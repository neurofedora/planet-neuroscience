	<p>Grounded cognition theory postulates that cognitive processes related to motor or sensory content are processed by brain networks involved in motor execution and perception, respectively. Processing words with auditory features was shown to activate the auditory cortex. Our study aimed at determining whether onomatopoetic verbs (e.g., &amp;amp;ldquo;tr&amp;amp;ouml;pfeln&amp;amp;rdquo;&amp;amp;mdash;to dripple), whose articulation reproduces the sound of respective actions, engage the auditory cortex more than non-onomatopoetic verbs. Alpha and beta brain frequencies as well as evoked-related fields (ERFs) were targeted as potential neurophysiological correlates of this linguistic auditory quality. Twenty participants were measured with magnetoencephalography (MEG) while semantically processing visually presented onomatopoetic and non-onomatopoetic German verbs. While a descriptively stronger left temporal alpha desynchronization for onomatopoetic verbs did not reach statistical significance, a larger ERF for onomatopoetic verbs emerged at about 240 ms in the centro-parietal area. Findings suggest increased cortical activation related to onomatopoeias in linguistically relevant areas.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Implementation of residue-level coarse-grained models in GENESIS for large-scale molecular dynamics simulations</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Cheng Tan, Jaewoon Jung, Chigusa Kobayashi, Diego Ugarte La Torre, Shoji Takada, Yuji Sugita</p>

Residue-level coarse-grained (CG) models have become one of the most popular tools in biomolecular simulations in the trade-off between modeling accuracy and computational efficiency. To investigate large-scale biological phenomena in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with CG models, unified treatments of proteins and nucleic acids, as well as efficient parallel computations, are indispensable. In the GENESIS MD software, we implement several residue-level CG models, covering structure-based and context-based potentials for both well-folded biomolecules and intrinsically disordered regions. An amino acid residue in protein is represented as a single CG particle centered at the Cα atom position, while a nucleotide in RNA or DNA is modeled with three beads. Then, a single CG particle represents around ten heavy atoms in both proteins and nucleic acids. The input data in CG MD simulations are treated as GROMACS-style input files generated from a newly developed toolbox, GENESIS-CG-tool. To optimize the performance in CG MD simulations, we utilize multiple neighbor lists, each of which is attached to a different nonbonded interaction potential in the cell-linked list method. We found that random number generations for Gaussian distributions in the Langevin thermostat are one of the bottlenecks in CG MD simulations. Therefore, we parallelize the computations with message-passing-interface (MPI) to improve the performance on PC clusters or supercomputers. We simulate Herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 2 B-capsid and chromatin models containing more than 1,000 nucleosomes in GENESIS as examples of large-scale biomolecular simulations with residue-level CG models. This framework extends accessible spatial and temporal scales by multi-scale simulations to study biologically relevant phenomena, such as genome-scale chromatin folding or phase-separated membrane-less condensations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Cortical asymmetries at different spatial hierarchies relate to phonological processing ability</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mark A. Eckert, Kenneth I. Vaden Jr., Federico Iuricich, Dyslexia Data Consortium </p>

The ability to map speech sounds to corresponding letters is critical for establishing proficient reading. People vary in this phonological processing ability, which has been hypothesized to result from variation in hemispheric asymmetries within brain regions that support language. A cerebral lateralization hypothesis predicts that more asymmetric brain structures facilitate the development of foundational reading skills like phonological processing. That is, structural asymmetries are predicted to linearly increase with ability. In contrast, a canalization hypothesis predicts that asymmetries constrain behavioral performance within a normal range. That is, structural asymmetries are predicted to quadratically relate to phonological processing, with average phonological processing occurring in people with the most asymmetric structures. These predictions were examined in relatively large samples of children (<i>N =</i> 424) and adults (<i>N</i> = 300), using a topological asymmetry analysis of T1-weighted brain images and a decoding measure of phonological processing. There was limited evidence of structural asymmetry and phonological decoding associations in classic language-related brain regions. However, and in modest support of the cerebral lateralization hypothesis, small to medium effect sizes were observed where phonological decoding accuracy increased with the magnitude of the largest structural asymmetry across left hemisphere cortical regions, but not right hemisphere cortical regions, for both the adult and pediatric samples. In support of the canalization hypothesis, small to medium effect sizes were observed where phonological decoding in the normal range was associated with increased asymmetries in specific cortical regions for both the adult and pediatric samples, which included performance monitoring and motor planning brain regions that contribute to oral and written language functions. Thus, the relevance of each hypothesis to phonological decoding may depend on the scale of brain organization.

                The tumor-suppressive functions of the SWI/SNF subunit ARID2 remain ill-defined in the context of melanoma. Carcamo et al. demonstrate that, upon ARID2 depletion, the PBAF complex fails to assemble, altering BAF genomic occupancy with consequences on chromatin accessibility, transcription factor binding, and transcriptional changes that promote metastasis.

                Continuous features are ubiquitous in an animal’s life. They are hypothesized to be represented by neural manifold attractors. Darshan and Rivkind propose a theory of manifold attractors with biologically plausible asymmetric connectome and neural representation. They predict whether continuous memory survives asymmetry and what the functional implications of asymmetries are.

                Dopamine signals in the striatum are critical for learning and motivation. Stowe et al. show that diurnal rhythms in rapid dopamine signaling in the striatum are mediated by time-of-day shifts in cholinergic interneuron control of dopamine. These systems work together to mediate time-of-day changes in learning and motivated behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Reprogramming and redifferentiation of mucosal-associated invariant T cells reveal tumor inhibitory activity</a></h4>

              
                Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells belong to a family of innate-like T cells that bridge innate and adaptive immunities. Although MAIT cells have been implicated in tumor immunity, it currently remains unclear whether they function as tumor-promoting or inhibitory cells. Therefore, we herein used induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology to investigate this issue. Murine MAIT cells were reprogrammed into iPSCs and redifferentiated towards MAIT-like cells (m-reMAIT cells). m-reMAIT cells were activated by an agonist in the presence and absence of antigen-presenting cells and MR1-tetramer, a reagent to detect MAIT cells. This activation accompanied protein tyrosine phosphorylation and the production of T helper (Th)1, Th2, and Th17 cytokines and inflammatory chemokines. Upon adoptive transfer, m-reMAIT cells migrated to different organs with maturation in mice. Furthermore, m-reMAIT cells inhibited tumor growth in the lung metastasis model and prolonged mouse survival upon tumor inoculation through the NK cell-mediated reinforcement of cytolytic activity. Collectively, the present results demonstrated the utility and role of m-reMAIT cells in tumor immunity and provide insights into the function of MAIT cells in immunity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Listeria monocytogenes requires cellular respiration for NAD+ regeneration and pathogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Cellular respiration is essential for multiple bacterial pathogens and a validated antibiotic target. In addition to driving oxidative phosphorylation, bacterial respiration has a variety of ancillary functions that obscure its contribution to pathogenesis. We find here that the intracellular pathogen <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> encodes two respiratory pathways which are partially functionally redundant and indispensable for pathogenesis. Loss of respiration decreased NAD<sup>+</sup> regeneration, but this could be specifically reversed by heterologous expression of a water-forming NADH oxidase (NOX). NOX expression fully rescued intracellular growth defects and increased <i>L. monocytogenes</i> loads &gt;1,000-fold in a mouse infection model. Consistent with NAD<sup>+</sup> regeneration maintaining <i>L. monocytogenes</i> viability and enabling immune evasion, a respiration-deficient strain exhibited elevated bacteriolysis within the host cytosol and NOX expression rescued this phenotype. These studies show that NAD<sup>+</sup> regeneration represents a major role of <i>L. monocytogenes</i> respiration and highlight the nuanced relationship between bacterial metabolism, physiology, and pathogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Putting the theory into 'burstlet theory' with a biophysical model of burstlets and bursts in the respiratory preBötzinger complex</a></h4>

              
                Inspiratory breathing rhythms arise from synchronized neuronal activity in a bilaterally distributed brainstem structure known as the preBötzinger complex (preBötC). In in vitro slice preparations containing the preBötC, extracellular potassium must be elevated above physiological levels (to 7 - 9<i>mM</i>) to observe regular rhythmic respiratory motor output in the hypoglossal nerve to which the preBötC projects. Reexamination of how extracellular <i>K</i><sup>+</sup> affects preBötC neuronal activity has revealed that low amplitude oscillations persist at physiological levels. These oscillatory events are sub-threshold from the standpoint of transmission to motor output and are dubbed burstlets. Burstlets arise from synchronized neural activity in a rhythmogenic neuronal subpopulation within the preBötC that in some instances may fail to recruit the larger network events, or bursts, required to generate motor output. The fraction of subthreshold preBötC oscillatory events (burstlet fraction) decreases sigmoidally with increasing extracellular potassium. These observations underlie the burstlet theory of respiratory rhythm generation. Experimental and computational studies have suggested that recruitment of the non-rhythmogenic component of the preBötC population requires intracellular <i>Ca</i><sup>2+</sup> dynamics and activation of a calcium-activated non-selective cationic current. In this computational study, we show how intracellular calcium dynamics driven by synaptically triggered <i>Ca</i><sup>2+</sup> influx as well as <i>Ca</i><sup>2+</sup> release/uptake by the endoplasmic reticulum in conjunction with a calcium-activated non-selective cationic current can reproduce and offer an explanation for many of the key properties associated with the burstlet theory of respiratory rhythm generation. Altogether, our modeling work provides a mechanistic basis that can unify a wide range of experimental findings on rhythm generation and motor output recruitment in the preBötC.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Noisy metabolism can promote microbial cross-feeding</a></h4>

              
                Cross-feeding, the exchange of nutrients between organisms, is ubiquitous in microbial communities. Despite its importance in natural and engineered microbial systems, our understanding of how inter-species cross-feeding arises is incomplete, with existing theories limited to specific scenarios. Here, we introduce a novel theory for the emergence of such cross-feeding, which we term noise-averaging cooperation (NAC). NAC is based on the idea that, due to their small size, bacteria are prone to noisy regulation of metabolism which limits their growth rate. To compensate, related bacteria can share metabolites with each other to ‘average out’ noise and improve their collective growth. According to the Black Queen Hypothesis, this metabolite sharing among kin, a form of ‘leakage’, then allows for the evolution of metabolic interdependencies among species including de novo speciation via gene deletions. We first characterize NAC in a simple ecological model of cell metabolism, showing that metabolite leakage can in principle substantially increase growth rate in a community context. Next, we develop a generalized framework for estimating the potential benefits of NAC among real bacteria. Using single-cell protein abundance data, we predict that bacteria suffer from substantial noise-driven growth inefficiencies, and may therefore benefit from NAC. We then discuss potential evolutionary pathways for the emergence of NAC. Finally, we review existing evidence for NAC and outline potential experimental approaches to detect NAC in microbial communities.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Quantifying chromosomal instability from intratumoral karyotype diversity using agent-based modeling and Bayesian inference</a></h4>

              
                Chromosomal instability (CIN)-persistent chromosome gain or loss through abnormal mitotic segregation-is a hallmark of cancer that drives aneuploidy. Intrinsic chromosome mis-segregation rate, a measure of CIN, can inform prognosis and is a promising biomarker for response to anti-microtubule agents. However, existing methodologies to measure this rate are labor intensive, indirect, and confounded by selection against aneuploid cells, which reduces observable diversity. We developed a framework to measure CIN, accounting for karyotype selection, using simulations with various levels of CIN and models of selection. To identify the model parameters that best fit karyotype data from single-cell sequencing, we used approximate Bayesian computation to infer mis-segregation rates and karyotype selection. Experimental validation confirmed the extensive chromosome mis-segregation rates caused by the chemotherapy paclitaxel (18.5±0.5/division). Extending this approach to clinical samples revealed that inferred rates fell within direct observations of cancer cell lines. This work provides the necessary framework to quantify CIN in human tumors and develop it as a predictive biomarker.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">An archaea-specific c-type cytochrome maturation machinery is crucial for methanogenesis in Methanosarcina acetivorans</a></h4>

              
                <i>C</i>-type cytochromes (cyt <i>c</i>) are proteins that undergo post-translational modification to covalently bind heme, which allows them to facilitate redox reactions in electron transport chains across all domains of life. Genomic evidence suggests that cyt <i>c</i> are involved in electron transfer processes among the Archaea, especially in members that produce or consume the potent greenhouse gas methane. However, neither the maturation machinery for cyt <i>c</i> in Archaea nor their role in methane metabolism has ever been functionally characterized. Here, we have used CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing tools to map a distinct pathway for cyt <i>c</i> biogenesis in the model methanogenic archaeon <i>Methanosarcina acetivorans</i>, and have also identified substrate-specific functional roles for cyt <i>c</i> during methanogenesis. Although the cyt <i>c</i> maturation machinery from <i>M. acetivorans</i> is universally conserved in the Archaea, our evolutionary analyses indicate that different clades of Archaea acquired this machinery through multiple independent horizontal gene transfer events from different groups of Bacteria. Overall, we demonstrate the convergent evolution of a novel Archaea-specific cyt <i>c</i> maturation machinery and its physiological role during methanogenesis, a process which contributes substantially to global methane emissions

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cholinergic stimulation modulates the functional composition of CA3 cell types in the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                The functional heterogeneity of hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons has emerged as a key aspect of circuit function. Here, we explored the effects of long-term cholinergic activity on the functional heterogeneity of CA3 pyramidal neurons in organotypic slices. Application of agonists to either acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) generally, or muscarinic AChRs (mAChRs) specifically, induced robust increases in network activity in the low-gamma range. Prolonged AChR stimulation for 48 hrs uncovered a population of hyperadapting CA3 pyramidal neurons that typically fired a single, early action potential in response to current injection. Although these neurons were present in control networks, their proportions were dramatically increased following long-term cholinergic activity. Characterised by the presence of a strong M-current, the hyperadaptation phenotype was abolished by acute application of either M-channel antagonists or the re-application of AChR agonists. We conclude that long-term mAChR activation modulates the intrinsic excitability of a subset of CA3 pyramidal cells, uncovering a highly plastic cohort of neurons that are sensitive to chronic ACh modulation. Our findings provide evidence for the activity-dependent plasticity of functional heterogeneity in the hippocampus.

Through the use of NIMH's Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework, we evaluated consensus among hundreds of studies that examined brain activity during social and social cognition tasks to elucidate, at a larger scale, regions comprising the social brain. In addition, we examined convergence across tasks corresponding to the four RDoC social constructs, including Affiliation and Attachment, Social Communication, Perception and Understanding of Self, and Perception and Understanding of Others. We assessed activation patterns by performing a series of coordinate-based meta-analyses using the activation likelihood estimate (ALE) method. One meta-analysis was performed on whole-brain coordinates reported from 864 fMRI contrasts of healthy social processing (239 publications; 6,232 participants) using the NiMARE Python package. The meta-analysis of all social contrasts revealed consensus in the social brain, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), temporoparietal junction (TPJ), bilateral insula, amygdala, fusiform gyrus, precuneus, and thalamus. Additionally, four separate RDoC-based meta-analyses revealed differential convergence associated with the four social constructs. These outcomes highlight the neural support underlying these social constructs and inform future research on alterations among neurotypical and atypical populations.

                Humans are able to adopt almost any desired gait pattern on the fly when walking. We postulate that this flexibility in humans is partially due to the ability to control the whole body during walking as a volitional, goal-directed movement that can be planned and changed, rather than having to rely on habitual, reflexive control that is adapted over long time-scales. Here we present a neuromechanical model that accounts for this flexibility by combining movement goals and motor plans on a kinematic task level with low-level spinal feedback loops. We show that the model is able to walk at a wide range of different gait patterns by choosing a small number of high-level control parameters representing a movement goal. A larger number of parameters governing the low-level reflex loops in the spinal cord, on the other hand, remains fixed. We also show that the model is able to generalize the learned behavior by re-combining the high-level control parameters and walk with gait patterns it had not encountered before. Furthermore, the model can transition between different gaits without loss of balance by switching to a new set of control parameters in real time.

                Interval timing is a key executive process that involves estimating the duration of an interval over several seconds or minutes. Patients with Alzheimers disease (AD) have deficits in interval timing. Since temporal control of action is highly conserved across mammalian species, studying interval timing tasks in animal AD models may be relevant to human disease. Amyloid plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles are hallmark features of AD. While rodent models of amyloid pathology are known to have interval timing impairments, to our knowledge, interval timing has not been studied in models of tauopathy. Here, we evaluate interval timing performance of P301S transgenic mice, a widely studied model of tauopathy that overexpresses human tau with the P301S mutation. We employed the switch interval timing task, and found that P301S mice consistently underestimated temporal intervals compared to wild-type controls, responding early in anticipation of the target interval. Our study indicating timing deficits in a mouse tauopathy model could have relevance to human tauopathies such as AD.

                The generation of a correctly-sized cerebral cortex with all-embracing neuronal and glial cell-type diversity critically depends on faithful radial glial progenitor (RGP) cell proliferation/differentiation programs. Temporal RGP lineage progression is regulated by Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and loss of PRC2 activity results in severe neurogenesis defects and microcephaly. How PRC2-dependent gene expression instructs RGP lineage progression is unknown. Here we utilize Mosaic Analysis with Double Markers (MADM)-based single cell technology and demonstrate that PRC2 is not cell-autonomously required in neurogenic RGPs but rather acts at the global tissue-wide level. Conversely, cortical astrocyte production and maturation is cell-autonomously controlled by PRC2-dependent transcriptional regulation. We thus reveal highly distinct and sequential PRC2 functions in RGP lineage progression that are dependent on complex interplays between intrinsic and tissue-wide properties. In a broader context our results imply a critical role for the genetic and cellular niche environment in neural stem cell behavior.

                Genetic studies implicate phagocytosis pathways in microglia to be a major Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated process. Microglia phagocytose synapses in AD mouse models, suggesting a role for microglia in region-specific synapse loss, a pathological hallmark of AD. However, whether specific synapses are targeted for elimination, and if so, how, remains to be elucidated. Here, we show that synapses externalize phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) upon challenge by {beta}-amyloid oligomers, which are then selectively engulfed by microglia. Mechanistically, we find that Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2 (TREM2) is critical for microglia to sense and preferentially engulf AD synapses. In brains of mice and humans, TREM2 dysfunction leads to exacerbation of apoptotic synapses. Our work altogether suggests a fundamental role for microglia as brain-resident macrophages to remove damaged synapses in AD. We provide mechanistic insight into how TREM2 variants associated with increased risk of developing AD may contribute to defective microglia-synapse function.

                Intracerebroventricular streptozotocin (ICV-STZ) injection is among the best animal models to simulate sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD) (Hoyer, 2002, 2000, 1998; Salkovic-Petrisic and Hoyer, 2007). Brain insulin signaling abnormality (Grunblatt et al., 2007), neurodegeneration (Kamat, 2015), neuroinflammation (Liu et al., 2022), cholinergic damage (Blokland and Jolles, 1993; Roy et al., 2021), mitochondrial dysfunction (C. Correia et al., 2013), genetic abnormality (Chen et al., 2012), respiratory problem (Ebel et al., 2017), oxidative stress (Sharma and Gupta, 2001), gliosis (Rostami et al., 2017), sleep disturbances (Song et al., 2018) associated with cognitive abnormalities seen in ICV-STZ injected rats. Available experimental evidences has used varying doses of STZ (<1 to 3mg/kg) and studied its effect for different study durations, ranging from 14-21 (short), 30-42 (mild), 90-105 (moderate) and 250-270 (long) days (Chen et al., 2013, 2012; Grunblatt et al., 2007; Knezovic et al., 2015; Kraska et al., 2012; Mehla et al., 2013; Rostami et al., 2017; Salkovic-Petrisic et al., 2006). These studies indicated that 3mg/kg of body weight is the optimum dose for inducing sporadic AD in the rodents. However studies on the pathological process with relating the morphological and functional abnormalities reported were illusive. Therefore in the present study, we have investigated the effect of 3mg/kg ICV-STZ on three cognitive domains viz. spatial, episodic and avoidance and even neuropsychiatric abnormality i.e. anxiety with extensive morphological examination in the layers associated with hippocampus proper. Further, we have observed the onset of diffuse amyloid plaques, in association with enlargement of lateral ventricles and down scaling of spines in granular cells of dentate gyrus. Finally, to dissect the functional changes in spatial and anxiety variables we had examined the probability of fraction of time spent in Morris water maze and changes in ethological patterns of STZ injected rats in elevated plus maze.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Gut microbiome-linked metabolites in the pathobiology of depression and anxiety - a role for bile acids</a></h4>

              
                Background: The gut microbiome may play a role in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric diseases including major depressive disorder (MDD). Bile acids (BAs) are steroid acids that are synthesized in the liver from cholesterol and further processed by gut-bacterial enzymes, thus requiring both human and gut microbiome enzymatic processes in their metabolism. BAs participate in a range of important host functions such as lipid transport and metabolism, cellular signaling and regulation of energy homeostasis. BAs have recently been implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's and several other neuropsychiatric diseases, but the biochemical underpinnings of these gut microbiome-linked metabolites in the pathophysiology of depression and anxiety remains largely unknown. Method: Using targeted metabolomics, we profiled primary and secondary BAs in the baseline serum samples of 208 untreated outpatients with MDD. We assessed the relationship of BA concentrations and the severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms as defined by the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HRSD17) and the 14-item Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HRSA-Total), respectively. We also evaluated whether the baseline metabolic profile of BA informs about treatment outcomes. Results: The concentration of the primary BA chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) was significantly lower at baseline in both severely depressed (log2 fold difference (LFD)= -0.48; p=0.021) and highly anxious (LFD= -0.43; p=0.021) participants compared to participants with less severe symptoms. The gut bacteria-derived secondary BAs produced from CDCA such as lithocholic acid (LCA) and several of its metabolites, and their ratios to primary BAs, were significantly higher in the more anxious participants (LFD's range=[0.23,1.36]; p's range=[6.85E-6,1.86E-2]). The interaction analysis of HRSD17 and HRSA-Total suggested that the BA concentration differences were more strongly correlated to the symptoms of anxiety than depression. Significant differences in baseline CDCA (LFD= -0.87, p=0.0009), isoLCA (LFD= -1.08, p=0.016) and several BA ratios (LFD's range [0.46, 1.66], p's range [0.0003, 0.049]) differentiated treatment failures from remitters. Conclusion: In patients with MDD, BA profiles representing changes in gut microbiome compositions are associated with higher levels of anxiety and increased probability of first-line treatment failure. If confirmed, these findings suggest the possibility of developing gut microbiome-directed therapies for MDD characterized by gut dysbiosis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuronal nuclear calcium signaling suppression of microglial reactivity is mediated by osteoprotegerin after traumatic brain injury</a></h4>

              
                Background: Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is characterized by massive changes in neuronal excitation, from acute excitotoxicity to chronic hyper- or hypoexcitability. Nuclear calcium signaling pathways are involved in translating changes in synaptic inputs and neuronal activity into discrete transcriptional programs which not only affect neuronal survival and synaptic integrity, but also the crosstalk between neurons and glial cells. Here we report the effects of blunting neuronal nuclear calcium signals in the context of TBI. Methods: We used AAV vectors to express the genetically-encoded and nuclear-targeted calcium buffer parvalbumin (PV.NLS.mCherry) or the calcium/calmodulin buffer CaMBP4.mCherry in neurons only. Upon TBI, the extent of neuroinflammation, neuronal death and synaptic loss were assessed by immunohistochemistry and targeted transcriptome analysis. Modulation of the overall level of neuronal activity was achieved by PSAM/PSEM chemogenetics targeted to parvalbumin interneurons. The functional impact of neuronal nuclear Calcium buffering in TBI was assessed by quantification of spontaneous whisking. Results: Buffering neuronal nuclear calcium unexpectedly resulted in a massive and long-lasting increase in the recruitment of reactive microglia to the injury site, which was characterised by a disease-associated and phagocytic phenotypes. This effect was accompanied by a substantial surge in synaptic loss and significantly reduced whisking activity. Transcriptome analysis revealed a complex effect of TBI in the context of neuronal nuclear calcium buffering, with upregulation of complement factors, chemokines and interferon-response genes, as well as the downregulation of synaptic genes and epigenetic regulators compared to control conditions. Notably, nuclear calcium buffering led to a substantial loss in neuronal osteoprotegerin (OPG). Whereas stimulation of neuronal firing induced OPG expression. Viral re-expression of OPG resulted in decreased microglial recruitment and synaptic loss. OPG upregulation was also observed in the CSF of human TBI patients, underscoring its translational value. Conclusion: Neuronal nuclear calcium signals regulate the degree of microglial recruitment and reactivity upon TBI via, among others, osteoprotegerin signals. Our findings support a model whereby neuronal activity altered after TBI exerts a powerful impact on the neuroinflammatory cascade, which in turn contributes to the overall loss of synapses and functional impairment.

                Understanding the molecular anatomy and neural connectivity of the brain requires imaging technologies that can map the 3D nanoscale distribution of specific proteins in the context of brain ultrastructure. Light and electron microscopy (EM) enable visualization of either specific labels or anatomical ultrastructure, but combining molecular specificity with anatomical context is challenging. Here, we present pan-Expansion Microscopy of tissue (pan-ExM-t), an all-optical mouse brain imaging method that combines ~24-fold linear expansion of biological samples with fluorescent pan-staining of protein densities (providing EM-like ultrastructural context), and immunolabeling of protein targets (for molecular imaging). We demonstrate the versatility of this approach by imaging the established synaptic markers Homer1, Bassoon, PSD-95, Synaptophysin, the astrocytic protein GFAP, myelin basic protein (MBP), and anti-GFP antibodies in dissociated neuron cultures and mouse brain tissue sections. pan-ExM-t reveals these markers in the context of ultrastructural features such as pre and postsynaptic densities, 3D nanoarchitecture of neuropil, and the fine structures of cellular organelles. pan-ExM-t is adoptable in any neurobiological laboratory with access to a confocal microscope and has therefore broad applicability in the research community.

                Sleep is a state of behavioral quiescence that is closely associated with survival. Sleep-active neurons promote sleep and survival. It is not known, however, whether sleep-active neurons need to cause sleep to promote survival. Here, we tested how depolarization of the sleep-active RIS neuron in Caenorhabditis elegans controls sleep and survival during larval starvation. Survival always increased with raised RIS depolarization. RIS depolarization promoted sleep over a long range. Unexpectedly, however, high levels of RIS depolarization caused a nearly complete loss of sleep. Similarly, overexpression of sleep-inducing FLP-11 neuropeptides in RIS inhibited sleep, indicating that overactive transmission from RIS inhibits sleep. Despite the loss of sleep, survival was normal following FLP-11 overexpression. Thus, RIS overactivation abolishes sleep yet supports survival. These results indicate that regulation of sleep and survival are separable functions of a sleep-active neuron that are normally coupled but can be uncoupled by sleep-neuron over activation.

                Modulation of corticostriatal plasticity alters the information flow throughout basal ganglia circuits and represents a fundamental mechanism for motor learning, action selection, and reward. Synaptic plasticity in the striatal direct- and indirect-pathway spiny projection neurons (dSPNs and iSPNs) are dichotomically regulated by two distinct networks of GPCR signaling cascades. While it is well-known that dopamine D2 and adenosine A2a receptors bi-directionally regulate iSPN plasticity, it remains unclear how D1 signaling modulation of synaptic plasticity is counteracted by a dSPN-specific Gi signaling. Here, we show that striatal dynorphin selectively suppresses long-term potentiation (LTP) through Kappa Opioid Receptor (KOR) in dSPNs. Both KOR antagonism and conditional deletion of dynorphin in dSPNs enhance LTP counterbalancing with different levels of D1 receptor activation. Behaviorally, mice lacking dynorphin specifically in dSPNs show normal motor behavior and reward-based learning, but enhanced flexibility during reversal learning. These findings support a model in which D1R and KOR signaling bidirectionally modulate synaptic plasticity in striatal direct pathways and behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Delay-related activity in marmoset prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Persistent delay-period activity in prefrontal cortex (PFC) has long been regarded as a neural signature of working memory (WM). Electrophysiological investigations in macaque PFC have provided much insight into WM mechanisms, however a barrier to understanding is the fact that a portion of PFC lies buried within the principal sulcus in this species and is inaccessible for laminar electrophysiology or optical imaging. The relatively lissencephalic cortex of the New World common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) circumvents such limitations. It remains unknown however, whether marmoset PFC neurons exhibit persistent activity. Here, we addressed this gap by conducting wireless electrophysiological recordings in PFC of marmosets performing a delayed-match-to-location task on a home cage-based touchscreen system. As in macaques, marmoset PFC neurons exhibited sample, delay, and response-related activity that was directionally tuned and linked to correct task performance. Models constructed from population activity consistently and accurately predicted stimulus location throughout the delay period, supporting a framework of delay activity in which mnemonic representations are relatively stable in time. Taken together, our findings support the existence of common neural mechanisms underlying WM performance in PFC of macaques and marmosets, and thus validate the marmoset as a suitable model animal for investigating the microcircuitry underlying WM.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Effect of LSD and music on the time-varying brain dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Psychedelics are getting closer to being widely used in clinical treatment. Music is known as a key element of psychedelic-assisted therapy due to its psychological effects, specifically on the emotion, meaning-making and sensory processing. However, there is still a lack of understanding in how psychedelics influence brain activity in experimental settings involving music listening. The main goal of our research is to investigate the effect of music, as a part of setting, on the brain states dynamics after lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) intake. We used an open dataset, where a group of 15 participants underwent two scanning sessions under LSD influence and under placebo. Every scanning session contained three runs: two resting-state runs separated by one run with music listening. We applied the K-Means clustering to identify the repetitive patterns of brain activity, so-called brain states. For further analysis, we calculated states dwell time, fractional occupancy and transition probability. We found that the brain states dynamics during the resting-state and listening to music on both LSD and placebo does not differ significantly. Furthermore, we found that the music itself could potentially have a long-term influence on the resting-state, in particular on the states involving task-positive networks. Collectively, these findings suggest that the whole-brain states dynamics during psychedelic experience and placebo is relatively stable, however, music, as a crucial element of setting, can potentially have an influence on the subject resting-state. Further studies should replicate these results on a larger sample size.

                Microglia are phagocytes of the brain parenchyma, where they interact with neurons to engulf synapses in a context-dependent manner. Genetic studies in Alzheimers disease (AD) highlight dysfunctional phagocytic signaling in myeloid cells as disease-associated pathway. In AD models, there is a region-specific reactivation of microglia-synapse phagocytosis involving complement; however, what drives microglia-synapse engulfment remains unknown. Here, we show that SPP1 (Osteopontin), a glycoprotein associated with inflammation, is regionally upregulated and modulates microglial synaptic engulfment in AD mouse models. Ultrastructural examination revealed SPP1 expression predominantly by perivascular macrophages, a subtype of border-associated macrophages, in the hippocampus of mice and patient tissues. Cell-cell interaction networks of single-cell transcriptomics data suggested that perivascular SPP1 drives microglial functional states in the hippocampal microenvironment of AD mice. Absence of Spp1 expression resulted in failure of microglia to mediate synaptic phagocytosis. This study suggests a critical role for perivascular SPP1 in neuroimmune crosstalk in AD-relevant context.

                Nuclear inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 (NIPP1) is a known regulator of gene expression and has been shown to play roles in many physiological or pathological processes such as stem cell proliferation and development, and skin inflammation. While NIPP1 has many regulatory roles in proliferating cells, its function in the CNS has not been directly investigated. In the present study, we examined NIPP1 CNS function using a conditional knockout (cKO) mouse model, in which the nipp1 gene is excised from neural precursor cells. These mice demonstrate severe developmental impairments that lead to premature lethality within the first few postnatal weeks. To delineate some of the neurological changes occurring in these animals, we first assessed microtubule associated protein tau, a known target of NIPP1 activity. Furthermore, observed tremors prompted exploration of myelin integrity, an integral structure for CNS function, whose disruption is associated with various neurological disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. First, immunoblotting demonstrated increased phospho-tau and altered AKT and PP1 activity in NIPP1 cKO mice, suggesting increased tau phosphorylation likely results from a shift in kinase/phosphatase activity. Second, immunoblots, electron microscopy, and electrophysiology demonstrated a myelin deficit within the brain and optic nerve. Our study suggests that NIPP1 activity in neural precursors regulates phosphorylation of tau and CNS myelination and may represent a novel therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases.

                Investigation of the firing behavior of spinal motor neurons (MNs) provides essential neuromuscular control information because MNs form the final common pathway in motor control. The MNs activated during leg movements in human infants and rodent locomotion, mainly controlled by the spinal central pattern generator (CPG), show highly synchronous firing. In addition to spinal CPGs, the cerebral cortex is involved in neuromuscular control during walking in human adults. Thus, MN firing behavior during adult walking is expected to be similar to that of infants and rodents and has some unique features. Recent technical advances allow non-invasive investigation of MN firing by high-density surface electromyogram (HDsEMG) decomposition. Therefore, we investigated the MN firing behavior of the tibialis anterior muscle during walking by HDsEMG decomposition. We found motor unit recruitment modulation compared with steady isometric contractions, doublet firings, and gait phase-specific firings during walking. We also found high MN synchronization during walking over a wide range of frequencies, probably including cortical and spinal CPG-related components. The amount of MN synchronization was modulated between the gait phases and motor tasks. These results suggest that the central nervous system, including the spinal CPG and cerebral cortex, flexibly controls MN firing to generate appropriate muscle force during human walking. In addition to revealing the neural control mechanisms of walking, our data demonstrate the feasibility of non-invasive investigation of MNs during walking, which will open new frontiers for the study of neuromuscular function in medical and exercise sciences.

                Locomotion in vertebrates relies on high brain centers converging onto the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR). How the MLR recruits brainstem reticulospinal neurons (RSNs) to initiate locomotion is incompletely understood due to the challenge of recording these cells in vivo. To tackle this question, we leveraged the transparency and genetic accessibility of larval zebrafish. In this model organism, we uncovered the locus of the MLR as a small region dorsal to the locus coeruleus containing glutamatergic and cholinergic neurons. MLR stimulations reliably elicited forward bouts of controlled duration and speed. We find that the MLR elicits forward locomotion by recruiting V2a RSNs in the pontine and retropontine regions, and gradually in the medulla. Remarkably, recruited V2a RSNs in the medulla act as maintain cells encoding speed of forward locomotion. Altogether, our study reveals that the MLR recruits genetically-identified reticulospinal neurons in the medulla to control the kinematics of exploration.

                Immersive virtual reality (VR) environments are a powerful tool to explore cognitive processes ranging from memory and navigation to visual processing and decision making - and to do so in a naturalistic yet controlled setting. As such, they have been employed across different species, and by a diverse range of research groups. Unfortunately, designing and implementing behavioural tasks in such environments often proves complicated. To tackle this challenge, we created DomeVR, an immersive VR environment built using Unreal Engine 4 (UE4). UE4 is a powerful game engine with photo-realistic graphics containing a visual scripting language designed for use by non-programmers. As a result, virtual environments are easily created using drag-and-drop elements. DomeVR aims to make these features accessible to neuroscience experiments. This includes a logging and synchronization system to solve timing uncertainties inherent in UE4; an interactive GUI for scientists to observe subjects during experiments and adjust task parameters on the fly, and a dome projection system for full task immersion in non-human subjects. These key features are modular and can easily be added individually into other UE4 projects. Finally, we present proof-of-principle data highlighting the functionality of DomeVR in three different species: human, macaque and mouse.

                Bipolar disorder (BD) is a mood disorder with a high morbidity and death rate. Lithium (Li), a prominent mood stabilizer, is fully effective in roughly 30% of BD patients. The remaining patients respond partially or do not respond at all. Another drug used to treat BD patients is valproate (VPA). Plenty of efforts has been made to understand how these drugs affect the patients neurons. We have performed electrophysiological recordings in patient-derived dentate gyrus (DG) granule neurons for three groups: control individuals, BD patients who respond to Li treatment (LR), and BD patients who do not respond to Li treatment (NR). The recordings were analyzed by the statistical tools of modern information theory, which enabled us to recognize new relationships between the electrophysiological features. These added features included the entropy of several electrophysiological measurements and the mutual information between different types of electrophysiological measurements. Information theory features provided further knowledge about the distribution of the electrophysiological entities, which improved basic classification schemes. These newly added features enabled a significant improvement in our ability to distinguish the BD patients from the control individuals (an improvement from 60% accuracy to 74% accuracy) and the Li responders from the non-responders in the BD population using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification algorithms (an improvement from 81% accuracy to 99% accuracy). These new tools showed that LR neurons are less distinguishable from control neurons after Li treatment but not after VPA treatment, whereas NR neurons become more distinguishable from control neurons after Li treatment.

                Some animals including humans use stereoscopic vision which reconstructs spatial information about the environment from the disparity between images captured by eyes in two separate adjacent locations. Like other sensory information, such stereoscopic information is expected to influence attentional selection. We develop a biologically plausible model of binocular vision to study its effect on bottom-up visual attention, i.e., visual saliency. In our model, the scene is organized in terms of proto-objects on which attention acts, rather than on unbound sets of elementary features. We show that taking into account the stereoscopic information improves the performance of the model in the prediction of human eye movements with statistically significant differences.

                Potassium K+ is a fundamental actor in the shaping of action potentials, and its concentration in the extracellular microenvironment represents a crucial modulator of neural excitability. Yet, its employment as a neuromodulation modality is still in its infancy. Recent advances in the technology of ionic actuators are enabling the control of ionic concentrations at the spatiotemporal scales of micrometers and milliseconds, thereby holding the promise of making the control of K+ concentration a key enabling technology for the next generation of neural interfaces. In this regard, a theoretical framework to understand the possibilities and limits offered by such technology is pivotal. To this aim, we exploit the Hodgkin-Huxley modeling framework, augmented to account for the perturbation of extracellular K+ concentration. We leverage methods of bifurcation analysis to investigate which regimes of electrical activity arise in the space of the input variables, namely the extent of ionic actuation and the synaptic current. We show that, depending on the type of target neuron, switchings of the class of excitability may occur in such space. These effects could rule out the possibility of eliciting tonic spiking when the extracellular K+ concentration is assumed as a sole control input. Building upon these findings, we show in simulations how to address the problem of neuromodulation via ionic actuation in a principled fashion. In this respect, we account for a bidirectional scenario, namely from the perspective of both inhibiting and stimulating electrical activity. We then provide a first-order motivation for the switchings of neural excitability in terms of the conductances of the K+-selective channels. Finally, we introduce a Pinsky-Rinzel-like model to investigate the effects of performing the ionic actuation locally at the neural membrane.

                Early phase diabetes is often accompanied by pain sensitization. In the fruit fly Drosophila, the insulin receptor (InR) regulates the persistence of injury-induced thermal nociceptive sensitization. Whether Drosophila InR also regulates the persistence of mechanical nociceptive sensitization remains unclear. Mice with a sensory neuron deletion of the gene encoding the Insulin receptor (Insr) show normal nociceptive baselines, however, it is not known whether deletion of Insr in nociceptive sensory neurons leads to persistent nociceptive hypersensitivity in an inflammatory pain paradigm. In this study, we used fly and mouse nociceptive sensitization models to address these questions. In flies, InR mutants and larvae with sensory neuron-specific expression of RNAi transgenes targeting InR exhibited persistent mechanical hypersensitivity, as previously observed for the thermal sensory modality. Mice with a specific deletion of the Insr gene in NaV1.8+ nociceptive sensory neurons showed normal nociceptive thermal and mechanical baselines similar to controls. In an inflammatory paradigm, however, these mutant mice showed persistent mechanical (but not thermal) hypersensitivity, particularly in female mice. Mice with the NaV1.8+ sensory neuron specific deletion of Insr did not show metabolic abnormalities that would be typical of a systemic defect in insulin signaling. Our results show that some aspects of the regulation of nociceptive hypersensitivity by the Insulin receptor are shared between flies and mice and that this regulation is likely independent of metabolic effects.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Chronic hM3Dq-DREADD mediated chemogenetic activation of parvalbumin-positive inhibitory interneurons in postnatal life alters anxiety and despair-like behavior in adulthood in a task and sex-dependent manner</a></h4>

              
                Animal models of early adversity or neurodevelopmental disorders are associated with altered parvalbumin (PV)-positive inhibitory interneuron number and function, correlated with a dysregulated excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance that is implicated in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. We sought to address whether altering neuronal activity of PV-positive interneurons during the postnatal developmental window influences the emergence of anxio-depressive behaviors in adulthood, which are known to be perturbed in models of early adversity and neurodevelopmental disorders. We used a PV-Cre::hM3Dq-DREADD bigenic mouse line that selectively expresses the hM3Dq-DREADD receptor in PV-positive interneurons, and chemogenetically enhanced Gq signaling in PV-positive interneurons during the postnatal window via administration of the DREADD agonist, clozapine-N-oxide. Immunofluorescence studies indicated the selective expression of hM3Dq-DREADD in PV-positive interneurons in limbic circuits, and revealed a reduction in expression of the neuronal activity marker, c-Fos, in these circuits, following chemogenetic hM3Dq-DREADD mediated activation of PV-positive inhibitory interneurons. We noted no change in either growth or sensorimotor reflex milestones following chronic hM3Dq-DREADD mediated chemogenetic activation of PV-positive inhibitory interneurons in postnatal life. Adult male and female PV-Cre::hM3Dq-DREADD bigenic mice with a history of postnatal chemogenetic activation of PV-positive interneurons exhibited a reduction in anxiety and despair-like behavior in adulthood, which was noted in both a behavioral task and sex-dependent manner. These results indicate that altering neuronal activity within PV-positive interneurons during the critical postnatal developmental window can shape the emergence of anxio-depressive behaviors in adulthood, and suggest that interactions with sex as a variable play a key role in determining behavioral outcomes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Stochastic analysis of frequency bandwidth and noise attenuation in neurotransmission</a></h4>

              
                Action potential (AP)-triggered neurotransmitter release forms the key basis of inter-neuronal communication. We present a stochastic hybrid system model that captures the release of neurotransmitter-filled vesicles from a presynaptic neuron. More specifically, vesicles arrive as a Poisson process to attach at a given number of docking sites, and each docked vesicle has a certain probability of release when an AP is generated in the presynaptic neuron. The released neurotransmitters enhance the membrane potential of the postsynaptic neuron, and this increase is coupled to the continuous exponential decay of the membrane potential. The buildup of potential to a critical threshold level results in an AP firing in the postsynaptic neuron, with the potential subsequently resetting back to its resting level. Our model analysis develops formulas that quantify the fluctuations in the number of released vesicles and mechanistically connects them to fluctuations in both the postsynaptic membrane potential and the AP firing times. Increasing the frequency of APs in the presynaptic neuron leads to saturation effects on the postsynaptic side, resulting in a limiting frequency range of neurotransmission. Interestingly, AP firing in the postsynaptic neuron becomes more precise with increasing AP frequency in the presynaptic neuron. We also investigate how noise in AP timing varies with different parameters, such as the probability of releases, the number of docking sites, the voltage threshold for AP firing, and the timescale of voltage decay. In summary, our results provide a systematic understanding of how stochastic mechanisms in neurotransmission enhance or impinge the precision of AP fringing times.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain-heart interactions are optimized across the respiratory cycle via interoceptive attention</a></h4>

              
                Respiration and heartbeat continuously interact within the living organism at many different levels, representing two of the main oscillatory rhythms of the body and providing major sources of interoceptive information to the brain. Despite the modulatory effect of respiration on exteroception and cognition has been recently established in humans, its role in shaping interoceptive perception has been scarcely investigated so far. In two independent studies, we investigated the effect of spontaneous breathing on cardiac interoception by assessing the Heartbeat Evoked Potential (HEP) in healthy humans. In Study 1, we compared HEP activity for heartbeats occurred during inhalation and exhalation in 40 volunteers during resting-state. We found higher HEP amplitude during exhalations, compared to inhalations, over fronto-centro-parietal areas. This suggests increased brain-heart interactions and improved cortical processing of the heartbeats during exhalations. In Study 2, we tested the respiratory-phase dependent modulation of HEP activity in 20 volunteers during Exteroceptive and Interoceptive conditions of the Heartbeat Detection (HBD) task. In these conditions, participants were requested to tap at each heartbeat, either recorded or felt, respectively. Results showed higher HEP activity and higher detection accuracy at exhalation than inhalation in the Interoceptive condition only. These effects were positively correlated, suggesting that both cortical processing of cardiac signals and perception of heartbeats are optimized across the respiratory cycle. Direct comparisons of Interoceptive and Exteroceptive conditions confirmed stronger respiratory-phase dependent modulation of HEP and accuracy when attention was directed towards the interoceptive stimuli. We provide data showing that respiration shapes cardiac interoception at the neurophysiological and behavioural levels. Specifically, exhalation may allow attentional shift towards the internal bodily states.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Separation of NaV Subtypes in the Axon InitialSegment can Impede or Promote Backpropagation</a></h4>

              
                In a variety of neurons, action potentials (APs) initiate at the proximal axon, within a region called the axon initial segment (AIS) having favorable cable properties and a high density of voltage-gated ion channels. Pyramidal cells concentrate high-threshold sodium ion channels (NaV1.2) in the proximal AIS, and the distal AIS contains mostly lower threshold NaV1.6. It is widely believed that this separated NaV distribution favors backpropagation and lowers the AP threshold. We implemented a range of hypothetical NaV distributions in the AIS of a multicompartmental pyramidal cell model. Our simulations predict new effects on pyramidal neurons' excitability and backpropagation threshold, caused directly by the naturally occurring spatial separation of NaV1.2 and NaV1.6 in the AIS. By controlling the distribution of NaVs, pyramidal cells create a lengthwise profile of gating properties in the AIS. Using a "shift-clamping" technique, we demonstrate that different gating properties drive the effect of proximal NaV1.2 on the backpropagation threshold when the neuron is stimulated somatically versus axonally. When stimulating current is injected at the soma, the intrinsic right-shift of NaV1.2 activation causes these channels to raise the backpropagation threshold. However, with axonal stimulation, the right-shift of availability dominates, such that concentrating NaV1.2 in the proximal AIS facilitates backpropagation. The latter effect is dynamic: right-shifting steady-state availability is necessary but not sufficient to facilitate backpropagation; we show that the voltage-sensitive time constant of NaV1.2 availability must be right-shifted as well. Our results imply that regulation of NaV separation can sensitively control backpropagation, especially for somatodendritic stimulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Microstructural alterations in tract development in college football: a longitudinal diffusion MRI study</a></h4>

              
                Background and Objectives: Repeated concussive and sub-concussive impacts in high-contact sports can affect microstructure of the brain, which can be studied using diffusion MRI. Most prior imaging studies, however, employ a cross-sectional design, do not include low-contact players as controls, or use traditional diffusion tensor imaging without investigating novel tract-specific microstructural metrics. Methods: We examined brain microstructure in 63 high-contact (American football) and 34 low-contact (volleyball) collegiate athletes with up to 4 years of follow-up (315 total scans) using advanced diffusion MRI, a comprehensive set of multi-compartment models, and automated fiber quantification tools. We investigated diffusion metrics along the length of tracts using nested linear mixed-effects models to ascertain the acute and chronic effects of sub-concussive and concussive impacts, as well as associations between diffusion changes with clinical, behavioral, and sports-related measures. Results: Significant longitudinal increases in fractional anisotropy and axonal water fraction were detected in volleyball players, but not in football players, along with decreases in radial and mean diffusivity as well as orientation dispersion index (all findings absolute T-statistic > 3.5, p < .0001). This pattern was present in the callosum forceps minor, left superior longitudinal fasciculus, left thalamic radiation, and right cingulum hippocampus. Longitudinal group differences were more prominent and observed in a larger number of tracts in concussed (previously or in-study) football players (p < .0001), while smaller effects were noted in un-concussed players. An analysis of immediate-post concussion scans in football players demonstrated a transient localized increase in axial diffusivity, mean and radial kurtosis in the left uncinate and right cingulum hippocampus (p < .0001). Finally, football players with high position-based sub-concussive risk demonstrated increased orientation dispersion index over time (p < .0001). Discussion: The observed longitudinal changes in our volleyball cohort likely reflect normal development in this age range, while the relative attenuation of these effects seen in football, and especially concussed athletes, could possibly reveal diminished myelination, altered axonal calibers, or depressed pruning processes leading to a static, non-decreasing axonal dispersion. This prospective longitudinal study demonstrates significantly divergent tract-specific trajectories of brain microstructure, possibly reflecting a concussive and/or repeated sub-concussive impact-related alteration of normal white matter development in football athletes.

                The superior colliculus (SC) represents a major visual processing station in the mammalian brain that receives input from many types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). How many parallel channels exist in the SC, and what information does each encode? Here we recorded from mouse superficial SC neurons under a battery of visual stimuli including those used for classification of RGCs. An unsupervised clustering algorithm identified 24 functional types based on their visual responses. They fall into two groups: one that responds similarly to RGCs, and another with more diverse and specialized stimulus selectivity. The second group is dominant at greater depths, consistent with a vertical progression of signal processing in the SC. Cells of the same functional type tend to cluster near each other in anatomical space. Compared to the retina, the visual representation in the SC has lower dimensionality, consistent with a sifting process along the visual pathway.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An open-source, ready-to-use and validated ripple detector plugin for the Open Ephys GUI</a></h4>

              
                Sharp wave-ripples (SWRs, 100-250 Hz) are oscillatory events extracellularly recorded in the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus during sleep and quiet wakefulness. SWRs are thought to be involved in the dialogue between the hippocampus and cortical regions to promote memory consolidation during sleep and memory-guided decision making. Many studies employed closed-loop strategies to either detect and abolish SWRs within the hippocampus or manipulate other relevant areas upon ripple detection. However, the code and schematics necessary to replicate the detection system are not always available, which hinders the reproducibility of experiments among different research groups. Furthermore, information about performance is not usually reported. Here, we present the development and validation of an open-source, real-time ripple detection plugin integrated into the Open Ephys GUI. It contains a built-in movement detector based on accelerometer or electromyogram data that prevents false ripple events (due to chewing, grooming, or moving, for instance) from triggering the stimulation/manipulation device. To determine the accuracy of the detection algorithm, we first carried out simulations in Matlab with synthetic and real ripple recordings. Using a specific combination of detection parameters (amplitude threshold of 5 standard deviations above the mean, time threshold of 10 ms, and RMS block size of 7 samples), we obtained a 97% true positive rate and 2.48 false positives per minute on the real data. Next, an Open Ephys plugin based on the same detection algorithm was developed, and a closed-loop system was set up to evaluate the round trip (ripple onset-to-stimulation) latency over synthetic data. The lowest latency obtained was 34.5 {+/-} 0.5 ms. Besides contributing to increased reproducibility, we anticipate that the developed ripple detector plugin will be helpful for many closed-loop applications in the field of systems neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cue-driven motor planning facilitates express visuomotor responses in human arm muscles</a></h4>

              
                Humans can produce 'express' (~100ms) arm muscle responses that are inflexibly locked in time and space to the presentation of a visual target, consistent with subcortical visuomotor transformations via the tecto-reticulo-spinal pathway. These express visuomotor responses are sensitive to explicit cue-driven expectations, but it is unclear at what stage of sensory-to-motor transformation such modulation occurs. Here, we recorded electromyographic activity from shoulder muscles as participants reached toward one of four virtual targets whose physical location was partially predictable from a symbolic cue. In an experiment in which targets could be veridically reached, express responses were inclusive of the biomechanical requirements for reaching the cued locations and not systematically modulated by cue validity. In a second experiment, movements were restricted to the horizontal plane so that the participants could perform only rightward or leftward reaches, irrespective of target position on the vertical axis. Express muscle responses were almost identical for targets that were validly cued in the horizontal direction, regardless of cue validity in the vertical dimension. Together, these findings suggest that the cue-induced enhancements of express responses are dominated by effects at the level of motor plans and not solely via facilitation of early visuospatial target processing. Notably, direct cortico-tectal and cortico-reticular projections exist that are well-placed to modulate pre-stimulus motor preparation state in subcortical circuits. Our results appear to reflect a neural mechanism by which contextually relevant motor plans can be stored within subcortical visuomotor nodes and rapidly released in response to compatible visual inputs.

	<p>Trait empathy is an essential personality feature in the intricacy of typical social inclinations of individuals. Empathy is likely supported by multilevel neuronal network functioning, whereas local topological properties determine network integrity. In the present functional MRI study (N = 116), we aimed to trace empathic traits to the intrinsic brain network architecture. Empathy was conceived as composed of two dimensions within the concept of pre-reflective, intersubjective understanding. Vicarious experience consists of the tendency to resonate with the feelings of other individuals, whereas intuitive understanding refers to a natural awareness of others&amp;amp;rsquo; emotional states. Analyses of graph theoretical measures of centrality showed a relationship between the fronto-parietal network and psychometric measures of vicarious experience, whereas intuitive understanding was associated with sensorimotor and subcortical networks. Salience network regions could constitute hubs for information processing underlying both dimensions. The network properties related to empathy dimensions mainly concern inter-network information flow. Moreover, interaction effects implied several sex differences in the relationship between functional network organization and trait empathy. These results reveal that distinct intrinsic topological network features explain individual differences in separate dimensions of intersubjective understanding. The findings could help understand the impact of brain damage or stimulation through alterations of empathy-related network integrity.</p>

	<p>Visuo-motor adaptation to optical prisms (Prism Adaptation, PA), displacing the visual scene laterally, is a behavioral method used for the experimental investigation of visuomotor plasticity, and, in clinical settings, for temporarily ameliorating and rehabilitating unilateral spatial neglect. This study investigated the building up of PA, and the presence of the typically occurring subsequent Aftereffects (AEs) in a brain-damaged patient (TMA), suffering from apperceptive agnosia and a right visual half-field defect, with bilateral atrophy of the parieto-occipital cortices, regions involved in PA and AEs. Base-Right prisms and control neutral lenses were used. PA was achieved by repeated pointing movements toward three types of stimuli: visual, auditory, and bimodal audio-visual. The presence and the magnitude of AEs were assessed by proprioceptive, visual, visuo-proprioceptive, and auditory-proprioceptive straight-ahead pointing tasks. The patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s brain connectivity was investigated by Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). Unlike control participants, TMA did not show any adaptation to prism exposure, but her AEs were largely preserved. These findings indicate that AEs may occur even in the absence of PA, as indexed by the reduction of the pointing error, showing a dissociation between the classical measures of PA and AEs. In the PA process, error reduction, and its feedback, may be less central to the building up of AEs, than the sensorimotor pointing activity per se.</p>

	<p>The present study examined whether infants&amp;amp;rsquo; crawling experience is related to their sensitivity to fearful emotional expressions. Twenty-nine 9- to 10-month-old infants were tested in a preferential looking task, in which they were presented with different pairs of animated faces on a screen displaying a 100% happy facial expression and morphed facial expressions containing varying degrees of fear and happiness. Regardless of their crawling experiences, all infants looked longer at more fearful faces. Additionally, infants with at least 6 weeks of crawling experience needed lower levels of fearfulness in the morphs in order to detect a change from a happy to a fearful face compared to those with less crawling experience. Thus, the crawling experience seems to increase infants&amp;amp;rsquo; sensitivity to fearfulness in faces.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Understanding glioblastoma invasion using physically-guided neural networks with internal variables</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jacobo Ayensa-Jiménez, Mohamed H. Doweidar, Jose A. Sanz-Herrera, Manuel Doblare</p>

Microfluidic capacities for both recreating and monitoring cell cultures have opened the door to the use of Data Science and Machine Learning tools for understanding and simulating tumor evolution under controlled conditions. In this work, we show how these techniques could be applied to study Glioblastoma, the deadliest and most frequent primary brain tumor. In particular, we study Glioblastoma invasion using the recent concept of Physically-Guided Neural Networks with Internal Variables (PGNNIV), able to combine data obtained from microfluidic devices and some physical knowledge governing the tumor evolution. The physics is introduced by means of nonlinear advection-diffusion-reaction partial differential equation that models the Glioblastoma evolution for defining the network structure. On the other hand, multilayer perceptrons combined with a nodal deconvolution technique are used for learning the <i>go or grow</i> metabolic behavior which characterises the Glioblastoma invasion. The PGNNIV is here trained using synthetic data obtained from <i>in silico</i> tests created under different oxygenation conditions, using a previously validated model. The unravelling capacity of PGNNIV enables discovering complex metabolic processes in a non-parametric way, thus giving explanatory capacity to the networks, and, as a consequence, surpassing the predictive power of any parametric approach and for any kind of stimulus. Besides, the possibility of working, for a particular tumor, with different boundary and initial conditions, permits the use of PGNNIV for defining virtual therapies and for drug design, thus making the first steps towards <i>in silico</i> personalised medicine.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Inter-paralog amino acid inversion events in large phylogenies of duplicated proteins</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Stefano Pascarelli, Paola Laurino</p>

Connecting protein sequence to function is becoming increasingly relevant since high-throughput sequencing studies accumulate large amounts of genomic data. In order to go beyond the existing database annotation, it is fundamental to understand the mechanisms underlying functional inheritance and divergence. If the homology relationship between proteins is known, can we determine whether the function diverged? In this work, we analyze different possibilities of protein sequence evolution after gene duplication and identify “inter-paralog inversions”, i.e., sites where the relationship between the ancestry and the functional signal is decoupled. The amino acids in these sites are masked from being recognized by other prediction tools. Still, they play a role in functional divergence and could indicate a shift in protein function. We develop a method to specifically recognize inter-paralog amino acid inversions in a phylogeny and test it on real and simulated datasets. In a dataset built from the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) sequences found in 88 fish species, we identify 19 amino acid sites that went through inversion after gene duplication, mostly located at the ligand-binding extracellular domain. Our work uncovers an outcome of protein duplications with direct implications in protein functional annotation and sequence evolution. The developed method is optimized to work with large protein datasets and can be readily included in a targeted protein analysis pipeline.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Arousal state affects perceptual decision-making by modulating hierarchical sensory processing in a large-scale visual system model</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lynn K. A. Sörensen, Sander M. Bohté, Heleen A. Slagter, H. Steven Scholte</p>

Arousal levels strongly affect task performance. Yet, what arousal level is optimal for a task depends on its difficulty. Easy task performance peaks at higher arousal levels, whereas performance on difficult tasks displays an inverted U-shape relationship with arousal, peaking at medium arousal levels, an observation first made by Yerkes and Dodson in 1908. It is commonly proposed that the noradrenergic locus coeruleus system regulates these effects on performance through a widespread release of noradrenaline resulting in changes of cortical gain. This account, however, does not explain why performance decays with high arousal levels only in difficult, but not in simple tasks. Here, we present a mechanistic model that revisits the Yerkes-Dodson effect from a sensory perspective: a deep convolutional neural network augmented with a global gain mechanism reproduced the same interaction between arousal state and task difficulty in its performance. Investigating this model revealed that global gain states differentially modulated sensory information encoding across the processing hierarchy, which explained their differential effects on performance on simple versus difficult tasks. These findings offer a novel hierarchical sensory processing account of how, and why, arousal state affects task performance.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Meteorological factors and non-pharmaceutical interventions explain local differences in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Austria</a></h4>

The drivers behind regional differences of SARS-CoV-2 spread on finer spatio-temporal scales are yet to be fully understood. Here we develop a data-driven modelling approach based on an age-structured compartmental model that compares 116 Austrian regions to a suitably chosen control set of regions to explain variations in local transmission rates through a combination of meteorological factors, non-pharmaceutical interventions and mobility. We find that more than 60% of the observed regional variations can be explained by these factors. Decreasing temperature and humidity, increasing cloudiness, precipitation and the absence of mitigation measures for public events are the strongest drivers for increased virus transmission, leading in combination to a doubling of the transmission rates compared to regions with more favourable weather. We conjecture that regions with little mitigation measures for large events that experience shifts toward unfavourable weather conditions are particularly predisposed as nucleation points for the next seasonal SARS-CoV-2 waves.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Moving in on human motor cortex. Characterizing the relationship between body parts with non-rigid population response fields</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Wouter Schellekens, Carlijn Bakker, Nick F. Ramsey, Natalia Petridou</p>

For cortical motor activity, the relationships between different body part representations is unknown. Through reciprocal body part relationships, functionality of cortical motor areas with respect to whole body motor control can be characterized. In the current study, we investigate the relationship between body part representations within individual neuronal populations in motor cortices, following a 7 Tesla fMRI 18-body-part motor experiment in combination with our newly developed non-rigid population Response Field (pRF) model and graph theory. The non-rigid pRF metrics reveal somatotopic structures in all included motor cortices covering frontal, parietal, medial and insular cortices and that neuronal populations in primary sensorimotor cortex respond to fewer body parts than secondary motor cortices. Reciprocal body part relationships are estimated in terms of <i>uniqueness</i>, <i>clique-formation</i>, and <i>influence</i>. We report unique response profiles for the knee, a clique of body parts surrounding the ring finger, and a central role for the shoulder and wrist. These results reveal associations among body parts from the perspective of the central nervous system, while being in agreement with intuitive notions of body part usage.

                <p>by Bastien Polizzi, Andrea Fanesi, Filipa Lopes, Magali Ribot, Olivier Bernard</p>

We present a spatial model describing the growth of a photosynthetic microalgae biofilm. In this 2D-model we consider photosynthesis, cell carbon accumulation, extracellular matrix excretion, and mortality. The rate of each of these mechanisms is given by kinetic laws regulated by light, nitrate, oxygen and inorganic carbon. The model is based on mixture theory and the behaviour of each component is defined on one hand by mass conservation, which takes into account biological features of the system, and on the other hand by conservation of momentum, which expresses the physical properties of the components. The model simulates the biofilm structural dynamics following an initial colonization phase. It shows that a 75 <i>μ</i>m thick active region drives the biofilm development. We then determine the optimal harvesting period and biofilm height which maximize productivity. Finally, different harvesting patterns are tested and their effect on biofilm structure are discussed. The optimal strategy differs whether the objective is to recover the total biofilm or just the algal biomass.

For <i>de novo</i> mutational signature analysis, the critical first step is to decide how many signatures should be expected in a cancer genomics study. An incorrect number could mislead downstream analyses. Here we present SUITOR (Selecting the nUmber of mutatIonal signaTures thrOugh cRoss-validation), an unsupervised cross-validation method that requires little assumptions and no numerical approximations to select the optimal number of signatures without overfitting the data. <i>In vitro</i> studies and <i>in silico</i> simulations demonstrated that SUITOR can correctly identify signatures, some of which were missed by other widely used methods. Applied to 2,540 whole-genome sequenced tumors across 22 cancer types, SUITOR selected signatures with the smallest prediction errors and almost all signatures of breast cancer selected by SUITOR were validated in an independent breast cancer study. SUITOR is a powerful tool to select the optimal number of mutational signatures, facilitating downstream analyses with etiological or therapeutic importance.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Fast and flexible processing of large FRET image stacks using the FRET-IBRA toolkit</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Gautam Munglani, Hannes Vogler, Ueli Grossniklaus</p>

Ratiometric time-lapse FRET analysis requires a robust and accurate processing pipeline to eliminate bias in intensity measurements on fluorescent images before further quantitative analysis can be conducted. This level of robustness can only be achieved by supplementing automated tools with built-in flexibility for manual ad-hoc adjustments. FRET-IBRA is a modular and fully parallelized configuration file-based tool written in Python. It simplifies the FRET processing pipeline to achieve accurate, registered, and unified ratio image stacks. The flexibility of this tool to handle discontinuous image frame sequences with tailored configuration parameters further streamlines the processing of outliers and time-varying effects in the original microscopy images. FRET-IBRA offers cluster-based channel background subtraction, photobleaching correction, and ratio image construction in an all-in-one solution without the need for multiple applications, image format conversions, and/or plug-ins. The package accepts a variety of input formats and outputs TIFF image stacks along with performance measures to detect both the quality and failure of the background subtraction algorithm on a per frame basis. Furthermore, FRET-IBRA outputs images with superior signal-to-noise ratio and accuracy in comparison to existing background subtraction solutions, whilst maintaining a fast runtime. We have used the FRET-IBRA package extensively to quantify the spatial distribution of calcium ions during pollen tube growth under mechanical constraints. Benchmarks against existing tools clearly demonstrate the need for FRET-IBRA in extracting reliable insights from FRET microscopy images of dynamic physiological processes at high spatial and temporal resolution. The source code for Linux and Mac operating systems is released under the BSD license and, along with installation instructions, test images, example configuration files, and a step-by-step tutorial, is freely available at github.com/gmunglani/fret-ibra.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Association of Apolipoprotein E ɛ4 allele with Enlarged Perivascular Spaces</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Enlarged perivascular spaces have emerged as markers of cerebral small vessel disease and are linked to perivascular drainage dysfunction. The Apolipoprotein E ɛ4 allele is the strongest genetic risk factor for cerebral amyloid angiopathy and Alzheimer’s neuropathology, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We studied the relationship between APOE-ɛ4 and the topography and burden of enlarged perivascular spaces to elucidate underlying mechanisms between APOE-ɛ4 and adverse clinical outcomes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 3,564 Framingham Heart Study participants with available genotypes and magnetic resonance imaging. Enlarged perivascular spaces in the basal ganglia and centrum semiovale were rated using a validated scale. We related APOE-ɛ4 allele presence to high burden of enlarged perivascular spaces in each region and a mixed score reflecting high burden in both regions using multivariable logistic regression. Exploratory analyses incorporated presence of cerebral microbleeds and assessed effect modification by hypertension.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Mean age was 60.7 years (SD: 14.6), 1644 (46.1%) were male, 1486 (41.8%) were hypertensive, and 836 (23.5%) participants were APOE-ɛ4 carriers. APOE-ɛ4 was associated with high burden of enlarged perivascular spaces in the centrum semiovale (OR 1.45, 95% CI: 1.16, 1.81) and mixed regions (OR: 1.37; 95% CI: 1.11, 1.68). Associations were slightly stronger in hypertensive subjects.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The APOE-ɛ4 allele plays a modest role in the burden of enlarged perivascular spaces in the centrum semiovale. Further studies are needed to clarify the underlying small vessel disease type in community-dwelling individuals with predominant centrum semiovale enlarged perivascular spaces, which may be hypertensive angiopathy in our sample.</p>

                <p>The Ophelia syndrome or encephalitis with antibodies against the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) manifests with behavioral changes, memory deficits and anxiety. To study the antibody pathogenicity, mice received continuous cerebroventricular infusion of patients' or controls' IgG for 14 days, followed by a 15-day wash-out. The effects on hippocampal mGluR5 clusters were determined by confocal microscopy. Animals infused with patients' IgG, but not controls' IgG, showed memory impairment, increased anxiety, and decreased neuronal surface mGluR5 clusters. After antibody clearance, both behavioral and molecular changes reversed to baseline conditions<b>.</b> These findings support the pathogenicity of these antibodies in anti-mGluR5 encephalitis.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Oxidized phospholipids as novel mediators of neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                Neurodegeneration drives the progression of many neurological diseases. Inflammation and oxidative stress occurring in the CNS promote lipid peroxidation, leading to the generation of oxidized phospholipids such as oxidized phosphatidylcholines (OxPCs). OxPCs have been proposed as biomarkers of oxidative stress, where their detection in lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS), frontotemporal lobe dementia, spinal cord injury, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) implies that oxidative insult had occurred.

                By recording from large ensembles of hippocampal neurons as rats explored various tracks, Berners-Lee et al. find that sustained replay appears after a single experience. Further, with repeated experience on a novel track, replay slows down, taking more time to traverse the same trajectory.

                Transcriptomic and functional changes in glia are hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease. In this issue of Neuron, Sadick, O'Dea, et al. define transcriptomic differences in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in Alzheimer’s disease at the single-nuclei level. They also localize human Alzheimer’s-associated transcription profiles to strategic location in the inflamed mouse brain.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Precise in vivo functional analysis of DNA variants with base editing using ACEofBASEs target prediction</a></h4>

              
                Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) are prevalent genetic factors shaping individual trait profiles and disease susceptibility. The recent development and optimizations of base editors, rubber and pencil genome editing tools now promise to enable direct functional assessment of SNVs in model organisms. However, the lack of bioinformatic tools aiding target prediction limits the application of base editing <i>in vivo</i>. Here, we provide a framework for adenine and cytosine base editing in medaka (<i>Oryzias latipes)</i> and zebrafish (<i>Danio rerio</i>), ideal for scalable validation studies. We developed an online base editing tool ACEofBASEs (a careful evaluation of base-edits), to facilitate decision-making by streamlining sgRNA design and performing off-target evaluation. We used state-of-the-art adenine (ABE) and cytosine base editors (CBE) in medaka and zebrafish to edit eye pigmentation genes and transgenic GFP function with high efficiencies. Base editing in the genes encoding troponin T and the potassium channel ERG faithfully recreated known cardiac phenotypes. Deep-sequencing of alleles revealed the abundance of intended edits in comparison to low levels of insertion or deletion (indel) events for ABE8e and evoBE4max. We finally validated missense mutations in novel candidate genes of congenital heart disease (CHD) <i>dapk3</i>,<i> ube2b</i>, <i>usp44</i>, and <i>ptpn11 </i>in F0 and F1 for a subset of these target genes with genotype-phenotype correlation. This base editing framework applies to a wide range of SNV-susceptible traits accessible in fish, facilitating straight-forward candidate validation and prioritization for detailed mechanistic downstream studies.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">DNA circles promote yeast ageing in part through stimulating the reorganization of nuclear pore complexes</a></h4>

              
                The nuclear pore complex (NPC) mediates nearly all exchanges between nucleus and cytoplasm, and in many species it changes composition as the organism ages. However, how these changes arise and whether they contribute themselves to ageing is poorly understood. We show that SAGA-dependent attachment of DNA circles to NPCs in replicatively ageing yeast cells causes NPCs to lose their nuclear basket and cytoplasmic complexes. These NPCs were not recognized as defective by the NPC quality control machinery (SINC) and not targeted by ESCRTs. They interacted normally or more effectively with protein import and export factors but specifically lost mRNA export factors. Acetylation of Nup60 drove the displacement of basket and cytoplasmic complexes from circle-bound NPCs. Mutations preventing this remodeling extended the replicative lifespan of the cells. Thus, our data suggest that the anchorage of accumulating circles locks NPCs in a specialized state and that this process is intrinsically linked to the mechanisms by which ERCs promote ageing.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Why both sides of the gender equation matter</a></h4>

              
                Despite efforts to increase gender diversity in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine (STEMM), men continue to hold most tenured and leadership positions. Moreover, the specific population shifts and timelines which may be required to achieve gender parity have not been well delineated. It is obvious that if women are statistically underrepresented in a field, then men must be statistically overrepresented: however, male overrepresentation and related gender-based advantages are rarely mentioned in conversations about gender equality. It is important that actions to address both overrepresentation and underrepresentation are elements of any strategy that seeks to move STEMM fields closer to gender parity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Pinpointing the tumor-specific T-cells via TCR clusters</a></h4>

              
                Adoptive T cell transfer (ACT) is a promising approach to cancer immunotherapy, but its efficiency fundamentally depends on the extent of tumor-specific T-cell enrichment within the graft. This can be estimated via activation with identifiable neoantigens, tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), or living or lyzed tumor cells, but these approaches remain laborious, time-consuming, and functionally limited, hampering clinical development of ACT. Here, we demonstrate that homology cluster analysis of T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires efficiently identifies tumor-reactive TCRs allowing to: 1) detect their presence within the pool of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs); 2) optimize TIL culturing conditions, with IL-2<sub>low</sub>/IL-21/anti-PD-1 combination showing increased efficiency; 3) investigate surface marker-based enrichment for tumor-targeting T cells in freshly-isolated TILs (enrichment confirmed for CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> PD-1<sup>+</sup>/CD39<sup>+</sup> subsets), or re-stimulated TILs (informs on enrichment in 4-1BB-sorted cells). We believe that this approach to the rapid assessment of tumor-specific TCR enrichment should accelerate T cell therapy development.

                <b>Background:</b> When researchers' careers are disrupted                    by life events-such as illness or childbirth-they often need to take extended                    time off. This creates a gap in their research output that can reduce their                    chances of winning funding. In Australia, applicants can disclose their career                    disruptions and peer reviewers are instructed to make appropriate adjustments.                    However, it is not clear if and how applicants use career disruption sections or                    how reviewers adjust and if they do it consistently.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Innervation modulates the functional connectivity between pancreatic endocrine cells</a></h4>

              
                The importance of pancreatic endocrine cell activity modulation by autonomic innervation has been debated. To investigate this question, we established an <i>in vivo</i> imaging model that also allows chronic and acute neuromodulation with genetic and optogenetic tools. Using the GCaMP6s biosensor together with endocrine cell fluorescent reporters, we imaged calcium dynamics simultaneously in multiple pancreatic islet cell types in live animals in control states and upon changes in innervation. We find that by 4 days post fertilization in zebrafish, a stage when islet architecture is reminiscent of that in adult rodents, prominent activity coupling between beta cells is present in basal glucose conditions. Furthermore, we show that both chronic and acute loss of nerve activity result in diminished beta-beta and alpha-beta activity coupling. Pancreatic nerves are in contact with all islet cell types, but predominantly with beta and delta cells. Surprisingly, a subset of delta cells with detectable peri-islet neural activity coupling had significantly higher homotypic coupling with other delta cells suggesting that some delta cells receive innervation that coordinates their output. Overall, these data show that innervation plays a vital role in the maintenance of homotypic and heterotypic cellular connectivity in pancreatic islets, a process critical for islet function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sub-type selective muscarinic acetylcholine receptor modulation for the treatment of parkinsonian tremor</a></h4>

              
                Parkinsons Disease is characterized by hallmark motor symptoms including resting tremor, akinesia, rigidity, and postural instability. In patient surveys of Parkinsons Disease symptoms and quality of life, tremor consistently ranks among the top concerns of patients with disease. However, the gold standard of treatment, levodopa, has inconsistent or incomplete anti-tremor effects in patients, necessitating new therapeutic strategies to help relieve this burden. Non-selective anti-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor therapeutic agents which target each of the 5 muscarinic receptor subtypes have been used as an adjunct therapy in this disease, as well as other movement disorders, and have been shown to have anti-tremor efficacy. Despite this, anti-muscarinic therapy is poorly tolerated due to adverse effects. Recent pharmacological advances have led to the discovery of muscarinic subtype selective antagonists that may keep the anti-tremor efficacy of non-selective compounds, while reducing or eliminating adverse effects. Here, we directly test this hypothesis using pharmacological models of parkinsonian tremor combined with recently discovered selective positive allosteric modulators and antagonists of the predominant brain expressed muscarinic receptors M 1 , M 4 , and M 5 . Surprisingly, we find that selective modulation of M 1 , M 4 , or M 5 does not reduce tremor in these pre-clinical models, suggesting that central or peripheral M 2 or M 3 receptors may be responsible for the anti-tremor efficacy of non-selective anti-muscarinic therapies currently used in the clinic

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Biological responses to terahertz radiation with different power density in primary hippocampal neurons</a></h4>

              
                Background Terahertz (THz) radiation is a valuable imaging and sensing tool which is widely used in industry and medicine. However, it biological effects including genotoxicity and cytotoxicity are not clear, particularly on the nervous system. In this study, we investigated how THz radiation with different frequency and intensity would affect the morphology, cell growth and function of rat hippocampal neurons in vitro. Methods Primary hippocampal neuronal cells were isolated from newborn Wistar rat pups and were exposed to THz radiation with the frequencies of 0.12 THz and 0.141 THz, at an power intensities of 10 mW/cm2 and 30 mW/cm2 respectively. The cellular activities were evaluated by Cell Counting Kit-8 after exposure for 10 min and 30 min. The cellular apoptosis was examined by Annexin V staining using flow cytometry and the ultrastructure was detected by electron microscopy. Moreover, the amount of amino acid in the cultured neurons was measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results No obvious morphological changes, such as axon length and axon number, could be detected in primary neurons after exposure to 10mW/cm2 or 50 mW/cm2 THz for 30 min. However, the overall cellular activities were differentially affected by 10mW/cm2 and 50 mW/cm2 THz. Obvious cellular apoptosis was induced by both 10mW/cm2 and 50 mW/cm2 exposure. We also found that the amounts of most amino acids did not change significantly after exposure to these two types of THz radiation. Conclusions The effects of THz radiation on hippocampal neurons depend on frequency, power, exposure time as well as the measurement time after the exposure. These results will provide important information for further investigation of the effect of THz radiation on the nervous system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Older circuits get richer: neurogenesis timeline shapes hubness and neurogenetic profiles of the adult human brain</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the architectural principle that shapes the topology of the human connectome at its multiple spatial scales is a major challenge for systems neuroscience. This would provide key fundamental principles and a theory for browsing brains networks, to ultimately generate hypothesis and approach to which extent key structures might impact different brain pathologies. In this work, we propose the hypothesis that the centrality of the different brain nodes in the human connectome is a product of their embryogenic age, and accordingly, early-born nodes should display higher hubness, and viceversa for late-born nodes. We tested our hypothesis by identifying and segmenting eighteen macroregions with a well-known embryogenic age, over which we calculated the centrality of nodes in the structural and functional networks at different spatial resolutions. First, structural centrality of nodes correlated with their embryogenic age, fully confirming our working hypothesis. However, at the functional level, distinct trends were found at different resolutions. Secondly, the difference in embryonic age between nodes inversely correlated with the probability of existence and the weights of the links. This indicated the presence of a temporal developmental gradient that shapes connectivity and where nodes connect more to nodes with a similar age. Finally, brain transcriptomic analysis revealed high association between embryonic age, structural-functional centrality and the expression of genes related to nervous system development and synapse regulation. Furthermore, the spatial expression of genes causally related to major neurological diseases was highly correlated with spatial maps of region centrality. Overall, these results support the hypothesis that the embryogenic age of brain regions shapes the topology of adult brain networks. Our results show two key principles, preferential age attachment and older gets richer on the wiring of the human brain, thus shedding new light on the relationship between brain development, transcriptomics, node centrality, and neurological diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Toxicity of extracellular alpha-synuclein is independent of intracellular alpha-synuclein</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) pathology progresses throughout the nervous system affecting numerous neuronal structures. It has been postulated that the progression of the pathology is based on a prion-like disease mechanism partly due to the seeding effect of endocytosed alpha-synuclein (ASYN) on endogenous ASYN. The appearance of the pathology in dopaminergic neurons leads to neuronal cell death and motor symptoms. However, the effect on other neuronal structures is more inconsistent, leading to a higher variability in the prevalence of non-motor symptoms. Thus, the sensitivity to the pathology seems to vary among neuronal subtypes. Here, we analyzed the role of endogenous ASYN in the progression of PD-like pathology and the effect of monomeric and oligomeric ASYN as well as paraquat and rotenone on primary enteric, dopaminergic and cortical neurons from wild-type mice. Our results showed that pathology progression did not occur in the absence of endogenous ASYN and that dopaminergic neurons were more sensitive to ASYN and rotenone when compared to all other neuronal subtypes. Remarkably, the toxic effect of endocytosed ASYN-oligomers was independent of the presence of endogenous ASYN and directly related to the disturbance of the mitochondrial membrane potential. Thus, we suggest that the interaction between ASYN and mitochondria plays an important role in the toxicity of trans-synaptically transported ASYN and in the progression of PD pathology. These results question the prion-disease hypothesis and propose that endocytosed ASYN impairs the host's mitochondrial function thereby also contributing to PD-pathology progression.

	<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Therapy is currently limited to drugs that interfere with the immune system; treatment options that primarily mediate neuroprotection and prevent neurodegeneration are not available. Here, we studied the effects of nimodipine on the rat cell line OLN-93, which resembles young mature oligodendrocytes. Nimodipine is a dihydropyridine that blocks the voltage-gated L-type calcium channel family members Cav1.2 and Cav1.3. Our data show that the treatment of OLN-93 cells with nimodipine induced the upregulation of myelin genes, in particular of proteolipid protein 1 (Plp1), which was confirmed by a significantly greater expression of PLP1 in immunofluorescence analysis and the presence of myelin structures in the cytoplasm at the ultrastructural level. Whole-genome RNA sequencing additionally revealed the upregulation of genes that are involved in neuroprotection, remyelination, and antioxidation pathways. Interestingly, the observed effects were independent of Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 because OLN-93 cells do not express these channels, and there was no measurable response pattern in patch-clamp analysis. Taking into consideration previous studies that demonstrated a beneficial effect of nimodipine on microglia, our data support the notion that nimodipine is an interesting drug candidate for the treatment of MS and other demyelinating diseases.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The structural plasticity of dendritic spines serves as the adaptive capabilities of the central nervous system to various stimuli. Among these stimuli, cerebral ischemia induces dynamic alterations in neuronal network activity. Arcadlin/Paraxial protocadherin/Protocadherin-8 (Acad), a regulator of dendritic spine density, is strongly induced by activating stimuli to the neurons. However, the detailed distribution of Acad in normal and ischemic adult brains remains unclear. We comprehensively described <i>Acad</i> expression patterns in normal and ischemic adult brains by in situ hybridization histochemistry. We found that intact adult brains expressed <i>Acad</i> in the piriform cortex, dentate gyrus, hippocampal CA3, entorhinal cortex, amygdala, and hypothalamus. <i>Acad</i> expression was dramatically upregulated in the piriform cortex, olfactory area, dentate gyrus, entorhinal cortex, prefrontal cortex, insular cortex, amygdala, and septohippocampal nucleus 4 h after cerebral ischemia. Cerebral ischemia induced widespread neuronal activation, which was required for <i>Acad</i> upregulation. Our data suggested the involvement of Acad in the adaptive plasticity and remodeling of the neuronal network in the limbic and paralimbic systems.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dual pathway architecture underlying vocal learning in songbirds</a></h4>

              
                Song acquisition and production in songbirds is governed by a dedicated neural circuitry that involves two parallel pathways: a motor pathway for the production and a basal ganglia (BG) pathway for the acquisition. Juveniles learn by imitating adult vocalizations and proceed by trial and error, errors being conveyed by a dopaminergic signal. The complex nature of the relationship between neural control and syrinx musculature makes song learning a complicated problem to solve. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely hypothesized to underlie such sensorimotor learning even though this can lead to sub-optimal solutions under uneven contours in continuous action spaces. In this article, we propose to re-interpret the role of a dual pathway architecture, underlying avian vocal learning, that helps overcome these limitations. We posit that the BG pathway conducts exploration by inducing large daily shifts in the vocal production while the motor pathway gradually consolidates this exploration. This process can be understood as a modified form of a simulated annealing process. Simulations on Gaussian performance landscapes and a syrinx-based performance landscape are demonstrated and compared with standard approaches. Taking behavioral constraints into account (60 days of learning, 1000 trials per day), the model allows to reach the global optimum in complex landscapes and thus provides a sound insight into the role of the dual pathway architecture underlying vocal learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Viability of AMURA biomarkers from single-shell diffusion MRI in Migraine Clinical Studies</a></h4>

              
                Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is the most employed method to assess white matter properties using quantitative parameters derived from diffusion MRI, but it presents known limitations that restricts the evaluation of complex structures. The objective of this study was the assessment of complementary diffusion measures extracted with a novel approach, Apparent Measures Using Reduced Acquisitions (AMURA), in comparison with DTI in clinical studies. Fifty healthy controls, 51 episodic migraine and 56 chronic migraine patients underwent single-shell diffusion MRI. Three DTI-based and eight AMURA-based parameters were compared between groups with tract-based spatial statistics. On the other hand, following a region-based analysis, the measures were assessed for multiple subsamples with diverse reduced sample sizes and their stability was evaluated with the coefficient of quartile variation. Compared to DTI, statistically significant differences in additional regions and group comparisons were found with AMURA-based measures. Additionally, some AMURA-based measures showed a remarkable discriminative power for quite reduced sample size and, simultaneously, lower stability (higher coefficient of quartile variation) than DTI-based measures. These findings suggest that AMURA presents favorable characteristics to identify differences of specific microstructural properties between clinical groups in regions with complex fiber architecture and lower dependency on the sample size or assessing technique than DTI.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">VMHdm/cSF-1 Neuronal Circuits Regulate Skeletal Muscle PGC1-α via the Sympathoadrenal Drive</a></h4>

              
                To adapt to metabolically challenging environments, the central nervous system (CNS) orchestrates metabolism of peripheral organs including skeletal muscle. The organ-communication between the CNS and skeletal muscle has been investigated, yet our understanding of the neuronal pathway from the CNS to skeletal muscle is still limited. Neurons in the dorsomedial and central parts of the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMHdm/c) expressing steroidogenic factor-1 (VMHdm/cSF-1 neurons) are key for metabolic adaptations to exercise, including increased basal metabolic rate and skeletal muscle mass in mice. However, the mechanisms by which VMHdm/cSF-1 neurons regulate skeletal muscle function remain unclear. Here, we show that VMHdm/cSF-1 neurons increase the sympathoadrenal activity and regulate skeletal muscle peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1) in mice via multiple downstream nodes. Optogenetic activation of VMHdm/cSF-1 neurons dramatically elevates mRNA levels of skeletal muscle Pgc-1, which regulates a spectrum of skeletal muscle function including protein synthesis and metabolism. Mechanistically, the sympathoadrenal drive coupled with {beta}2 adrenergic receptor ({beta}2AdR) is essential for VMHdm/cSF-1 neurons-mediated increases in skeletal muscle PGC1-. Specifically, adrenalectomy and knockout of {beta}2AdR block augmented skeletal muscle PGC1- by VMHdm/cSF-1 neuronal activation. Optogenetic functional mapping reveals that downstream nodes of VMHdm/cSF-1 neurons are functionally redundant to increase circulating epinephrine and skeletal muscle PGC1-. Collectively, we propose that VMHdm/cSF-11 neurons-skeletal muscle pathway, VMHdm/cSF-1 neurons[-&gt;]multiple downstream nodes[-&gt;]the adrenal gland[-&gt;]skeletal muscle {beta}2AdR, underlies augmented skeletal muscle function for metabolic adaptations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">RNA methylation influences TDP43 binding and disease pathogenesis in models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia</a></h4>

              
                Methylation of RNA at the N6 position of adenosine (m6A) is one of the most common RNA modifications, impacting RNA stability as well as its transport and translation. Previous studies uncovered RNA destabilization in models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), in association with accumulation of the RNA-binding protein TDP43, which is itself mislocalized from the nucleus in >95% of those with ALS. Here, we show that TDP43 recognizes m6A-modified RNA, and that RNA methylation is critical for both TDP43 binding and autoregulation. We also observed extensive hypermethylation of coding and non-coding transcripts in ALS spinal cord, many of which overlap with methylated TDP43 target RNAs. Emphasizing the importance of m6A for TDP43 binding and function, we identified several m6A factors that enhance or suppress TDP43-mediated toxicity via a single-cell CRISPR/Cas9 candidate-based screen in primary neurons. The most promising genetic modifier among these-the canonical m6A reader YTHDF2-accumulated within spinal motor neurons in ALS postmortem sections, and its knockdown prolonged the survival of human neurons carrying ALS-associated mutations. Collectively, these data show that m6A modifications modulate RNA binding by TDP43, and that m6A is pivotal for TDP43-related neurodegeneration in ALS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A retrospective and stepwise learning strategy revealed by neuronal activity in the basal forebrain</a></h4>

              
                Associative learning is a fundamental cognitive capacity that allows animals and humans to learn the predictive relationship between behavioral events and rewarding outcomes. While the process of learning is commonly conceptualized as a prospective strategy (learning how behavioral events predict future rewards), here we provide behavioral and neurophysiological evidence to show that animals may instead employ a retrospective and stepwise learning strategy (learning how the reward is predicted by preceding behavioral events). In rats learning a new association in which the reward was paired with a sequence of behavioral events, learning started from the event closest to the reward and sequentially incorporated earlier events into animals' internal model. The learning of each behavioral event as a new reward predictor was accompanied by the emergence of basal forebrain (BF) neuronal responses toward that event. BF activities quantitatively conveyed a reward prediction error signal associated with the behavioral event, and promoted reward-seeking behavioral sequences containing the newly learned event. As the internal model incorporated more behavioral events as reward predictors, non-rewarded behavioral sequences that were once compatible with the internal model during early stages of learning became incompatible and were sequentially eliminated. Together, these results demonstrate how the retrospective and stepwise learning strategy can effectively establish animals' internal model during the learning process and lead to the sequential refinement of reward-seeking behaviors. These results also highlight the functional significance of BF neuronal activities, which provided unique insights into the covert dynamics of the learning process in single trials.

	<p>Background: Oligoclonal bands represent intrathecal immunoglobulin G (IgG) synthesis and play an important role in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS). Kappa free light chains (KFLC) are increasingly recognized as an additional biomarker for intrathecal Ig synthesis. However, there are limited data on KFLC in neurological diseases other than MS. Methods: This study, conducted at two centers, retrospectively enrolled 346 non-MS patients. A total of 182 patients were diagnosed with non-inflammatory and 84 with inflammatory neurological diseases other than MS. A further 80 patients were classified as symptomatic controls. Intrathecal KFLC production was determined using different approaches: KFLC index, Reiber&amp;amp;rsquo;s diagram, Presslauer&amp;amp;rsquo;s exponential curve, and Senel&amp;amp;rsquo;s linear curve. Results: Matching results of oligoclonal bands and KFLC (Reiber&amp;amp;rsquo;s diagram) were frequently observed (93%). The Reiber&amp;amp;acute;s diagram for KFLC detected intrathecal KFLC synthesis in an additional 7% of the patient samples investigated (4% non-inflammatory; 3% inflammatory), which was not found by oligoclonal band detection. Conclusion: The determination of both biomarkers (KFLC and oligoclonal bands) is recommended for routine diagnosis and differentiation of non-inflammatory and inflammatory neurological diseases. Due to the high sensitivity and physiological considerations, the assessment of KFLC in the Reiber&amp;amp;acute;s diagram should be preferred to other evaluation methods.</p>

	<p>Temporal connectives play a crucial role in marking the sequence of events during language comprehension. Although existing studies have shown that sentence comprehension can be modulated by temporal connectives, they have mainly focused on languages with grammatical tense such as English. It thus remains unclear how temporal information is processed in tenseless languages. The present study used event-related potentials (ERPs) to examine how world knowledge is retrieved and integrated in sentences linked by zhiqian (before) and zhihou (after) in Mandarin Chinese (e.g., After/Before going to the countryside, Grandpa went to the city because the air there was fresh and pure). The critical words (e.g., fresh) were either congruent or incongruent with world knowledge. Relative to the after-congruent sentences, the after-incongruent sentences evoked a P600 on critical words and a negativity on sentence-final words, whereas relative to before-congruent sentences, before-incongruent sentences showed no significant difference on critical words but a sustained negativity on sentence-final words. Additionally, before-congruent sentences elicited a larger sustained positivity (P600) than after-congruent sentences. The results suggest that before is more difficult to process than after in Mandarin Chinese, supporting the iconicity account of temporal relations.</p>

	<p>The development of potent and selective therapeutic approaches to glioblastoma (GBM) requires the identification of molecular pathways that critically regulate the survival and proliferation of GBM. Glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) possess stem-cell-like properties, self-renewal, and differentiation into multiple neural cell lineages. From a clinical point of view, GSCs have been reported to resist radiation and chemotherapy. GSCs are influenced by the microenvironment, especially the hypoxic condition. N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) is a tumor suppressor with the potential to suppress the proliferation, invasion, and migration of cancer cells. Previous studies have reported that deregulated expression of NDRG1 affects tumor growth and clinical outcomes of patients with GBM. This literature review aimed to clarify the critical role of NDRG1 in tumorigenesis and acquirement of resistance for anti-GBM therapies, further to discussing the possibility and efficacy of NDRG1 as a novel target of treatment for GBM. The present review was conducted by searching the PubMed and Scopus databases. The search was conducted in February 2022. We review current knowledge on the regulation and signaling of NDRG1 in neuro-oncology. Finally, the role of NDRG1 in GBM and potential clinical applications are discussed.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this paper was to explore the utility of time to maximum concentration (T<sub>max</sub>)-based target mismatch on computed tomography perfusion (CTP) in predicting radiological and clinical outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion (LVO) selected for endovascular treatment (EVT).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients with AIS underwent CTP within 24 hours from onset followed by EVT. Critically hypoperfused tissue and ischemic core volumes were automatically calculated using T<sub>max</sub> thresholds &gt;9.5 seconds and &gt;16 seconds, respectively. The difference between T<sub>max</sub> &gt; 9.5 seconds and T<sub>max</sub> &gt; 16 seconds volumes and the ratio between T<sub>max</sub> &gt; 9.5 seconds and T<sub>max</sub> &gt; 16 seconds volumes were considered ischemic penumbra and T<sub>max</sub> mismatch ratio, respectively. Final infarct volume (FIV) was measured on follow-up non-contrast computed tomography (CT) at 24 hours. Favorable clinical outcome was defined as 90-day modified Rankin Scale 0 to 2. Predictors of FIV and outcome were assessed with multivariable logistic regression. Optimal T<sub>max</sub> volumes for identification of good outcome was defined using receiver operating curves.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 393 patients were included, of whom 298 (75.8%) achieved successful recanalization and 258 (65.5%) achieved good outcome. In multivariable analyses, all T<sub>max</sub> parameters were independent predictors of FIV and outcome. T<sub>max</sub> &gt; 16 seconds volume had the strongest association with FIV (beta coefficient = 0.596 <i>p</i> &lt;0.001) and good outcome (odds ratio [OR] = 0.96 per 1 ml increase, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.95–0.97, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). T<sub>max</sub> &gt; 16 seconds volume had the highest discriminative ability for good outcome (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.842–0.909). A T<sub>max</sub> &gt; 16 seconds volume of ≤67 ml best identified subjects with favorable outcome (sensitivity = 0.91 and specificity = 0.73).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>T<sub>max</sub> target mismatch predicts radiological and clinical outcomes in patients with AIS with LVO receiving EVT within 24 hours from onset. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), one of the major extracellular matrix components of the glial scar that surrounds central nervous system (CNS) injuries, are known to inhibit the regeneration of neurons. This study investigated whether pleiotrophin (PTN), a growth factor upregulated during early CNS development, can overcome the inhibition mediated by CSPGs and promote the neurite outgrowth of neurons in vitro. The data showed that a CSPG matrix inhibited the outgrowth of neurites in primary cortical neuron cultures compared to a control matrix. PTN elicited a dose dependent increase in the neurite outgrowth even in the presence of the growth inhibitory CSPG matrix, with optimal growth at 15 ng mL-1 of PTN (114.8% of neuronal outgrowth relative to laminin control). The growth promoting effect of PTN was blocked by inhibition of the receptor anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) by alectinib in a dose dependent manner. Neurite outgrowth in the presence of this CSPG matrix was induced by activation of the protein kinase B (AKT) pathway, a key downstream mediator of ALK activation. This study identified PTN as a dose-dependent regulator of neurite outgrowth in primary cortical neurons cultured in the presence of a CSPG matrix, and identified ALK activation as a key driver of PTN-induced growth

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modulation of C5a-C5aR1 signaling alters the dynamics of AD progression</a></h4>

              
                Background: The complement system is part of the innate immune system that clears pathogens and cellular debris. In the healthy brain, complement influences neurodevelopment and neurogenesis, synaptic pruning, clearance of neuronal blebs, recruitment of phagocytes, and protects from pathogens. However, excessive downstream complement activation that leads to generation of C5a, and C5a engagement with its receptor C5aR1, instigates a feed-forward loop of inflammation, injury, and neuronal death, making C5aR1 a potential therapeutic target for neuroinflammatory disorders. C5aR1 ablation in the Arctic (Arc) model of Alzheimers disease protects against cognitive decline and neuronal injury without altering amyloid plaque accumulation. Methods: To elucidate the effects of C5a-C5aR1 signaling on AD pathology, we crossed Arc mice with a C5a overexpressing mouse (ArcC5a+) and tested hippocampal memory. RNA-seq was performed on hippocampus and cortex from Arc, ArcC5aR1KO, and ArcC5a+ mice at 2.7-10 months and age-matched controls to assess mechanisms involved in each system. Immunohistochemistry was used to probe for protein markers of microglia and astrocytes activation states. Results: ArcC5a+ mice had accelerated cognitive decline compared to Arc. Deletion of C5ar1 delayed or prevented the expression of some, but not all, AD-associated genes in the hippocampus and a subset of pan-reactive and A1 reactive astrocyte genes, indicating a separation between genes induced by amyloid plaques alone and those influenced by C5a-C5aR1 signaling. Biological processes associated with AD and AD mouse models, including inflammatory signaling, microglial cell activation, and astrocyte migration, were delayed in the ArcC5aR1KO hippocampus. Interestingly, C5a overexpression also delayed the increase of some AD-, complement-, and astrocyte-associated genes, suggesting the possible involvement of neuroprotective C5aR2. However, these pathways were enhanced in older ArcC5a+ mice compared to Arc. Immunohistochemistry confirmed that C5a-C5aR1 modulation in Arc mice delayed the increase in CD11c-positive microglia, while not affecting other pan-reactive microglial or astrocyte markers. Conclusion: C5a-C5aR1 signaling in AD largely exerts its effects by enhancing microglial activation pathways that accelerate disease progression. While C5a may have neuroprotective effects via C5aR2, engagement of C5a with C5aR1 is detrimental in AD models. These data support specific pharmacological inhibition of C5aR1 as a potential therapeutic strategy to treat AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inter-Individual Variability in Dorsal Stream Dynamics During Word Production</a></h4>

              
                The current standard model of language production involves a sensorimotor dorsal stream connecting areas in the temporo-parietal junction with those in the inferior frontal gyrus and lateral premotor cortex. These regions have been linked to various aspects of word production such as phonological processing or articulatory programming, primarily through neuropsychological and functional imaging group studies. Most if not all the theoretical descriptions of this model imply that the same network should be identifiable across individual speakers. We tested this hypothesis by quantifying the variability of activation observed across individuals within each dorsal stream anatomical region. This estimate was based on electrical activity recorded directly from the cerebral cortex with millisecond accuracy in awake epileptic patients clinically implanted with intracerebral depth electrodes for pre-surgical diagnosis. Each region's activity was quantified using two different metrics, intra-cerebral evoked related potentials and high gamma activity, at the level of the group, the individual, and the recording contact. Using picture naming task, the two metrics show simultaneous activation of parietal and frontal regions in line with models that posit interactive processing during word retrieval. They also reveal different levels of variability across brain regions and patients except in auditory and motor regions. The independence and non-uniformity of cortical activity according to the two metrics push the current model towards sub-second and sub-region explorations focused on individualized language speech production. Several hypotheses are considered for this within-region heterogeneity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Explaining flexible continuous speech comprehension from individual motor rhythms</a></h4>

              
                When speech is too fast, the tracking of the acoustic signal along the auditory pathway deteriorates, leading to suboptimal speech segmentation and decoding of speech information. Thus, speech comprehension is limited by the temporal constraints of the auditory system. Previous research suggests that individual differences in auditory-motor coupling strength might shape such temporal constraints. In two behavioral experiments, we characterize individual differences in the comprehension of naturalistic speech as function of the individual coupling strength between the auditory and motor systems, and the preferred frequencies of the systems. As expected, speech comprehension declined at higher rates. Importantly, both, higher auditory-motor coupling and higher spontaneous speech motor production rates were related to better speech-comprehension performance. Furthermore, performance increased with higher linguistic sentence predictability (using a recurrent neural network) -particularly at higher speech rates and for individuals with high auditory-motor coupling strength- and with participants' higher working memory capacity (Digit Span). These findings support the notion of an individual preferred auditory regime that allows for optimal auditory (speech) processing. Crucially, we provide evidence for a model that assigns a central role to motor-system-dependent individual flexibility in continuous speech comprehension.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Late maturation of executive control promotes conceptual development</a></h4>

              
                Control processes are critical for the generation of task-appropriate behaviour across cognitive domains, yet children have a long developmental period with reduced executive control. Traditionally, this is viewed as a negative but necessary consequence of the time taken to learn control processes and develop the prefrontal cortex. Here, we exploit a recent computational model of controlled semantic cognition to formally test an alternative (yet perhaps complementary) view that a developmental period without control promotes conceptual knowledge acquisition. Our simulations show that maturational delay and anatomical connectivity conspire to promote conceptual learning. Learning conceptual structure necessitates a connection from control to more peripheral regions rather than the deep multimodal hub. Delayed control speeds conceptual learning without compromising conceptual representations, particularly when control connects to intermediate layers. These results are counterintuitive as delayed control onset can produce overall faster mastery of controlled behaviours. To assess whether delayed semantic control is also observed over development, we conducted a meta-analysis of the classic triadic matching task where participants decide which of two options best matches a third. Matching can be based on taxonomic or thematic relations, and when these conflict, participants must use task context to determine which relation to choose - that is, they must exert semantic control. Children aged 2 have the representations to identify both relations when distractors are unrelated, but when relations conflict, they cannot use context to guide their choices. Context-sensitivity develops later than conceptual structure and shows large increases around 6, a critical time for executive function across domains.

	<p>(1) Background: Hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HSRT) and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibodies have been reported to have a promising survival benefit in recent studies. Anlotinib is a new oral VEGF receptor inhibitor. This report describes our experience using HSRT and anlotinib for recurrent glioblastoma (rGBM). (2) Methods: Between December 2019 and June 2020, rGBM patients were retrospectively analysed. Anlotinib was prescribed at 12 mg daily during HSRT. Adjuvant anlotinib was administered d1-14 every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) after salvage treatment, and toxicity. (3) Results: Five patients were enrolled. The prescribed dose was 25.0 Gy in 5 fractions. The median number of cycles of anlotinib was 21 (14&amp;amp;ndash;33). The ORR was 100%. Three (60%) patients had the best outcome of a partial response (PR), and 2 (40%) achieved a complete response (CR). One patient died of tumour progression at the last follow-up. Two patients had grade 2 hand-foot syndrome. (4) Conclusions: Salvage HSRT combined with anlotinib showed a favourable outcome and acceptable toxicity for rGBM. A prospective phase II study (NCT04197492) is ongoing to further investigate the regimen.</p>

	<p>Associative memory (AM) is the ability to remember the relationship between previously unrelated items. AM is significantly affected by normal aging and neurodegenerative conditions, thus there is a growing interest in applying non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques for AM enhancement. A growing body of studies identifies posterior parietal cortex (PPC) as the most promising cortical target for both transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) to modulate a cortico-hippocampal network that underlines AM. In that sense, theta frequency oscillatory tES protocols, targeted towards the hallmark oscillatory activity within the cortico-hippocampal network, are increasingly coming to prominence. To increase precision and effectiveness, the need for EEG guided individualization of the tES protocols is proposed. Here, we present the study protocol in which two types of personalized oscillatory tES&amp;amp;ndash;transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) and oscillatory transcranial direct current stimulation (otDCS), both frequency-modulated to the individual theta-band frequency (ITF), are compared to the non-oscillatory transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and to the sham stimulation. The study has cross-over design with four tES conditions (tACS, otDCS, tDCS, sham), and the comprehensive set of neurophysiological (resting state EEG and AM-evoked EEG) and behavioral outcomes, including AM tasks (short-term associative memory, face&amp;amp;ndash;word, face&amp;amp;ndash;object, object-location), as well as measures of other cognitive functions (cognitive control, verbal fluency, and working memory).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Afterhyperpolarization Promotes the Firing of Mitral Cells through a Voltage-Dependent Modification of Action Potential Threshold</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>In the olfactory bulb, mitral cells (MCs) display a spontaneous firing that is characterized by bursts of action potentials (APs) intermixed with silent periods. Intraburst firing frequency and duration are heterogeneous among MCs and increase with membrane depolarization. By using patch-clamp recording on rat slices, we dissected out the intrinsic properties responsible for this bursting activity. We showed that the threshold of AP generation dynamically changes as a function of the preceding trajectory of the membrane potential. In fact, the AP threshold became more negative when the membrane was hyperpolarized and had a recovery rate inversely proportional to the membrane repolarization rate. Such variations appeared to be produced by changes in the inactivation state of voltage-dependent Na<sup>+</sup> channels. Thus, AP initiation was favored by hyperpolarizing events, such as negative membrane oscillations or inhibitory synaptic input. After the first AP, the following fast afterhyperpolarization (AHP) brought the threshold to more negative values and then promoted the emission of the following AP. This phenomenon was repeated for each AP of the burst making the fast AHP a regenerative mechanism that sustained the firing, AHP with larger amplitudes and faster repolarizations being associated with larger and higher-frequency bursts. Burst termination was found to be because of the development of a slow repolarization component of the AHP (slow AHP). Overall, the AHP characteristics appeared as a major determinant of the bursting properties.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">A Novel Automated Approach for Improving Standardization of the Marble Burying Test Enables Quantification of Burying Bouts and Activity Characteristics</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The marble burying test is a commonly used paradigm to describe phenotypes in mouse models of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. The current methodological approach relies predominantly on reporting the number of buried marbles at the end of the test. By measuring the proxy of the behavior (buried marbles), many important characteristics regarding the temporal aspect of this assay are lost. Here, we introduce a novel, automated method to quantify mouse behavior during the marble burying test with the focus on the burying bouts and movement dynamics. Using open-source software packages, we trained a supervised machine learning algorithm (the "classifier") to distinguish burying behavior in freely moving mice. In order to confirm the classifier&rsquo;s accuracy and characterize burying events in high detail, we performed the marble burying test in three mouse models: <I>Ube3a<sup>m-/p+</sup> </I>[Angelman syndrome (AS) model], <I>Shank2</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> (autism model), and <I>Sapap3</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> [obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) model] mice. The classifier scored burying behavior accurately and consistent with the previously reported phenotype of the <I>Ube3a<sup>m-/p+</sup> </I>mice, which showed decreased levels of burying compared with controls. <I>Shank2</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice showed a similar pattern of decreased burying behavior, which was not found in <I>Sapap3</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice. Tracking mouse behavior throughout the test revealed hypoactivity in <I>Ube3a<sup>m-/p+</sup> </I>and hyperactivity in the <I>Shank2</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice, indicating that mouse activity is unrelated to burying behavior. Reducing activity with midazolam in <I>Shank2</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice did not alter the burying behavior. Together, we demonstrate that our classifier is an accurate method for the analysis of the marble burying test, providing more information than currently used methods.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Temporally and Spatially Localized PKA Activity within Learning and Memory Circuitry Regulated by Network Feedback</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Dynamic functional connectivity within brain circuits requires coordination of intercellular signaling and intracellular signal transduction. Critical roles for cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) signaling are well established in the <I>Drosophila</I> mushroom body (MB) learning and memory circuitry, but local PKA activity within this well-mapped neuronal network is uncharacterized. Here, we use an <I>in vivo</I> PKA activity sensor (PKA-SPARK) to test spatiotemporal regulatory requirements in the MB axon lobes. We find immature animals have little detectable PKA activity, whereas postcritical period adults show high field-selective activation primarily in just 3/16 defined output regions. In addition to the age-dependent PKA activity in distinct &alpha;&rsquo;/&beta;&rsquo; lobe nodes, females show sex-dependent elevation compared with males in these same restricted regions. Loss of neural cell body Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) and Rugose [human Neurobeachin (NBEA)] suppresses localized PKA activity, whereas overexpression (OE) of MB lobe PKA-synergist Meng-Po (human SBK1) promotes PKA activity. Elevated Meng-Po subverts the PKA age-dependence, with elevated activity in immature animals, and spatial-restriction, with striking  lobe activity. Testing circuit signaling requirements with temperature-sensitive <I>shibire</I> (human Dynamin) blockade, we find broadly expanded PKA activity within the MB lobes. Using transgenic tetanus toxin to block MB synaptic output, we find greatly heightened PKA activity in virtually all MB lobe fields, although the age-dependence is maintained. We conclude spatiotemporally restricted PKA activity signaling within this well-mapped learning/memory circuit is age-dependent and sex-dependent, driven by FMRP-Rugose pathway activation, temporally promoted by Meng-Po kinase function, and restricted by output neurotransmission providing network feedback.</p>

The large taxonomic variability of microbial community composition is a consequence of the combination of environmental variability, mediated through ecological interactions, and stochasticity. Most of the analysis aiming to infer the biological factors determining this difference in community structure start by quantifying how much communities are similar in their composition, trough beta-diversity metrics. The central role that these metrics play in microbial ecology does not parallel with a quantitative understanding of their relationships and statistical properties. In particular, we lack a framework that reproduces the empirical statistical properties of beta-diversity metrics. Here we take a macroecological approach and introduce a model to reproduce the statistical properties of community similarity. The model is based on the statistical properties of individual communities and on a single tunable parameter, the correlation of species’ carrying capacities across communities, which sets the difference of two communities. The model reproduces quantitatively the empirical values of several commonly-used beta-diversity metrics, as well as the relationships between them. In particular, this modeling framework naturally reproduces the negative correlation between overlap and dissimilarity, which has been observed in both empirical and experimental communities and previously related to the existence of universal features of community dynamics. In this framework, such correlation naturally emerges due to the effect of random sampling.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modelling the interaction between stem cells derived cardiomyocytes patches and host myocardium to aid non-arrhythmic engineered heart tissue design</a></h4>

Application of epicardial patches constructed from human-induced pluripotent stem cell- derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) has been proposed as a long-term therapy to treat scarred hearts post myocardial infarction (MI). Understanding electrical interaction between engineered heart tissue patches (EHT) and host myocardium represents a key step toward a successful patch engraftment. EHT retain different electrical properties with respect to the host heart tissue due to the hiPSC-CMs immature phenotype, which may lead to increased arrhythmia risk. We developed a modelling framework to examine the influence of patch design on electrical activation at the engraftment site. We performed an in-silico investigation of different patch design approaches to restore pre-MI activation properties and evaluated the associated arrhythmic risk. We developed an <i>in silico</i> cardiac electrophysiology model of a transmural cross section of host myocardium. The model featured an infarct region, an epicardial patch spanning the infarct region and a bath region. The patch is modelled as a layer of hiPSC-CM, combined with a layer of conductive polymer (CP). Tissue and patch geometrical dimensions and conductivities were incorporated through 10 modifiable model parameters. We validated our model against 4 independent experimental studies and showed that it can qualitatively reproduce their findings. We performed a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) to isolate the most important parameters, showing that the stimulus propagation is mainly governed by the scar depth, radius and conductivity when the scar is not transmural, and by the EHT patch conductivity when the scar is transmural. We assessed the relevance of small animal studies to humans by comparing simulations of rat, rabbit and human myocardium. We found that stimulus propagation paths and GSA sensitivity indices are consistent across species. We explored which EHT design variables have the potential to restore physiological propagation. Simulations predict that increasing EHT conductivity from 0.28 to 1–1.1 S/m recovered physiological activation in rat, rabbit and human. Finally, we assessed arrhythmia risk related to increasing EHT conductivity and tested increasing the EHT Na<sup>+</sup> channel density as an alternative strategy to match healthy activation. Our results revealed a greater arrhythmia risk linked to increased EHT conductivity compared to increased Na<sup>+</sup> channel density. We demonstrated that our modeling framework could capture the interaction between host and EHT patches observed in <i>in vitro</i> experiments. We showed that large (patch and tissue dimensions) and small (cardiac myocyte electrophysiology) scale differences between small animals and humans do not alter EHT patch effect on infarcted tissue. Our model revealed that only when the scar is transmural do EHT properties impact activation times and isolated the EHT conductivity as the main parameter influencing propagation. We predicted that restoring physiological activation by tuning EHT conductivity is possible but may promote arrhythmic behavior. Finally, our model suggests that acting on hiPSC-CMs low action potential upstroke velocity and lack of I<sub>K1</sub> may restore pre-MI activation while not promoting arrhythmia.
