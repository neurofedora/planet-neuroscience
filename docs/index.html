<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2: SARS-CoV-2), which originated from Wuhan, China, has spread to the other countries in a short period of time. We report a 47-year-old male who was admitted to our hospital due to suffering from progressive vertigo and ataxia for 7 days prior to the admission. Neurological examination revealed cerebellar dysfunction, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) depicted edema of the cerebellar hemisphere associated with leptomeningeal enhancement. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed mild lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, and lactate dehydrogenase. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal and CSF specimens. As a result, treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir was initiated, and patient symptoms and signs improved significantly during the course of hospitalization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of acute cerebellitis associated with COVID-19 disease which is reported in the literature so far.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Crossed cerebellar diaschisis (CCD) can be associated with impaired cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) and poor clinical outcome, but whether this holds true for patients with diffuse glioma is unknown. With blood oxygenation level–dependent (BOLD)-CVR imaging, we determined the presence of CCD in patients with diffuse glioma and investigated its relationship with cerebrovascular reactivity and clinical outcome. For eighteen enrolled subjects (nineteen datasets) with diffuse glioma, CCD was deferred from BOLD-CVR using a predetermined cerebellar asymmetry index (CAI) cutoff value of 6.0%. A FET-PET study was done as a verification of the CCD diagnosis. BOLD-CVR values as well as clinical performance scores (i.e., Karnofsky performance score (KPS), disability rating scale (DRS), and modified Rankin scale (mRS)) by BOLD-CVR scan at 3-month clinical follow-up were assessed and compared for the CCD-positive and CCD-negative group. CCD was present in 26.3% of subjects and strongly associated with impaired BOLD-CVR of the affected (i.e., the hemisphere harboring the glioma) and unaffected supratentorial hemisphere (CCD(+) vs. CCD(−): 0.08 ± 0.11 vs. 0.18 ± 0.04; <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.007 and 0.08 ± 0.12 vs. 0.19 ± 0.04; <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.007, respectively). This finding was independent of tumor volume (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.48). Furthermore, poorer initial (by scan) clinical performance scores at follow-up were found for the CCD(+) group. The presence of crossed cerebellar diaschisis in patients with diffuse glioma is associated with impaired supratentorial cerebrovascular reactivity and worse clinical outcome.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is primarily characterized by migraine, stroke, mood disturbances, and cognitive decline. Ataxia has seldom been reported as a presenting symptom. Here, we review reports of CADASIL presenting as ataxia and compare these to the first pathologically confirmed case of CADASIL presenting with progressive ataxia. A 50-year-old woman presented with progressive truncal ataxia. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed white matter hyperintensities in the bilateral anterior temporal lobes, external capsules, and periventricular areas, but not the cerebellum. Electron microscopy of skin biopsy material revealed multiple granular osmiophilic materials. Genetic testing confirmed a c.4552C &gt; A mutation in exon 25 of the <em class="a-plus-plus">NOTCH3</em> gene. CADASIL is a rare cause of progressive ataxia, and only four cases of CADASIL presenting with ataxia have been reported in the literature. We also discuss the possible pathophysiology of cerebellar ataxia associated with CADASIL.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Balance control is essential to maintain a stable body position and to prevent falls. The aim of this study was to determine whether balance control could be improved by using cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and visual feedback in a combined approach. A total of 90 healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to six groups defined by the delivery of tDCS (cathodal or anodal or sham) and the provision or not of visual feedback on balance during the acquisition phase. tDCS was delivered over the cerebellar hemisphere ipsilateral to the dominant leg for 20 min at 2 mA during a unipedal stance task. Body sway (i.e., ankle angle and hip position) was measured as an overall maximal unit in anteroposterior and mediolateral direction, together with participant rating of perception of stability, before (baseline), during (acquisition), and after (final) the intervention. We found a reduction in body sway during the acquisition session when visual feedback alone was provided. When the visual feedback was removed (final session), however, body sway increased above baseline. Differently, the reduction in overall maximal body sway was maintained during the final session when the delivery of cathodal tDCS and visual feedback was combined. These findings suggest that cathodal tDCS may support the short-term maintenance of the positive effects of visual feedback on balance and provide the basis for a new approach to optimize balance control, with potential translational implications for the elderly and patients with impaired posture control.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Predictive coding accounts of action perception sustain that kinematics information is compared with contextual top-down predictions (i.e., priors) to understand actions in conditions of perceptual ambiguity. It has been previously shown that the cerebellum contributes to motor simulation of observed actions. Here, we tested the hypothesis that a specific contribution of the cerebellum to action perception is to provide contextual priors that guide the sampling of perceptual kinematic information. To this aim, we compared the performance of 42 patients with childhood brain tumor affecting infratentorial (ITT) or supratentorial (STT) areas with that of peers with typical development in an action prediction task. First, participants were exposed to videos depicting a child performing different reaching-to-grasp actions, which were associated with contextual cues in a probabilistic fashion. Then, they were presented with shortened versions of the same videos and asked to infer the action outcome; since kinematics was ambiguous, we expected their responses would be biased toward the previously learned contextual priors. We found that patients with brain tumor were impaired in predicting actions when compared to healthy controls. However, STT patients presented a reliable probabilistic effect, while ITT patients, who had cerebellar damage, did not rely on contextual priors in predicting actions. Furthermore, we found an association between the use of contextual priors and the ability to infer others’ mental states as assessed by a standardized test. These results suggest that the cerebellum provides contextual priors to understand others’ actions and this predictive function might underlie complex social cognition abilities.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is caused by unstable expanded CAG repeats (expCAGs) in <em class="a-plus-plus">ATXN3</em>. Factors associated with intergenerational instability (delta-expCAG) and genetic anticipation in SCA3 have never been reported in Chinese mainland. Here, we demonstrated that unstable transmissions occurred more often in sons than in daughters (91% vs 72%, Fisher’s exact test, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.012). The extended delta-expCAG of father-son transmissions was greater than that of mother-son transmissions (3.8 ± 2.3 repeats vs 1.6 ± 1.0 repeats, Mann-Whitney <em class="a-plus-plus">U</em>, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.001). Genetic anticipation was frequently observed between generations but not affected by the delta-expCAG.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Difficulties in gait and balance disorders are among the most common mobility limitations in multiple sclerosis (MS), mainly due to a damage of cerebellar circuits. Moreover, the cerebellum plays a critical role in promoting new motor tasks, which is an essential function for neurorehabilitation. In this study, we investigated the effects of cerebellar intermittent theta burst stimulation (c-iTBS), a high-frequency rTMS protocol able to increase cerebellar activity, on gait and balance in a sample of 20 hospitalized participants with MS, undergoing vestibular rehabilitation (VR), an exercise-based program primarily designed to reduce vertigo and dizziness, gaze instability, and/or imbalance and falls in MS. Patients were assigned to receive either c-iTBS or sham iTBS before being treated with VR during 2 weeks. VR consisted of two types of training: gaze stability and postural stability exercises. The primary outcome measure was the change from baseline in the Tinetti Balance and Gait scale (TBG). The secondary outcome measures were changes from baseline in Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Two Minute Walking Test (2MWT), and Timed 25-ft walk test (T25FW) scales. MS patients treated with c-iTBS-VR showed a significant improvement in the TBG as compared to patients treated with sham iTBS-VR. Moreover, MS patients in the c-iTBS groups showed better performances in the vestibular-ocular reflex exercises. Combined c-iTBS and VR improves gait and balance abilities more than standard VR treatment in MS patients with a high level of disability.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Response inhibition as an executive function refers to the ability to suppress inappropriate but prepotent responses. Several brain regions have been implicated in the process underlying inhibitory control, including the cerebellum. The aim of the present study was to explore the role of the cerebellum in executive functioning, particularly in response inhibition. For this purpose, we transitorily inhibited cerebellar activity by means of cathodal tDCS and studied the effects of this inhibition on ERP components elicited during a Go/NoGo task in healthy subjects. Sixteen healthy subjects underwent a Go/NoGo task prior to and after cathodal and sham cerebellar tDCS in separate sessions. A reduction in N2-NoGo amplitude and a prolongation in N2-NoGo latency emerged after cathodal tDCS whereas no differences were detected after sham stimulation. Moreover, commission errors in NoGo trials were significantly higher after cathodal tDCS than at the basal evaluation. No differences emerged between performances in Go trials and those after sham stimulation. These data indicate that cerebellar inhibition following cathodal stimulation alters the ability to allocate attentional resources to stimuli containing conflict information and the inhibitory control. The cerebellum may regulate the attentional mechanisms of stimulus orientation and inhibitory control both directly, by making predictions of errors or behaviors related to errors, and indirectly, by controlling the functioning of the cerebral cortical areas involved in the perception of conflict signals and of the basal ganglia involved in the inhibitory control of movement.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Two recent studies have demonstrated that the dendritic Ca<sup class="a-plus-plus">2+</sup> signal associated with a climbing fibre (CF) input to the cerebellar Purkinje neuron (PN) depends on the membrane potential (<em class="a-plus-plus">V</em><sub class="a-plus-plus">m</sub>). Specifically, when the cell is hyperpolarised, this signal is mediated by T-type voltage-gated Ca<sup class="a-plus-plus">2+</sup> channels; in contrast, when the cell is firing, the CF-PN signal is mediated by P/Q-type voltage-gated Ca<sup class="a-plus-plus">2+</sup> channels.

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">The objective of this study was to investigate lobule-specific cerebellar structural alterations relevant to clinical behavioral characteristics of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). We performed a case-control study of 21 Japanese individuals with PWS (age; median 21.0, range 13–50 years, 14 males, 7 females) and 40 age- and sex-matched healthy controls with typical development. Participants underwent 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging. Three-dimensional T<sub class="a-plus-plus">1</sub>-weighted images were assessed for cerebellar lobular volume and adjusted for total intracerebellar volume (TIV) using a spatially unbiased atlas template to give a relative volume ratio. A region of interest analysis included the deep cerebellar nuclei. A correlation analysis was performed between the volumetric data and the clinical behavioral scores derived from the standard questionnaires (hyperphagia, autism, obsession, and maladaptive index) for global intelligence assessment in paired subgroups. In individuals with PWS, TIV was significantly reduced compared with that of controls (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.05, family-wise error corrected; mean [standard deviation], 1014.1 [93.0] mm<sup class="a-plus-plus">3</sup>). Decreased relative lobular volume ratios were observed in posterior inferior lobules with age, sex, and TIV as covariates (Crus I, Crus II, lobules VIIb, VIIIa, VIIIb, and IX). However, increased ratios were found in the dentate nuclei bilaterally in individuals with PWS (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.01); the mean (standard deviation) × 10<sup class="a-plus-plus">−3</sup> was as follows: left, 1.58 (0.26); right, 1.67 (0.30). The altered lobular volume ratios showed negative correlations with hyperphagic and autistic characteristics and positive correlations with obsessive and intellectual characteristics. This study provides the first objective evidence of topographic patterns of volume differences in cerebellar structures consistent with clinical behavioral characteristics in individuals with PWS and strongly suggests a cerebellar contribution to altered functional brain connectivity in PWS.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Reading in children has been associated with microstructural properties of the cerebellar peduncles, the white matter pathways connecting the cerebellum to the cerebrum. In this study, we used two independent neuroimaging modalities to assess which features of the cerebellar peduncles would be associated with reading. Twenty-three 8-year-old children were evaluated on word reading efficiency and imaged using diffusion MRI (dMRI) and quantitative T1 relaxometry (qT1). We segmented the superior (SCP), middle, and inferior cerebellar peduncles and extracted two metrics: fractional anisotropy (FA) from dMRI and R1 from qT1. Tract-FA was significantly correlated with tract-R1 in left and right SCPs (left: <em class="a-plus-plus">r</em><sub class="a-plus-plus"><em class="a-plus-plus">P</em></sub>(21) = .63, right: <em class="a-plus-plus">r</em><sub class="a-plus-plus"><em class="a-plus-plus">P</em></sub>(21) = .76, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> ≤ .001) suggesting that FA of these peduncles, at least in part, indexed myelin content. Tract-FA and tract R1 were not correlated in the other cerebellar peduncles. Reading efficiency negatively correlated with tract-FA of the left (<em class="a-plus-plus">r</em><sub class="a-plus-plus"><em class="a-plus-plus">P</em></sub>(21) = − .43, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = .040) and right SCP (<em class="a-plus-plus">r</em><sub class="a-plus-plus"><em class="a-plus-plus">P</em></sub>(21) = − .37, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = .079). Reading efficiency did not correlate with tract-R1 in the SCPs. The negative association of reading efficiency with tract-FA and the lack of association of reading efficiency with tract-R1 implicate properties other than myelin content as relevant to the information flow between the cerebellum and the cerebrum for individual differences in reading skills in children.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Essential tremor (ET) has recently been reconceptualized by many as a degenerative disease of the cerebellum. Until now, though, there has been no attempt to frame it within the context of these diseases. Here, we compare the clinical and postmortem features of ET with other cerebellar degenerations, thereby placing it within the broader context of these diseases. Action tremor is the hallmark feature of ET. Although often underreported in the spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), action tremors occur, and it is noteworthy that in SCA12 and 15, they are highly prevalent, often severe, and can be the earliest disease manifestation, resulting in an initial diagnosis of ET in many cases. Intention tremor, sometimes referred to as “cerebellar tremor,” is a common feature of ET and many SCAs. Other features of cerebellar dysfunction, gait ataxia and eye motion abnormalities, are seen to a mild degree in ET and more markedly in SCAs. Several SCAs (e.g., SCA5, 6, 14, and 15), like ET, follow a milder and more protracted disease course. In ET, numerous postmortem changes have been localized to the cerebellum and are largely confined to the cerebellar cortex, preserving the cerebellar nuclei. Purkinje cell loss is modest. Similarly, in SCA3, 12, and 15, Purkinje cell loss is limited, and in SCA12 and 15, there is preservation of cerebellar nuclei and relative sparing of other central nervous system regions. Both clinically and pathologically, there are numerous similarities and intersection points between ET and other disorders of cerebellar degeneration.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels contribute to the resting membrane potential of many neurons and play an important role in controlling neuronal excitability. Although previous studies have revealed a high expression of GIRK subunits in the cerebellum, their functional role has never been clearly described. Using patch-clamp recordings in mice cerebellar slices, we examined the properties of the GIRK currents in Purkinje cells (PCs) and investigated the effects of a selective agonist of GIRK1-containing channels, ML297 (ML), on PC firing and synaptic plasticity. We demonstrated that GIRK channel activation decreases the PC excitability by inhibiting both sodium and calcium spikes and, in addition, modulates the complex spike response evoked by climbing fiber stimulation. Our results indicate that GIRK channels have also a marked effect on synaptic plasticity of the parallel fiber-PC synapse, as the application of ML297 increased the expression of LTP while preventing LTD. We, therefore, propose that the recruitment of GIRK channels represents a crucial mechanism by which neuromodulators can control synaptic strength and membrane conductance for proper refinement of the neural network involved in memory storage and higher cognitive functions.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Cerebellar involvement in major depressive disorder (MDD) has been demonstrated by a growing number of studies, but it is unknown whether cognitive functioning in depressed individuals is related to cerebellar gray matter volume (GMV) abnormalities. Impaired attention and executive dysfunction are characteristic cognitive deficits in MDD, and critically, they often persist despite remission of mood symptoms. In this study, we investigated cerebellar GMV in patients with remitted MDD (rMDD) that showed persistent cognitive impairment. We applied cerebellum-optimized voxel-based morphometry in 37 patients with rMDD and with cognitive deficits, in 12 patients with rMDD and without cognitive deficits, and in 36 healthy controls (HC). Compared with HC, rMDD patients with cognitive deficits had lower GMV in left area VIIA, crus II, and in vermal area VIIB. In patients with rMDD, regression analyses demonstrated significant associations between GMV reductions in both regions and impaired attention and executive dysfunction. Compared with HC, patients without cognitive deficits showed increased GMV in bilateral area VIIIB. This study supports cerebellar contributions to the cognitive dimension of MDD. The data also point towards cerebellar area VII as a potential target for non-invasive brain stimulation to treat cognitive deficits related to MDD.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">The traditional view on the cerebellum is that it controls motor behavior. Although recent work has revealed that the cerebellum supports also nonmotor functions such as cognition and affect, only during the last 5 years it has become evident that the cerebellum also plays an important social role. This role is evident in social cognition based on interpreting goal-directed actions through the movements of individuals (social “mirroring”) which is very close to its original role in motor learning, as well as in social understanding of other individuals’ mental state, such as their intentions, beliefs, past behaviors, future aspirations, and personality traits (social “mentalizing”). Most of this mentalizing role is supported by the posterior cerebellum (e.g., Crus I and II). The most dominant hypothesis is that the cerebellum assists in learning and understanding social action sequences, and so facilitates social cognition by supporting optimal predictions about imminent or future social interaction and cooperation. This consensus paper brings together experts from different fields to discuss recent efforts in understanding the role of the cerebellum in social cognition, and the understanding of social behaviors and mental states by others, its effect on clinical impairments such as cerebellar ataxia and autism spectrum disorder, and how the cerebellum can become a potential target for noninvasive brain stimulation as a therapeutic intervention. We report on the most recent empirical findings and techniques for understanding and manipulating cerebellar circuits in humans. Cerebellar circuitry appears now as a key structure to elucidate social interactions.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a multifactorial disorder caused by environmental and genetic factors. Studies have shown that various single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the binding sites of microRNAs contribute to the risk of developing SCZ. We aimed to investigate whether the variants located in the 3′-UTR region of <em class="a-plus-plus">LIF</em> (rs929271T&gt;G) and <em class="a-plus-plus">ATF6B</em> (rs8283G&gt;A) were associated with increased susceptibility to SCZ in a population from the south-east of Iran. In this case-control study, a total of 396 subjects were recruited. SNPs were genotyped via polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Genotyping results showed that the G allele of rs929271 significantly increased the risk of SCZ (OR = 1.58 95%CI = 1.19–2.10, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.001). As for rs929271, the GG genotype of co-dominant (OR = 2.54 95%CI = 1.39–4.64, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.002) and recessive (OR = 2.91 95%CI = 1.77–4.80, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> &lt; 0.001) models were strongly linked to SCZ. No significant differences were observed between rs8283 polymorphism and predisposition to SCZ. In silico analyses predicted that rs929271 might alter the binding sites of microRNAs, which was believed to have an unclear role in the development of SCZ. Moreover, rs929271 polymorphism changed the <em class="a-plus-plus">LIF</em>-mRNA folding structure. These findings provide fine pieces of evidence regarding the possible effects of <em class="a-plus-plus">LIF</em> polymorphism in the development of SCZ and regulation of the <em class="a-plus-plus">LIF</em> gene targeted by microRNAs.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus"><em class="a-plus-plus">TBL1XR1</em> is a member of the WD40 repeat-containing gene family. Mutations of <em class="a-plus-plus">TBL1XR1</em> have been reported in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Although the phenotypes of some patients have been described in single studies, few studies have reviewed the genotype and phenotype relationships using a relatively large cohort of patients with <em class="a-plus-plus">TBL1XR1</em> mutations. Herein, we report a new de novo frameshift mutation in <em class="a-plus-plus">TBL1XR1</em> (NM_024665.4, c.388_389delAC, p.T130Sfs*14) in a patient with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To explore the correlations between genotypes and phenotypes for <em class="a-plus-plus">TBL1XR1</em> in NDDs, we manually curated and analyzed 38 variants and the associated phenotypes from 50 individuals with NDDs. <em class="a-plus-plus">TBL1XR1</em> mutations lead to a wide range of phenotypic defects. We conclude that the most common phenotypes associated with <em class="a-plus-plus">TBL1XR1</em> mutations were language and motor developmental delay, intellectual disabilities, facial deformity, hypotonia, and microcephaly. Our study provides a comprehensive spectrum of neurodevelopmental phenotypes caused by <em class="a-plus-plus">TBL1XR1</em> mutations, which is important for genetic diagnosis and precision clinical management.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is an X-linked recessive disease that causes acute or chronic hemolytic anemia and potentially leads to severe jaundice in response to oxidative agents. Capicua transcriptional repressor (CIC) is an important gene associated with mental retardation, autosomal dominant 45. Affiliated tissues including skin, brain, bone, and related phenotypes are intellectual disability and seizures. Clinical, biochemical, and whole exome analysis are carried out in a Turkish family. Mutation analysis of G6PD and CIC genes by Sanger sequencing in the whole family was carried out to reveal the effect of these mutations on the patient’s clinical outcome. Here, we present the case of epilepsy in an 8-year-old child with a hemizygous variation in G6PD gene and heterozygous mutation in CIC gene, resulting in focal epileptiform activity and hypsarrhythmia in electroencephalography (EEG), seizures, psychomotor retardation, speech impairment, intellectual disability, developmental regression, and learning difficulties. Whole exome sequencing confirmed the diagnosis of X-linked increased susceptibility for hemolytic anemia due to G6PD deficiency and mental retardation type 45 due to CIC variant, which explained the development of epileptic seizures. Considering CIC variant and relevant relation with the severity and course of the disease, G6PD mutations sustained through the family are defined as hereditary. Our findings could represent the importance of variants found in G6PD as well as CIC genes linked to the severity of epilepsy, which was presumed based on the significant changes in protein configuration.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Ketamine is a recreational drug that causes emotional and cognitive impairments, but its specific mechanisms of action are still unclear. Recent evidence suggests that Tau protein phosphorylation and targeted delivery to the postsynaptic area are closely related to its neurotoxicity, and our recent studies have shown that long-term ketamine administration causes excessive Tau protein phosphorylation. However, the regulatory mechanism of Tau protein phosphorylation induced by ketamine has not been clarified. In the present study, we administered a single ketamine injection and long-term (6 months) ketamine injections in C57BL/6 mice, to investigate the effects of different doses of ketamine on the expression levels of Tau protein and its phosphorylation, the expression levels and activities of the related protein phosphokinases GSK-3β and CDK5, and the expression levels and activities of the related protein phosphatases PP2A and PP2B in the mouse hippocampus. Our results showed that both single-dose and long-term ketamine administration induced excessive phosphorylation of the Tau protein at ser202/thr205 and ser396. A single ketamine administration caused an increase in the activity of GSK-3β (at high doses) and a decrease in the activity of PP2A. On the other hand, long-term ketamine administration resulted in an increase in the activities of GSK-3β (at high doses) and CDK5, and a decrease in the activity of PP2A. Our results indicate that GSK-3β, CDK5, and PP2A may be involved in ketamine-induced Tau protein phosphorylation.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">To understand the effect of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-SIRT1 (silent information regulator 1)-PPARγ coactivator-1α (PGC1α) signaling pathway on the cognitive function of sevoflurane-anesthetized aged rats. Aged rats were divided into Normal group, Sevo group (Sevoflurane anesthesia), Sevo + AICAR (the AMPK activator) group, Sevo + EX527 group (the AMPK inhibitor), and Sevo + AICAR + EX527 group. The cognitive function of rats was determined by the Morris water maze. Hippocampal neuronal apoptosis was evaluated by TUNEL and Fluoro-Jade C (FJC) staining, and the expression of cleaved caspase-3 was detected by immunohistochemistry. ROS, SOD, and MDA levels and the fluorescence intensity of GFAP in the hippocampus were assayed. The mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), mitochondrial mass, ATP level, and the expression of AMPK-SIRT1-PGC1α were determined by the corresponding methods. Rats in the Sevo group manifested significant extension in the escape latency, with fewer platform crossings; and meanwhile, the apoptotic rate, the number of FJC-positive cells, and the fluorescence intensity of GFAP of neurons were elevated, with up-regulation of cleaved caspase-3. Moreover, the level of MDA and ROS was increased evidently, with significant down-regulation of SOD activity, ATP, mitochondrial mass and MMP levels, and AMPK, SIRT1 and PGC-1α protein expressions. However, sevoflurane-induced changes above were improved after the administration of AICAR, and EX527 could reverse AICAR-induced improvements in Sevo-anesthetized aged rats. Activating AMPK-SIRT1-PGC1α pathway can improve the cognitive function and mitigate the neuronal injury in Sevo-anesthetized aged rats by antagonizing the oxidative stress and maintaining the mitochondrial function.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Sepsis can induce acute and chronic changes in the central nervous system termed sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE). Not only cognitive deficits but also anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder are common in severe sepsis survivors. In this study, we demonstrated that amitriptyline, a classic tricyclic antidepressant, reduced sepsis-induced brain damage through the tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) signaling pathway. Amitriptyline ameliorated neuronal loss assessed by Nissl staining in a mouse cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)–induced sepsis model. Furthermore, amitriptyline reduced early gliosis assessed by immunofluorescence and late cognitive deficits assessed by the Morris water maze (MWM) test. Moreover, amitriptyline treatment attenuated oxidative stress indicated by less superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity consumption and malondialdehyde (MDA) accumulation. Interestingly, those protective effects of amitriptyline could be abolished by GW441756, a TrkA signaling pathway inhibitor. Immunoblot directly showed that TrkA signaling pathway–associated proteins, such as Akt and GSK3β, were involved in the neuroprotective effects of amitriptyline. Thus, amitriptyline appears to be an encouraging candidate to treat cognitive deficits and depression after severe sepsis.</p>

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Endothelial dysfunction greatly contributes to microcirculation disorder. The role of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) in cerebral microcirculation was explored in vitro. LPS (0.5 or 1 μg/ml) was added to induce injury in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HCMEC/D3). CCK-8 was applied to check viabilities of HCMEC/D3 before and after LPS treatment. Western blot witnessed the changes in protein expressions of inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and TNF-α. Caspase-3/7 activity was analyzed and so were the protein expressions of pro-apoptotic gene BAX and anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2. mRNA expressions of eNOS and GTPCH1 were evaluated by RT-qPCR. After overexpressing eNOS or GTPCH1 in LPS-induced HCMEC/D3 cells, viabilities, inflammatory cytokines, caspase-3/7 activity, and apoptosis-related genes were detected. The modulation of PGE1 in eNOS and GTPCH1 production, viability, inflammation, and apoptosis was investigated. The inhibitor of eNOS or GTPCH1 was introduced to examine impacts of eNOS or GTPCH1 could have on the PGE1 function. LPS decreased cell viabilities, eNOS and GTPCH1 expression, and promoted inflammation and apoptosis in HCMEC/D3 cells. Overexpressed eNOS or GTPCH1 promoted cell viabilities and suppressed inflammation and apoptosis. PGE1 enhanced viability and decreased inflammation and apoptosis in cells treated by LPS. PGE1 activated eNOS and GTPCH1 and inhibition of eNOS or GTPCH1 led to the attenuation of the protective functions of PGE1 in LPS-induced cells. PGE1 protected HCMEC/D3 cells from injuries induced by LPS by activation of eNOS and GTPCH1, suggesting that PGE1 might be used to help maintain cerebral microcirculation in future.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Oxidative stress is the core problem in improving secondary spinal cord injury (SCI). To investigate the effect of electro-acupuncture with different frequencies on neuroinflammation, oxidative stress injury, as well as related signaling pathways, male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were induced using operation for model SCI and then treated with electrical stimulation at low frequency (2 mA, 0.2 Hz), medium frequency (2 mA, 50 Hz), and high frequency (2 mA, 100 Hz), respectively. Here, we first demonstrated that the JNK/p66<sup class="a-plus-plus">Shc</sup> signal pathway promoted ROS generation and inhibited the anti-oxidation effect of FoxO3a to induce oxidative stress damage after SCI and the mechanism of electro-acupuncture in anti-oxidative stress. Electro-acupuncture facilitated functional recovery after SCI and improved the apoptosis of neurons. Furthermore, p38MAPK-mediated microglia activation and inflammatory reaction and JNK/p66<sup class="a-plus-plus">Shc</sup>-mediated ROS generation and oxidative stress damage were both attenuated by electro-acupuncture. However, the inhibitory effect of electro-acupuncture on p38MAPK was enslaved to the acupuncture frequency, but the ROS generation and phosphorylation of p66<sup class="a-plus-plus">Shc</sup> were effectively inhibited by electro-acupuncture. Therefore, the activation of JNK/p66<sup class="a-plus-plus">Shc</sup> promoted the ROS-induced oxidative stress damage after SCI, and inhibiting the phosphorylation of p66<sup class="a-plus-plus">Shc</sup>-mediated oxidative stress was the key target of electro-acupuncture to facilitate functional recovery SCI, but not p38MAPK.</p>

Building and maintaining neuronal networks and cognitive functions require mRNA localization and regulated protein synthesis in neurons. RNA modification N6-methyl-adenosine (m6A) has recently been shown in axonal and synaptically localized mRNAs whose local activity is required for axon growth, synaptogenesis, and neuronal plasticity. However, no cellular pathways engaging local epitranscriptomic modulation are known to underlie these post-mitotic neuronal functions. Now we report that cytoplasmic m6A reader YTHDF1 is enriched in neurons and required for axonal, dendritic, and spine development. We show that m6A and YTHDF1 are part of a microtubule plus-end associated RNA granule that contains extensive networks of mRNAs organized by autism risk gene adenomatous polyposis coli (APC). Disrupting m6A signals by knocking down methyltransferase METTL14 or YTHDF1, or overexpressing autism or schizophrenia-associated missense mutations I311V or S399L in human METTL14, reduce expression of APC granule and tubulin, disrupt microtubule assembly and function. These results reveal a novel neuronal subcellular locus for epitranscriptomic regulation to promote post-mitotic neurodevelopment.

Developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEE) are characterized by pharmacoresistant seizures with concomitant intellectual disability. Epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures (EIMFS) is one of the most severe of these syndromes. De novo mutations in ion channels, including gain-of-function variants in KCNT1, have been found to play a major role in the etiology of EIMFS. Here, we test a potential precision therapeutic approach in KCNT1-associated DEE using a gene silencing antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) approach. The homozygous p.P924L (L/L) mouse model recapitulates the frequent, debilitating seizures and developmental compromise that are seen in patients. After a single intracerebroventricular bolus injection of a Kcnt1 gapmer ASO in symptomatic mice at postnatal day 40, seizure frequency was significantly reduced, behavioral abnormalities improved, and overall survival was extended compared to mice treated with a control ASO (non-hybridizing sequence). ASO administration at neonatal age was also well-tolerated and effective in controlling seizures and extending the lifespan of treated animals. The data presented here provides a proof of concept for ASO-based gene silencing as a promising therapeutic approach in KCNT1-associated epilepsies.

<p>by Enrica Bianchi, Gavin J. Wright</p>

Sexual reproduction is such a successful way of creating progeny with subtle genetic variations that the vast majority of eukaryotic species use it. In mammals, it involves the formation of highly specialised cells: the sperm in males and the egg in females, each carrying the genetic inheritance of an individual. The interaction of sperm and egg culminates with the fusion of their cell membranes, triggering the molecular events that result in the formation of a new genetically distinct organism. Although we have a good cellular description of fertilisation in mammals, many of the molecules involved remain unknown, and especially the identity and role of cell surface proteins that are responsible for sperm–egg recognition, binding, and fusion. Here, we will highlight and discuss these gaps in our knowledge and how the role of some recently discovered sperm cell surface and secreted proteins contribute to our understanding of this fundamental process.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/EZvRCrmjJ6E" width="1" />

Metabolic reprogramming to fulfill the biosynthetic and bioenergetic demands of cancer cells has aroused great interest in recent years. However, metabolic reprogramming for cancer metastasis has not been well elucidated. Here, we screened a subpopulation of breast cancer cells with highly metastatic capacity to the lung in mice and investigated the metabolic alternations by analyzing the metabolome and the transcriptome, which were confirmed in breast cancer cells, mouse models, and patients’ tissues. The effects and the mechanisms of nucleotide de novo synthesis in cancer metastasis were further evaluated in vitro and in vivo. In our study, we report an increased nucleotide de novo synthesis as a key metabolic hallmark in metastatic breast cancer cells and revealed that enforced nucleotide de novo synthesis was enough to drive the metastasis of breast cancer cells. An increased key metabolite of de novo synthesis, guanosine-5'-triphosphate (GTP), is able to generate more cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) to activate cGMP-dependent protein kinases PKG and downstream MAPK pathway, resulting in the increased tumor cell stemness and metastasis. Blocking de novo synthesis by silencing phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase 2 (PRPS2) can effectively decrease the stemness of breast cancer cells and reduce the lung metastasis. More interestingly, in breast cancer patients, the level of plasma uric acid (UA), a downstream metabolite of purine, is tightly correlated with patient’s survival. Our study uncovered that increased de novo synthesis is a metabolic hallmark of metastatic breast cancer cells and its metabolites can regulate the signaling pathway to promote the stemness and metastasis of breast cancer.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/qz0X2Ozyfyo" width="1" />

The central pattern generator (CPG) for locomotion is a set of pacemaker neurons endowed with inherent bursting driven by the persistent sodium current (<i>I</i><sub>NaP</sub>). How they proceed to regulate the locomotor rhythm remained unknown. Here, in neonatal rodents, we identified a persistent potassium current critical in regulating pacemakers and locomotion speed. This current recapitulates features of the M-current (<i>I</i><sub>M</sub>): a subthreshold noninactivating outward current blocked by 10,10-bis(4-pyridinylmethyl)-9(10H)-anthracenone dihydrochloride (XE991) and enhanced by <i>N</i>-(2-chloro-5-pyrimidinyl)-3,4-difluorobenzamide (ICA73). Immunostaining and mutant mice highlight an important role of Kv7.2-containing channels in mediating <i>I</i><sub>M</sub>. Pharmacological modulation of <i>I</i><sub>M</sub> regulates the emergence and the frequency regime of both pacemaker and CPG activities and controls the speed of locomotion. Computational models captured these results and showed how an interplay between <i>I</i><sub>M</sub> and <i>I</i><sub>NaP</sub> endows the locomotor CPG with rhythmogenic properties. Overall, this study provides fundamental insights into how <i>I</i><sub>M</sub> and <i>I</i><sub>NaP</sub> work in tandem to set the speed of locomotion.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/9d4Muf1xKZ8" width="1" />

<p>Boolean satisfiability is a propositional logic problem of interest in
multiple fields, e.g., physics, mathematics, and computer science. Beyond a
field of research, instances of the SAT problem, as it is known, require
efficient solution methods in a variety of applications. It is the decision
problem of determining whether a Boolean formula has a satisfying assignment,
believed to require exponentially growing time for an algorithm to solve for
the worst-case instances. Yet, the efficient solution of many classes of
Boolean formulae eludes even the most successful algorithms, not only for the
worst-case scenarios, but also for typical-case instances. Here, we introduce a
memory-assisted physical system (a digital memcomputing machine) that, when its
non-linear ordinary differential equations are integrated numerically, shows
evidence for polynomially-bounded scalability while solving "hard"
planted-solution instances of SAT, known to require exponential time to solve
in the typical case for both complete and incomplete algorithms. Furthermore,
we analytically demonstrate that the physical system can efficiently solve the
SAT problem in continuous time, without the need to introduce chaos or an
exponentially growing energy. The efficiency of the simulations is related to
the collective dynamical properties of the original physical system that
persist in the numerical integration to robustly guide the solution search even
in the presence of numerical errors. We anticipate our results to broaden
research directions in physics-inspired computing paradigms ranging from theory
to application, from simulation to hardware implementation.

<p>Successive Cancellation Decoders have come a long way since the
implementation of traditional SC decoders, but there still is a potential for
improvement. The main struggle over the years was to find an optimal algorithm
to implement them. Most of the proposed algorithms are not practical enough to
be implemented in real-life. In this research, we aim to introduce the
Efficiency of stochastic neural networks as an SC decoder and Find the possible
ways of improving its performance and practicality. In this paper, after a
brief introduction to stochastic neurons and SNNs, we introduce methods to
realize Stochastic NNs on both deterministic and stochastic platforms.

<p>One of the most rising issues in recent machine learning research is
One-Class Classification which considers data set composed of only one class
and outliers. It is more reasonable than traditional Multi-Class Classification
in dealing with some problematic data set or special cases. Generally,
classification accuracy and interpretability for user are considered as
trade-off in OCC methods. Classifier based on Hyper-Rectangle (H-RTGL) is a
sort of classifier that can be a remedy for such trade-off and uses H-RTGL
formulated by conjunction of geometric rules called interval. This interval can
be basis of interpretability since it can be easily understood by user.
However, existing H-RTGL based OCC classifiers have limitations that (i) most
of them cannot reflect density of target class and (ii) that considering
density has primitive interval generation method, and (iii) there exists no
systematic procedure for hyperparameter of H-RTGL based OCC classifier, which
influences classification performance of classifier. Based on these remarks, we
suggest One-Class Hyper-Rectangle Descriptor based on density (1-HRD_d) with
more elaborate interval generation method including parametric and
nonparametric approaches. In addition, we designed Genetic Algorithm (GA) that
consists of chromosome structure and genetic operators for systematic
generation of 1-HRD_d by optimization of hyperparameter. Our work is validated
through a numerical experiment using actual data set with comparison of
existing OCC algorithms along with other H-RTGL based classifiers.

<p>Biological brains are inherently limited in their capacity to process and
store information, but are nevertheless capable of solving complex tasks with
apparent ease. Intelligent behavior is related to these limitations, since
resource constraints drive the need to generalize and assign importance
differentially to features in the environment or memories of past experiences.
Recently, there have been parallel efforts in reinforcement learning and
neuroscience to understand strategies adopted by artificial and biological
agents to circumvent limitations in information storage. However, the two
threads have been largely separate. In this article, we propose a dynamical
framework to maximize expected reward under constraints of limited resources,
which we implement with a cost function that penalizes precise representations
of action-values in memory, each of which may vary in its precision. We derive
from first principles an algorithm, Dynamic Resource Allocator (DRA), which we
apply to two standard tasks in reinforcement learning and a model-based
planning task, and find that it allocates more resources to items in memory
that have a higher impact on cumulative rewards. Moreover, DRA learns faster
when starting with a higher resource budget than what it eventually allocates
for performing well on tasks, which may explain why frontal cortical areas in
biological brains appear more engaged in early stages of learning before
settling to lower asymptotic levels of activity. Our work provides a normative
solution to the problem of learning how to allocate costly resources to a
collection of uncertain memories in a manner that is capable of adapting to
changes in the environment.

<p>The vehicle routing problem with simultaneous pickup-delivery and time
windows (VRPSPDTW) has attracted much attention in the last decade, due to its
wide application in modern logistics involving bi-directional flow of goods. In
this paper, we propose a memetic algorithm with efficient local search and
extended neighborhood, dubbed MATE, for solving this problem. The novelty of
MATE lies in three aspects: 1) an initialization procedure which integrates an
existing heuristic into the population-based search framework, in an
intelligent way; 2) a new crossover involving route inheritance and
regret-based node reinsertion; 3) a highly-effective local search procedure
which could flexibly search in a large neighborhood by switching between move
operators with different step sizes, while keeping low computational
complexity. Experimental results on public benchmark show that MATE
consistently outperforms all the state-of-the-art algorithms, and notably,
finds new best-known solutions on 44 instances (65 instances in total). A new
benchmark of large-scale instances, derived from a real-world application of
the JD logistics, is also introduced, which could serve as a new and more
practical test set for future research.

<p>Neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) aims at designing problem-independent
and efficient neural network-based strategies for solving combinatorial
problems. The field recently experienced growth by successfully adapting
architectures originally designed for machine translation. Even though the
results are promising, a large gap still exists between NCO models and classic
deterministic solvers, both in terms of accuracy and efficiency. One of the
drawbacks of current approaches is the inefficiency of training on multiple
problem sizes. Curriculum learning strategies have been shown helpful in
increasing performance in the multi-task setting. In this work, we focus on
designing a curriculum learning-based training procedure that can help existing
architectures achieve competitive performance on a large range of problem sizes
simultaneously. We provide a systematic investigation of several training
procedures and use the insights gained to motivate application of a
psychologically-inspired approach to improve upon the classic curriculum
method.

<p>Complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) devices display volatile
characteristics, and are not well suited for analog applications such as
neuromorphic computing. Spintronic devices, on the other hand, exhibit both
non-volatile and analog features, which are well-suited to neuromorphic
computing. Consequently, these novel devices are at the forefront of
beyond-CMOS artificial intelligence applications. However, a large quantity of
these artificial neuromorphic devices still require the use of CMOS, which
decreases the efficiency of the system. To resolve this, we have previously
proposed a number of artificial neurons and synapses that do not require CMOS
for operation. Although these devices are a significant improvement over
previous renditions, their ability to enable neural network learning and
recognition is limited by their intrinsic activation functions. This work
proposes modifications to these spintronic neurons that enable configuration of
the activation functions through control of the shape of a magnetic domain wall
track. Linear and sigmoidal activation functions are demonstrated in this work,
which can be extended through a similar approach to enable a wide variety of
activation functions.

<p>A fundamental feature of complex biological systems is the ability to form
feedback interactions with their environment. A prominent model for studying
such interactions is reservoir computing, where learning acts on
low-dimensional bottlenecks. Despite the simplicity of this learning scheme,
the factors contributing to or hindering the success of training in reservoir
networks are in general not well understood. In this work, we study non-linear
feedback networks trained to generate a sinusoidal signal, and analyze how
learning performance is shaped by the interplay between internal network
dynamics and target properties. By performing exact mathematical analysis of
linearized networks, we predict that learning performance is maximized when the
target is characterized by an optimal, intermediate frequency which
monotonically decreases with the strength of the internal reservoir
connectivity. At the optimal frequency, the reservoir representation of the
target signal is high-dimensional, de-synchronized, and thus maximally robust
to noise. We show that our predictions successfully capture the qualitative
behaviour of performance in non-linear networks. Moreover, we find that the
relationship between internal representations and performance can be further
exploited in trained non-linear networks to explain behaviours which do not
have a linear counterpart. Our results indicate that a major determinant of
learning success is the quality of the internal representation of the target,
which in turn is shaped by an interplay between parameters controlling the
internal network and those defining the task.

<p>In stochastic optimization, particularly in evolutionary computation and
reinforcement learning, the optimization of a function $f: \Omega \to
\mathbb{R}$ is often addressed through optimizing a so-called relaxation
$\theta \in \Theta \mapsto \mathbb{E}_\theta(f)$ of $f$, where $\Theta$
resembles the parameters of a family of probability measures on $\Omega$. We
investigate the structure of such relaxations by means of measure theory and
Fourier analysis, enabling us to shed light on the success of many stochastic
optimization methods. The main structural traits we derive, and that allow fast
and reliable optimization of relaxations, are the resemblance of optimal values
of $f$, Lipschitzness of gradients, and convexity.

<p>We present a physics-constrained control-oriented deep learning method for
modeling building thermal dynamics. The proposed method is based on the
systematic encoding of physics-based prior knowledge into a structured
recurrent neural architecture. Specifically, our method incorporates structural
priors from traditional physics-based building modeling into the neural network
thermal dynamics model structure. Further, we leverage penalty methods to
provide inequality constraints, thereby bounding predictions within physically
realistic and safe operating ranges. Observing that stable eigenvalues
accurately characterize the dissipativeness of the system, we additionally use
a constrained matrix parameterization based on the Perron-Frobenius theorem to
bound the dominant eigenvalues of the building thermal model parameter
matrices. We demonstrate the proposed data-driven modeling approach's
effectiveness and physical interpretability on a dataset obtained from a
real-world office building with 20 thermal zones. Using only 10 days'
measurements for training, we demonstrate generalization over 20 consecutive
days, significantly improving the accuracy compared to prior state-of-the-art
results reported in the literature.

<p>Members of a social species need to make appropriate decisions about who,
how, and when to interact with others in their group. However, it has been
difficult for researchers to detect the inputs to these decisions and, in
particular, how much information individuals actually have about their social
context. We present a new method that can serve as a social assay to quantify
how patterns of aggression depend upon information about the ranks of
individuals within social dominance hierarchies. Applied to existing data on
aggression in 172 social groups across 85 species in 23 orders, it reveals
three main patterns of rank-dependent social dominance: the downward heuristic
(aggress uniformly against lower-ranked opponents), close competitors (aggress
against opponents ranked slightly below self), and bullying (aggress against
opponents ranked much lower than self). The majority of the groups (133 groups,
77%) follow a downward heuristic, but a significant minority (38 groups, 22%)
show more complex social dominance patterns (close competitors or bullying)
consistent with higher levels of social information use. These patterns are not
phylogenetically constrained and different groups within the same species can
use different patterns, suggesting that heuristics use may depend on context
and the structuring of aggression by social information should not be
considered a fixed characteristic of a species. Our approach provides new
opportunities to study the use of social information within and across species
and the evolution of social complexity and cognition.

<p>Amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides can form protease-resistant aggregates within and outside of neurons. Accumulation of these aggregates is a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) neuropathology and contributes to devastating cognitive deficits associated with this disorder. The primary etiological factor for Aβ aggregation is either an increase in Aβ production or a decrease in its clearance. Aβ is produced by the sequential activity of β- and γ-secretase on the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the clearance is mediated by chaperone-mediated mechanisms. The Aβ aggregates vary from soluble monomers and oligomers to insoluble senile plaques. While excess intraneuronal oligomers can transduce neurotoxic signals into neurons causing cellular defects like oxidative stress and neuroepigenetic mediated transcriptional dysregulation, extracellular senile plaques cause neurodegeneration by impairing neural membrane permeabilization and cell signaling pathways. Paradoxically, senile plaque formation is hypothesized to be an adaptive mechanism to sequester excess toxic soluble oligomers while leaving native functional Aβ levels intact. This hypothesis is strengthened by the absence of positive outcomes and side effects from immunotherapy clinical trials aimed at complete Aβ clearance, and support beneficial physiological roles for native Aβ in cellular function. Aβ has been shown to modulate synaptic transmission, consolidate memory, and protect against excitotoxicity. We discuss the current understanding of beneficial and detrimental roles for Aβ in synaptic function and epigenetic gene control and the future promising prospects of early therapeutic interventions aimed at mediating Aβ induced neuroepigenetic and synaptic dysfunctions to delay AD onset.</p>

<p>Progressive myoclonus epilepsy of Unverricht-Lundborg type (EPM1) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in the cystatin B (CSTB) gene. Progression of the clinical symptoms in EPM1 patients, including stimulus-sensitive myoclonus, tonic-clonic seizures, and ataxia, are well described. However, the cellular dysfunction during the presymptomatic phase that precedes the disease onset is not understood. CSTB deficiency leads to alterations in GABAergic signaling, and causes early neuroinflammation followed by progressive neurodegeneration in brains of a mouse model, manifesting as progressive myoclonus and ataxia. Here, we report the first proteome atlas from cerebellar synaptosomes of presymptomatic Cstb-deficient mice, and propose that early mitochondrial dysfunction is important to the pathogenesis of altered synaptic function in EPM1. A decreased sodium- and chloride dependent GABA transporter 1 (GAT-1) abundance was noted in synaptosomes with CSTB deficiency, but no functional difference was seen between the two genotypes in electrophysiological experiments with pharmacological block of GAT-1. Collectively, our findings provide novel insights into the early onset and pathogenesis of CSTB deficiency, and reveal greater complexity to the molecular pathogenesis of EPM1.</p>

<p>Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a fatal cerebrovascular disease with high morbidity and mortality, for which no effective therapies are currently available. Brain tissue damage caused by ICH is mediated by a newly identified form of non-apoptotic programmed cell death, called ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is characterized by the iron-induced accumulation of lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to intracellular oxidative stress. Lipid ROS cause damage to nucleic acids, proteins, and cell membranes, eventually resulting in ferroptosis. Numerous biological processes are involved in ferroptosis, including iron metabolism, lipid peroxidation, and glutathione biosynthesis; therefore, iron chelators, lipophilic antioxidants, and other specific inhibitors can suppress ferroptosis, suggesting that these modulators are beneficial for treating brain injury due to ICH. Accumulating evidence indicates that ferroptosis differs from other types of programmed cell death, such as necroptosis, apoptosis, oxytosis, and pyroptosis, in terms of ultrastructural characteristics, signaling pathways, and outcomes. Although several studies have emphasized the importance of ferroptosis due to ICH, the detailed mechanism underlying ferroptosis remains unclear. This review summarizes the available evidence on the mechanism underlying ferroptosis and its relationship with other types of cell death, with the aim to identify therapeutic targets and potential interventions for ICH.</p>

<p>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was considered to be a disorder with high heterogeneity, as various abnormalities were found across widespread brain regions in recent neuroimaging studies. However, remarkable individual variability of cortical structure and function may have partially contributed to these discrepant findings. In this work, we applied the Dense Individualized and Common Connectivity-Based Cortical Landmarks (DICCCOL) method to identify fine-granularity corresponding functional cortical regions across different subjects based on the shape of a white matter fiber bundle and measured functional connectivities between these cortical regions. Fiber bundle pattern and functional connectivity were compared between ADHD patients and normal controls in two independent samples. Interestingly, four neighboring DICCCOLs located close to the left parietooccipital area consistently exhibited discrepant fiber bundles in both datasets. The left precentral gyrus (DICCCOL 175, BA 6) and the right anterior cingulate gyrus (DICCCOL 321, BA 32) had the highest connection number among 78 pairs of abnormal functional connectivities with good cross-sample consistency. Furthermore, abnormal functional connectivities were significantly correlated with ADHD symptoms. Our studies revealed novel fine-granularity structural and functional alterations in ADHD.</p>

Objective<p>The occurrence of death by suicide in patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder is as much as 60 times greater than in the general population. Even during the state of euthymia patients are characterized by suicide risk. The aim of the study is to investigate the baseline brain activity in euthymic bipolar disorder patients in regard to suicide risk.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to evaluate resting state brain activity and ROI–ROI functional connectivity analysis was performed. Suicidal risk was estimated using The Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised.</p>Results<p>A two sample t-test revealed decreased functional connectivity between regions involved in the salience network in patients compared to the control group. This decrease was negatively correlated with current suicide risk.</p>Conclusion<p>Obtained results suggest the association between risk of suicide and activity of regions responsible for functions such as learning from mistakes, prospective thinking, and sensory integration.</p>

<p>Area prostriata in primates has recently been found to play important roles in rapid detection and processing of peripheral visual, especially fast-moving visual information. The prostriata in rodents was not discovered until recently and its connectivity is largely unknown. As a part of our efforts to reveal brain-wide connections of the prostriata in rat and mouse, this study focuses on its commissural projections in order to understand the mechanisms underlying interhemispheric integration of information, especially from peripheral visual field. Using anterograde, retrograde and Cre-dependent tracing techniques, we find a unique commissural connection pattern of the prostriata: its layers 2-3 in both hemispheres form strong homotopic commissural connections with few heterotopic projections to bilateral medial entorhinal cortex. This projection pattern is in sharp contrast to that of the presubiculum and parasubiculum, two neighbor regions of the prostriata. The latter two structures project very strongly to bilateral medial entorhinal cortex and to their contralateral counterparts. Our results also suggest the prostriata is a distinct anatomical structure from the presubiculum and parasubiculum and probably plays differential roles in interhemispheric integration and the balancing of spatial information between two hemispheres.</p>

<p>Heteromers between mu opioid receptor (MOPr) and delta opioid receptor (DOPr) (i.e., MOPr-DOPr heteromer) have been found to be expressed in different brain regions, in the spinal cord, and in dorsal root ganglia. Recent studies on this heteromer reveal its important pathophysiological function in pain regulation including neuropathic pain; this suggests a role as a novel therapeutic target in chronic pain management. In addition, receptor transporter protein 4 (RTP4) has been shown to be involved in the intracellular maturation of the MOPr-DOPr heteromers. RTP4 appears to have unique distribution in vivo being highly expressed in sensory neurons and also macrophages; the latter are effector cells of the innate immune system that phagocytose foreign substances and secrete both pro-inflammatory and antimicrobial mediators; this suggests a possible contribution of RTP4 to neuronal immune-related pathological conditions such as neuropathic pain. Although RTP4 could be considered as an important therapeutic target in the management of pain via MOPr-DOPr heteromer, a few reports have supported this. This review will summarize the possible role or functions of the MOPr-DOPr heteromer and its regulatory molecule RTP4 in pain modulation at sensory neurons.</p>

<p>The brain of adult mammals, including humans, contains neural stem cells (NSCs) located within specific niches of which the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) is the largest one. Under physiological conditions, NSCs proliferate, self-renew and produce new neurons and glial cells. Several recent studies established that oncogenic mutations in adult NSCs of the V-SVZ are responsible for the emergence of malignant primary brain tumors called glioblastoma. These aggressive tumors contain a small subpopulation of cells, the glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), that are endowed with proliferative and self-renewal abilities like NSCs from which they may arise. GSCs are thus considered as the cells that initiate and sustain tumor growth and, because of their resistance to current treatments, provoke tumor relapse. A growing body of studies supports that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling controls a variety of processes in NSCs and GSCs. Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a ubiquitous second messenger whose fluctuations of its intracellular concentrations are handled by channels, pumps, exchangers, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding proteins. The concerted action of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> toolkit components encodes specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals with defined spatio-temporal characteristics that determine the cellular responses. In this review, after a general overview of the adult brain NSCs and GSCs, we focus on the multiple roles of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> toolkit in NSCs and discuss how GSCs hijack these mechanisms to promote tumor growth. Extensive knowledge of the role of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> toolkit in the management of essential functions in healthy and pathological stem cells of the adult brain should help to identify promising targets for clinical applications.</p>

<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease that selectively affects motor neurons (MNs) of the cortex, brainstem, and spinal cord. Several genes have been linked to both familial (fALS) and sporadic (sALS) cases of ALS. Among all the ALS-related genes, a group of genes known to directly affect cytoskeletal dynamics (ALS2, DCTN1, PFN1, KIF5A, NF-L, NF-H, PRPH, SPAST, and TUBA4A) is of high importance for MN health and survival, considering that MNs are large polarized cells with axons that can reach up to 1 m in length. In particular, cytoskeletal dynamics facilitate the transport of organelles and molecules across the long axonal distances within the cell, playing a key role in synapse maintenance. The majority of ALS-related genes affecting cytoskeletal dynamics were identified within the past two decades, making it a new area to explore for ALS. The purpose of this review is to provide insights into ALS-associated cytoskeletal genes and outline how recent studies have pointed towards novel pathways that might be impacted in ALS. Further studies making use of extensive analysis models to look for true hits, the newest technologies such as CRIPSR/Cas9, human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and axon sequencing, as well as the development of more transgenic animal models could potentially help to: differentiate the variants that truly act as a primary cause of the disease from the ones that act as risk factors or disease modifiers, identify potential interactions between two or more ALS-related genes in disease onset and progression and increase our understanding of the molecular mechanisms leading to cytoskeletal defects. Altogether, this information will give us a hint on the real contribution of the cytoskeletal ALS-related genes during this lethal disease.</p>

<p>Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a common and severe neurological disorder that can effectively induce oxidative stress responses. NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) is a member of the NOX family of oxidases. It is expressed in the brain normally and involved in cell signal transduction and the removal of harmful substances. In some pathological conditions, it mediates inflammation and the aging of cells. However, few studies have focused on whether NOX4 is involved in brain injury caused by ICH. Therefore, this study aimed to clarify the role of NOX4 in the pathological process that occurs after ICH and the potential mechanism underlying its role. A rat model of ICH was established by the injection of collagenase type IV, and the expression of NOX4 was then determined. Further, siRNA-mediated protein expression knockdown technology was used for NOX4 knockdown, and western immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and other molecular biological techniques were performed to assess the effects of NOX4 knockdown. Neurobiological scoring, brain water content determination, and other brain injury detection methods were also performed to assess the role of NOX4 following ICH. We found that the expression of NOX4 increased in the brains of rats after ICH, and that it was mainly expressed in neurons, astrocytes, vascular endothelial cells and microglia. Following NOX4 knockdown, the level of oxidative stress in the brain decreased considerably, the neurobehavioral scores improved, the levels of neuronal apoptosis reduced markedly, and the impairment of blood-brain barrier function was significantly ameliorated in rats with ICH. In conclusion, this study suggests that NOX4 expression is upregulated after ICH, which may cause an imbalance in the oxidative stress of relevant cells in the brain, leading to subsequent apoptosis of neurons and damage to the blood-brain barrier due to secondary brain injury following ICH.</p>

<p>Population averaged brain templates are an essential tool for imaging-based neuroscience research, providing investigators with information about the expected size and morphology of brain structures and the spatial relationships between them, within a demographic cross-section. This allows for a standardized comparison of neuroimaging data between subjects and provides neuroimaging software with a probabilistic framework upon which further processing and analysis can be based. Many different templates have been created to represent specific study populations and made publicly available for human and animal research. An increasingly studied animal model in the neurosciences that still lacks appropriate brain templates is the adult Yucatan micropig. In particular, T2-weighted templates are absent in this species as a whole. To address this need and provide a tool for neuroscientists wishing to pursue neuroimaging research in the adult micropig, we present the construction of population averaged (n = 16) T2-weighted MRI brain template for the adult Yucatan micropig. Additionally, we present initial analysis of T1-weighted (n = 3), and diffusion-weighted (n = 3) images through multimodal registration of these contrasts to our T2 template. The strategies used here may also be generalized to create similar templates for other study populations or species in need of template construction.</p>

<p>Schizophrenia (SCH) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) share several common aetiological and symptomatic features suggesting they may be included in a common spectrum. For example, recent results suggest that excitatory/inhibitory imbalance is relevant in the etiology of SCH and ASD. Numerous studies have investigated this imbalance in regions like the ventromedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). However, relatively little is known about neuroanatomical changes that could reduce inhibition in subcortical structures, such as the caudate nucleus (CN), in neuropsychiatric disorders. We recently showed a significant decrease in calretinin-immunopositive (CR-ip) interneuronal density in the CN of patients with ASD without significant change in the density of neuropeptide Y-immunopositive (NPY-ip) neurons. These subtypes together constitute more than 50% of caudate interneurons and are likely necessary for maintaining excitatory/inhibitory balance. Consequently, and since SCH and ASD share characteristic features, here we tested the hypothesis, that the density of CR-ip neurons in the CN is decreased in patients with SCH. We used immunohistochemistry and qPCR for CR and NPY in six patients with schizophrenia and six control subjects. As expected, small, medium and large CR-ip interneurons were detected in the CN. We found a 38% decrease in the density of all CR-ip interneurons (P &lt; 0.01) that was driven by the loss of the small CR-ip interneurons (P &lt; 0.01) in patients with SCH. The densities of the large CR-ip and of the NPY-ip interneurons were not significantly altered. The lower density detected could have been due to inflammation-induced degeneration. However, the state of microglial activation assessed by quantification of ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1)- and transmembrane protein 119 (TMEM119)-immunopositive cells showed no significant difference between patients with SCH and controls. Our results warrant further studies focussing on the role of CR-ip neurons and on the striatum being a possible hub for information selection and regulation of associative cortical fields whose function have been altered in SCH.</p>

<p>NMDA receptors are important players for neuronal differentiation. We previously reported that antagonizing NMDA receptors with APV blocked the growth-promoting effects evoked by the overexpression of specific calcium-permeable or flip-spliced AMPA receptor subunits and of type I transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins which both exclusively modify apical dendritic length and branching of cortical pyramidal neurons. These findings led us to characterize the role of GluN2B and GluN2A for dendritogenesis using organotypic cultures of rat visual cortex. Antagonizing GluN2B with ifenprodil and Ro25-6981 strongly impaired basal dendritic growth of supra- and infragranular pyramidal cells at DIV 5–10, but no longer at DIV 15–20. Growth recovered after washout, and protein blots revealed an increase of synaptic GluN2B-containing receptors as indicated by a enhanced phosphorylation of the tyrosine 1472 residue. Antagonizing GluN2A with TCN201 and NVP-AAM077 was ineffective at both ages. Dendrite growth of non-pyramidal interneurons was not altered. We attempted to overexpress GluN2A and GluN2B. However, although the constructs delivered currents in HEK cells, there were neither effects on dendrite morphology nor an enhanced sensitivity to NMDA. Further, co-expressing GluN1-1a and GluN2B did not alter dendritic growth. Visualization of overexpressed, tagged GluN2 proteins was successful after immunofluorescence for the tag which delivered rather weak staining in HEK cells as well as in neurons. This suggested that the level of overexpression is too weak to modify dendrite growth. In summary, endogenous GluN2B, but not GluN2A is important for pyramidal cell basal dendritic growth during an early postnatal time window.</p>

<p>Sleep complaints are the most prevalent syndromes in older adults, particularly in women. Moreover, they are frequently accompanied with a high level of depression and stress. Although several diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies reported associations between sleep quality and brain white matter (WM) microstructure, it is still unclear whether gender impacts the effect of sleep quality on structural alterations, and whether these alterations mediate the effects of sleep quality on emotional regulation. We included 389 older participants (176 females, age = 65.5 ± 5.5 years) from the 1000BRAINS project. Neuropsychological examinations covered the assessments of sleep quality, depressive symptomatology, current stress level, visual working memory, and selective attention ability. Based on the DTI dataset, the diffusion parameter maps, including fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD), were calculated and normalized to a population-specific FA template. According to the global Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), 119 poor sleepers (PSQI: 10∼17) and 120 good sleepers (PSQI: 3∼6) were identified. We conducted a two by two (good sleepers/poor sleepers) × (males/females) analysis of variance by using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) and JHU-ICBM WM atlas-based comparisons. Moreover, we performed a voxel-wise correlation analysis of brain WM microstructure with the neuropsychological tests. Finally, we applied a mediation analysis to explore if the brain WM microstructure mediates the relationship between sleep quality and emotional regulation. No significant differences in brain WM microstructure were detected on the main effect of sleep quality. However, the MD, AD, and RD of pontine crossing tract and bilateral inferior cerebellar peduncle were significant lower in the males than females. Voxel-wise correlation analysis revealed that FA and RD values in the corpus callosum were positively related with depressive symptomatology and negatively related with current stress levels. Additionally, we found a significantly positive association between higher FA values in visual-related WM tracts and better outcomes in a visual pattern recognition test. Furthermore, a mediation analysis suggested that diffusion metrics within the corpus callosum partially mediated the associations between poor sleep quality/high stress and depressive symptomatology.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63603">Genome-wide CRISPR screen identifies non-canonical NF-κB signaling as a regulator of density-dependent proliferation</a></h4>

Epithelial cells possess intrinsic mechanisms to maintain an appropriate cell density for normal tissue morphogenesis and homeostasis. Defects in such mechanisms likely contribute to hyperplasia and cancer initiation. To identify genes that regulate the density-dependent proliferation of murine mammary epithelial cells, we developed a fluorescence-activated cell sorting assay based on FUCCI, which marks different stages of the cell cycle with distinct fluorophores. Using this powerful assay, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen, selecting for cells that proliferate normally at low density but continue to divide at high density. Unexpectedly, one top hit was <i>Traf3</i>, a negative regulator of NF-κB signaling that has never previously been linked to density-dependent proliferation. We demonstrate that loss of <i>Traf3</i> specifically activates non-canonical NF-κB signaling. This in turn triggers an innate immune response and drives cell division independently of known density-dependent proliferation mechanisms, including YAP/TAZ signaling and cyclin kinase inhibitors, by blocking entry into quiescence.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/62731">GTPBP1 resolves paused ribosomes to maintain neuronal homeostasis</a></h4>

Ribosome-associated quality control pathways respond to defects in translational elongation to recycle arrested ribosomes and degrade aberrant polypeptides and mRNAs. Loss of a tRNA gene leads to ribosomal pausing that is resolved by the translational GTPase GTPBP2, and in its absence causes neuron death. Here, we show that loss of the homologous protein GTPBP1 during tRNA deficiency in the mouse brain also leads to codon-specific ribosome pausing and neurodegeneration, suggesting that these non-redundant GTPases function in the same pathway to mitigate ribosome pausing. As observed in <i>Gtpbp2</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice (Ishimura et al., 2016), GCN2-mediated activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) was apparent in the <i>Gtpbp1</i><sup>-/-</sup> brain. We observed decreased mTORC1 signaling which increased neuronal death, whereas ISR activation was neuroprotective. Our data demonstrate that GTPBP1 functions as an important quality control mechanism during translation elongation and suggest that translational signaling pathways intricately interact to regulate neuronal homeostasis during defective elongation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/62021">The structural basis for SARM1 inhibition and activation under energetic stress</a></h4>

SARM1 an executor of axonal degeneration, displays NADase activity that depletes the key cellular metabolite, NAD+, in response to nerve injury. The basis of SARM1 inhibition, and its activation under stress conditions are still unknown. Here, we present cryo-EM maps of SARM1 at 2.9 and 2.7 Å resolution. These indicate that SARM1 homo-octamer avoids premature activation by assuming a packed conformation, with ordered inner and peripheral rings, that prevents dimerization and activation of the catalytic domains. This inactive conformation is stabilized by binding of SARM1's own substrate NAD+ in an allosteric location, away from the catalytic sites. This model was validated by mutagenesis of the allosteric site, which led to constitutively active SARM1. We propose that the reduction of cellular NAD+ concentration contributes to the disassembly of SARM1's peripheral ring, which allows formation of active NADase domain dimers, thereby further depleting NAD+ to cause an energetic catastrophe and cell death.

Displacement loops (D-loops) are critical intermediates formed during homologous recombination. Rdh54 (a.k.a. Tid1), a Rad54 paralog in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae,</i> is well-known for its role with Dmc1 recombinase during meiotic recombination. Yet contrary to Dmc1, Rdh54/Tid1 is also present in somatic cells where its function is less understood. While Rdh54/Tid1 enhances the Rad51 DNA strand invasion activity <i>in vitro,</i> it is unclear how it interplays with Rad54. Here, we show that Rdh54/Tid1 inhibits D-loop formation by Rad51 and Rad54 in an ATPase-independent manner. Using a novel D-loop Mapping Assay, we further demonstrate that Rdh54/Tid1 uniquely restricts the lengths of Rad51-Rad54-mediated D-loops. The alterations in D-loop properties appear to be important for cell survival and mating-type switch in haploid yeast. We propose that Rdh54/Tid1 and Rad54 compete for potential binding sites within the Rad51 filament, where Rdh54/Tid1 acts as a physical roadblock to Rad54 translocation, limiting D-loop formation and D-loop length.

Displacement loops (D-loops) are signature intermediates formed during homologous recombination. Numerous factors regulate D-loop formation and disruption, thereby influencing crucial aspects of DNA repair, including donor choice and the possibility of crossover outcome. While D-loop detection methods exist, it is currently unfeasible to assess the relationship between D-loop editors and D-loop characteristics such as length and position. Here, we developed a novel <i>in vitro</i> assay to characterize the length and position of individual D-loops with near base-pair resolution and deep coverage, while also revealing their distribution in a population. Non-denaturing bisulfite treatment modifies the cytosines on the displaced strand of the D-loop to uracil, leaving a permanent signature for the displaced strand. Subsequent single-molecule real-time sequencing uncovers the cytosine conversion patch as a D-loop footprint. The D-loop Mapping Assay is widely applicable with different substrates and donor types and can be used to study factors that influence D-loop properties.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59081">Intracellular complexities of acquiring a new enzymatic function revealed by mass-randomisation of active site residues</a></h4>

Selection for a promiscuous enzyme activity provides substantial opportunity for competition between endogenous and newly-encountered substrates to influence the evolutionary trajectory, an aspect that is often overlooked in laboratory directed evolution studies. We selected the <i>Escherichia coli</i> nitro/quinone reductase NfsA for chloramphenicol detoxification by simultaneously randomising eight active site residues and interrogating ~250,000,000 reconfigured variants. Analysis of every possible intermediate of the two best chloramphenicol reductases revealed complex epistatic interactions. In both cases, improved chloramphenicol detoxification was only observed after an R225 substitution that largely eliminated activity with endogenous quinones. Error-prone PCR mutagenesis reinforced the importance of R225 substitutions, found in 100% of selected variants. This strong activity trade-off demonstrates that endogenous cellular metabolites hold considerable potential to shape evolutionary outcomes. Unselected prodrug-converting activities were mostly unaffected, emphasising the importance of negative selection to effect enzyme specialisation, and offering an application for the evolved genes as dual-purpose selectable/counter-selectable markers.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58277">Bacterial OTU deubiquitinases regulate substrate ubiquitination upon <i>Legionella</i> infection</a></h4>

<i>Legionella pneumophila</i> causes a severe pneumonia known as Legionnaires' disease. During the infection, <i>Legionella</i> injects more than 300 effector proteins into host cells. Among them are enzymes involved in altering the host-ubiquitination system. Here, we identified two <i><span class="underline">L</span></i><i>egionella</i> <span class="underline">OT</span>U-like deubiquitinases (LOT; LotB (Lpg1621/Ceg23) and LotC (Lpg2529)). The crystal structure of the LotC catalytic core (LotC<sub>14-310</sub>) was determined at 2.4 Å. Unlike the classical OTU-family, the <i>Legionella</i> OTU-family shows an extended helical lobe between the Cys-loop and the variable loop, which defines them as a unique class of OTU-deubiquitinases. LotB has an additional ubiquitin-binding site (S1'), which enables the specific cleavage of Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains. By contrast, LotC only contains the S1 site and cleaves different species of ubiquitin chains. MS analysis of LotB and LotC identified different categories of host-interacting proteins and substrates. Together, our results provide new structural insights into bacterial OTU deubiquitinases and indicate distinct roles in host-pathogen interactions.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56058">The palmitoyl acyltransferase ZDHHC14 controls Kv1-family potassium channel clustering at the axon initial segment</a></h4>

The palmitoyl acyltransferase (PAT) ZDHHC14 is highly expressed in the hippocampus and is the only PAT predicted to bind Type I PDZ domain-containing proteins. However, ZDHHC14's neuronal roles are unknown. Here, we identify the PDZ domain-containing Membrane-associated Guanylate Kinase (MaGUK) PSD93 as a direct ZDHHC14 interactor and substrate. PSD93, but not other MaGUKs, localizes to the Axon Initial Segment (AIS). Using lentiviral-mediated shRNA knockdown in rat hippocampal neurons, we find that ZDHHC14 controls palmitoylation and AIS clustering of PSD93 and also of Kv1 potassium channels, which directly bind PSD93. Neurodevelopmental expression of ZDHHC14 mirrors that of PSD93 and Kv1 channels and, consistent with ZDHHC14's importance for Kv1 channel clustering, loss of ZDHHC14 decreases outward currents and increases action potential firing in hippocampal neurons. To our knowledge, these findings identify the first neuronal roles and substrates for ZDHHC14 and reveal a previously unappreciated role for palmitoylation in control of neuronal excitability.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55529"><i>Smchd1</i> is a maternal effect gene required for genomic imprinting</a></h4>

Genomic imprinting establishes parental allele-biased expression of a suite of mammalian genes based on parent-of-origin specific epigenetic marks. These marks are under the control of maternal effect proteins supplied in the oocyte. Here we report epigenetic repressor <i>Smchd1</i> as a novel maternal effect gene that regulates the imprinted expression of ten genes in mice. We also found zygotic SMCHD1 had a dose-dependent effect on the imprinted expression of seven genes. Together, zygotic and maternal SMCHD1 regulate three classic imprinted clusters and eight other genes, including non-canonical imprinted genes. Interestingly, the loss of maternal SMCHD1 does not alter germline DNA methylation imprints pre-implantation or later in gestation. Instead, what appears to unite most imprinted genes sensitive to SMCHD1 is their reliance on polycomb-mediated methylation as germline or secondary imprints, therefore we propose that SMCHD1 acts downstream of polycomb imprints to mediate its function.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/53990">Talin-activated vinculin interacts with branched actin networks to initiate bundles</a></h4>

Vinculin plays a fundamental role in integrin-mediated cell adhesion. Activated by talin, it interacts with diverse adhesome components, enabling mechanical coupling between the actin cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix. Here we studied the interactions of activated full-length vinculin with actin and the way it regulates the organization and dynamics of the Arp2/3 complex-mediated branched actin network. Through a combination of surface patterning and light microscopy experiments we show that vinculin can bundle dendritic actin networks through rapid binding and filament crosslinking. We show that vinculin promotes stable but flexible actin bundles having a mixed-polarity organization, as confirmed cryo-electron tomography. Adhesion-like synthetic design of vinculin activation by surface-bound talin revealed that clustered vinculin can initiate and immobilize bundles from mobile Arp2/3-branched networks. Our results provide a molecular basis for coordinate actin bundle formation at nascent adhesions.

The axon initial segment (AIS) is a specialized neuronal compartment in which synaptic input is converted into action potential output. This process is supported by a diverse complement of sodium, potassium, and calcium channels (CaV). Different classes of sodium and potassium channels are scaffolded at specific sites within the AIS, conferring unique functions, but how calcium channels are functionally distributed within the AIS is unclear. Here, we utilize conventional 2-photon laser scanning and diffraction-limited, high-speed spot 2-photon imaging to resolve action potential-evoked calcium dynamics in the AIS with high spatiotemporal resolution. In mouse layer 5 prefrontal pyramidal neurons, calcium influx was mediated by a mix of CaV2 and CaV3 channels that differentially localized to discrete regions. CaV3 functionally localized to produce nanodomain hotspots of calcium influx that coupled to ryanodine-dependent stores, whereas CaV2 localized to non-hotspot regions. Thus, different pools of CaVs appear to play distinct roles in AIS function.

Multiple cilia-associated genes have been shown to affect hair cells in zebrafish ()Danio rerio), including the human deafness gene dcdc2 , the radial spoke gene rsph9 , and multiple intraflagellar transport (IFT) and transition zone genes. Recently a zebrafish alms1 mutant was generated. The ALMS1 gene is the gene mutated in the ciliopathy Alstrom Syndrome a disease that causes hearing loss among other symptoms. The hearing loss seen in Alstrom Syndrome may be due in part to hair cell defects as Alms1 mutant mice show stereocilia polarity defects and a loss of hair cells. Hair cell loss is also seen in postmortem analysis of Alstrom patients. The zebrafish alms1 mutant has metabolic defects similar to those seen in Alstrom syndrome and Alms1 mutant mice. We wished to investigate if it also had hair cell defects. We, however, failed to find any hair cell related phenotypes in alms1 mutant zebrafish. They had normal lateral line hair cell numbers as both larvae and adults and normal kinocilia formation. They also showed grossly normal swimming behavior, response to vibrational stimuli, and FM1-43 loading. Mutants also showed a normal degree of sensitivity to both short-term neomycin and long-term gentamicin treatment. These results indicate that cilia-associated genes differentially affect different hair cell types.

Stimulus repetition reduces neuronal responses in sensory areas, while leaving perceptual fidelity and behavioral performance intact. Visual gamma-band activity decreases for few stimulus repetitions in humans, yet increases for many repetitions in macaques. Using magnetoencephalography, we confirmed that gamma decreases for the first few stimulus repetitions, and, as in macaques, increases for further repetitions. Crucially, this increase did not transfer to other stimuli, suggesting that the circuit changes were specific to the inducing stimulus. The increase partially persisted when the inducing stimulus was repeated after 25 minutes of intervening stimuli. The increase was most pronounced in early visual areas, and entailed an increased feedforward influence onto higher areas. Our results suggest that early visual cortex gamma synchronization subserves adaptative neuronal processing of recurring stimuli. We propose that drive-dependent gamma phase shifting combines with spike timing-dependent synaptic plasticity to reduce overall responses, while maintaining the impact on higher areas and behavior.

Developmental programs that guide neurons and their neurites into specific subvolumes of the mammalian neocortex give rise to lifelong constraints for the formation of synaptic connections. To what degree do these constraints affect cortical wiring diagrams? Here we introduce an inverse modeling approach to show how cortical networks would appear if they were solely due to the spatial distributions of neurons and neurites. We find that neurite packing density and morphological diversity will inevitably translate into non-random pairwise and higher-order connectivity statistics. More importantly, we show that these non-random wiring properties are not arbitrary, but instead reflect the specific structural organization of the underlying neuropil. Our predictions are consistent with the empirically observed wiring specificity from subcellular to network scales. Thus, independent from learning and genetically encoded wiring rules, many of the properties that define the neocortex' characteristic network architecture may emerge as a result of neuron and neurite development.

Background: Early life stress (ELS) is an important risk factor for the development of depression. Impairments in reward learning and feedback sensitivity have been suggested. to be an intermediate phenotype in depression aetiology. We therefore hypothesised that healthy adults with a history of ELS would have impairments in reward learning and feedback sensitivity. Methods: We recruited 64 adult participants with high levels of ELS and no diagnosis of a current mental health disorder in addition to 65 controls. Participants completed two online reward learning tasks: the probabilistic reversal learning task (PRLT) and probabilistic reward task (PRT). Participants also completed depression, anhedonia, social status and stress scales with PRLT data being additionally analysed utilising a reinforcement learning model. Results: Participants with high levels of ELS showed decreased positive feedback sensitivity (PFS) in the PRLT compared to controls. High ELS participants also tended towards possessing a decreased model-free learning rate which strengthened in subsequent analysis. This was coupled with a decreased learning ability in the acquisition phase of block 1 following the practice session. Neither groups of participants showed a reward induced response bias in the PLT however high ELS participants exhibited decreased discrimination ability between stimuli; this was however accounted for by depression symptomology in further analysis. Conclusions: These data suggest that healthy participants without a mental health diagnosis and high levels of ELS show deficits in PFS and reward learning in the PRLT that are distinct from depressed patients. These deficits may be relevant to an increased vulnerability to depression.

Over the last two decades, beginning with the Avian Brain Nomenclature Forum in 2000, major revisions have been made to our understanding of the organization and nomenclature of the avian brain. However, there are still unresolved questions on avian pallial organization, particularly whether the cells above the ventricle represent different populations to those below it. Concerns included limited number of genes profiled, biased selection of genes, and potential independent origins of cell types in different parts of the brain. Here we test two competing hypotheses, using RNA sequencing to profile the transcriptomes of the major avian pallial subdivisions dorsal and ventral to the ventricle boundary, and a new zebra finch genome assembly containing about 22,000 annotated, complete genes. We found that the transcriptomes of neural populations below and above the ventricle were remarkably similar. What had been previously named hyperpallium densocellulare above the ventricle had nearly the same molecular profile as the mesopallium below it; the hyperpallium apicale above was highly similar to the nidopallium below; the primary sensory intercalated hyperpallium apicale above was most similar to the sensory population below, although more divergent than the other populations were to each other. These shared population expression profiles define unique functional specializations in anatomical structure development, synaptic transmission, signaling, and neurogenesis. These findings support the continuum hypothesis of avian brain subdivisions above and below the ventricle space, with the pallium as a whole consisting of four major cell populations instead of seven and has some profound implications for our understanding of vertebrate brain evolution.

Antipsychotic-induced behavioral supersensitivity is a problematic consequence of long-term treatment with antipsychotic drugs and is characterized by emergence of refractory symptoms and dyskinesias. The underlying mechanisms are unknown, and no rational approaches exist to prevent or reverse antipsychotic-induced supersensitivity. Here we describe major adaptations impacting populations of striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) during the development of behavioral supersensitivity and reveal a prominent role played by D2 receptor expressing MSNs. We show that enhanced D2-MSN activity underlies several symptoms spanning from psychostimulant sensitization, to antipsychotic treatment resistance and drug addiction. Our data warn against severe adverse events following antipsychotic treatment discontinuation and offer insight that may inform therapeutic approaches to overcome antipsychotic-induced supersensitivity.

In addition to participating in {gamma}-secretase activity, presenilin 1 (PS1) regulates trafficking and subcellular localization of {beta}-amyloid precursor protein (APP). We previously showed that gamma-secretase activating protein (GSAP) selectively modulates {gamma}-secretase activity by inducing conformational change in PS1. However, little is known whether and how GSAP might influence APP trafficking and consequent generation of {beta}-amyloid (A{beta}) peptides. Here, to explore whether GSAP has any role in regulating APP trafficking, and to systematically investigate the intracellular trafficking routes of APP, we paired total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, high-speed line scanning microscopy, and 4D microscopy with comprehensive imaging analysis methodologies to depict the elusive modes of APP trafficking at a single-vesicle level. Mobility and diffusivity changes reveal the existence of two kinetically distinct pathways, classified into mobile and immobile pools, for vesicular APP trafficking, suggesting high association between immobile vesicle pool and amyloidogenic processing. GSAP knockdown significantly lowers immobile pool without overturning APP vesicle diffusivity, suggesting that GSAP affects vesicular APP trafficking by retaining APP in membrane microdomains known to favor amyloidogenic processing. Our study reveals a novel role of GSAP in the regulation of A{beta}-peptide formation that modulates switching of APP vesicles between immobile and mobile pools, which may help identifying new therapeutic strategies to treat Alzheimer's disease.

<p>by Joseph D. Romano, Jason H. Moore</p>

Papers describing software are an important part of computational fields of scientific research. These “software papers” are unique in a number of ways, and they require special consideration to improve their impact on the scientific community and their efficacy at conveying important information. Here, we discuss 10 specific rules for writing software papers, covering some of the different scenarios and publication types that might be encountered, and important questions from which all computational researchers would benefit by asking along the way.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/39EYQupRqIk" width="1" />

<p>by Chen Xie, Cemalettin Bekpen, Sven Künzel, Maryam Keshavarz, Rebecca Krebs-Wheaton, Neva Skrabar, Kristian K. Ullrich, Wenyu Zhang, Diethard Tautz</p>

Systematic knockout studies in mice have shown that a large fraction of the gene replacements show no lethal or other overt phenotypes. This has led to the development of more refined analysis schemes, including physiological, behavioral, developmental and cytological tests. However, transcriptomic analyses have not yet been systematically evaluated for non-lethal knockouts. We conducted a power analysis to determine the experimental conditions under which even small changes in transcript levels can be reliably traced. We have applied this to two gene disruption lines of genes for which no function was known so far. Dedicated phenotyping tests informed by the tissues and stages of highest expression of the two genes show small effects on the tested phenotypes. For the transcriptome analysis of these stages and tissues, we used a prior power analysis to determine the number of biological replicates and the sequencing depth. We find that under these conditions, the knockouts have a significant impact on the transcriptional networks, with thousands of genes showing small transcriptional changes. GO analysis suggests that <i>A930004D18Rik</i> is involved in developmental processes through contributing to protein complexes, and <i>A830005F24Rik</i> in extracellular matrix functions. Subsampling analysis of the data reveals that the increase in the number of biological replicates was more important that increasing the sequencing depth to arrive at these results. Hence, our proof-of-principle experiment suggests that transcriptomic analysis is indeed an option to study gene functions of genes with weak or no traceable phenotypic effects and it provides the boundary conditions under which this is possible.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Y4Esignvs20" width="1" />

Eukaryotic genome sequencing and de novo assembly, once the exclusive domain of well-funded international consortia, have become increasingly affordable, thus fitting the budgets of individual research groups. Third-generation long-read DNA sequencing technologies are increasingly used, providing extensive genomic toolkits that were once reserved for a few select model organisms. Generating high-quality genome assemblies and annotations for many aquatic species still presents significant challenges due to their large genome sizes, complexity, and high chromosome numbers. Indeed, selecting the most appropriate sequencing and software platforms and annotation pipelines for a new genome project can be daunting because tools often only work in limited contexts. In genomics, generating a high-quality genome assembly/annotation has become an indispensable tool for better understanding the biology of any species. Herein, we state 12 steps to help researchers get started in genome projects by presenting guidelines that are broadly applicable (to any species), sustainable over time, and cover all aspects of genome assembly and annotation projects from start to finish. We review some commonly used approaches, including practical methods to extract high-quality DNA and choices for the best sequencing platforms and library preparations. In addition, we discuss the range of potential bioinformatics pipelines, including structural and functional annotations (e.g., transposable elements and repetitive sequences). This paper also includes information on how to build a wide community for a genome project, the importance of data management, and how to make the data and results Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) by submitting them to a public repository and sharing them with the research community.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SFRYvOAodxE" width="1" />

<p>by Rowan S. M. Howell, Cinzia Klemm, Peter H. Thorpe, Attila Csikász-Nagy</p>

The transition from mitosis into the first gap phase of the cell cycle in budding yeast is controlled by the Mitotic Exit Network (MEN). The network interprets spatiotemporal cues about the progression of mitosis and ensures that release of Cdc14 phosphatase occurs only after completion of key mitotic events. The MEN has been studied intensively; however, a unified understanding of how localisation and protein activity function together as a system is lacking. In this paper, we present a compartmental, logical model of the MEN that is capable of representing spatial aspects of regulation in parallel to control of enzymatic activity. We show that our model is capable of correctly predicting the phenotype of the majority of mutants we tested, including mutants that cause proteins to mislocalise. We use a continuous time implementation of the model to demonstrate that Cdc14 Early Anaphase Release (FEAR) ensures robust timing of anaphase, and we verify our findings in living cells. Furthermore, we show that our model can represent measured cell–cell variation in Spindle Position Checkpoint (SPoC) mutants. This work suggests a general approach to incorporate spatial effects into logical models. We anticipate that the model itself will be an important resource to experimental researchers, providing a rigorous platform to test hypotheses about regulation of mitotic exit.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/7sXa2Hr7n4Y" width="1" />

<p>by Joana Leitão, Ben Meuleman, Dimitri Van De Ville, Patrik Vuilleumier</p>

Emotions are multifaceted phenomena affecting mind, body, and behavior. Previous studies sought to link particular emotion categories (e.g., fear) or dimensions (e.g., valence) to specific brain substrates but generally found distributed and overlapping activation patterns across various emotions. In contrast, distributed patterns accord with multi-componential theories whereby emotions emerge from appraisal processes triggered by current events, combined with motivational, expressive, and physiological mechanisms orchestrating behavioral responses. According to this framework, components are recruited in parallel and dynamically synchronized during emotion episodes. Here, we use functional MRI (fMRI) to investigate brain-wide systems engaged by theoretically defined components and measure their synchronization during an interactive emotion-eliciting video game. We show that each emotion component recruits large-scale cortico-subcortical networks, and that moments of dynamic synchronization between components selectively engage basal ganglia, sensory-motor structures, and midline brain areas. These neural results support theoretical accounts grounding emotions onto embodied and action-oriented functions triggered by synchronized component processes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/MAf_3GnUew8" width="1" />

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease, has moved rapidly around the globe, infecting millions and killing hundreds of thousands. The basic reproduction number, which has been widely used—appropriately and less appropriately—to characterize the transmissibility of the virus, hides the fact that transmission is stochastic, often dominated by a small number of individuals, and heavily influenced by superspreading events (SSEs). The distinct transmission features of SARS-CoV-2, e.g., high stochasticity under low prevalence (as compared to other pathogens, such as influenza), and the central role played by SSEs on transmission dynamics cannot be overlooked. Many explosive SSEs have occurred in indoor settings, stoking the pandemic and shaping its spread, such as long-term care facilities, prisons, meat-packing plants, produce processing facilities, fish factories, cruise ships, family gatherings, parties, and nightclubs. These SSEs demonstrate the urgent need to understand routes of transmission, while posing an opportunity to effectively contain outbreaks with targeted interventions to eliminate SSEs. Here, we describe the different types of SSEs, how they influence transmission, empirical evidence for their role in the COVID-19 pandemic, and give recommendations for control of SARS-CoV-2.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/hPyMz8UJ2O4" width="1" />

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To assess the association between migraine and cryptogenic ischemic stroke (CIS) in young adults, with subgroup analyses stratified by sex and presence of patent foramen ovale (PFO).</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We prospectively enrolled 347 consecutive patients aged 18 to 49 years with a recent CIS and 347 age‐ and sex‐matched (±5 years) stroke‐free controls. Any migraine and migraine with (MA) and migraine without aura (MO) were identified by a screener, which we validated against a headache neurologist. We used conditional logistic regression adjusting for age, education, hypertension, diabetes, waist‐to‐hip ratio, physical inactivity, current smoking, heavy drinking, and oral estrogen use to assess independent association between migraine and CIS. The effect of PFO on the association between migraine and CIS was analyzed with logistic regression in a subgroup investigated with transcranial Doppler bubble screen.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The screener performance was excellent (Cohen kappa &gt; 0.75) in patients and controls. Compared with nonmigraineurs, any migraine (odds ratio [OR] = 2.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.63–3.76) and MA (OR = 3.50, 95% CI = 2.19–5.61) were associated with CIS, whereas MO was not. The association emerged in both women (OR = 2.97 for any migraine, 95% CI = 1.61–5.47; OR = 4.32 for MA, 95% CI = 2.16–8.65) and men (OR = 2.47 for any migraine, 95% CI = 1.32–4.61; OR = 3.61 for MA, 95% CI = 1.75–7.45). Specifically for MA, the association with CIS remained significant irrespective of PFO. MA prevalence increased with increasing magnitude of the right‐to‐left shunt in patients with PFO.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>MA has a strong association with CIS in young patients, independent of vascular risk factors and presence of PFO. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25956?af=R">Prevention of epilepsy in infants with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex in the EPISTOP trial</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Epilepsy develops in 70–90% of children with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) and is often resistant to medication. Recently, the concept of preventive antiepileptic treatment to modify the natural history of epilepsy has been proposed. EPISTOP was a clinical trial designed to compare preventive versus conventional antiepileptic treatment in TSC infants.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this multi‐center study, 94 infants with TSC without seizure history were followed with monthly video electroencephalography (EEG), and received vigabatrin either as conventional antiepileptic treatment, started after the first electrographic or clinical seizure, or preventively when epileptiform EEG activity before seizures was detected. At six sites, subjects were randomly allocated to treatment in a 1:1 ratio in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). At four sites, treatment allocation was fixed, denoted an open‐label trial (OLT). Subjects were followed until 2 years of age. The primary endpoint was the time to first clinical seizure.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p><b>In 54</b> subjects epileptiform EEG abnormalities were identified before seizures. Twenty‐seven were included in the RCT and 27 in the OLT. The time to the first clinical seizure was significantly longer with preventive than conventional treatment (RCT: 364 95% CI: 223, 535) vs. 124 days (95% CI: 33, 149); OLT: 426 (95% CI: 258, 628) vs. 106 days (95% CI: 11, 149). At 24 months, our pooled analysis showed preventive treatment reduced the risk of clinical seizures (odds ratio [OR] = 0.21, p = 0.032), drug‐resistant epilepsy (OR = 0.23, p = 0.022), and infantile spasms (OR = 0, p &lt; 0.001). No adverse events related to preventive treatment were noted.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Preventive treatment with vigabatrin was safe and modified the natural history of seizures in TSC, reducing the risk and severity of epilepsy.</p>

<p>All HCN channel subtypes were located at subcellular level in human and compared with other mammals such as guinea pig, cat, and three mouse strains. Changes in HCN expression levels were quantified in aging mice and murine postnatal development. The widespread expression and distinct localization emphasized the importance of HCN channels for sound coding and electrical stimulation with cochlear implants</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neuronal diversity in the cochlea is largely determined by ion channels. Among voltage‐gated channels, hyperpolarization‐activated cyclic nucleotide‐gated (HCN) channels open with hyperpolarization and depolarize the cell until the resting membrane potential. The functions for hearing are not well elucidated and knowledge about localization is controversial. We created a detailed map of subcellular location and co‐expression of all four HCN subunits across different mammalian species including CBA/J, C57Bl/6N, Ly5.1 mice, guinea pigs, cats, and human subjects. We correlated age‐related hearing deterioration in CBA/J and C57Bl/6N with expression levels of HCN1, −2, and −4 in individual auditory neurons from the same cohort. Spatiotemporal expression during murine postnatal development exposed HCN2 and HCN4 involvement in a critical phase of hair cell innervation. The huge diversity of subunit composition, but lack of relevant heteromeric pairing along the perisomatic membrane and axon initial segments, highlighted an active role for auditory neurons. Neuron clusters were found to be the hot spots of HCN1, −2, and −4 immunostaining. HCN channels were also located in afferent and efferent fibers of the sensory epithelium. Age‐related changes on HCN subtype expression were not uniform among mice and could not be directly correlated with audiometric data. The oldest mice groups revealed HCN channel up‐ or downregulation, depending on the mouse strain. The unexpected involvement of HCN channels in outer hair cell function where HCN3 overlaps prestin location emphasized the importance for auditory function. A better understanding may open up new possibilities to tune neuronal responses evoked through electrical stimulation by cochlear implants.</p>

<p>The principle of self-organization has acquired a fundamental significance in
the newly emerging field of computational philosophy. Self-organizing systems
have been described in various domains in science and philosophy including
physics, neuroscience, biology and medicine, ecology, and sociology. While
system architecture and their general purpose may depend on domain specific
concepts and definitions, there are at least seven key properties of
self-organization clearly identified in brain systems: modular connectivity,
unsupervised learning, adaptive ability, functional resiliency, functional
plasticity, from-local-to-global functional organization and dynamic system
growth. These are defined here in the light of insight from neurobiology,
cognitive neuroscience and Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART), and physics to show
that self-organization achieves stability and functional plasticity while
minimizing structural system complexity. A specific example informed by
empirical research is discussed to illustrate how modularity, adaptive
learning, and dynamic network growth enable stable yet plastic somatosensory
representation for human grip force control. Implications for the design of
strong artificial intelligence in robotics are brought forward.

<p>Stimulation methods that utilise more than one stimulation frequency have
been developed in steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) brain-computer
interfaces (BCIs) for the purpose of increasing the number of targets that can
be presented simultaneously. However, there is no unified decoding algorithm
that can be applied to a large class of multi-frequency stimulated SSVEP
settings. This paper extends the widely used canonical correlation analysis
(CCA) decoder to explicitly accommodate multi-frequency SSVEP by exploiting the
interactions between the multiple stimulation frequencies. A concept "order"
was defined as the sum of absolute values of the coefficients in the linear
interaction. The probability distribution of the order in the resulting SSVEP
response was then used to improve decoding accuracy. Results show that,
compared to the standard CCA formulation, the proposed multi-frequency CCA
(MFCCA) has a 20% improvement in decoding accuracy on average at order 2.
Although the proposed methods were only tested with two input frequencies, the
technique is capable of handling more than two simultaneous input frequencies.

<p>The Nonlinear Noisy Leaky Integrate and Fire neuronal models are mathematical
models that describe the activity of neural networks. These models have been
studied at a microscopic level, using Stochastic Differential Equations, and at
a mesoscopic/macroscopic level, through the mean field limits using
Fokker-Planck type equations. The aim of this paper is to improve their
understanding, using a numerical study of their particle systems. We analyse in
depth the behaviour of the classical and physical solutions of the Stochastic
Differential Equations and, we compare it with what is already known about the
Fokker-Planck equation. This allows us to better understand what happens in the
neural network when an explosion occurs in finite time. After firing all
neurons at the same time, if the system is weakly connected, the neural network
converges towards its unique steady state. Otherwise, its behaviour is more
complex, because it can tend towards a stationary state or a "plateau"
distribution.

<p>While phase oscillators are often used to model neuronal populations, in
contrast to the Kuramoto paradigm, strong interactions between brain areas can
be associated with loss of synchrony. Using networks of coupled oscillators
described by neural mass models, we find that a transition to decoherence at
increased coupling strength results from the fundamental nonlinearity, e.g.,
arising from refractoriness, of the interactions between the nodes. The
nonlinearity-driven transition also depends on the connection topology,
underlining the role of network structure in shaping brain activity.

<p>Tracking the positions of objects in local space is a core function of animal
brains. We do not yet understand how it is done with limited neural resources.
The challenges of spatial cognition are discussed under the criteria: (a)
scaling of computational costs; (b) feature binding; (c) precise calculation of
spatial displacements; (d) fast learning of invariant patterns; and (e)
exploiting the strong Bayesian prior of object constancy. The leading current
models of spatial cognition are Hierarchical Bayesian models of vision, and
Deep Neural Nets. These are typically fully distributed models, which compute
using direct communication links between a set of modular knowledge sources,
and no other essential components. Their distributed nature leads to
difficulties with the criteria (a) - (e). I discuss an alternative model of
spatial cognition, which uses a single central position aggregator to store
estimated locations of each object or feature, and applies constraints on
locations in an iterative cycle between the aggregator and the knowledge
sources. This model has advantages in addressing the criteria (a) - (e). If
there is an aggregator in mammalian brains, there are reasons to believe that
it is in the thalamus. I outline a possible neural realisation of the
aggregator function in the thalamus.

<p>Self-Organizing Map algorithms have been used for almost 40 years across
various application domains such as biology, geology, healthcare, industry and
humanities as an interpretable tool to explore, cluster and visualize
high-dimensional data sets. In every application, practitioners need to know
whether they can \textit{trust} the resulting mapping, and perform model
selection to tune algorithm parameters (e.g. the map size). Quantitative
evaluation of self-organizing maps (SOM) is a subset of clustering validation,
which is a challenging problem as such. Clustering model selection is typically
achieved by using clustering validity indices. While they also apply to
self-organized clustering models, they ignore the topology of the map, only
answering the question: do the SOM code vectors approximate well the data
distribution? Evaluating SOM models brings in the additional challenge of
assessing their topology: does the mapping preserve neighborhood relationships
between the map and the original data? The problem of assessing the performance
of SOM models has already been tackled quite thoroughly in literature, giving
birth to a family of quality indices incorporating neighborhood constraints,
called \textit{topographic} indices. Commonly used examples of such metrics are
the topographic error, neighborhood preservation or the topographic product.
However, open-source implementations are almost impossible to find. This is the
issue we try to solve in this work: after a survey of existing SOM performance
metrics, we implemented them in Python and widely used numerical libraries, and
provide them as an open-source library, SOMperf. This paper introduces each
metric available in our module along with usage examples.

<p>The Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm (AFSA) is inspired by the ecological
behaviors of fish schooling in nature, viz., the preying, swarming, following
and random behaviors. Owing to a number of salient properties, which include
flexibility, fast convergence, and insensitivity to the initial parameter
settings, the family of AFSA has emerged as an effective Swarm Intelligence
(SI) methodology that has been widely applied to solve real-world optimization
problems. Since its introduction in 2002, many improved and hybrid AFSA models
have been developed to tackle continuous, binary, and combinatorial
optimization problems. This paper aims to present a concise review of the
family of AFSA, encompassing the original ASFA and its improvements,
continuous, binary, discrete, and hybrid models, as well as the associated
applications. A comprehensive survey on the AFSA from its introduction to 2012
can be found in [1]. As such, we focus on a total of {\color{blue}123} articles
published in high-quality journals since 2013. We also discuss possible AFSA
enhancements and highlight future research directions for the family of
AFSA-based models.

<p>Deep artificial neural networks have been proposed as a model of primate
vision. However, these networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, whereby
introducing minimal noise can fool networks into misclassifying images. Primate
vision is thought to be robust to such adversarial images. We evaluated this
assumption by designing adversarial images to fool primate vision. To do so, we
first trained a model to predict responses of face-selective neurons in macaque
inferior temporal cortex. Next, we modified images, such as human faces, to
match their model-predicted neuronal responses to a target category, such as
monkey faces. These adversarial images elicited neuronal responses similar to
the target category. Remarkably, the same images fooled monkeys and humans at
the behavioral level. These results challenge fundamental assumptions about the
similarity between computer and primate vision and show that a model of
neuronal activity can selectively direct primate visual behavior.

<p>This work presents a decentralized motion planning framework for addressing
the task of multi-robot navigation using deep reinforcement learning. A custom
simulator was developed in order to experimentally investigate the navigation
problem of 4 cooperative non-holonomic robots sharing limited state information
with each other in 3 different settings. The notion of decentralized motion
planning with common and shared policy learning was adopted, which allowed
robust training and testing of this approach in a stochastic environment since
the agents were mutually independent and exhibited asynchronous motion
behavior. The task was further aggravated by providing the agents with a sparse
observation space and requiring them to generate continuous action commands so
as to efficiently, yet safely navigate to their respective goal locations,
while avoiding collisions with other dynamic peers and static obstacles at all
times. The experimental results are reported in terms of quantitative measures
and qualitative remarks for both training and deployment phases.

<p>As organism is a dissipative system. The process from multi desires to
exclusive motivation is of great importance among all sensory-action loops. In
this paper we argued that a proper Desire-Motivation model should be a
continuous dynamic mapping from the dynamic desire vector to the sparse
motivation vector. Meanwhile, it should at least have specific stability and
adjustability of motivation intensity. Besides, the neuroscience evidences
suggest that the Desire-Motivation model should have dynamic information
acquisition and should be a recurrent neural network. A five-equation model is
built based on the above arguments, namely the Recurrent Gating
Desire-Motivation (RGDM) model. Additionally, a heuristic speculation based on
the RGDM model about corresponding brain regions is carried out. It believes
that the tonic and phasic firing of ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons
should execute the respective and collective feedback functions of recurrent
processing. The analysis about the RGMD model shows the expectations about
individual personality from three dimensions, namely stability, intensity, and
motivation decision speed. These three dimensions can be combined and create
eight different personalities, which is correspondent to Jung's personality
structure theorem. Furthermore, the RGDM model can be used to predict three
different brand-new types of depressive disorder with different phenotypes.
Moreover, it can also explain several other psychiatry disorders from new
perspectives.

<p>Optimisation algorithms are commonly compared on benchmarks to get insight
into performance differences. However, it is not clear how closely benchmarks
match the properties of real-world problems because these properties are
largely unknown. This work investigates the properties of real-world problems
through a questionnaire to enable the design of future benchmark problems that
more closely resemble those found in the real world. The results, while not
representative, show that many problems possess at least one of the following
properties: they are constrained, deterministic, have only continuous
variables, require substantial computation times for both the objectives and
the constraints, or allow a limited number of evaluations. Properties like
known optimal solutions and analytical gradients are rarely available, limiting
the options in guiding the optimisation process. These are all important
aspects to consider when designing realistic benchmark problems. At the same
time, objective functions are often reported to be black-box and since many
problem properties are unknown the design of realistic benchmarks is difficult.
To further improve the understanding of real-world problems, readers working on
a real-world optimisation problem are encouraged to fill out the questionnaire:

<p>In quantum mechanics, a norm squared wave function can be interpreted as the
probability density that describes the likelihood of a particle to be measured
in a given position or momentum. This statistical property is at the core of
the microcosmos. Meanwhile, machine learning inverse design of materials raised
intensive attention, resulting in various intelligent systems for matter
engineering. Here, inspired by quantum theory, we propose a probabilistic deep
learning paradigm for the inverse design of functional meta-structures. Our
probability-density-based neural network (PDN) can accurately capture all
plausible meta-structures to meet the desired performances. Local maxima in
probability density distribution correspond to the most likely candidates. We
verify this approach by designing multiple meta-structures for each targeted
transmission spectrum to enrich design choices.

<p>Krüppel-like factors (KLFs) are zinc finger transcription factors implicated in diverse biological processes, including differentiation of neural cells. The ability of mammalian neurons to elongate axons decreases during postnatal development in parallel with a decrease in cAMP, and increase in expression of several Klf genes. The paralogous KLFs 9 and 13 inhibit neurite outgrowth, and we hypothesized that their actions are mediated through repression of cAMP signaling. To test this we used the adult mouse hippocampus-derived cell line HT22 engineered to control expression of Klf9 or Klf13 with doxycycline, or made deficient for these Klfs by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. We also used primary hippocampal cells isolated from wild type, Klf9<sup>–/–</sup> and Klf13<sup>–/–</sup> mice. Forced expression of Klf9 or Klf13 in HT22 changed the mRNA levels of several genes involved with cAMP signaling; the predominant action was gene repression, and KLF13 influenced ∼4 times more genes than KLF9. KLF9 and KLF13 repressed promoter activity of the protein kinase a catalytic subunit alpha gene in transfection-reporter assays; KLF13, but not KLF9 repressed the calmodulin 3 promoter. Forskolin activation of a cAMP-dependent promoter was reduced after forced expression of Klf9 or Klf13, but was enhanced in Klf gene knockout cells. Forced expression of Klf9 or Klf13 blocked cAMP-dependent neurite outgrowth in HT22 cells, and axon growth in primary hippocampal neurons, while Klf gene knockout enhanced the effect of elevated cAMP. Taken together, our findings show that KLF9 and KLF13 inhibit neurite/axon growth in hippocampal neurons, in part, by inhibiting the cAMP signaling pathway.</p>

<p>Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) mediate interactions of neurons with the extracellular environment by forming adhesive bonds with CAMs on adjacent membranes or via binding to proteins of the extracellular matrix. Binding of CAMs to their extracellular ligands results in the activation of intracellular signaling cascades, leading to changes in neuronal structure and the molecular composition and function of neuronal contacts. Ultimately, many of these changes depend on the synthesis of new proteins. In this review, we summarize the evidence showing that CAMs regulate protein synthesis by modulating the activity of transcription factors, gene expression, protein translation, and the structure and distribution of organelles involved in protein synthesis and transport.</p>

<p>Oxidative stress-induced neuronal damage has been implicated to play a dominant role in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Nicotine, a principal additive compound for tobacco users, is thought as a candidate to attenuate amyloid-β-mediated neurotoxicity and NMDA-induced excitotoxicity. Previous studies demonstrated that nicotine exerted this neuroprotective action on oxidative stress. However, the mechanisms underlying how nicotine contributes on oxidative injury in immortalized hippocampal HT-22 cells remain largely unknown. Therefore, in this study we investigated that the potential effects of nicotine on hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)-induced oxidative injury and underlying mechanisms in HT-22 cells. We found that pretreatment with nicotine at low concentrations markedly recovered the cell cycle that was arrested at the G2/M phase in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> through reduced intracellular ROS generation. Moreover, nicotine attenuated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced mitochondrial dysfunctions. Mechanistically, the application of nicotine significantly upregulated the levels of phosphorylated Erk1/2. The neuroprotective effects of nicotine, in turn, were abolished by PD0325901, a selective Erk1/2 inhibitor. Further obtained investigation showed that nicotine exerted its neuroprotective effects via specifically activating α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α7-nAChRs). A selective inhibitor of α7-nAChRs, methyllycaconitine citrate (MLA), not only completely prevented nicotine-mediated antioxidation but also abolished expression of p-Erk1/2. Taken together, our findings suggest that nicotine suppresses H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced HT-22 cell injury through activating the α7-nAChR/Erk1/2 signaling pathway, which indicates that nicotine may be a novel strategy for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

<p>Neurodegenerative disorders (NDD) such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases are significant causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The pathophysiology of NDD is still debated, and there is an urgent need to understand the mechanisms behind the onset and progression of these heterogenous diseases. The eye represents a unique window to the brain that can be easily assessed via non-invasive ocular imaging. As such, ocular measurements have been recently considered as potential sources of biomarkers for the early detection and management of NDD. However, the current use of ocular biomarkers in the clinical management of NDD patients is particularly challenging. Specifically, many ocular biomarkers are influenced by local and systemic factors that exhibit significant variation among individuals. In addition, there is a lack of methodology available for interpreting the outcomes of ocular examinations in NDD. Recently, mathematical modeling has emerged as an important tool capable of shedding light on the pathophysiology of multifactorial diseases and enhancing analysis and interpretation of clinical results. In this article, we review and discuss the clinical evidence of the relationship between NDD in the brain and in the eye and explore the potential use of mathematical modeling to facilitate NDD diagnosis and management based upon ocular biomarkers.</p>

<p>Essential tremor (ET) patients often experience hand tremor that impairs daily activities. Non-invasive electrical stimulation of median and radial nerves in the wrist using a recently developed therapy called transcutaneous afferent patterned stimulation (TAPS) has been shown to provide symptomatic tremor relief in ET patients and improve patients’ ability to perform functional tasks, but the duration of tremor reduction is unknown. In this single-arm, open-label study, fifteen ET patients performed four hand tremor-specific tasks (postural hold, spiral drawing, finger-to-nose reach, and pouring) from the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Clinical Rating Scale (FTM-CRS) prior to, during, and 0, 30, and 60 min following TAPS. At each time point, tremor severity was visually rated according to the FTM-CRS and simultaneously measured by wrist-worn accelerometers. The duration of tremor reduction was assessed using (1) improvement in the mean FTM-CRS score across all four tasks relative to baseline, and (2) reduction in accelerometer-measured tremor power relative to baseline for each task. Patients were labeled as having at least 60 min of therapeutic benefit from TAPS with respect to each specified metric if all three (i.e., 0, 30, and 60 min) post-therapy measurements were better than that metric’s baseline value. The mean FTM-CRS scores improved for at least 60 min beyond the end of TAPS for 80% (12 of 15, p = 4.6e–9) of patients. Similarly, for each assessed task, tremor power improved for at least 60 min beyond the end of TAPS for over 70% of patients. The postural hold task had the largest reduction in tremor power (median 5.9-fold peak reduction in tremor power) and had at least 60 min of improvement relative to baseline beyond the end of TAPS therapy for 73% (11 of 15, p = 9.8e–8) of patients. Clinical ratings of tremor severity were correlated to simultaneously recorded accelerometer-measured tremor power (r = 0.33–0.76 across the four tasks), suggesting tremor power is a valid, objective tremor assessment metric that can be used to track tremor symptoms outside the clinic. These results suggest TAPS can provide reductions in upper limb tremor symptoms for at least 1 h post-therapy in some patients, which may improve patients’ ability to perform tasks of daily living.</p>

<p>The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in the urgent need to develop and deploy treatment approaches that can minimize mortality and morbidity. As infection, resulting illness, and the often prolonged recovery period continue to be characterized, therapeutic roles for transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) have emerged as promising non-pharmacological interventions. tES techniques have established therapeutic potential for managing a range of conditions relevant to COVID-19 illness and recovery, and may further be relevant for the general management of increased mental health problems during this time. Furthermore, these tES techniques can be inexpensive, portable, and allow for trained self-administration. Here, we summarize the rationale for using tES techniques, specifically transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS), across the COVID-19 clinical course, and index ongoing efforts to evaluate the inclusion of tES optimal clinical care.</p>

<p>Immature auditory perception in children has generally been ascribed to deficiencies in cognitive factors, such as working memory and inattention. This notion appears to be commonly accepted for all children despite limited empirical evidence. In the present work, we examined whether working memory capacity would predict basic aspects of hearing, pure-tone frequency discrimination and temporal gap detection, in typically-developing, normal-hearing children (7–12 years). Contrary to our expectation, working memory capacity, as measured by digit spans, or intrinsic auditory attention (on- and off-task response variability) did not consistently predict the individual variability in auditory perception. Present results provide no evidence for a role of working memory capacity in basic measures of auditory perception in children. This lack of a relationship may partly explain why some children with perceptual deficits despite normal audiograms (commonly referred to as auditory processing disorders) may have typical cognitive abilities.</p>

<p>Pitch labeling in absolute pitch (AP), the ability to recognize the pitch class of a sound without an external reference, is effortless, fast, and presumably automatic. Previous studies have shown that pitch labeling in AP can interfere with task demands. In the current study, we used a cued auditory Go/Nogo task requiring same/different decisions to investigate both behavioral and electrophysiological correlates of increased inhibitory demands related to automatic pitch labeling. The task comprised two Nogo conditions: a Nogo condition with pitch differences larger than one semitone, and a second Nogo condition with pitch differences of only a quarter semitone. The first Nogo condition tested if auditory-related inhibition processes are generally altered in AP musicians. The second Nogo condition tested the suppressibility of the pitch labeling using a Stroop-like effect: the two tones belonged to the same pitch class but were not identical in terms of tone frequency. If pitch labeling cannot be suppressed, the conflicting information would be expected to increase the inhibitory load in AP musicians. Our data provided no evidence for an increased difficulty to inhibit a prepotent response or to suppress conflicting pitch-labeling information in AP: AP musicians showed similar commission error rates as non-AP musicians in both Nogo conditions. N2d and P3d amplitudes of AP musicians were also comparable to those of non-AP musicians. The event-related potentials (ERPs) were, however, modulated by the Nogo condition, probably indicating an effect of stimulus similarity. It is possible that, depending on the context, pitch labeling in AP musicians is not entirely automatic and can be suppressed.</p>

<p>There is controversy about the influence of compression garments on balance control. A positive influence was reported in elderly and injured individuals, whereas no beneficial effects were observed in young healthy active subjects, which is likely due to the large inter-individual differences in these subjects. Hence, this study investigated the acute effects of compression garments on balance control in young healthy active subjects by addressing the issue of heterogeneity of individuals’ responses to the wearing of compression garments. Thirteen young, healthy, active subjects were recruited. They stood on a force plate which recorded the center of foot pressure displacements in a monopedal stance with the eyes closed and on a wobble board with the eyes open, while wearing compression garments or not. Statistics were first calculated with the data from the whole sample. A hierarchical cluster analysis was also performed in order to categorize the participants’ behaviors into subgroups with similar characteristics. The whole group analysis showed that there were no significant effects attributed to compression garments. The clustering analysis identified distinct and homogeneous subgroups of participants. Only participants who swayed the more at baseline benefited from the wearing of compression garments to improve their balance control. These participants might have either a gravity-dependent preferred sensorimotor strategy with an exploratory postural behavior or poorer balance/proprioceptive abilities. Since poor balance control is a predictor of sports injury risk, wearing compression garments during sports practice could be viewed as a potential prevention strategy for individuals at risk.</p>

<p>Individuals who have suffered a severe brain injury typically require extensive hospitalization in intensive care units (ICUs), where critical treatment decisions are made to maximize their likelihood of recovering consciousness and cognitive function. These treatment decisions can be difficult when the neurological assessment of the patient is limited by unreliable behavioral responses. Reliable objective and quantifiable markers are lacking and there is both (1) a poor understanding of the mechanisms underlying the brain’s ability to reconstitute consciousness and cognition after an injury and (2) the absence of a reliable and clinically feasible method of tracking cognitive recovery in ICU survivors. Our goal is to develop and validate a clinically relevant EEG paradigm that can inform the prognosis of unresponsive, brain-injured patients in the ICU. This protocol describes a study to develop a point-of-care system intended to accurately predict outcomes of unresponsive, brain-injured patients in the ICU. We will recruit 200 continuously-sedated brain-injured patients across five ICUs. Between 24 h and 7 days post-ICU admission, high-density EEG will be recorded from behaviorally unresponsive patients before, during and after a brief cessation of pharmacological sedation. Once patients have reached the waking stage, they will be asked to complete an abridged Cambridge Brain Sciences battery, a web-based series of neurocognitive tests. The test series will be repeated every day during acute admission (ICU, ward), or as often as possible given the constraints of ICU and ward care. Following discharge, patients will continue to complete the same test series on weekly, and then monthly basis, for up to 12 months following injury. Functional outcomes will also be assessed up to 12 months post-injury. We anticipate our findings will lead to an increased ability to identify patients, as soon as possible after their brain injury, who are most likely to survive, and to make accurate predictions about their long-term cognitive and functional outcome. In addition to providing critically needed support for clinical decision-making, this study has the potential to transform our understanding of key functional EEG networks associated with consciousness and cognition.</p>

<p>Interest and investment in closed-loop or adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS) systems have quickly expanded due to this neurotechnology’s potential to more safely and effectively treat refractory movement and psychiatric disorders compared to conventional DBS. A large neuroethics literature outlines potential ethical concerns about conventional DBS and aDBS systems. Few studies, however, have examined stakeholder perspectives about ethical issues in aDBS research and other next-generation DBS devices. To help fill this gap, we conducted semi-structured interviews with researchers involved in aDBS trials (n = 23) to gain insight into the most pressing ethical questions in aDBS research and any concerns about specific features of aDBS devices, including devices’ ability to measure brain activity, automatically adjust stimulation, and store neural data. Using thematic content analysis, we identified 8 central themes in researcher responses. The need to measure and store neural data for aDBS raised concerns among researchers about data privacy and security issues (noted by 91% of researchers), including the avoidance of unintended or unwanted third-party access to data. Researchers reflected on the risks and safety (83%) of aDBS due to the experimental nature of automatically modulating then observing stimulation effects outside a controlled clinical setting and in relation to need for surgical battery changes. Researchers also stressed the importance of ensuring informed consent and adequate patient understanding (74%). Concerns related to automaticity and device programming (65%) were discussed, including current uncertainties about biomarker validity. Additionally, researchers discussed the potential impacts of automatic stimulation on patients’ autonomy and control over stimulation (57%). Lastly, researchers discussed concerns related to patient selection (defining criteria for candidacy) (39%), challenges of ensuring post-trial access to care and device maintenance (39%), and potential effects on personality and identity (30%). To help address researcher concerns, we discuss the need to minimize cybersecurity vulnerabilities, advance biomarker validity, promote the balance of device control between patients and clinicians, and enhance ongoing informed consent. The findings from this study will help inform policies that will maximize the benefits and minimize potential harms of aDBS and other next-generation DBS devices.</p>

<p>Neural patterns associated with viewing energy-dense foods can predict changes in eating-related outcomes.

The present study seeks to add to that literature by employing a more refined assessment of food craving and consumption outcomes along with a more detailed neurobiological model of behavior change over several time points. Here, a community sample of 88 individuals (age: M = 39.17, SD = 3.47; baseline BMI: M = 31.5, SD = 3.9, range 24–42) with higher body mass index (BMI) performed a food craving reactivity and regulation task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. At that time—and 1, 3, and 6 months later—participants reported craving for and consumption of healthy and unhealthy foods via the Food Craving Inventory (FCI) and ASA24 (N at 6 months = 52–55 depending on the measure). A priori hypotheses that brain activity associated with both viewing and regulating personally desired unhealthy, energy-dense foods would be associated with self-reported craving for and consumption of unhealthy foods at baseline were not supported by the data. Instead, regression models controlling for age, sex, and BMI demonstrated that brain activity across several regions measured while individuals were regulating their desires for unhealthy food was associated with the self-reported craving for and consumption of healthy food. The hypothesis that vmPFC activity would predict patterns of healthier eating was also not supported. Instead, linear mixed models controlling for baseline age and sex, as well as changes in BMI, revealed that more regulation-related activity in the dlPFC, dACC, IFG, and vmPFC at baseline predicted decreases in the craving for and consumption of healthy foods over the course of 6 months.</p>

<p>Hormonal changes across the menstrual cycle have been shown to influence reward-related motivation and impulsive behaviors. Here, with the aim of examining the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive control of impulsivity, we compared event-related monetary delay discounting task behavior and concurrent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) revealed brain activity as well as resting state (rs)-fMRI activity, between women in the mid-luteal phase (LP) and women in the late follicular phase (FP). The behavioral data were analyzed and related to neural activation data. In the delay discounting task, women in the late FP were more responsive to short-term rewards (i.e., showed a greater discount rate) than women in the mid-LP, while also showing greater activity in the dorsal striatum (DS). Discount rate (transformed k) correlated with functional connectivity between the DS and dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), consistent with previous findings indicating that DS-dlPFC circuitry may regulate impulsivity. Our rs-fMRI data further showed that the right dlPFC was significantly more active in the mid-LP than in late FP, and this effect was sensitive to absolute and relative estradiol levels during the mid-LP. DS-dlPFC functional connectivity magnitude correlated negatively with psychometric impulsivity scores during the late FP, consistent with our behavioral data and further indicating that relative estradiol levels may play an important role in augmenting cognitive control. These findings provide new insight into the treatment of conditions characterized by hyper-impulsivity, such as obsessive compulsive disorder, Parkinson disease, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. In conclusion, our results suggest that cyclical gonadal hormones affect cognitive control of impulsive behavior in a periodic manner, possibility via DS-dlPFC circuitry.</p>

<p>Environmental hyperthermia is a common risk factor for occupational safety in many situations due to decreased vigilance performances. Previously, we have reported that decreased resting-state functional connectivity within the default mode network (DMN) and decreased activations in dorsal attention network (DAN) such as dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) were correlated with selective attention deficits during hyperthermia. However, whether the inherent functionally organized anti-correlation between the DMN and DAN would contribute to the behavioral deficits remains unclear. In this study, we collected the resting-state fMRI data of 25 participants during two simulated thermal conditions: normothermic condition (25°C for 1 h) and hyperthermic condition (50°C for 1 h). Using group independent component analysis (ICA), we investigated the functional connectivity within the DMN and DAN, as well as the anti-correlations between both networks. Paired comparisons revealed that decreased intranetwork functional connectivity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)/anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in the DMN contributed to executive control performance during hyperthermia using multivariate linear regression analysis. Paired comparison on the DAN showed that increased one in the posterior part of the middle and inferior temporal gyrus nearby the temporal–parietal junction area contributed to preserved alerting performance. Lastly but most importantly, we found that decreased correlation between mPFC in the DMN and intraparietal sulcus (IPS) area in the DAN contributed to the executive control deficit, suggesting a weaker intrinsic anti-correlation between DMN and DAN during hyperthermia. These findings indicated that a functional reorganized architecture of DMN and DAN might provide a potential neural basis of the selective deficits for different cognitive-demand attention tasks in high-temperature environments.</p>

<p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are considered as the third generation of artificial neural networks, which are more closely with information processing in biological brains. However, it is still a challenge for how to train the non-differential SNN efficiently and robustly with the form of spikes. Here we give an alternative method to train SNNs by biologically-plausible structural and functional inspirations from the brain. Firstly, inspired by the significant top-down structural connections, a global random feedback alignment is designed to help the SNN propagate the error target from the output layer directly to the previous few layers. Then inspired by the local plasticity of the biological system in which the synapses are more tuned by the neighborhood neurons, a differential STDP is used to optimize local plasticity. Extensive experimental results on the benchmark MNIST (98.62%) and Fashion MNIST (89.05%) have shown that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against several state-of-the-art SNNs trained with backpropagation.</p>

<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of disability and mortality in children and young adults and has a profound impact on the socio-economic wellbeing of patients and their families. Initially, brain damage is caused by mechanical stress-induced axonal injury and vascular dysfunction, which can include hemorrhage, blood-brain barrier disruption, and ischemia. Subsequent neuronal degeneration, chronic inflammation, demyelination, oxidative stress, and the spread of excitotoxicity can further aggravate disease pathology. Thus, TBI treatment requires prompt intervention to protect against neuronal and vascular degeneration. Rapid advances in the field of stem cells (SCs) have revolutionized the prospect of repairing brain function following TBI. However, more than that, SCs can contribute substantially to our knowledge of this multifaced pathology. Research, based on human induced pluripotent SCs (hiPSCs) can help decode the molecular pathways of degeneration and recovery of neuronal and glial function, which makes these cells valuable tools for drug screening. Additionally, experimental approaches that include hiPSC-derived engineered tissues (brain organoids and bio-printed constructs) and biomaterials represent a step forward for the field of regenerative medicine since they provide a more suitable microenvironment that enhances cell survival and grafting success. In this review, we highlight the important role of hiPSCs in better understanding the molecular pathways of TBI-related pathology and in developing novel therapeutic approaches, building on where we are at present. We summarize some of the most relevant findings for regenerative therapies using biomaterials and outline key challenges for TBI treatments that remain to be addressed.</p>

<p>Background: Hereditary hearing loss is a disorder with high genetic and allelic heterogeneity. Diagnostic screening of candidate genes commonly yields novel variants of unknown clinical significance. TBC1D24 is a pleiotropic gene associated with recessive DOORS syndrome, epileptic encephalopathy, myoclonic epilepsy, and both recessive and dominant hearing impairment. Genotype-phenotype correlations have not been established to date but could facilitate diagnostic variant assessment and elucidation of pathomechanisms.</p><p>Methods and Results: Whole-exome and gene panel screening identified a novel (c.919A&gt;C; p.Asn307His) causative variant in TBC1D24 in two unrelated Caucasian families with Autosomal dominant (AD) nonsyndromic late-onset hearing loss. Protein modeling on the Drosophila TBC1D24 ortholog Skywalker crystal structure showed close interhelix proximity (6.8Å) between the highly conserved residue p.Asn307 in α18 and the position of the single known pathogenic dominant variation (p.Ser178Leu) in α11 that causes a form of deafness with similar clinical characteristics.</p><p>Conclusion: Genetic variants affecting two polar hydrophilic residues in neighboring helices of TBC1D24 cause AD nonsyndromic late-onset hearing loss. The spatial proximity of the affected residues suggests the first genotype-phenotype association in TBC1D24-related disorders. Three conserved residues in α18 contribute to the formation of a functionally relevant cationic phosphoinositide binding pocket that regulates synaptic vesicle trafficking which may be involved in the molecular mechanism of disease.</p>

<p>Sensorineural hearing loss is a common disability often caused by the loss of sensory hair cells in the cochlea. Hair cell (HCs) regeneration has long been the main target for the development of novel therapeutics for sensorineural hearing loss. In the mammalian cochlea, hair cell regeneration is limited, but the auditory epithelia of non-mammalian organisms retain the capacity for hair cell regeneration. In the avian basilar papilla (BP), supporting cells (SCs), which give rise to regenerated hair cells, are usually quiescent. Hair cell loss induces both direct transdifferentiation and mitotic division of supporting cells. Here, we established an explant culture model for hair cell regeneration in chick basilar papillae and validated it for investigating the initial phase of hair cell regeneration. The histological assessment demonstrated hair cell regeneration via direct transdifferentiation of supporting cells. Labeling with 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) revealed the occurrence of mitotic division in the supporting cells at specific locations in the basilar papillae, while no EdU labeling was observed in newly generated hair cells. RNA sequencing indicated alterations in known signaling pathways associated with hair cell regeneration, consistent with previous findings. Also, unbiased analyses of RNA sequencing data revealed novel genes and signaling pathways that may be related to the induction of supporting cell activation in the chick basilar papillae. These results indicate the advantages of our explant culture model of the chick basilar papillae for exploring the molecular mechanisms of hair cell regeneration.</p>

<p>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have presented a promising neuroprotective effect in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Olfactory mucosa MSCs (OM-MSCs), a novel source of MSCs located in the human nasal cavity, are easy to obtain and situated for autologous transplantation. The present study was designed to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of OM-MSCs on cerebral I/R injury and the possible mechanisms. In the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (t-MCAO) model, excessive oxidative stress and increased swollen mitochondria were observed in the peri-infarct cortex. Intravenous injection of OM-MSCs ameliorated mitochondrial damage and restored oxidant/antioxidant imbalance. Using the oxygen glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) model in vitro, we discovered that the exposure of mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells to OGD/R triggers excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and induces mitochondrial deterioration with decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and reduces ATP content. OM-MSC transwell coculture attenuated the above perturbations accompanied with increased UbiA prenyltransferase domain-containing 1 (UBIAD1) expression, whereas these protective effects of OM-MSCs were blocked when UBIAD1 was knocked down. UBIAD1-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) reversed the increased membrane potential and ATP content promoted by OM-MSCs. Additionally, UBIAD1-specific siRNA blocked the oxidant/antioxidant balance treated by OM-MSCs. Overall, our results suggested that OM-MSCs exert neuroprotective effects in cerebral I/R injury by attenuating mitochondrial dysfunction and enhancing antioxidation via upregulation of UBIAD1.</p>

<p>Sound localization requires extremely precise development of auditory brainstem circuits, the molecular mechanisms of which are largely unknown. We previously demonstrated a novel requirement for non-apoptotic activity of the protease caspase-3 in chick auditory brainstem development. Here, we used mass spectrometry to identify proteolytic substrates of caspase-3 during chick auditory brainstem development. These auditory brainstem caspase-3 substrates were enriched for proteins previously shown to be cleaved by caspase-3, especially in non-apoptotic contexts. Functional annotation analysis revealed that our caspase-3 substrates were also enriched for proteins associated with several protein categories, including proteins found in extracellular vesicles (EVs), membrane-bound nanoparticles that function in intercellular communication. The proteome of EVs isolated from the auditory brainstem was highly enriched for our caspase-3 substrates. Additionally, we identified two caspase-3 substrates with known functions in axon guidance, namely Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule (NCAM) and Neuronal-glial Cell Adhesion Molecule (Ng-CAM), that were found in auditory brainstem EVs and expressed in the auditory pathway alongside cleaved caspase-3. Taken together, these data suggest a novel developmental mechanism whereby caspase-3 influences auditory brainstem circuit formation through the proteolytic cleavage of extracellular vesicle (EV) proteins.</p>

<p>Cognitive demands for postural control increase with aging and cognitive-motor interference (CMI) exists for a number of walking situations, especially with visuo-spatial cognitive tasks. Such interference also influences spatial learning abilities among older adults; however, this is rarely considered in research on aging in spatial navigation. We posited that visually and physically exploring an unknown environment may be subject to CMI for older adults. We investigated potential indicators of postural control interfering with spatial learning. Given known associations between age-related alterations in gait and brain structure, we also examined potential neuroanatomical correlates of this interference. Fourteen young and 14 older adults had to find an invisible goal in an unfamiliar, real, ecological environment. We measured walking speed, trajectory efficiency (direct route over taken route) and goal fixations (proportion of visual fixations toward the goal area). We calculated the change in walking speed between the first and last trials and adaptation indices for all three variables to quantify their modulation across learning trials. All participants were screened with a battery of visuo-cognitive tests. Eighteen of our participants (10 young, 8 older) also underwent a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination. Older adults reduced their walking speed considerably on the first, compared to the last trial. The adaptation index of walking speed correlated positively with those of trajectory efficiency and goal fixations, indicating a reduction in resource sharing between walking and encoding the environment. The change in walking speed correlated negatively with gray matter volume in superior parietal and occipital regions and the precuneus. We interpret older adults’ change in walking speed as indicative of CMI, similar to dual task costs. This is supported by the correlations between the adaptation indices and between the change in walking speed and gray matter volume in brain regions that are important for navigation, given that they are involved in visual attention, sensory integration and encoding of space. These findings under ecological conditions in a natural spatial learning task question what constitutes dual tasking in older adults and they can lead future research to reconsider the actual cognitive burden of postural control in aging navigation research.</p>

Objectives<p>To investigate the value of MRI-based radiomic model based on the radiomic features of different basal nuclei in differentiating idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (IPD) from Parkinsonian variants of multiple system atrophy (MSA-P).</p>Methods<p>Radiomics was applied to the 3T susceptibility- weighted imaging (SWI) from 102 MSA-P patients and 83 IPD patients (allocated to a training and a testing cohort, 7:3 ratio). The substantia nigra (SN), caudate nucleus (CN), putamen (PUT), globus pallidus (GP), red nucleus (RN), and subthalamic nucleus (STN) were manually segmented, and 396 features were extracted. After feature selection, support vector machine (SVM) was generated, and its predictive performance was calculated in both the training and testing cohorts using the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).</p>Results<p>Seven radiomic features were selected from the PUT, by which the SVM classifier achieved the best diagnostic performance with an AUC of 0.867 in the training cohort and an AUC of 0.862 in the testing cohort. Furthermore, the combined model, which incorporating part III of the Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRSIII) scores into radiomic features of the PUT, further improved the diagnostic performance. However, radiomic features extracted from RN, SN, GP, CN, and STN had moderate to poor diagnostic performance, with AUC values that ranged from 0.610 to 0.788 in the training cohort and 0.583 to 0.766 in the testing cohort.</p>Conclusion<p>Radiomic features derived from the PUT had optimal value in differentiating IPD from MSA-P. A combined radiomic model, which contained radiomic features of the PUT and UPDRSIII scores, further improved performance and may represent a promising tool for distinguishing between IPD and MSA-P.</p>

<p>Financial exploitation (FE) in old age is devastating and common; however, the neural correlates of FE are poorly understood. Previous studies of FE in older adults have implicated declines in decision making and social cognition as two risk factors for FE in later life. Here we examined whether functional connectivity among brain regions implicated in decision making and social cognition differed for those with an experience of FE vs. those without. Participants included 16 older adults without cognitive impairment who reported FE (Mean age = 70.5, 62.5% female, Mean education = 16.0 years) and 16 demographically and cognitively matched adults who denied a history of FE (Mean age = 65.1, 37.5% female, Mean education = 15.1 years). Measures of whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity in the hippocampus, insula, and medial frontal cortex were derived for each group. Compared to the non-FE group, FE was associated with greater functional connectivity between the right hippocampus and bilateral temporal regions, and less functional connectivity between the right hippocampus and the right cerebellum and bilateral lingual gyri. The FE group showed less connectivity between the right and left insula and cingulate cortex, and between the right insula and regions of the left lateral temporal gyrus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Finally, the FE group showed greater functional connectivity between the medial frontal cortex and the right lateral temporal gyrus and orbitofrontal cortex, and less functional connectivity with the right pre- and postcentral gyri. Results suggest that perceived FE in old age is associated with whole-brain functional connectivity differences involving the hippocampus, insula, and medial frontal cortex, consistent with models implicating age-associated changes in decision making and social cognition in FE.</p>

<p>The disease biology of frontotemporal lobe dementia (FTD) is complex and not fully understood, with limited translational value appreciated from animal models to date. Human cellular systems that can recapitulate phenotypic features of disease offer promise as translational tools to not only increase our understanding of disease processes but also increase the probability of success of translating novel treatment options to patients. However not all researchers may necessarily have access to well-characterized induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived human neurons. As an example, we therefore comprehensively profiled phenotypic features over time in one commercially-available IPSC-derived human neuron cell line. This included systems-level assessments of neurite outgrowth dynamics, neuronal network function, and genome-wide gene expression. By investigating progranulin biology as an example we then demonstrated the utility of these cells as a tool to investigate human disease biology. For example, by using the siRNA-mediated knockdown of the progranulin (GRN) gene, we demonstrated the establishment of an isogenic human cellular model to facilitate translational FTD research. We reproduced findings from rodent neurons by demonstrating that recombinant progranulin (rPGRN) mediated neuroprotection. Contrary to previous rodent data, in our human cellular models, growth factor treatment showed no consistent sensitivity to modulate neurite outgrowth dynamics. Our study further provides the first evidence that rRPGRN modulated neuronal firing and synchrony in human neurons. Taken together, our datasets are a valuable systems-level resource demonstrating the utility of the tested commercially-available human iPSC neurons for investigating basic human neurobiology, translational neuroscience, and drug discovery applications in neurodegenerative and other CNS diseases.</p>

<p>Age-related deficits in selective attention have been demonstrated to depend on the sensory modality through which targets and distractors are presented. Some of these investigations suggest a specific impairment of cross-modal auditory selective attention. For the first time, this study is taking on a whole brain approach while including a passive perception baseline, to investigate the neural underpinnings of selective attention across age groups, and taking the sensory modality of relevant and irrelevant (i.e., distracting) stimuli into account. Sixteen younger (mean age = 23.3 years) and 14 older (mean age = 65.3 years), healthy participants performed a series of delayed match-to-sample tasks, in which participants had to selectively attend to visual stimuli, selectively attend to auditory stimuli, or passively view and hear both types of stimuli, while undergoing 3T fMRI. The imaging analyses showed that areas recruited by cross-modal visual and auditory selective attention in both age groups included parts of the dorsal attention and frontoparietal control networks (i.e., intraparietal sulcus, insula, fusiform gyrus, anterior cingulate, and inferior frontal cortex). Most importantly, activation throughout the brain did not differ across age groups, suggesting intact brain function during cross-modal selective attention in older adults. Moreover, stronger brain activation during cross-modal visual vs. cross-modal auditory selective attention was found in both age groups, which is consistent with earlier accounts of visual dominance. In conclusion, these results do not support the hypothesized age-related deficit of cross-modal auditory selective attention. Instead, they suggest that the underlying neural correlates of cross-modal selective attention are similar in younger and older adults.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/62669">Systematic identification of <i>cis</i>-regulatory variants that cause gene expression differences in a yeast cross</a></h4>

Sequence variation in regulatory DNA alters gene expression and shapes genetically complex traits. However, the identification of individual, causal regulatory variants is challenging. Here, we used a massively parallel reporter assay to measure the <i>cis</i>-regulatory consequences of 5,832 natural DNA variants in the promoters of 2,503 genes in the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. We identified 451 causal variants, which underlie genetic loci known to affect gene expression. Several promoters harbored multiple causal variants. In five promoters, pairs of variants showed non-additive, epistatic interactions. Causal variants were enriched at conserved nucleotides, tended to have low derived allele frequency, and were depleted from promoters of essential genes, which is consistent with the action of negative selection. Causal variants were also enriched for alterations in transcription factor binding sites. Models integrating these features provided modest, but statistically significant, ability to predict causal variants. This work revealed a complex molecular basis for <i>cis</i>-acting regulatory variation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/60528">A motogenic GABAergic system of mononuclear phagocytes facilitates dissemination of coccidian parasites</a></h4>

Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) serves diverse biological functions in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, including neurotransmission in vertebrates. Yet, the role of GABA in the immune system has remained elusive. Here, a comprehensive characterization of human and murine myeloid mononuclear phagocytes revealed the presence of a conserved and tightly regulated GABAergic machinery with expression of GABA metabolic enzymes and transporters, GABA-A receptors and regulators, and voltage-dependent calcium channels. Infection challenge with the common coccidian parasites <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> and <i>Neospora caninum</i> activated GABAergic signaling in phagocytes. Using gene silencing and pharmacological modulators <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> in mice, we identify the functional determinants of GABAergic signaling in parasitized phagocytes and demonstrate a link to calcium responses and migratory activation. The findings reveal a regulatory role for a GABAergic signaling machinery in the host-pathogen interplay between phagocytes and invasive coccidian parasites. The co-option of GABA underlies colonization of the host by a <i>Trojan horse</i> mechanism.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/60419">Synergy between Wsp1 and Dip1 may initiate assembly of endocytic actin networks</a></h4>

The actin filament nucleator Arp2/3 complex is activated at cortical sites in <i>S. pombe</i> to assemble branched actin networks that drive endocytosis. Arp2/3 complex activators Wsp1 and Dip1 are required for proper actin assembly at endocytic sites, but how they coordinately control Arp2/3-mediated actin assembly is unknown. Alone, Dip1 activates Arp2/3 complex without preexisting actin filaments to nucleate 'seed' filaments that activate Wsp1-bound Arp2/3 complex, thereby initiating branched actin network assembly. In contrast, because Wsp1 requires pre-existing filaments to activate, it has been assumed to function exclusively in propagating actin networks by stimulating branching from pre-existing filaments. Here we show that Wsp1 is important not only for propagation, but also for initiation of endocytic actin networks. Using single molecule TIRF microscopy we show that Wsp1 synergizes with Dip1 to co-activate Arp2/3 complex. Synergistic coactivation does not require pre-existing actin filaments, explaining how Wsp1 contributes to actin network initiation in cells.

Robust biomarkers of aging have been developed from DNA methylation in humans and more recently, in mice. This study aimed to generate a novel epigenetic clock in rats—a model with unique physical, physiological, and biochemical advantages—by incorporating behavioral data, unsupervised machine learning, and network analysis to identify epigenetic signals that not only track with age, but also relates to phenotypic aging. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) data was used to train an epigenetic age (DNAmAge) measure in Fischer 344 CDF (F344) rats. This measure correlated with age at (r = 0.93) in an independent sample, and related to physical functioning (p=5.9e-3), after adjusting for age and cell counts. DNAmAge was also found to correlate with age in male C57BL/6 mice (r = 0.79), and was decreased in response to caloric restriction. Our signatures driven by CpGs in intergenic regions that showed substantial overlap with H3K9me3, H3K27me3, and E2F1 transcriptional factor binding.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58069">BLOS1 mediates kinesin switch during endosomal recycling of LDL receptor</a></h4>

Low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) in hepatocytes plays a key role in normal clearance of circulating LDL and in whole body cholesterol homeostasis. The trafficking of LDLR is highly regulated in clathrin-dependent endocytosis, endosomal recycling and lysosomal degradation. Current studies focus on its endocytosis and degradation. However, the detailed molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying its endosomal recycling are largely unknown. We found that BLOS1, a shared subunit of BLOC-1 and BORC, is involved in LDLR endosomal recycling. Loss of BLOS1 leads to less membrane LDLR and impairs LDL clearance from plasma in hepatocyte-specific BLOS1 knockout mice. BLOS1 interacts with kinesin-3 motor KIF13A, and BLOS1 acts as a new adaptor for kinesin-2 motor KIF3 to coordinate kinesin-3 and kinesin-2 during the long-range transport of recycling endosomes (REs) to plasma membrane along microtubule tracks to overcome hurdles at microtubule intersections. This provides new insights into RE's anterograde transport and the pathogenesis of dyslipidemia.

Owing to its high numerical aperture optics, this microscope achieves lateral and axial resolutions that are comparable to the square illumination mode of Lattice Light-Sheet Microscopy, but in a user friendly and versatile format. Given this performance, we demonstrate high-resolution imaging of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, vimentin, the endoplasmic reticulum, membrane dynamics, and Natural Killer-mediated cytotoxicity. Furthermore, we image biological phenomena that would be otherwise challenging or impossible to perform in a traditional light-sheet microscope geometry, including cell migration through confined spaces within a microfluidic device, subcellular photoactivation of Rac1, diffusion of cytoplasmic rheological tracers at a volumetric rate of 14 Hz, and large field of view imaging of neurons, developing embryos, and centimeter-scale tissue sections.

The problem of selecting one action from a set of different possible actions, simply referred to as the problem of action selection, is a ubiquitous challenge in the animal world. For vertebrates, the basal ganglia (BG) are widely thought to implement the core computation to solve this problem, as the anatomy and physiology of the BG are well-suited to this end. However, the BG still displays physiological features whose role in achieving efficient action selection remains unclear. In particular, it is known that the two types of dopaminergic receptors (D1 and D2) present in the BG give rise to mechanistically different responses. The overall effect will be a difference in sensitivity to dopamine which may have ramifications for action selection. However, which receptor type leads to a stronger response is, a priori, unclear, due to the complexity of the intracellular mechanisms involved. In this study, we use the action selection hypothesis to {em predict} which of D1 or D2 has the greater sensitivity. Thus, we ask - what sensitivity ratio would result in enhanced action selection functionality in the basal ganglia? To do this, we incorporated differential D1 and D2 sensitivity in an existing, high level computational model of the macro-architecture of the basal ganglia, via a simple weighting variable. We then quantitatively assessed the model's capacity to perform action selection as we parametrically manipulated the new feature. We show that differential (rather than equal) D1 and D2 sensitivity to dopaminergic input improves action selection, and specifically, that greater D1 sensitivity (compared to that for D2) leads to these improvements.

Rett syndrome is a devastating childhood neurological disorder caused by mutations in MECP2. Of the many symptoms, motor deterioration is a significant problem for patients. In mice, deleting Mecp2 from the cortex or basal ganglia causes motor dysfunction, hypoactivity, and tremor, which are abnormalities observed in patients. However, little is known about the consequences of deleting Mecp2 from the cerebellum, a brain region critical for motor function. Here we show that deleting Mecp2 from the entire cerebellum, but not from individual cerebellar cell types, causes a delay in motor learning that is overcome by additional training. We also observed irregular firing rates of Purkinje cells and transcriptional misregulation within the cerebellum of knockout mice. These findings demonstrate that the motor deficits present in Rett syndrome arise, in part, from cerebellar dysfunction. For Rett syndrome as well as other neurodevelopmental disorders, our results highlight the importance of understanding which brain regions contribute to disease phenotypes.

The expression of immediate early genes (IEGs) in visual cortex can be triggered by visual input and is associated with certain forms of neuronal plasticity. How IEG expression in cortical neurons relates to neuronal activity or experience-dependent changes of neuronal activity, however, is still unclear. Using three transgenic mouse lines that express GFP under the control of different IEG promoters (c-fos, egr1 or Arc), we recorded both neuronal activity and IEG expression levels in primary visual cortex before and after a mouse's first visual exposure, and subsequent visuomotor learning. We found that expression levels of all three IEGs correlated positively with neuronal activity, and that different IEGs are preferentially expressed in different functional cell types. Neurons with strong motor-related activity preferentially expressed EGR1 while neurons that developed strong visually driven activity preferentially expressed Arc. Our findings suggest that during functional development of visual cortex different IEGs are preferentially expressed in neurons that receive different functional types of input.

Long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD) of excitatory neurotransmission are believed to be the neuronal basis of learning and memory. Both processes are primarily mediated by neuronal activity-induced transport of postsynaptic AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs). While AMPAR subunits and their specific phosphorylation sites mediate differential AMPAR trafficking, LTP and LTD could also occur in a subunit-independent manner. Thus, it remains unclear whether and how, certain AMPAR subunits with phosphorylation sites are preferentially recruited to or removed from synapses during LTP and LTD. Here, we show that phosphorylation of the membrane-proximal region (MPR), which only occurs in GluA1 AMPAR subunits, mediates the subunit-dependent endosomal transport of AMPARs during LTD. AP-2 and AP-3, adaptor protein complexes necessary for clathrin-mediated endocytosis and late endosomal/lysosomal trafficking, respectively, are reported to be recruited to AMPARs by binding to the AMPAR auxiliary subunit, stargazin (STG), in an AMPAR subunit-independent manner. However, the association of AP-3, but not AP-2, with STG was indirectly inhibited by the phosphomimetic mutation in the MPR of GluA1. Thus, although AMPARs containing the phosphomimetic mutation at the MPR of GluA1 were endocytosed by a LTD-inducing stimulus, they were quickly recycled back to the cell surface in hippocampal neurons. These results could explain how the phosphorylation status of GluA1-MPR plays a dominant role in subunit-independent STG-mediated AMPAR trafficking during LTD.

Complex social behaviors are mediated by the activity of highly intricate neuronal networks, the function of which is shaped by their transcriptomic and proteomic content. Contemporary advances in neurogenetics, genomics, and tools for automated behavior analysis make it possible to functionally connect the transcriptome profile of candidate neurons to their role in regulating behavior. In this study we used Drosophila melanogaster to explore the molecular signature of neurons expressing receptor for neuropeptide F (NPF), the fly homologue of neuropeptide Y (NPY). By comparing the transcription profile of NPFR neurons to those of nine other populations of neurons, we discovered that NPFR neurons exhibit a unique transcriptome, enriched with receptors for various neuropeptides and neuromodulators, as well as with genes known to regulate behavioral processes, such as learning and memory. By manipulating RNA editing and protein ubiquitination programs specifically in NPFR neurons, we demonstrate that their delicate transcriptome and proteome repertoires are required to suppress male courtship and certain features of social group interaction. Our results highlight the importance of transcriptome and proteome diversity in the regulation of complex behaviors and pave the path for future dissection of the spatiotemporal regulation of genes within highly complex tissues, such as the brain.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder, characterized by intellectual disability and sensory deficits, caused by epigenetic silencing of the FMR1 gene and subsequent loss of its protein product, fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Delays in synaptic and neuronal development in the cortex have been reported in FXS mouse models, however, the main goal of translating lab research into pharmacological treatments in clinical trials has been so far largely unsuccessful, leaving FXS a still incurable disease. Here, we generated 2D and 3D in vitro human FXS model systems based on isogenic FMR1 knock-out mutant and wild-type human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines. Phenotypical and functional characterization of cortical neurons derived from FMRP-deficient hiPSCs display altered gene expression and impaired differentiation when compared with the healthy counterpart. FXS cortical cultures show increased proliferation of GFAP positive cells, likely astrocytes, increased spontaneous network activity and depolarizing GABAergic transmission. Cortical brain organoid models show increased proliferation of glial cells, and bigger organoid size. Our findings demonstrate that FMRP is required to correctly support neuronal and glial cell proliferation, and to set the correct excitation/inhibition ratio in human brain development.

Circadian rhythms are entrained by light and influenced by non-photic stimuli, such as feeding. The activity preceding scheduled mealtimes, food anticipatory activity (FAA), is elicited in rodents fed a limited amount at scheduled times. FAA is thought to be the output of an unidentified food entrained oscillator. Previous studies, using gene deletion and receptor pharmacology, implicated dopamine type receptor 1 (D1R) signaling in the dorsal striatum as necessary for FAA in mice. To further understand the role of D1R in promoting FAA, we utilized the Cre-lox system to create cell type-specific deletions of D1R. We were unsuccessful in obtaining conditional deletion of D1R when using transgenically driven D1R-Cre. We then created a conditional deletion of D1R in GABA neurons using Vgat-ires-Cre line, which had attenuated FAA, but the amount was higher than expected based on prior results using a constitutive knockout of D1R, D1R KODrago. This result prompted us to re-test the original D1R KODrago line, which expressed less FAA than controls, but only moderately so. To determine if genetic drift had diminished the effect of D1R deletion on FAA, we re-established the D1R KODrago knockout line from cryopreserved samples. The reestablished D1R KODrago-cryo had a clear impairment of FAA compared to controls, but still developed increased activity preceding mealtime across the 4 weeks of timed feeding. Finally, we tested a different deletion allele of D1R created by the Knockout Mouse Project. This line of D1R KOKOMP mice had a significant impairment in the acquisition of FAA, but eventually reached similar levels of premeal activity compared to controls after 4 weeks of timed feeding. Taken together, our results suggest that D1R signaling promotes FAA, but other dopamine receptors likely contribute to FAA given that mice lacking the D1 receptor still retain some FAA.

The available literature provides relatively little information on the morphology of the autonomic head ganglia in rodents including their neurochemical codding. The present study was thus designed to investigate the morphology and neurochemical properties of the otic ganglion in the chinchilla. The results will contribute to our knowledge of the organization of the autonomic nerve system in mammals. Morphological investigations of the otic ganglion were performed using the modified acetylcholinesterase method. The cellular structure were investigated with histological techniques and neurochemical properties were studied with double-labelling immunofluorescence method Mocromorphological investigations allowed the otic ganglion to be identified as a compact, oval agglomeration of neurons and nerve fibers   located inside the skull on the medial surface of the mandibular nerve, just above the oval foramen. Multidimensional cross-sections revealed densely arranged neuronal perikarya and two populations of nerve cells differing in size were distinguished. The large cells (40-50 {micro}m) accounted for about 80% of the neurons in the otic ganglion cross-sections. Moreover, a small number of intraganglionic nerve fibers was observed. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that over 85% of the neuronal cell bodies in the otic ganglion contained immunoreactivity to VACHT or CHAT. VIP-immunoreactive perikarya comprised approximately 10% of the ganglionic cells. Double staining revealed the presence of VACHT and NOS-positive neurons which amounted to about 45% of the nerve cells in the otic ganglion. NOS-positive only perikarya comprised approx. 15% of all the neurons. Immunoreactivity to enkephalines, substance P, somatostatin and galanin was expressed in single nerve cell bodies and nerve fibres except numerous SP-positive intraganglionic nerve fibres. Some of them stained also for CGRP. Single neurons stained for TH. The present results, compared with previous findings, suggest the existence interspecies differences in the morphology, cellular structure and immunohistochemical properties of the  head autonomic ganglia in mammals.

Presynaptic terminals have been little studied as sites of synaptic integration because of inaccessibility. Gi/o-mediated presynaptic inhibition is ubiquitous and either reduces release probability (Pr) by inhibiting Ca2+ entry or inhibits directly at SNARE complexes. At CA1-subicular presynapses, 5-HT1B and GABAB receptors colocalize. GABABRs inhibit Ca2+ entry, whereas 5-HT1BRs Ca2+-dependently target SNARE complexes. We demonstrate that GABABRs, alter Pr, but 5-HT1BRs reduce cleft glutamate concentrations allowing strong inhibition of AMPA- but not NMDA-receptor responses. Simulations of glutamate release and receptor binding demonstrates that experimental effects on release and low affinity antagonism are well-fit by reduced release rates. Train-dependent presynaptic Ca2+ accumulation forces frequency-dependent recovery of neurotransmission during 5-HT1BR activation, consistent with competition between Ca2+-synaptotagmin and G{beta}{gamma} at SNARE complexes. Thus, stimulus trains in 5-HT unveil dynamic synaptic modulation and a sophisticated hippocampal output filter, that itself is modulated by colocalized GABABRs which alter presynaptic Ca2+ allowing complex presynaptic integration.

Age is the greatest risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD) which causes progressive loss of dopamine (DA) neurons, with males at greater risk than females. We found that vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT) expression mediates vulnerability to age-related DA neurodegeneration in a sex-dependent manner, providing a new mechanism for sex differences in DA neuron vulnerability. These findings lay the groundwork for novel therapeutic strategies to boost neuronal resilience throughout aging.

Efforts to explain jury decisions have focused on competing models emphasizing utility, narrative, and social-affective mechanisms, but these are difficult to distinguish using behavior alone. Here, we use patterns of brain activation derived from large neuroimaging databases to look for signatures of the cognitive processes associated with models of juror decision making. We asked jury-eligible subjects to rate the strength of a series of criminal cases while recording the resulting patterns of brain activation. When subjects considered evidence, utility and narrative processes were both active, but cognitive processes associated with narrative models better explain the patterns of brain activation. In contrast, a biasing effect of crime type on perceived strength of the case was best explained by brain patterns associated with social cognition.

Glia in the central nervous system engulf neuron fragments during synapse remodeling and recycling of photo-receptor outer-segments. Whether glia passively clear shed neuronal debris, or actively remove neuron fragments is unknown. How pruning of single-neuron endings impacts animal behavior is also unclear. Here we report that adult C. elegans AMsh glia engulf sensory endings of the AFD thermosensory neuron. Engulfment is regulated by temperature, AFD sensory input, and tracks AFD activity. Phosphatidylserine (PS) flippase TAT-1/ATP8A, functions with glial PS-receptor PSR-1/PSR and PAT-2/-integrin to initiate engulfment. Glial CED-10/Rac1 GTPase, acting through a conserved GEF complex, executes phagocytosis using the actin-remodeler WSP-1/nWASp and the membrane-sealing factor EFF-1 fusogen. CED-10 levels determine engulfment rates, and engulfment-defective mutants exhibit altered AFD-ending shape and thermosensory behavior. Our findings reveal a molecular pathway underpinning glia-dependent phagocytosis in a peripheral sense-organ, and demonstrate that glia actively engulf neuron-fragments, with profound consequences on neuron shape and animal behavior.

An enduring neuroscientific debate concerns the extent to which neural representation is restricted to networks of patches specialized for particular domains of perceptual input (Kaniwsher et al., 1997; Livingstone et al., 2019), or distributed outside of these patches to broad areas of cortex as well (Haxby et al., 2001; Op de Beeck, 2008). A critical level for this debate is the localization of the neural representation of the identity of individual images, (Spiridon &amp; Kanwisher, 2002) such as individual-level face or written word recognition. To address this debate, intracranial recordings from 489 electrodes throughout ventral temporal cortex across 17 human subjects were used to assess the spatiotemporal dynamics of individual word and face processing within and outside cortical patches strongly selective for these categories of visual information. Individual faces and words were first represented primarily only in strongly selective patches and then represented in both strongly and weakly selective areas approximately 170 milliseconds later. Strongly and weakly selective areas contributed non-redundant information to the representation of individual images. These results can reconcile previous results endorsing disparate poles of the domain specificity debate by highlighting the temporally segregated contributions of different functionally defined cortical areas to individual level representations. Taken together, this work supports a dynamic model of neural representation characterized by successive domain-specific and distributed processing stages.

The intracellular misfolding and accumulation of alpha-synuclein into structures collectively called Lewy pathology is a central phenomenon for the pathogenesis of Parkinsons disease (PD), Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB), and Multiple System Atrophy. Understanding the molecular architecture of Lewy pathology is crucial for understanding disease origins and progression. Here we developed a method to label, extract, and purify molecules from Lewy pathology of formalin fixed PD and DLB brain for blotting and mass spectrometry analysis. Using the biotinylation antibody recognition (BAR) technique, we labeled phosphoserine 129 alpha-synuclein positive pathology and associated molecules with biotin. Formalin crosslinks were then reversed, protein extracted, and pathology associated molecules isolated with streptavidin beads. Results showed superior immunohistochemical staining of Lewy pathology following the BAR protocol when compared to standard avidin biotin complex (ABC) based detection. The enhanced staining was particularly apparent for fibers of the medial forebrain bundle and punctate pathology within the striatum and cortex, which otherwise were weakly labeled or not detected. Subsequent immunoblotting BAR-labeled Lewy pathology extracts revealed the presence of high molecular weight alpha-synuclein, ubiquitin protein conjugates, and phosphoserine 129 alpha-synuclein. Mass spectrometry analysis of BAR-labeled Lewy pathology extracts from PD and DLB patients identified 815 proteins with significant enrichment for many pathways. Notably the most significant KEGG pathway was Parkinsons disease (FDR = 2.48 X 10-26) and GO Cellular compartment was extracellular exosomes (GO Cellular Compartment; FDR = 2.66x 10-34). We used enrichment data to create a functional map of Lewy Pathology from primary disease tissues, which implicated Vesicle Trafficking as the primary disease associated pathway in DLB and PD. In summary, this protocol can be used to enrich for Lewy pathology from formalin fixed human primary tissues, which allows the determination of molecular signatures of Lewy pathology. This technique has broad potential to help understand the phenomenon of Lewy pathology in primary human tissue and animal models.

Visual information processing requires an efficient visual attention system. The neural theory of visual attention (TVA) proposes that visual processing speed depends on the coordinated activity between frontoparietal and occipital brain areas. Previous research has shown that the coordinated activity between (i.e., functional connectivity, 'inter-FC') cingulo-opercular (COn) and right-frontoparietal (RFPn) networks is linked to visual processing speed. However, evidence for how inter-FC of COn and RFPn with visual networks links to visual processing speed is still missing. Forty-eight healthy human adult participants (27 females) underwent resting-state (rs-)fMRI and performed a whole-report psychophysical task. To obtain inter-FC, we analyzed the entire frequency range available in our rs-fMRI data (i.e., 0.01-0.4 Hz) to avoid discarding neural information. Following previous approaches, we analyzed the data across frequency bins (Hz): Slow-5 (0.01-0.027), Slow-4 (0.027-0.073), Slow-3 (0.073-0.198), and Slow-2 (0.198-0.4). We used the mathematical TVA framework to estimate an individual, latent-level visual processing speed parameter. We found that visual processing speed was negatively associated with inter-FC between RFPn and visual networks in Slow-5 and Slow-2, with no corresponding significant association for inter-FC between COn and visual networks. These results provide first empirical evidence that links inter-FC between RFPn and visual networks with the visual processing speed parameter. These findings suggest a direct connectivity between occipital and right frontoparietal, but not frontoinsular, regions, to support visual processing speed.

The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is theorized to globally suppress movement through connections with downstream basal ganglia structures. Current theories are supported by increased STN activity when subjects withhold an uninitiated action plan, but a critical test of these theories requires studying STN responses when an ongoing action is replaced with an alternative. Here, we perform this test using an extended reaching task with instructions to switch movement trajectory mid-action. We show that STN activity decreases during action switches, contrary to prevalent theories. Further, beta oscillations in the local field potential in STN, which are associated with movement inhibition do not show increased power or entraining of neuronal firing during switches. We report an inhomogeneous population neural code in STN, with one sub-population encoding movement kinematics and direction and another encoding unexpected action switches. We suggest an elaborate neural code in STN that contributes to planning actions and changing the plans.

In the mammalian brain, allocentric representations support efficient self-location and flexible navigation. A number of distinct populations of these spatial responses have been identified but no unified function has been shown to account for their emergence. Here we developed a network, trained with a simple predictive objective, that was capable of mapping egocentric information into an allocentric spatial reference frame. The prediction of visual inputs was sufficient to drive the appearance of spatial representations resembling those observed in rodents: head direction, boundary vector, and place cells, along with the recently discovered egocentric boundary cells, suggesting predictive coding as a principle for their emergence in animals. The network learned a solution for head direction tracking convergent with known biological connectivity, while suggesting a possible mechanism of boundary cell remapping. Moreover, like mammalian representations, responses were robust to environmental manipulations, including exposure to novel settings, and could be replayed in the absence of perceptual input, providing the means for offline learning. In contrast to existing reinforcement learning approaches, agents equipped with this network were able to flexibly reuse learnt behaviours - adapting rapidly to unfamiliar environments. Thus, our results indicate that these representations, derived from a simple egocentric predictive framework, form an efficient basis-set for cognitive mapping.

Sensorimotor mu-alpha rhythm reflects the state of cortical excitability. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can modulate neural synchrony by inducing periodic electric fields (E-fields) in the cortical networks. We hypothesized that the increased synchronization of mu-alpha rhythm would inhibit the corticospinal excitability reflected by decreased motor evoked potentials (MEP). In seventeen healthy participants, we applied rhythmic, arrhythmic, and sham rTMS over the left M1. The stimulation intensity was individually adapted to 35 mV/mm using prospective E-field estimation. This intensity corresponded to ca. 40% of the resting motor threshold. We found that rhythmic rTMS increased the synchronization of mu-alpha rhythm, increased mu-alpha/beta power, and reduced MEPs. On the other hand, arrhythmic rTMS did not change the ongoing mu-alpha synchronization or MEPs, though it increased the alpha/beta power. We concluded that low intensity, rhythmic rTMS can synchronize mu-alpha rhythm and modulate the corticospinal excitability in M1.

Over the last decades, several studies have demonstrated that conscious and unconscious reward incentives both affect performance in physical and cognitive tasks, suggesting that goal-pursuit can arise from an unconscious will. Whether the planning of goal-directed saccadic eye movements during an effortful task can also be affected by subliminal reward cues has not been systematically investigated. We employed a novel task where participants had to make several eye movements back and forth between a fixation point and a number of peripheral targets. The total number of targets visited by the eyes in a fixed amount of time determined participants monetary gain. The magnitude of the reward at stake was briefly shown at the beginning of each trial and was masked by pattern images superimposed in time. We found that when reward cues were fully visible and thus consciously perceived, higher reward enhanced all saccade parameters. However, a dissociation was observed between the effects of subliminal rewards on saccade initiation and peak velocities. While truly subliminal reward cues did increase the number of saccades, they did not enhance saccades peak velocity. Additionally, participants who had reached a truly subliminal level of reward perception showed a decrement in accuracy as a function of reward across all visibility levels, as saccade endpoint error was larger when higher reward incentives were expected. This suboptimal speed-accuracy trade-off did not occur in the supraliminal group. These results suggest that although saccades initiation can be triggered by subconscious mechanisms, conscious awareness is required to optimally adjust the velocity and accuracy of eye movements based on the expected rewards.

Neuroinflammation forms a glial scar following a spinal cord injury (SCI). The injured axon cannot regenerate across the scar, suggesting permanent paraplegia. In this study, we report that d-chiral glutathione (D-GSH) suppresses the inflammatory response after SCI and leads to axon regeneration of the injured spinal cord to a greater extent than l-chiral glutathione (L-GSH). After SCI, axon regrowth in D-GSH-treated rats was significantly increased compared to that in L-GSH-treated rats (***p &lt; 0.001). Secondary damage and motor function were significantly improved in D-GSH-treated rats compared to those outcomes in L-GSH-treated rats (**p &lt; 0.01). Moreover, D-GSH significantly decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines and glial scar via inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway compared to L-GSH (***p &lt; 0.001). In primary cultured macrophages, we found that D-GSH undergoes more intracellular interaction with activated macrophages than L-GSH (***p &lt; 0.001). These findings reveal a potential new regenerative function of chiral GSH in SCI and suggest that chiral GSH has therapeutic potential as a treatment of other diseases.

<p>by Teresa Maria Rosaria Noviello, Francesco Ceccarelli, Michele Ceccarelli, Luigi Cerulo</p>

Small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are short non-coding sequences involved in gene regulation in many biological processes and diseases. The lack of a complete comprehension of their biological functionality, especially in a genome-wide scenario, has demanded new computational approaches to annotate their roles. It is widely known that secondary structure is determinant to know RNA function and machine learning based approaches have been successfully proven to predict RNA function from secondary structure information. Here we show that RNA function can be predicted with good accuracy from a lightweight representation of sequence information without the necessity of computing secondary structure features which is computationally expensive. This finding appears to go against the dogma of secondary structure being a key determinant of function in RNA. Compared to recent secondary structure based methods, the proposed solution is more robust to sequence boundary noise and reduces drastically the computational cost allowing for large data volume annotations.

Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) provides 3D visualization of subcellular components in the near-native state and at sub-molecular resolutions in single cells, demonstrating an increasingly important role in structural biology <i>in situ</i>. However, systematic recognition and recovery of macromolecular structures in cryo-ET data remain challenging as a result of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), small sizes of macromolecules, and high complexity of the cellular environment. Subtomogram structural classification is an essential step for such task. Although acquisition of large amounts of subtomograms is no longer an obstacle due to advances in automation of data collection, obtaining the same number of structural labels is both computation and labor intensive. On the other hand, existing deep learning based supervised classification approaches are highly demanding on labeled data and have limited ability to learn about new structures rapidly from data containing very few labels of such new structures. In this work, we propose a novel approach for subtomogram classification based on few-shot learning. With our approach, classification of unseen structures in the training data can be conducted given few labeled samples in test data through instance embedding. Experiments were performed on both simulated and real datasets. Our experimental results show that we can make inference on new structures given only five labeled samples for each class with a competitive accuracy (&gt; 0.86 on the simulated dataset with SNR = 0.1), or even one sample with an accuracy of 0.7644. The results on real datasets are also promising with accuracy &gt; 0.9 on both conditions and even up to 1 on one of the real datasets. Our approach achieves significant improvement compared with the baseline method and has strong capabilities of generalizing to other cellular components.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/krPd1qOwjh8" width="1" />

Complete resection of the tumor is important for survival in glioma patients. Even if the gross total resection was achieved, left-over micro-scale tissue in the excision cavity risks recurrence. High Resolution Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (HRMAS NMR) technique can distinguish healthy and malign tissue efficiently using peak intensities of biomarker metabolites. The method is fast, sensitive and can work with small and unprocessed samples, which makes it a good fit for real-time analysis during surgery. However, only a targeted analysis for the existence of known tumor biomarkers can be made and this requires a technician with chemistry background, and a pathologist with knowledge on tumor metabolism to be present during surgery. Here, we show that we can accurately perform this analysis in real-time and can analyze the full spectrum in an untargeted fashion using machine learning. We work on a new and large HRMAS NMR dataset of glioma and control samples (n = 565), which are also labeled with a quantitative pathology analysis. Our results show that a random forest based approach can distinguish samples with tumor cells and controls accurately and effectively with a median AUC of 85.6% and AUPR of 93.4%. We also show that we can further distinguish benign and malignant samples with a median AUC of 87.1% and AUPR of 96.1%. We analyze the feature (peak) importance for classification to interpret the results of the classifier. We validate that known malignancy biomarkers such as creatine and 2-hydroxyglutarate play an important role in distinguishing tumor and normal cells and suggest new biomarker regions.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Childhood obesity is associated with negative physiological and cognitive health outcomes. The hippocampus is a diverse subcortical structure involved in learned feeding behaviors and energy regulation, and research has shown that the hippocampus is vulnerable to the effects of excess adiposity. Previous studies have demonstrated reduced hippocampal volume in overweight and obese children; however, it is unclear if certain subregions are selectively affected. The purpose of this study was to determine how excess body weight influences regional hippocampal surface morphology and memory performance in a large cross‐sectional cohort of 588 children and adolescents between 8.33 and 19.92 years of age using body mass index expressed as a percentage of the 95th percentile cutoff (%BMIp95). We demonstrate %BMIp95 is associated with reduced radial thickness in the superior anterior region of the left hippocampus, and this relationship is predominantly driven by children younger than 14 years. We also found %BMIp95 was associated with worse performance on a spatial episodic memory task and this relationship was partially mediated by the radial thickness of the significant shape cluster. These results demonstrate the differential influence of excess body weight on regional hippocampal structure and hippocampal‐dependent behavior in children and adolescents.</p>

<p>Sequencing analysis for the lesion site of the rat SCI model revealed that the injury significantly stimulated the expression of circRNA‐2960, which acted as a miRNA‐124 sponge to regulate the downstream pathways. Increased circRNA‐2960 expression in SCI decreased the activity of miRNA‐124, which further promoted neuroinflammation and apoptosis.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Recent studies have shown that circular RNAs (circRNAs) are involved in many human diseases, but their roles in secondary damage after spinal cord injury (SCI) remain unclear. In the current study circRNA sequencing was performed in the damaged tissues of SCI rats on the seventh day after injury, and related molecular mechanisms were investigated. Quantitative PCR validations of molecules that exhibited significantly altered expression in SCI mice were performed. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses were conducted to assess differentially expressed circRNAs. A novel circRNA‐2960 was the most significantly upregulated in the SCI group. It could downregulate its target molecule miRNA‐124, then exacerbate the inflammatory response and induce apoptosis at the lesion site. Disrupting circRNA‐2960 expression promoted recovery of tissues affected by secondary SCI damage. The results of the present study may provide new insight into the mechanisms of secondary injury in SCI, and a new molecular marker for the diagnosis and treatment of SCI.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Adaptive memory requires the organism to form associations that bridge between events separated in time. Many studies show interactions between hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) during formation of such associations. We analyze neural recording from monkey HPC and PFC during a memory task that requires the monkey to associate stimuli separated by about a second in time. After the first stimulus was presented, large numbers of units in both HPC and PFC fired in sequence. Many units fired only when a particular stimulus was presented at a particular time in the past. These results indicate that both HPC and PFC maintain a temporal record of events that could be used to form associations across time. This temporal record of the past is a key component of the temporal coding hypothesis, a hypothesis in psychology that memory not only encodes what happened, but when it happened.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The prevalence of cancer‐related pain is 64% among patients with metastatic, advanced, or terminal cancer, 59% among patients undergoing anticancer treatment, and 33% among patients who completed curative treatment. According to the World Health Organization cancer pain relief guidelines, opioid analgesics are the mainstay analgesic therapy in addition to conventional first‐step analgesics, such as non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen. The indications for strong opioids have recently been expanded to include mild‐to‐moderate pain in addition to moderate‐to‐severe pain. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines emphasize that realistic expectations should be weighed against potential serious harm from opioids, rather than relying on the unrealized long‐term benefits of these drugs. Therefore, treatment strategies for both cancer‐related chronic or acute pain have been unfortunately deviated from opioid analgesics. The barriers hindering adequate cancer‐related pain management with opioid analgesics are related to the inadequate knowledge of opioid analgesics (e.g., effective dose, adverse effects, and likelihood of addiction or tolerance). To achieve adequate opioid availability, these barriers should be overcome in a clinically suitable manner. Genetic assessments could play an important role in overcoming challenges in opioid management. To balance the improvement in opioid availability and the prevention of opioid misuse and addiction, the following two considerations concerning opioids and genetic polymorphisms warrant attention: (A) pain severity, opioid sensitivity, and opioid tolerance; and (B) vulnerability to opioid dependence and addiction.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The neural mechanisms that underlie responses to drugs of abuse are complex, and impacted by a number of neuromodulatory peptides. Within the past 10 years it has been discovered that several of the receptors for neuromodulators are enriched in the primary cilia of neurons. Primary cilia are microtubule‐based organelles that project from the surface of nearly all mammalian cells, including neurons. Despite what we know about cilia, our understanding of how cilia regulate neuronal function and behavior is still limited. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the contributions of primary cilia on specific neuronal populations to behavioral responses to amphetamine. To test the consequences of cilia loss on amphetamine‐induced locomotor activity we selectively ablated cilia from dopaminergic or GAD2‐GABAergic neurons in mice. Cilia loss had no effect on baseline locomotion in either mouse strain. In mice lacking cilia on dopaminergic neurons, locomotor activity compared to wild‐ type mice was reduced in both sexes in response to acute administration of 3.0 mg/kg amphetamine. In contrast, changes in the locomotor response to amphetamine in mice lacking cilia on GAD2‐GABAergic neurons were primarily driven by reductions in locomotor activity in males. Following repeated amphetamine administration (1.0 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> over 5 days), mice lacking cilia on GAD2‐GABAergic neurons exhibited enhanced sensitization of the locomotor stimulant response to the drug, whereas mice lacking cilia on dopaminergic neurons did not differ from wild‐type controls. These results indicate that cilia play neuron‐specific roles in both acute and neuroplastic responses to psychostimulant drugs of abuse.</p>

<p>Attention Schema Theory (AST) is a recent proposal to provide a scientific
explanation for the basis of subjective awareness. Essentially, AST posits that
conscious experience in the minds of humans and some other animals is the
result of evolution having provided the mind with its own internal model of
attention taking place within their own (and others') mind (the 'attention
schema'). However, the inability of humans to understand how their own
subjective awareness arises (related to the so-called 'hard problem' of
consciousness) is because the attention schema is inherently incomplete. In
this short note, we ask to what extent it is possible, in principle, for a mind
(either human or machine-based) to have an attention schema that is complete in
the sense of being able to faithfully represent streams of attention. Using a
simple model and a mathematical argument based on classical topology, we
describe some limits of the extent to which an attention schema could be
complete.

<p>A stochastic optimal control based model with velocity tracking and internal
feedback for saccadic eye movements is presented in this paper. Recent evidence
from neurophysiological studies of superior colliculus suggests the presence of
a dynamic input to the saccade generation system that encodes saccade velocity,
rather than just the saccade amplitude and direction. The new evidence makes it
imperative to test if saccade control can use a desired velocity input which is
the basis for the proposed velocity tracking model. The model is validated
using behavioral data of saccades generated by healthy human subjects. It
generates trajectories of horizontal saccades made to different amplitudes as
well as predicts vertical and oblique saccade behavior. This paper presents the
first-ever model of the saccadic system in an optimal control framework using
an alternate interpretation of velocity-based control, contrary to the dominant
end-point based models available in the literature.

<p>Autonomous spacecraft maneuver planning using an evolutionary algorithmic
approach is investigated. Simulated spacecraft were placed into four different
initial orbits. Each was allowed a string of thirty delta-v impulse maneuvers
in six cartesian directions, the positive and negative x, y and z directions.
The goal of the spacecraft maneuver string was to, starting from some non-polar
starting orbit, place the spacecraft into a polar, low eccentricity orbit. A
genetic algorithm was implemented, using a mating, fitness, mutation and
crossover scheme for impulse strings. The genetic algorithm was successfully
able to produce this result for all the starting orbits. Performance and future
work is also discussed.

<p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are promising in a bio-plausible coding for
spatio-temporal information and event-driven signal processing, which is very
suited for energy-efficient implementation in neuromorphic hardware. However,
the unique working mode of SNNs makes them more difficult to train than
traditional networks. Currently, there are two main routes to explore the
training of deep SNNs with high performance. The first is to convert a
pre-trained ANN model to its SNN version, which usually requires a long coding
window for convergence and cannot exploit the spatio-temporal features during
training for solving temporal tasks. The other is to directly train SNNs in the
spatio-temporal domain. But due to the binary spike activity of the firing
function and the problem of gradient vanishing or explosion, current methods
are restricted to shallow architectures and thereby difficult in harnessing
large-scale datasets (e.g. ImageNet). To this end, we propose a
threshold-dependent batch normalization (tdBN) method based on the emerging
spatio-temporal backpropagation, termed "STBP-tdBN", enabling direct training
of a very deep SNN and the efficient implementation of its inference on
neuromorphic hardware. With the proposed method and elaborated shortcut
connection, we significantly extend directly-trained SNNs from a shallow
structure ( &lt; 10 layer) to a very deep structure (50 layers). Furthermore, we
theoretically analyze the effectiveness of our method based on "Block Dynamical
Isometry" theory. Finally, we report superior accuracy results including 93.15
% on CIFAR-10, 67.8 % on DVS-CIFAR10, and 67.05% on ImageNet with very few
timesteps. To our best knowledge, it's the first time to explore the
directly-trained deep SNNs with high performance on ImageNet.

<p>Neural network realizes multi-parameter optimization and control by
simulating certain mechanisms of the human brain. It can be used in many fields
such as signal processing, intelligent driving, optimal combination, vehicle
abnormality detection, and chemical process optimization control. Supercritical
extraction is a new type of high-efficiency chemical separation process, which
is mainly used in the separation and purification of natural substances. There
are many influencing factors. The neural network model can quickly optimize the
process parameters and predict the experimental results under different process
conditions. It is helpful to understand the inner law of the experiment and
determine the optimal experimental conditions. This paper briefly describes the
basic concepts and research progress of neural networks and supercritical
extraction, and summarizes the application of neural network algorithms in
supercritical extraction, aiming to provide reference for the development and
innovation of industry technology.

<p>This review intends to summarise the key qualities, current challenges and
future perspectives faced by the GA technique. Their implicit parallelism and
evolutionary operators allow an optimal balance between exploration and
exploitation. They thrive in identifying good solutions in large, rugged search
spaces. They have desirable convergence properties, offer high flexibility, and
impose very few assumptions on the nature of the solutions being evolved. They
allow a realistic modelling of evolutionary systems and innovation dynamics.
Often criticised for their computational complexity, GAs' computational
efficiency is a first challenge to address to handle dynamic or more complex
problems, likely with further use of parallelism and GPU computing. The
difficult configuration of GAs parameters, determinant to their performance,
remains an open area of investigation. The specifications of the canonical GA,
notably the choice of individual representation, the design of the fitness
landscape, and initial population sampling, impose some implicit constraints on
the search space being explored, and the solutions being evolved, requiring
further innovations to achieve open-ended evolution and robustness. Most of GAs
achievements have so far been achieved from a restricted subset of our
knowledge on natural evolution and genetics. We argue that a deeper, renewed
inspiration from the state of the art of biology and genetic research, carries
the potential for fundamental discoveries in GA design. The evolution of
evolvability, the ability to produce the most improving kind of variation for
selection, interactions between mutations, pleiotropy, the modularity of
biological networks, are only few examples of such many promising future
directions. By expanding self-adaptation, a novel class of GAs oriented towards
artificial life and open ended evolution can emerge.

<p>Detecting changes in the environment is fundamental for our survival. According to predictive coding theory, detecting these irregularities relies both on incoming sensory information and our top–down prior expectations (or internal generative models) about the world. Prediction errors (PEs), detectable in event-related potentials (ERPs), occur when there is a mismatch between the sensory input and our internal model (i.e., a surprise event). Many changes occurring in our environment are irrelevant for survival and may remain unseen. Such changes, even if subtle, can nevertheless be detected by the brain without emerging into consciousness. What remains unclear is how these changes are processed in the brain at the network level. Here, we used a visual oddball paradigm in which participants engaged in a central letter task during electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings while presented with task-irrelevant high- or low-coherence background, random-dot motion. Critically, once in a while, the direction of the dots changed. After the EEG session, we confirmed that changes in motion direction at high- and low-coherence were visible and invisible, respectively, using psychophysical measurements. ERP analyses revealed that changes in motion direction elicited PE regardless of the visibility, but with distinct spatiotemporal patterns. To understand these responses, we applied dynamic causal modeling (DCM) to the EEG data. Bayesian Model Averaging showed visible PE relied on a release from adaptation (repetition suppression) within bilateral MT+, whereas invisible PE relied on adaptation at bilateral V1 (and left MT+). Furthermore, while feedforward upregulation was present for invisible PE, the visible change PE also included downregulation of feedback between right MT+ to V1. Our findings reveal a complex interplay of modulation in the generative network models underlying visible and invisible motion changes.</p>

<p>Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a highly variable and complex set of neurological disorders that alter neurodevelopment and cognitive function, which usually presents with social and learning impairments accompanied with other comorbid symptoms like hypersensitivity or hyposensitivity, or repetitive behaviors. Autism can be caused by genetic and/or environmental factors and unraveling the etiology of ASD has proven challenging, especially given that different genetic mutations can cause both similar and different phenotypes that all fall within the autism spectrum. Furthermore, the list of ASD risk genes is ever increasing making it difficult to synthesize a common theme. The use of rodent models to enhance ASD research is invaluable and is beginning to unravel the underlying molecular mechanisms of this disease. Recently, zebrafish have been recognized as a useful model of neurodevelopmental disorders with regards to genetics, pharmacology and behavior and one of the main foundations supporting autism research (SFARI) recently identified 12 ASD risk genes with validated zebrafish mutant models. Here, we describe what is known about those 12 ASD risk genes in human, mice and zebrafish to better facilitate this research. We also describe several non-genetic models including pharmacological and gnotobiotic models that are used in zebrafish to study ASD.</p>

<p>Background: It has been consistently reported that the deficiency of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) sensitive purinergic receptor P2X7 (P2X7R) ameliorates symptoms in animal models of brain diseases.</p><p>Objective: This study aimed to investigate the role of P2X7R in rodent models of acute and subchronic schizophrenia based on phencyclidine (PCP) delivery in animals lacking or overexpressing P2X7R, and to identify the underlying mechanisms involved.</p><p>Methods: The psychotomimetic effects of acute i.p. PCP administration in C57Bl/6J wild-type, P2X7R knockout (P2rx7<sup>−/−</sup>) and overexpressing (P2X7-EGFP) young adult mice were quantified. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of P2rx7<sup>−/−</sup> and heterozygous P2X7-EGFP acutely treated animals was characterized through immunohistochemical staining. The prefrontal cortices of young adult P2rx7<sup>−/−</sup> and P2rx7<sup>tg/+</sup> mice were examined with tritiated dopamine release experiments and the functional properties of the mPFC pyramidal neurons in layer V from P2rx7<sup>−/−</sup> mice were assessed by patch-clamp recordings. P2rx7<sup>−/−</sup> animals were subjected to a 7 days subchronic systemic PCP treatment. The animals working memory performance and PFC cytokine levels were assessed.</p><p>Results: Our data strengthen the hypothesis that P2X7R modulates schizophrenia-like positive and cognitive symptoms in NMDA receptor antagonist models in a receptor expression level-dependent manner. P2X7R expression leads to higher medial PFC susceptibility to PCP-induced circuit hyperactivity. The mPFC of P2X7R knockout animals displayed distinct alterations in the neuronal activation pattern, microglial organization, specifically around hyperactive neurons, and were associated with lower intrinsic excitability of mPFC neurons.</p><p>Conclusions: P2X7R expression exacerbated PCP-related effects in C57Bl/6J mice. Our findings suggest a pleiotropic role of P2X7R in the mPFC, consistent with the observed behavioral phenotype, regulating basal dopamine concentration, layer-specific neuronal activation, intrinsic excitability of neurons in the mPFC, and the interaction of microglia with hyperactive neurons. Direct measurements of P2X7R activity concerning microglial ramifications and dynamics could help to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved.</p>

<p>The degeneration of light-detecting rod and cone photoreceptors in the human retina leads to severe visual impairment and ultimately legal blindness in millions of people worldwide. Multiple therapeutic options at different stages of degeneration are being explored but the majority of ongoing clinical trials involve adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector-based gene supplementation strategies for select forms of inherited retinal disease. Over 300 genes are associated with inherited retinal degenerations and only a small proportion of these will be suitable for gene replacement therapy. However, while the origins of disease may vary, there are considerable similarities in the physiological changes that occur in the retina. When early therapeutic intervention is not possible and patients suffer loss of photoreceptor cells but maintain remaining layers of cells in the neural retina, there is an opportunity for a universal gene therapy approach that can be applied regardless of the genetic origin of disease. Optogenetic therapy offers such a strategy by aiming to restore vision though the provision of light-sensitive molecules to surviving cell types of the retina that enable light perception through the residual neurons. Here we review the recent progress in attempts to restore visual function to the degenerate retina using optogenetic therapy. We focus on multiple pre-clinical models used in optogenetic strategies, discuss their strengths and limitations, and highlight considerations including vector and transgene designs that have advanced the field into two ongoing clinical trials.</p>

<p>Numerous studies find that creativity is not only associated with low effort and flexible processes but also associated with high effort and persistent processes especially when defensive behavior is induced by negative emotions. The important role of self-esteem is to buffer negative emotions, and individuals with low self-esteem are prone to instigating various forms of defensive behaviors. Thus, we thought that the relationships between trait creativity and executive control brain networks might be modulated by self-esteem. The resting-state electroencephalogram (RS-EEG) microstates can be divided into four classical types (MS1, MS2, MS3, and MS4), which can reflect the brain networks as well as their dynamic characteristic. Thus, the Williams Creative Tendency Scale (WCTS) and Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale (RSES) were used to investigate the modulating role of self-esteem on the relationships between trait creativity and the RS-EEG microstates. As our results showed, self-esteem consistently modulated the relationships between creativity and the duration and contribution of MS2 related to visual or imagery processing, the occurrence of MS3 related to cingulo-opercular networks, and transitions between MS2 and MS4, which were related to frontoparietal control networks. Based on these results, we thought that trait creativity was related to the executive control of bottom-up processing for individuals with low self-esteem, while the bottom-up information from vision or visual imagery might be related to trait creativity for individuals with high self-esteem.</p>

<p>Our understanding of the neurofunctional mechanisms of speech production and their pathologies is still incomplete. In this paper, a comprehensive model of speech production based on the Neural Engineering Framework (NEF) is presented. This model is able to activate sensorimotor plans based on cognitive-functional processes (i.e., generation of the intention of an utterance, selection of words and syntactic frames, generation of the phonological form and motor plan; feedforward mechanism). Since the generation of different states of the utterance are tied to different levels in the speech production hierarchy, it is shown that different forms of speech errors as well as speech disorders can arise at different levels in the production hierarchy or are linked to different levels and different modules in the speech production model. In addition, the influence of the inner feedback mechanisms on normal as well as on disordered speech is examined in terms of the model. The model uses a small number of core concepts provided by the NEF, and we show that these are sufficient to create this neurobiologically detailed model of the complex process of speech production in a manner that is, we believe, clear, efficient, and understandable.</p>

<p>Olfaction plays an important role in the evaluation, motivation, and palatability of food. The chemical identity of odorants is coded by a spatial combination of activated glomeruli in the olfactory bulb, which is referred to as the odor map. However, the functional roles of the olfactory cortex, a collective region that receives axonal projections from the olfactory bulb, and higher olfactory centers in odor-guided eating behaviors are yet to be elucidated. The olfactory tubercle (OT) is a component of the ventral striatum and forms a node within the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway. Recent studies have revealed the anatomical domain structures of the OT and their functions in distinct odor-guided motivated behaviors. Another component of the ventral striatum, the nucleus accumbens, is well known for its involvement in motivation and hedonic responses for foods, which raises the possibility of functional similarities between the OT and nucleus accumbens in eating. This review first summarizes recent findings on the domain- and neuronal subtype-specific roles of the OT in odor-guided motivated behaviors and then proposes a model for the regulation of eating behaviors by the OT.</p>

<p>SARS-CoV-2, which causes the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, has a brain neurotropism through binding to the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expressed by neurones and glial cells, including astrocytes and microglia. Systemic infection which accompanies severe cases of COVID-19 also triggers substantial increase in circulating levels of chemokines and interleukins that compromise the blood-brain barrier, enter the brain parenchyma and affect its defensive systems, astrocytes and microglia. Brain areas devoid of a blood-brain barrier such as the circumventricular organs are particularly vulnerable to circulating inflammatory mediators. The performance of astrocytes and microglia, as well as of immune cells required for brain health, is considered critical in defining the neurological damage and neurological outcome of COVID-19. In this review, we discuss the neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2, the implication of neuroinflammation, adaptive and innate immunity, autoimmunity, as well as astrocytic and microglial immune and homeostatic functions in the neurological and psychiatric aspects of COVID-19. The consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection during ageing, in the presence of systemic comorbidities, and for the exposed pregnant mother and foetus are also covered.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.585833">An Overview on the Differential Interplay Among Neurons–Astrocytes–Microglia in CA1 and CA3 Hippocampus in Hypoxia/Ischemia</a></h4>

<p>Neurons have been long regarded as the basic functional cells of the brain, whereas astrocytes and microglia have been regarded only as elements of support. However, proper intercommunication among neurons–astrocytes–microglia is of fundamental importance for the functional organization of the brain. Perturbation in the regulation of brain energy metabolism not only in neurons but also in astrocytes and microglia may be one of the pathophysiological mechanisms of neurodegeneration, especially in hypoxia/ischemia. Glial activation has long been considered detrimental for survival of neurons, but recently it appears that glial responses to an insult are not equal but vary in different brain areas. In this review, we first take into consideration the modifications of the vascular unit of the glymphatic system and glial metabolism in hypoxic conditions. Using the method of triple-labeling fluorescent immunohistochemistry coupled with confocal microscopy (TIC), we recently studied the interplay among neurons, astrocytes, and microglia in chronic brain hypoperfusion. We evaluated the quantitative and morpho-functional alterations of the neuron–astrocyte–microglia triads comparing the hippocampal CA1 area, more vulnerable to ischemia, to the CA3 area, less vulnerable. In these contiguous and interconnected areas, in the same experimental hypoxic conditions, astrocytes and microglia show differential, finely regulated, region-specific reactivities. In both areas, astrocytes and microglia form triad clusters with apoptotic, degenerating neurons. In the neuron–astrocyte–microglia triads, the cell body of a damaged neuron is infiltrated and bisected by branches of astrocyte that create a microscar around it while a microglial cell phagocytoses the damaged neuron. These coordinated actions are consistent with the scavenging and protective activities of microglia. In hypoxia, the neuron–astrocyte–microglia triads are more numerous in CA3 than in CA1, further indicating their protective effects. These data, taken from contiguous and interconnected hippocampal areas, demonstrate that glial response to the same hypoxic insult is not equal but varies significantly. Understanding the differences of glial reactivity is of great interest to explain the differential susceptibility of hippocampal areas to hypoxia/ischemia. Further studies may evidence the differential reactivity of glia in different brain areas, explaining the higher or lower sensitivity of these areas to different insults and whether glia may represent a target for future therapeutic interventions.</p>

<p>Maternal exposure to the valproate short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) during pregnancy is known to possibly induce autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) in the offspring. By contrast, case studies have evidenced positive outcomes of this anticonvulsant drug in children with severe autism. Interestingly, the same paradoxical pattern applies to the IL-17a inflammatory cytokine involved in the immune system regulation. Such joint apparent contradictions can be overcome by pointing out that, among their respective signaling pathways, valproate and IL-17a share an enhancement of the “type A monoamine oxidase” (MAOA) enzyme carried by the X chromosome. In the Guided Propagation (GP) model of autism, such enzymatic rise triggers a prenatal epigenetic downregulation, which, without possible X-inactivation, and when coinciding with genetic expression variants of other brain enzymes, results in the delayed onset of autistic symptoms. The underlying imbalance of synaptic monoamines, serotonin in the first place, would reflect a mismatch between the environment to which the brain metabolism was prepared during gestation and the postnatal actual surroundings. Following a prenatal exposure to molecules that significantly elicit the MAOA gene expression, a daily treatment with the same metabolic impact would tend to recreate the fetal environment and contribute to rebalance monoamines, thus allowing proper neural circuits to gradually develop, provided behavioral re-education. Given the multifaceted other players than MAOA that are involved in the regulation of serotonin levels, potential compensatory effects are surveyed, which may underlie the autism heterogeneity. This explanatory framework opens up prospects regarding autism prevention and treatment, strikingly in line with current advances along the gut microbiome–brain axis.</p>

<p>Selective negative allosteric modulators (NAMs), targeting α5 subunit-containing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs) as potential therapeutic targets for disorders associated with cognitive deficits, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), continually fail clinical trials. We investigated whether this was due to the change in the expression of α5 GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs, consequently altering synaptic function during AD pathogenesis. Using medicinal chemistry and computational modeling, we developed aqueous soluble hybrids of 6,6-dimethyl-3-(2-hydroxyethyl) thio-1-(thiazol-2-yl)-6,7-dihydro-2-benzothiophene-4(5H)-one, that demonstrated selective binding and high negative allosteric modulation, specifically for the α5 GABA<sub>A</sub>R subtypes in constructed HEK293 stable cell-lines. Using a knock-in mouse model of AD (APP<sup>NL−F/NL−F</sup>), which expresses a mutant form of human amyloid-β (Aβ), we performed immunofluorescence studies combined with electrophysiological whole-cell recordings to investigate the effects of our key molecule, α5-SOP002 in the hippocampal CA1 region. In aged APP<sup>NL−F/NL−F</sup> mice, selective preservation of α5 GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs was observed in, calretinin- (CR), cholecystokinin- (CCK), somatostatin- (SST) expressing interneurons, and pyramidal cells. Previously, we reported that CR dis-inhibitory interneurons, specialized in regulating other interneurons displayed abnormally high levels of synaptic inhibition in the APP<sup>NL−F/NL−F</sup> mouse model, here we show that this excessive inhibition was “normalized” to control values with bath-applied α5-SOP002 (1 μM). However, α5-SOP002, further impaired inhibition onto CCK and pyramidal cells that were already largely compromised by exhibiting a deficit of inhibition in the AD model. In summary, using a multi-disciplinary approach, we show that exposure to α5 GABA<sub>A</sub>R NAMs may further compromise aberrant synapses in AD. We, therefore, suggest that the α5 GABA<sub>A</sub>R is not a suitable therapeutic target for the treatment of AD or other cognitive deficits due to the widespread neuronal-networks that use α5 GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs.</p>

<p>Progression of neuronal deterioration within specific brain regions is considered as one of the principal bases for the development of major depressive disorders. Therefore, protects and promotes the maintaining of normal structure and function of neurons might be a potential therapeutic strategy in the treatment of depression. Here, we report that the antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), inhibited neuronal injury through its capacity to reduce oxidative stress and exerted antidepressant effects. Specifically, we show that antioxidant enzyme activity was significantly decreased in the hippocampal CA1 region of depressive rats, while treatment with NAC (300 mg/kg, i.p.) produced neuroprotective effects against mitochondrial oxidative stress injuries and oxidative DNA damage in CA1 neurons of these rats. Moreover, NAC treatment alleviated neuronal injury resulting from neuroinflammation and apoptosis in depressed rats, effects that were associated with reductions in dendritic spine atrophy, and synapse deficits. These effects appear to involve a down-regulation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-JNK signaling along with an up-regulation of ERK signaling within the hippocampal CA1 region. Moreover, this NAC treatment significantly ameliorated depression-like behaviors as indicated by performance in the sucrose preference and forced swim tests (FST). Taken together, these results reveal the potential involvement of oxidative stress in the generation of depression. And, the antidepressant-like effects exerted by NAC may involve reductions in this oxidative stress that can result in neuronal deterioration. Such neuroprotective effects of NAC may indicate a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of stress-related depression.</p>

<p>Background: Intrinsically organized large-scale brain networks and their interactions support complex cognitive function. Investigations suggest that the default network (DN) is the earliest disrupted network and that the frontoparietal control network (FPCN) and dorsal attention network (DAN) are subsequently impaired in Alzheimer's disease (AD). These large-scale networks comprise different subsystems (DN: medial temporal lobe (MTL), dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DM) subsystems and a Core; FPCN: FPCNA and FPCNB). Our previous research has indicated that different DN subsystems are not equally damaged in AD. However, changes in the patterns of interactions among these large-scale network subsystems and the underlying cause of the alterations in AD remain unclear. We hypothesized that disrupted DN subsystems cause specific impairments in inter-system interactions and a higher regulatory burden for the FPCNA.</p><p>Method: To test this hypothesis, Granger causality analysis (GCA) was performed to explore effective functional connectivity (FC) pattern of these networks. The regional information flow strength (IFS) was calculated and compared across groups to explore changes in the subsystems and their inter-system interactions and the relationship between them. To investigate specific inter-system changes, we summed the inter-system IFS and performed correlation analyses of the bidirectional inter-system IFS, which was compared across groups. Additionally, correlation analyses of dynamic effective FC patterns were performed to reveal alterations in the temporal co-evolution of sets of inter-subsystem interactions. Furthermore, we used partial correlation analysis to quantify the FPCN's regulatory effects. Finally, we applied a support vector machine (SVM) linear classifier to probe which network most effectively discriminated patients from controls.</p><p>Results: Compared with controls, AD patients showed a decreased intra-DN regional IFS, which was significantly related to the inter-network's IFS. The IFS between the DN subsystems and FPCN subsystems/DAN decreased. Critically, the correlation values of the decreased bidirectional IFS between the DN subsystems and FPCNA diminished. Additionally, the Core and DM play pivotal roles in disordered temporal co-evolution. Furthermore, the FPCNA showed enhanced regulation of the Core. Finally, the MTL subsystem and Core were effective at discriminating patients from controls.</p><p>Conclusion: The predominantly disrupted DN subsystems caused impaired inter-system interactions and created a higher regulatory burden for the FPCNA.</p>

<p>Evidence suggests that extracellular vesicles (EVs) act as mediators and biomarkers of neurodegenerative diseases. Two distinct forms of Alzheimer disease (AD) are known: a late-onset sporadic form (SAD) and an early-onset familial form (FAD). Recently, neurovascular dysfunction and altered systemic immunological components have been linked to AD neurodegeneration. Therefore, we characterized systemic-EVs from postmortem SAD and FAD patients and evaluated their effects on neuroglial and endothelial cells. We found increase CLN-5 spots with vesicular morphology in the abluminal portion of vessels from SAD patients. Both forms of AD were associated with larger and more numerous systemic EVs. Specifically, SAD patients showed an increase in endothelial- and leukocyte-derived EVs containing mitochondria; in contrast, FAD patients showed an increase in platelet-derived EVs. We detected a differential protein composition for SAD- and FAD-EVs associated with the coagulation cascade, inflammation, and lipid-carbohydrate metabolism. Using mono- and cocultures (endothelium-astrocytes-neurons) and human cortical organoids, we showed that AD-EVs induced cytotoxicity. Both forms of AD featured decreased neuronal branches area and astrocytic hyperreactivity, but SAD-EVs led to greater endothelial detrimental effects than FAD-EVs. In addition, FAD- and SAD-EVs affected calcium dynamics in a cortical organoid model. Our findings indicate that the phenotype of systemic AD-EVs is differentially defined by the etiopathology of the disease (SAD or FAD), which results in a differential alteration of the NVU cells implied in neurodegeneration.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63230">Optimized Vivid-derived Magnets photodimerizers for subcellular optogenetics in mammalian cells</a></h4>

Light-inducible dimerization protein modules enable precise temporal and spatial control of biological processes in non-invasive fashion. Among them, Magnets are small modules engineered from the <i>Neurospora crassa </i>photoreceptor Vivid by orthogonalizing the homodimerization interface into complementary heterodimers. Both Magnets components, which are well-tolerated as protein fusion partners, are photoreceptors requiring simultaneous photoactivation to interact, enabling high spatiotemporal confinement of dimerization with a single-excitation wavelength. However, Magnets require concatemerization for efficient responses and cell preincubation at 28<sup>o</sup>C to be functional. Here we overcome these limitations by engineering an optimized Magnets pair requiring neither concatemerization nor low temperature preincubation. We validated these 'enhanced' Magnets (eMags) by using them to rapidly and reversibly recruit proteins to subcellular organelles, to induce organelle contacts, and to reconstitute OSBP-VAP ER-Golgi tethering implicated in phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate transport and metabolism. eMags represent a very effective tool to optogenetically manipulate physiological processes over whole cells or in small subcellular volumes.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/62105">Asynchrony between virus diversity and antibody selection limits influenza virus evolution</a></h4>

Seasonal influenza viruses create a persistent global disease burden by evolving to escape immunity induced by prior infections and vaccinations. New antigenic variants have a substantial selective advantage at the population level, but these variants are rarely selected within-host, even in previously immune individuals. Using a mathematical model, we show that the temporal asynchrony between within-host virus exponential growth and antibody-mediated selection could limit within-host antigenic evolution. If selection for new antigenic variants acts principally at the point of initial virus inoculation, where small virus populations encounter well-matched mucosal antibodies in previously infected individuals, there can exist protection against reinfection that does not regularly produce observable new antigenic variants within individual infected hosts. Our results provide a theoretical explanation for how virus antigenic evolution can be highly selective at the global level but nearly neutral within host. They also suggest new avenues for improving influenza control.

Intracellular transport relies on multiple kinesins, but it is poorly understood which kinesins are present on particular cargos, what their contributions are and whether they act simultaneously on the same cargo. Here, we show that Rab6-positive secretory vesicles are transported from the Golgi apparatus to the cell periphery by kinesin-1 KIF5B and kinesin-3 KIF13B, which determine the location of secretion events. KIF5B plays a dominant role, whereas KIF13B helps Rab6 vesicles to reach freshly polymerized microtubule ends, to which KIF5B binds poorly, likely because its cofactors, MAP7-family proteins, are slow in populating these ends. Sub-pixel localization demonstrated that during microtubule plus-end directed transport, both kinesins localize to the vesicle front and can be engaged on the same vesicle. When vesicles reverse direction, KIF13B relocates to the middle of the vesicle, while KIF5B shifts to the back, suggesting that KIF5B but not KIF13B undergoes a tug-of-war with a minus-end directed motor.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59770">Alpha-satellite RNA transcripts are repressed by centromere-nucleolus associations</a></h4>

Although originally thought to be silent chromosomal regions, centromeres are instead actively transcribed. However, the behavior and contributions of centromere-derived RNAs have remained unclear. Here, we used single-molecule fluorescence in-situ hybridization (smFISH) to detect alpha-satellite RNA transcripts in intact human cells. We find that alpha-satellite RNA smFISH foci levels vary across cell lines and over the cell cycle, but do not remain associated with centromeres, displaying localization consistent with other long non-coding RNAs. Alpha-satellite expression occurs through RNA Polymerase II-dependent transcription, but does not require established centromere or cell division components. Instead, our work implicates centromere-nucleolar interactions as repressing alpha-satellite expression. The fraction of nucleolar-localized centromeres inversely correlates with alpha-satellite transcripts levels across cell lines and transcript levels increase substantially when the nucleolus is disrupted. The control of alpha-satellite transcripts by centromere-nucleolar contacts provides a mechanism to modulate centromere transcription and chromatin dynamics across diverse cell states and conditions.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58641">Optogenetic investigation of BMP target gene expression diversity</a></h4>

Signaling molecules activate distinct patterns of gene expression to coordinate embryogenesis, but how spatiotemporal expression diversity is generated is an open question. In zebrafish, a BMP signaling gradient patterns the dorsal-ventral axis. We systematically identified target genes responding to BMP and found that they have diverse spatiotemporal expression patterns. Transcriptional responses to optogenetically delivered high- and low-amplitude BMP signaling pulses indicate that spatiotemporal expression is not fully defined by different BMP signaling activation thresholds. Additionally, we observed negligible correlations between spatiotemporal expression and transcription kinetics for the majority of analyzed genes in response to BMP signaling pulses. In contrast, spatial differences between BMP target genes largely collapsed when FGF and Nodal signaling were inhibited. Our results suggest that, similar to other patterning systems, combinatorial signaling is likely to be a major driver of spatial diversity in BMP-dependent gene expression in zebrafish.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58478"><i>circZNF827</i> nucleates a transcription inhibitory complex to balance neuronal differentiation</a></h4>

Circular RNAs are important for many cellular processes but their mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. Here, we map circRNA inventories of mouse embryonic stem cells, neuronal progenitor cells and differentiated neurons and identify hundreds of highly expressed circRNAs. By screening several candidate circRNAs for a potential function in neuronal differentiation, we find that <i>circZNF827</i> represses expression of key neuronal markers, suggesting that this molecule negatively regulates neuronal differentiation. Among 760 tested genes linked to known neuronal pathways, knockdown of <i>circZNF827</i> deregulates expression of numerous genes including nerve growth factor receptor (<i>NGFR</i>), which becomes transcriptionally upregulated to enhance NGF signaling. We identify a <i>circZNF827</i>-nucleated transcription-repressive complex containing hnRNP-K/L proteins and show that knockdown of these factors strongly augments NGFR regulation. Finally, we show that the ZNF827 protein is part of the mRNP complex, suggesting a functional co-evolution of a circRNA and the protein encoded by its linear pre-mRNA host.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58360">A new no-report paradigm reveals that face cells encode both consciously perceived and suppressed stimuli</a></h4>

A powerful paradigm to identify neural correlates of consciousness is binocular rivalry, wherein a constant visual stimulus evokes a varying conscious percept. It has recently been suggested that activity modulations observed during rivalry may represent the act of report rather than the conscious percept itself. Here, we performed single-unit recordings from face patches in macaque inferotemporal (IT) cortex using a no-report paradigm in which the animal's conscious percept was inferred from eye movements. We found that high proportions of IT neurons represented the conscious percept even without active report. Furthermore, on single trials we could decode both the conscious percept and the suppressed stimulus. Together, these findings indicate that (1) IT cortex possesses a true neural correlate of consciousness, and (2) this correlate consists of a population code wherein single cells multiplex representation of the conscious percept and veridical physical stimulus, rather than a subset of cells perfectly reflecting consciousness.

<p>by Tiina Manninen, Ausra Saudargiene, Marja-Leena Linne</p>

Astrocytes have been shown to modulate synaptic transmission and plasticity in specific cortical synapses, but our understanding of the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms remains limited. Here we present a new biophysicochemical model of a somatosensory cortical layer 4 to layer 2/3 synapse to study the role of astrocytes in spike-timing-dependent long-term depression (t-LTD) <i>in vivo</i>. By applying the synapse model and electrophysiological data recorded from rodent somatosensory cortex, we show that a signal from a postsynaptic neuron, orchestrated by endocannabinoids, astrocytic calcium signaling, and presynaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors coupled with calcineurin signaling, induces t-LTD which is sensitive to the temporal difference between post- and presynaptic firing. We predict for the first time the dynamics of astrocyte-mediated molecular mechanisms underlying t-LTD and link complex biochemical networks at presynaptic, postsynaptic, and astrocytic sites to the time window of t-LTD induction. During t-LTD a single astrocyte acts as a delay factor for fast neuronal activity and integrates fast neuronal sensory processing with slow non-neuronal processing to modulate synaptic properties in the brain. Our results suggest that astrocytes play a critical role in synaptic computation during postnatal development and are of paramount importance in guiding the development of brain circuit functions, learning and memory.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hl6PJIbIOEc" width="1" />

<p>by Daniel Nüst, Vanessa Sochat, Ben Marwick, Stephen J. Eglen, Tim Head, Tony Hirst, Benjamin D. Evans</p>

Computational science has been greatly improved by the use of containers for packaging software and data dependencies. In a scholarly context, the main drivers for using these containers are transparency and support of reproducibility; in turn, a workflow’s reproducibility can be greatly affected by the choices that are made with respect to building containers. In many cases, the build process for the container’s image is created from instructions provided in a Dockerfile format. In support of this approach, we present a set of rules to help researchers write understandable Dockerfiles for typical data science workflows. By following the rules in this article, researchers can create containers suitable for sharing with fellow scientists, for including in scholarly communication such as education or scientific papers, and for effective and sustainable personal workflows.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4EN5XLEWE9Q" width="1" />

Hypertension is the most important cause of death and disability in the elderly. In 9 out of 10 cases, the molecular cause, however, is unknown. One mechanistic hypothesis involves impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation through reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. Indeed, ROS forming NADPH oxidase (<i>Nox</i>) genes associate with hypertension, yet target validation has been negative. We re-investigate this association by molecular network analysis and identify NOX5, not present in rodents, as a sole neighbor to human vasodilatory endothelial nitric oxide (NO) signaling. In hypertensive patients, endothelial microparticles indeed contained higher levels of NOX5—but not NOX1, NOX2, or NOX4—with a bimodal distribution correlating with disease severity. Mechanistically, mice expressing human <i>N</i>ox5 in endothelial cells developed—upon aging—severe systolic hypertension and impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation due to uncoupled NO synthase (NOS). We conclude that NOX5-induced uncoupling of endothelial NOS is a causal mechanism and theragnostic target of an age-related hypertension endotype. <i>N</i>ox5 knock-in (KI) mice represent the first mechanism-based animal model of hypertension.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/OYrIOvWWwEA" width="1" />

<p>by Silvio Macias, Kushal Bakshi, Francisco Garcia-Rosales, Julio C. Hechavarria, Michael Smotherman</p>

Echolocating bats rely upon spectral interference patterns in echoes to reconstruct fine details of a reflecting object’s shape. However, the acoustic modulations required to do this are extremely brief, raising questions about how their auditory cortex encodes and processes such rapid and fine spectrotemporal details. Here, we tested the hypothesis that biosonar target shape representation in the primary auditory cortex (A1) is more reliably encoded by changes in spike timing (latency) than spike rates and that latency is sufficiently precise to support a synchronization-based ensemble representation of this critical auditory object feature space. To test this, we measured how the spatiotemporal activation patterns of A1 changed when naturalistic spectral notches were inserted into echo mimic stimuli. Neurons tuned to notch frequencies were predicted to exhibit longer latencies and lower mean firing rates due to lower signal amplitudes at their preferred frequencies, and both were found to occur. Comparative analyses confirmed that significantly more information was recoverable from changes in spike times relative to concurrent changes in spike rates. With this data, we reconstructed spatiotemporal activation maps of A1 and estimated the level of emerging neuronal spike synchrony between cortical neurons tuned to different frequencies. The results support existing computational models, indicating that spectral interference patterns may be efficiently encoded by a cascading tonotopic sequence of neural synchronization patterns within an ensemble of network activity that relates to the physical features of the reflecting object surface.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/3FZBnVuZ3uI" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Theta oscillations in the hippocampus have many behavioral correlates, with the magnitude and vigor of ongoing movement being the most salient. Many consider correlates of locomotion with hippocampal theta to be a confound in delineating theta contributions to cognitive processes. Theory and empirical experiments suggest theta‐movement relationships are important if spatial navigation is to support higher cognitive processes. In the current study, we tested if variations in speed modulation of hippocampal theta can predict spatial learning rates in the water maze. Using multi‐step regression, we find that the magnitude and robustness of hippocampal theta frequency versus speed scaling can predict water maze learning rates. Using a generalized linear model, we also demonstrate that speed and water maze learning are the best predictors of hippocampal theta frequency and amplitude. Our findings suggest movement‐speed correlations with hippocampal theta frequency may be actively used in spatial learning.</p>

<p>WIDE AWAKE (WAKE) was first identified in <i>Drosophila</i> as a clock‐output molecule that regulates the timing of sleep and arousal. There is a single homolog of WAKE (mWAKE/ANKFN1/NMF9) in mice, which has previously shown to be enriched in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the master circadian pacemaker. This present work surveys the brain expression pattern of mWAKE using multiple approaches. First, <i>mWake</i> mRNA expression is examined using RNAscope in situ hybridization. Second, mWAKE protein expression is investigated using two different transgenic animal models: an <i>mWake</i>
<sup>
   <i>V5</i>
</sup> mouse where a V5 tag is fused directly to the end of the protein and an <i>mWake</i>
<sup>
   <i>tdTomato‐2A‐Cre</i>
</sup> mouse where tdTomato is inserted in‐frame within the gene. Third, we analyze scRNA‐Seq data to characterize the molecular identity of <i>mWake</i> neurons in the hypothalamus. These data reveal that mWAKE labels a distributed subset of GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons across the brainstem, subcortical regions, and cortex, with significant expression in the hypothalamus. This study may provide a potential roadmap for future studies of the circadian regulation of distinct circuits and behaviors.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Structure–function analyses of the mammalian brain have historically relied on anatomically‐based approaches. In these investigations, physical, chemical, or electrolytic lesions of anatomical structures are applied, and the resulting behavioral or physiological responses assayed. An alternative approach is to focus on the expression pattern of a molecule whose function has been characterized and then use genetic intersectional methods to optogenetically or chemogenetically manipulate distinct circuits. We previously identified WIDE AWAKE (WAKE) in <i>Drosophila</i>, a clock output molecule that mediates the temporal regulation of sleep onset and sleep maintenance. More recently, we have studied the mouse homolog, mWAKE/ANKFN1, and our data suggest that its basic role in the circadian regulation of arousal is conserved. Here, we perform a systematic analysis of the expression pattern of <i>mWake</i> mRNA, protein, and cells throughout the adult mouse brain. We find that mWAKE labels neurons in a restricted, but distributed manner, in multiple regions of the hypothalamus (including the suprachiasmatic nucleus, dorsomedial hypothalamus, and tuberomammillary nucleus region), the limbic system, sensory processing nuclei, and additional specific brainstem, subcortical, and cortical areas. Interestingly, mWAKE is also observed in non‐neuronal ependymal cells. In addition, to describe the molecular identities and clustering of <i>mWake</i>
<sup>+</sup> cells, we provide detailed analyses of single cell RNA sequencing data from the hypothalamus, a region with particularly significant mWAKE expression. These findings lay the groundwork for future studies into the potential role of mWAKE<sup>+</sup> cells in the rhythmic control of diverse behaviors and physiological processes.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Members of the POU4F/Brn3 transcription factor family have an established role in the development of retinal ganglion cell (RGCs) types, the main transducers of visual information from the mammalian eye to the brain. Our previous work using sparse random recombination of a conditional knock‐in reporter allele expressing alkaline phosphatase (AP) and intersectional genetics had identified three types of Brn3c positive (Brn3c<sup>+</sup>) RGCs. Here, we describe a novel Brn3c<sup>Cre</sup> mouse allele generated by serial Dre to Cre recombination and use it to explore the expression overlap of Brn3c with Brn3a and Brn3b and the dendritic arbor morphologies and visual stimulus response properties of Brn3c<sup>+</sup> RGC types. Furthermore, we explore brain nuclei that express Brn3c or receive input from Brn3c<sup>+</sup> neurons. Our analysis reveals a much larger number of Brn3c<sup>+</sup> RGCs and more diverse set of RGC types than previously reported. Most RGCs expressing Brn3c during development are still Brn3c positive in the adult, and all express Brn3a while only about half express Brn3b. Genetic Brn3c‐Brn3b intersection reveals an area of increased RGC density, extending from dorsotemporal to ventrolateral across the retina and overlapping with the mouse binocular field of view. In addition, we report a Brn3c<sup>+</sup> RGC projection to the thalamic reticular nucleus, a visual nucleus that was not previously shown to receive retinal input. Furthermore, Brn3c<sup>+</sup> neurons highlight a previously unknown subdivision of the deep mesencephalic nucleus.

<p>Insects use UV light as navigation signals to locate the position of the sun. In this study, we construct a comprehensive map of the downstream circuitry of UV‐sensing R7 neurons by analyzing large‐scale 3D neural data at the single‐neuron resolution in <i>Drosophila</i>. We find six families of visual projection neurons that connect the optic lobe to the central brain. Our imaging study reveals the morphological diversity of these visual projection neurons of the medulla layer 6 (M<sub>6</sub>) downstream circuitry suggests the multi‐dimensional processing of UV information via hierarchical, multiple‐layer, parallel, and bilateral circuits in the brain. Furthermore, we describe a detailed neuroanatomical description of the lateral anterior optic tubercle (L‐AOTU) and the bulb (BU).

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The brain perceives visual information and controls behavior depending on its underlying neural circuits. How UV information is represented and processed in the brain remains poorly understood. In <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, UV light is detected by the R7 photoreceptor that project exclusively into the medulla layer 6 (M<sub>6</sub>). Herein, we imaged 28,768 single neurons and identified 238 visual projection neurons linking M<sub>6</sub> to the central brain. Based on morphology and connectivity, these visual projection neurons were systematically classified into 94 cell types belonging to 12 families. Three tracts connected M<sub>6</sub> in each optic lobe to the central brain: One dorsal tract linking to the ipsilateral lateral anterior optic tubercle (L‐AOTU) and two medial tracts linking to the ipsilateral ventral medial protocerebrum (VMP) and the contralateral VMP. The M<sub>6</sub> information was primarily represented in the L‐AOTU. Each L‐AOTU consisted of four columns that each contained three glomeruli. Each L‐AOTU glomerulus received inputs from M<sub>6</sub> subdomains and gave outputs to a glomerulus within the ellipsoid body dendritic region, suggesting specific processing of spatial information through the dorsal pathway. Furthermore, the middle columns of the L‐AOTUs of both hemispheres were connected via the intertubercle tract, suggesting information integration between the two eyes. In contrast, an ascending neuron linked each VMP to all glomeruli in the bulb and the L‐AOTU, bilaterally, suggesting general processing of information through the ventral pathway. Altogether, these diverse morphologies of the visual projection neurons suggested multi‐dimensional processing of UV information through parallel and bilateral circuits in the <i>Drosophila</i> brain.</p>

<p>Visual metacognition—the introspection and evaluation of one’s own visual perceptual processes—is measured through both decision confidence and “metacognitive efficiency.” Metacognitive efficiency refers to an individual’s ability to accurately judge incorrect and correct decisions through confidence ratings given their task performance. Previous imaging studies in humans and nonhuman primates reported widely distributed brain regions being involved in decision confidence and metacognition. However, the neural correlates of metacognition are remarkably inconsistent across studies concerning spatial outline. Therefore, this study investigates the neural correlates of visual metacognition by examining co-activation across regions that scale with visual decision confidence. We hypothesized that interacting processes of perceptual and metacognitive performance contribute to the arising decision confidence in distributed, but segregable co-activating brain regions. To test this hypothesis, we performed task-fMRI in healthy humans during a visual backward masking task with four-scale, post-decision confidence ratings. We measured blood oxygenation covariation patterns, which served as a physiological proxy for co-activation across brain regions. Decision confidence ratings and an individual’s metacognitive efficiency served as behavioral measures for metacognition. We found three distinct co-activation clusters involved in decision confidence: the first included right-centered fronto-temporal-parietal regions, the second included left temporal and parietal regions, and the left basal forebrain (BF), and the third included cerebellar regions. The right fronto-temporal-parietal cluster including the supplementary eye field and the right basal forebrain showed stronger co-activation in subjects with higher metacognitive efficiency. Our results provide novel evidence for co-activation of widely distributed fronto-parieto-temporal regions involved in visual confidence. The supplementary eye field was the only region that activated for both decision confidence and metacognitive efficiency, suggesting the supplementary eye field plays a key role in visual metacognition. Our results link findings in electrophysiology studies and human fMRI studies and provide evidence that confidence estimates arise from the integration of multiple information processing pathways.</p>

<p>Oscillations in the granule cell layer (GCL) of the cerebellar cortex have been related to behavior and could facilitate communication with the cerebral cortex. These local field potential (LFP) oscillations, strong at 4–12 Hz in the rodent cerebellar cortex during awake immobility, should also be an indicator of an underlying influence on the patterns of the cerebellar cortex neuronal firing during rest. To address this hypothesis, cerebellar cortex LFPs and simultaneous single-neuron activity were collected during LFP oscillatory periods in the GCL of awake resting rats. During these oscillatory episodes, different types of units across the GCL and Purkinje cell layers showed variable phase-relation with the oscillatory cycles. Overall, 74% of the Golgi cell firing and 54% of the Purkinje cell simple spike (SS) firing were phase-locked with the oscillations, displaying a clear phase relationship. Despite this tendency, fewer Golgi cells (50%) and Purkinje cell’s SSs (25%) showed an oscillatory firing pattern. Oscillatory phase-locked spikes for the Golgi and Purkinje cells occurred towards the peak of the LFP cycle. GCL LFP oscillations had a strong capacity to predict the timing of Golgi cell spiking activity, indicating a strong influence of this oscillatory phenomenon over the GCL. Phase-locking was not as prominent for the Purkinje cell SS firing, indicating a weaker influence over the Purkinje cell layer, yet a similar phase relation. Overall, synaptic activity underlying GCL LFP oscillations likely exert an influence on neuronal population firing patterns in the cerebellar cortex in the awake resting state and could have a preparatory neural network shaping capacity serving as a neural baseline for upcoming cerebellar operations.</p>

<p>Neural systems involved in processing natural rewards and drugs of abuse overlap and exposure to drugs of abuse induce neuroadaptations that can cause compulsive-like behavior. For example, the recruitment of the orexin (Orx) system by drugs of abuse has been proposed to induce neuroadaptations that in turn alter its function, reflected by maladaptive, compulsive, and addictive behavior. Orexin neurons project to the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT)—particularly the posterior part (pPVT), a structure that plays a key role in stress regulation. This study investigated whether Orx transmission in the pPVT plays a role in stress-induced reinstatement of reward-seeking behavior toward ethanol (EtOH) and a highly palatable food reward [sweetened condensed milk (SCM)] in rats and whether this role changes with EtOH dependence. After being trained to orally self-administer EtOH or SCM, the rats were made dependent (EtOH<sub>D</sub> and SCM<sub>D</sub>) by chronic intermittent EtOH vapor exposure. The control nondependent groups (EtOH<sub>ND</sub> and SCM<sub>ND</sub>) were exposed to air. Following extinction, the rats were tested for stress-induced reinstatement of EtOH- and SCM-seeking behavior. Stress reinstated EtOH- and SCM-seeking behavior in all groups (EtOH<sub>D/ND</sub> and SCM<sub>D/ND</sub>). Administration of the dual Orx receptor (OrxR) antagonist TCS1102 (15 μg) in the pPVT prevented stress-induced reinstatement only in dependent rats (EtOH<sub>D</sub> and SCM<sub>D</sub>). In parallel, the qPCR analysis showed that Orx mRNA expression in the hypothalamus and OrxR1/R2 mRNA expression in the pPVT were increased at the time of testing in the EtOH<sub>D</sub> and SCM<sub>D</sub> groups. These results are the first to implicate Orx transmission in the pPVT in the stress-induced reinstatement of reward-seeking behavior in EtOH dependent rats and indicate the maladaptive recruitment of Orx transmission in the pPVT by EtOH dependence.</p>

<p>A large variety of methods exist to estimate brain coupling in the frequency domain from electrophysiological data measured, e.g., by EEG and MEG. Those data are to reasonable approximation, though certainly not perfectly, Gaussian distributed. This work is based on the well-known fact that for Gaussian distributed data, the cross-spectrum completely determines all statistical properties. In particular, for an infinite number of data, all normalized coupling measures at a given frequency are a function of complex coherency. However, it is largely unknown what the functional relations are. We here present those functional relations for six different measures: the weighted phase lag index, the phase lag index, the absolute value and imaginary part of the phase locking value (PLV), power envelope correlation, and power envelope correlation with correction for artifacts of volume conduction. With the exception of PLV, the final results are simple closed form formulas. In an excursion we also discuss differences between short time Fourier transformation and Hilbert transformation for estimations in the frequency domain. We tested in simulations of linear and non-linear dynamical systems and for empirical resting state EEG on sensor level to what extent a model, namely the respective function of coherency, can explain the observed couplings. For empirical data we found that for measures of phase-phase coupling deviations from the model are in general minor, while power envelope correlations systematically deviate from the model for all frequencies. For power envelope correlation with correction for artifacts of volume conduction the model cannot explain the observed couplings at all. We also analyzed power envelope correlation as a function of time and frequency in an event related experiment using a stroop reaction task and found significant event related deviations mostly in the alpha range.</p>

<p>One major challenge in medical imaging analysis is the lack of label and annotation which usually requires medical knowledge and training. This issue is particularly serious in the brain image analysis such as the analysis of retinal vasculature, which directly reflects the vascular condition of Central Nervous System (CNS). In this paper, we present a novel semi-supervised learning algorithm to boost the performance of random forest under limited labeled data by exploiting the local structure of unlabeled data. We identify the key bottleneck of random forest to be the information gain calculation and replace it with a graph-embedded entropy which is more reliable for insufficient labeled data scenario. By properly modifying the training process of standard random forest, our algorithm significantly improves the performance while preserving the virtue of random forest such as low computational burden and robustness over over-fitting. Our method has shown a superior performance on both medical imaging analysis and machine learning benchmarks.</p>

<p>Previous studies have reported that some objects evoke a sense of local three-dimensional space (space-defining; SD), while others do not (space-ambiguous; SA), despite being imagined or viewed in isolation devoid of a background context. Moreover, people show a strong preference for SD objects when given a choice of objects with which to mentally construct scene imagery. When deconstructing scenes, people retain significantly more SD objects than SA objects. It, therefore, seems that SD objects might enjoy a privileged role in scene construction. In the current study, we leveraged the high temporal resolution of magnetoencephalography (MEG) to compare the neural responses to SD and SA objects while they were being used to build imagined scene representations, as this has not been examined before using neuroimaging. On each trial, participants gradually built a scene image from three successive auditorily-presented object descriptions and an imagined 3D space. We then examined the neural dynamics associated with the points during scene construction when either SD or SA objects were being imagined. We found that SD objects elicited theta changes relative to SA objects in two brain regions, the right ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the right superior temporal gyrus (STG). Furthermore, using dynamic causal modeling, we observed that the vmPFC drove STG activity. These findings may indicate that SD objects serve to activate schematic and conceptual knowledge in vmPFC and STG upon which scene representations are then built.</p>

<p>Neuroimaging studies have revealed a multitude of brain regions associated with self- and other-referential processing, but the question how the distinction between self, close other, and distant other is processed in the brain still remains unanswered. The default mode network (DMN) is the primary network associated with the processing of self, whereas task-positive networks (TPN) are indispensable for the processing of external objects. We hypothesize that self- and close-other-processing would engage DMN more than TPN, whereas distant-other-processing would engage TPN to a greater extent. To test this hypothesis, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) functional connectivity data obtained in the course of a trait adjective judgment task while subjects evaluated themselves, the best friend, a neutral stranger, and an unpleasant person. A positive association between the degree of self-relatedness and the degree of DMN dominance was revealed in cortical midline structures (CMS) and the left lateral prefrontal cortex. Relative to TPN, DMN showed greater connectivity in me than in friend, in friend than in stranger, and in stranger than in unpleasant conditions. These results show that the less the evaluated person is perceived as self-related, the more the balance of activity in the brain shifts from the DMN to the TPN.</p>

<p>Background: Antagonistic tasks are cognitive-motor task trainings. Intervention programs involving antagonistic exercise tasks are being employed to help prevent falls and reduce the need for nursing care in older populations. Meanwhile, the effects of such tasks on blood flow in the brain remain obscure. This study aimed to clarify the effects of antagonistic tasks on prefrontal cortical cerebral hemodynamics.</p><p>Materials and Methods: We assessed 13 healthy adults (two men, 11 women; mean age, 21.4 ± 1.0 years). Participants imitated each of the antagonistic tasks presented on a PC monitor placed at a 120-mm viewing distance. All participants performed six tasks, consisting of upper-limb tasks (non-antagonism, simple antagonism, and complex antagonism) and upper- and lower-limb tasks (tasks combining lower-limb opening and closing movements with each upper-limb task). We used near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to measure cerebral blood flow dynamics, with oxygenated hemoglobin (Oxy-Hb) concentration changes as the main outcome. A 10-channel probe was placed on the participants’ forehead, focusing on the prefrontal cortex. We first obtained a baseline NIRS measurement for 10 s; the participants then imitated the task presented on the PC monitor for 90 s. We measured the number of errors and the subjective difficulty of each task.</p><p>Results: The increase in prefrontal cortex Oxy-Hb concentration was significantly higher in the complex antagonist conditions than in the non-antagonistic and simple antagonistic conditions. There were no significant prefrontal cortex Oxy-Hb differences between the upper limb and upper- and lower-limb conditions (increasing number of motor limbs).</p><p>Conclusions: The study findings support that an increase in finger-shaped complexity has a greater effect on cerebral blood flow dynamics in the prefrontal cortex than does an increase in the number of motor limbs involved in the task.</p>

<p>Facial trustworthiness and feedback information of trustees can influence trustors’ investment behavior in trust games. This study investigated the temporal features of outcome evaluation (evaluation of feedback) and how they influence the processing of facial trustworthiness. A total of 25 college students participated in a decision-making task in which feedback was presented prior to a face stimulus. The decision of participants to continue investing was evaluated. We observed that trustors were more inclined to keep investing in trustworthy trustees or those appearing after positive feedback (gains). Event-related potential (ERP) results revealed that in the face presentation stage, trustworthy faces with losses induced more negative feedback-related negativity (FRN) than did trustworthy faces with gains and untrustworthy faces with losses. Further, faces that did not meet expectations induced more negative FRN. Trustworthy faces with gains induced more positive late positive component (LPC) than did trustworthy faces with losses and generated more motivated attention. Bottom–up and top–down processes were integrated for facial trustworthiness perception at different stages. In sum, top–down processing exerted a greater impact during the early stage of facial trustworthiness perception, both top–down and bottom–up processing were involved in the medium term, and bottom–up processing exerted a greater impact in the later stage.</p>

<p>The radial dimension expands during central nervous system development after the proliferative neuroepithelium is molecularly patterned. The process is associated with neurogenesis, radial glia scaffolding, and migration of immature neurons into the developing mantle stratum. Radial histogenetic units, defined as a delimited neural polyclone whose cells share the same molecular profile, are molded during these processes, and usually become roughly stratified into periventricular, intermediate, and superficial (subpial) strata wherein neuronal cell types may differ and be distributed in various patterns. Cell-cell adhesion or repulsion phenomena together with interaction with local intercellular matrix cues regulate the acquisition of nuclear, reticular, or layer histogenetic forms in such strata. Finally, the progressive addition of inputs and outputs soon follows the purely neurogenetic and radial migratory phase. Frequently there is heterochrony in the radial development of adjacent histogenetic units, apart of peculiarities in differentiation due to non-shared aspects of the respective molecular profiles. Tangential migrations may add complexity to radial unit cytoarchitecture and function. The study of the contributions of such genetically controlled radial histogenetic units to the emerging complex neural structure is a key instrument to understand central nervous system morphology and function. One recent example in this scenario is the recently proposed radial model of the mouse pallial amygdala. This is theoretically valid generally in mammals (Garcia-Calero et al., 2020), and subdivides the nuclear complex of the pallial amygdala into five main radial units. The approach applies a novel ad hoc amygdalar section plane, given the observed obliquity of the amygdalar radial glial framework. The general relevance of radial unit studies for clarifying structural analysis of all complex brain regions such as the pallial amygdala is discussed, with additional examples.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, for which aging remains the major risk factor. Aging is under a consistent pressure of increasing brain entropy (BEN) due to the progressive brain deteriorations. Noticeably, the brain constantly consumes a large amount of energy to maintain its functional integrity, likely creating or maintaining a big “reserve” to counteract the high entropy. Malfunctions of this latent reserve may indicate a critical point of disease progression. The purpose of this study was to characterize BEN in aging and AD and to test an inverse-U-shape BEN model: BEN increases with age and AD pathology in normal aging but decreases in the AD continuum. BEN was measured with resting state fMRI and compared across aging and the AD continuum. Associations of BEN with age, education, clinical symptoms, and pathology were examined by multiple regression. The analysis results highlighted resting BEN in the default mode network, medial temporal lobe, and prefrontal cortex and showed that: (1) BEN increased with age and pathological deposition in normal aging but decreased with age and pathological deposition in the AD continuum; (2) AD showed catastrophic BEN reduction, which was related to more severe cognitive impairment and daily function disability; and (3) BEN decreased with education years in normal aging, but not in the AD continuum. BEN evolution follows an inverse-U trajectory when AD progresses from normal aging to AD dementia. Education is beneficial for suppressing the entropy increase potency in normal aging.</p>

<p>Recent research regards the electroencephalogram (EEG) as a promising method to study real-time brain dynamic changes in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), but a deeper understanding is needed to discern coincident pathophysiology, patterns of changes, and diagnosis. This review summarized recent research on EEG characterization related to the cognitive and motor functions in PD patients and discussed its potential to be used as diagnostic biomarkers. Thirty papers out of 220 published from 2010 to 2020 were reviewed. Movement abnormalities and cognitive decline are related to changes in EEG spectrum and event-related potentials (ERPs) during typical oddball paradigms and/or combined motor tasks. Abnormalities in β and δ frequency bands are, respectively the main manifestation of dyskinesia and cognitive decline in PD. The review showed that PD patients have noteworthy changes in specific EEG characterizations, however, the underlying mechanism of the interrelation between gait and cognitive is still unclear. Understanding the specific nature of the relationship is essential for development of novel invasive clinical diagnostic and therapeutic methods.</p>

<p>Cell-based screening of bioactive compounds has served as an important gateway in drug discovery. In the present report, using human neuroblastoma cells and enrolling an extensive three-step screening of 57 phytochemicals, we have identified caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) as a potent neurodifferentiating natural compound. Analyses of control and CAPE-induced neurodifferentiated cells revealed: (i) modulation of several key proteins (NF200, MAP-2, NeuN, PSD95, Tuj1, GAP43, and GFAP) involved in neurodifferentiation process; and (ii) attenuation of neuronal stemness (HOXD13, WNT3, and Msh-2) and proliferation-promoting (CDC-20, CDK-7, and BubR1) proteins. We anticipated that the neurodifferentiation potential of CAPE may be beneficial for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and tested it using the Drosophila model of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and mice model of amnesia/loss of memory. In both models, CAPE exhibited improved disease symptoms and activation of physiological functions. Remarkably, CAPE-treated mice showed increased levels of neurotrophin-BDNF, neural progenitor marker-Nestin, and differentiation marker-NeuN, both in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Taken together, we demonstrate the differentiation-inducing and therapeutic potential of CAPE for neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<p>Human epidemiological evidence and animal experimental data suggest that chronic manganese (Mn) exposure increases the risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and amyloid plaques, a hallmark of AD brain pathology, but the underlying mechanisms were not fully understood. Using the transgenic APP/PS1/Tau triple transgenic AD (3×Tg-AD) mouse model and mouse-derived microglia and neuroblastoma cell lines, we found that chronic 5-month Mn treatment increased beta amyloid peptide (Aβ) expression and Aβ plaques in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus in these 3×Tg-AD mice. Furthermore, we found that the β- and γ-secretase cleavage activities were markedly increased, while α-secretase cleavage activity was reduced in the brain of Mn-treated AD mice; these effects increase Aβ production and thus are amyloidogenic. Equally important, Mn treatment alone did not alter β-secretase 1 (BACE1) gene expression or Aβ production in amyloidogenic mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene hAPPsw-transfected N2a cells (APPsw-N2a), but in APPsw-N2a cells either co-cultured with microglia or cultured with microglia-conditioned media, Mn exposure increased BACE1 expression and amyloidogenesis. We further determined that Mn exposure promoted the activation of microglia both in 3×Tg-AD mouse brains and in cultured microglia cells, and increased the secretion of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Taken together, these results suggest that Mn may increase the release of IL-1β and TNF-α from microglia that in turn stimulates the expression of BACE1 gene and protein and consequently Aβ production; this novel molecular mechanism not only advances our understanding about the amyloidogenic effect of chronic Mn exposure reported for special human populations but also indicates Mn dyshomeostasis as a potential contributor to AD pathogenesis.</p>

<p>Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is characterised by the progressive accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) in the walls of cerebral capillaries and arteries representing a major cause of haemorrhagic stroke including lobar intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) and convexity subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). Haemorrhaging from CAA predominantly involves smaller arteries rather than arterial aneurysm. Restricted bleeding into the subarachnoid space in CAA results in asymptomatic or mild symptomatic SAH. Herein, we present an autopsied case of massive SAH related to CAA. An 89-year-old male with a history of mild Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and advanced pancreatic cancer with liver metastasis developed sudden onset of coma. Head CT illustrated ICH located in the right frontal lobe and right insula, as well as SAH bilaterally spreading from the basal cistern to the Sylvian fissure, with hydrocephalus and brain herniation. He died about 24 h after onset and the post-mortem examination showed no evidence of arterial aneurysm. The substantial accumulation of Aβ in the vessels around the haemorrhagic lesions led to the diagnosis of ICH related to CAA and secondary SAH, which may have been aggravated by old age and malignancy. This case suggests that CAA can cause severe SAH resembling aneurysmal origin and thus may be overlooked when complicated by atypical cerebral haemorrhage.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63368">Innovation of heterochromatin functions drives rapid evolution of essential ZAD-ZNF genes in <i>Drosophila</i></a></h4>

Contrary to dogma, evolutionarily young and dynamic genes can encode essential functions. We find that evolutionarily dynamic <i>ZAD-ZNF</i> genes, which encode the most abundant class of insect transcription factors, are more likely to encode essential functions in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> than ancient, conserved <i>ZAD-ZNF</i> genes. We focus on the <i>Nicknack ZAD-ZNF</i> gene, which is evolutionarily young, poorly retained in <i>Drosophila</i> species, and evolves under strong positive selection. Yet we find that it is necessary for larval development in <i>D. melanogaster.</i> We show that <i>Nicknack</i> encodes a heterochromatin-localizing protein like its paralog <i>Oddjob</i>, also an evolutionarily dynamic yet essential <i>ZAD-ZNF</i> gene. We find that the divergent <i>D. simulans</i> Nicknack protein can still localize to <i>D. melanogaster</i> heterochromatin and rescue viability of female but not male <i>Nicknack-</i>null <i>D. melanogaster</i>. Our findings suggest that innovation for rapidly changing heterochromatin functions might generally explain the essentiality of many evolutionarily dynamic <i>ZAD-ZNF</i> genes in insects.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/62420">The effects of age and systemic metabolism on anti-tumor T cell responses</a></h4>

Average age and obesity prevalence are increasing globally. Both aging and obesity are characterized by profound systemic metabolic and immunologic changes and are cancer risk factors. The mechanisms linking age and body weight to cancer are incompletely understood, but recent studies have provided evidence that the anti-tumor immune response is reduced in both conditions, while responsiveness to immune checkpoint blockade, a form of cancer immunotherapy, is paradoxically intact. Dietary restriction, which promotes health and lifespan, may enhance cancer immunity. These findings illustrate that the systemic context can impact anti-tumor immunity and immunotherapy responsiveness. Here, we review the current knowledge of how age and systemic metabolic state affect the anti-tumor immune response, with an emphasis on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, which are key players in anti-tumor immunity. A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms may lead to novel therapies enhancing anti-tumor immunity in the context of aging or metabolic dysfunction.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/61834">SpikeInterface, a unified framework for spike sorting</a></h4>

Much development has been directed towards improving the performance and automation of spike sorting. This continuous development, while essential, has contributed to an over-saturation of new, incompatible tools that hinders rigorous benchmarking and complicates reproducible analysis. To address these limitations, we developed SpikeInterface, a Python framework designed to unify preexisting spike sorting technologies into a single codebase and to facilitate straightforward comparison and adoption of different approaches. With a few lines of code, researchers can reproducibly run, compare, and benchmark most modern spike sorting algorithms; pre-process, post-process, and visualize extracellular datasets; validate, curate, and export sorting outputs; and more. In this paper, we provide an overview of SpikeInterface and, with applications to real and simulated datasets, demonstrate how it can be utilized to reduce the burden of manual curation and to more comprehensively benchmark automated spike sorters.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/61393">Biochemical patterns of antibody polyreactivity revealed through a bioinformatics-based analysis of CDR loops</a></h4>

Antibodies are critical components of adaptive immunity, binding with high affinity to pathogenic epitopes. Antibodies undergo rigorous selection to achieve this high affinity, yet some maintain an additional basal level of low affinity, broad reactivity to diverse epitopes, a phenomenon termed 'polyreactivity'. While polyreactivity has been observed in antibodies isolated from various immunological niches, the biophysical properties that allow for promiscuity in a protein selected for high affinity binding to a single target remain unclear. Using a database of over 1,000 polyreactive and non-polyreactive antibody sequences, we created a bioinformatic pipeline to isolate key determinants of polyreactivity. These determinants, which include an increase in inter-loop crosstalk and a propensity for a neutral binding surface, are sufficient to generate a classifier able to identify polyreactive antibodies with over 75% accuracy. The framework from which this classifier was built is generalizable, and represents a powerful, automated pipeline for future immune repertoire analysis.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/60939">Reprogramming of bone marrow myeloid progenitor cells in patients with severe coronary artery disease</a></h4>

Atherosclerosis is the major cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Monocyte-derived macrophages are the most abundant immune cells in atherosclerotic plaques. In patients with atherosclerotic CVD, leukocytes have a hyperinflammatory phenotype. We hypothesize that immune cell reprogramming in these patients occurs at the level of myeloid progenitors. We included 13 patients with coronary artery disease due to severe atherosclerosis and 13 subjects without atherosclerosis in an exploratory study. Cytokine production capacity after <i>ex vivo</i> stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNCs) and bone marrow MNCs was higher in patients with atherosclerosis. In BM-MNCs this was associated with increased glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. The BM composition was skewed towards myelopoiesis and transcriptome analysis of HSC/GMP cell populations revealed enrichment of neutrophil- and monocyte-related pathways. These results show that in patients with atherosclerosis, activation of innate immune cells occurs at the level of myeloid progenitors, which adds exciting opportunities for novel treatment strategies.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/60031">The SSVEP tracks attention, not consciousness, during perceptual filling-in</a></h4>

Research on the neural basis of conscious perception has almost exclusively shown that becoming aware of a stimulus leads to increased neural responses. By designing a novel form of perceptual filling-in (PFI) overlaid with a dynamic texture display, we frequency-tagged multiple disappearing targets as well as their surroundings. We show that in a PFI paradigm the disappearance of a stimulus and subjective invisibility are associated with increases in neural activity, as measured with steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP), in electroencephalography (EEG). We also find that this increase correlates with alpha-band activity, a well-established neural measure of attention. These findings cast doubt on the direct relationship previously reported between the strength of neural activity and conscious perception, at least when measured with current tools, such as the SSVEP. Instead we conclude that SSVEP strength more closely measures changes in attention.

<p>by Elif Köksal Ersöz, Julien Modolo, Fabrice Bartolomei, Fabrice Wendling</p>

Epilepsy is a dynamic and complex neurological disease affecting about 1% of the worldwide population, among which 30% of the patients are drug-resistant. Epilepsy is characterized by recurrent episodes of paroxysmal neural discharges (the so-called seizures), which manifest themselves through a large-amplitude rhythmic activity observed in depth-EEG recordings, in particular in local field potentials (LFPs). The signature characterizing the transition to seizures involves complex oscillatory patterns, which could serve as a marker to prevent seizure initiation by triggering appropriate therapeutic neurostimulation methods. To investigate such protocols, neurophysiological lumped-parameter models at the mesoscopic scale, namely neural mass models, are powerful tools that not only mimic the LFP signals but also give insights on the neural mechanisms related to different stages of seizures. Here, we analyze the multiple time-scale dynamics of a neural mass model and explain the underlying structure of the complex oscillations observed before seizure initiation. We investigate population-specific effects of the stimulation and the dependence of stimulation parameters on synaptic timescales. In particular, we show that intermediate stimulation frequencies (&gt;20 Hz) can abort seizures if the timescale difference is pronounced. Those results have the potential in the design of therapeutic brain stimulation protocols based on the neurophysiological properties of tissue.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Ikp9WQjg7DQ" width="1" />

Given the complexity and diversity of the cancer genomics profiles, it is challenging to identify distinct clusters from different cancer types. Numerous analyses have been conducted for this propose. Still, the methods they used always do not directly support the high-dimensional omics data across the whole genome (Such as ATAC-seq profiles). In this study, based on the deep adversarial learning, we present an end-to-end approach ClusterATAC to leverage high-dimensional features and explore the classification results. On the ATAC-seq dataset and RNA-seq dataset, ClusterATAC has achieved excellent performance. Since ATAC-seq data plays a crucial role in the study of the effects of non-coding regions on the molecular classification of cancers, we explore the clustering solution obtained by ClusterATAC on the pan-cancer ATAC dataset. In this solution, more than 70% of the clustering are single-tumor-type-dominant, and the vast majority of the remaining clusters are associated with similar tumor types. We explore the representative non-coding loci and their linked genes of each cluster and verify some results by the literature search. These results suggest that a large number of non-coding loci affect the development and progression of cancer through its linked genes, which can potentially advance cancer diagnosis and therapy.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tZDTEu1VwSY" width="1" />

<p>by Richard Wilton, Alexander S. Szalay</p>

In large DNA sequence repositories, archival data storage is often coupled with computers that provide 40 or more CPU threads and multiple GPU (general-purpose graphics processing unit) devices. This presents an opportunity for DNA sequence alignment software to exploit high-concurrency hardware to generate short-read alignments at high speed. Arioc, a GPU-accelerated short-read aligner, can compute WGS (whole-genome sequencing) alignments ten times faster than comparable CPU-only alignment software. When two or more GPUs are available, Arioc's speed increases proportionately because the software executes concurrently on each available GPU device. We have adapted Arioc to recent multi-GPU hardware architectures that support high-bandwidth peer-to-peer memory accesses among multiple GPUs. By modifying Arioc's implementation to exploit this GPU memory architecture we obtained a further 1.8x-2.9x increase in overall alignment speeds. With this additional acceleration, Arioc computes two million short-read alignments per second in a four-GPU system; it can align the reads from a human WGS sequencer run–over 500 million 150nt paired-end reads–in less than 15 minutes. As WGS data accumulates exponentially and high-concurrency computational resources become widespread, Arioc addresses a growing need for timely computation in the short-read data analysis toolchain.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GoN8bqwwA6Q" width="1" />

<p>by Mahdi Golkaram, Chen Zhao, Kristina Kruglyak, Shile Zhang, Sven Bilke</p>

The tumor mutational burden (TMB) is increasingly recognized as an emerging biomarker that predicts improved outcomes or response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in cancer. A multitude of technical and biological factors make it difficult to compare TMB values across platforms, histologies, and treatments. Here, we present a mechanistic model that explains the association between panel size, histology, and TMB threshold with panel performance and survival outcome and demonstrate the limitations of existing methods utilized to harmonize TMB across platforms.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SChzzr3NQOM" width="1" />

The cell is compartmentalised into complex micro-environments allowing an array of specialised biological processes to be carried out in synchrony. Determining a protein’s sub-cellular localisation to one or more of these compartments can therefore be a first step in determining its function. High-throughput and high-accuracy mass spectrometry-based sub-cellular proteomic methods can now shed light on the localisation of thousands of proteins at once. Machine learning algorithms are then typically employed to make protein-organelle assignments. However, these algorithms are limited by insufficient and incomplete annotation. We propose a semi-supervised Bayesian approach to novelty detection, allowing the discovery of additional, previously unannotated sub-cellular niches. Inference in our model is performed in a Bayesian framework, allowing us to quantify uncertainty in the allocation of proteins to new sub-cellular niches, as well as in the number of newly discovered compartments. We apply our approach across 10 mass spectrometry based spatial proteomic datasets, representing a diverse range of experimental protocols. Application of our approach to <i>hyper</i>LOPIT datasets validates its utility by recovering enrichment with chromatin-associated proteins without annotation and uncovers sub-nuclear compartmentalisation which was not identified in the original analysis. Moreover, using sub-cellular proteomics data from <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, we uncover a novel group of proteins trafficking from the ER to the early Golgi apparatus. Overall, we demonstrate the potential for novelty detection to yield biologically relevant niches that are missed by current approaches.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/t8e8t0V_BtA" width="1" />

<p>by David A. Kennedy, Andrew F. Read</p>

Although less common than the evolution of antimicrobial drug resistance, vaccine resistance can and has evolved. How likely is it that COVID-19 vaccines currently in development will be undermined by viral evolution? We argue that this can be determined by repurposing samples that are already being collected as part of clinical trials. Such information would be useful for prioritizing investment among candidate vaccines and maximizing the potential long-term impact of COVID-19 vaccines.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/hUFF69rQUeg" width="1" />

<p>by Rebekah C. Kading, Tigga Kingston</p>

Human perturbation of natural systems is accelerating the emergence of infectious diseases, mandating integration of disease and ecological research. Bats have been associated with recent zoonoses, but our bibliometric analysis of coauthor relationships identified a separation of bat ecologists and infectious disease researchers with few cross-disciplinary relationships. Of 5,645 papers, true interdisciplinary collaborations occurred primarily in research focused on White Nose Syndrome (WNS). This finding is important because it illustrates how research with outcomes favoring both bat conservation and disease mitigation promotes domain integration and network connectivity. We advocate for increased engagement between ecology and infectious researchers to address such common causes and suggest that efforts focus on leveraging existing activities, building interdisciplinary projects, and networking individuals and networks to integrate domains and coordinate resources. We provide specific opportunities for pursuing these strategies through the Bat One Health Research Network (BOHRN).<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/2Ti93dMGzO0" width="1" />

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to analyze longitudinal changes of retinal thickness and their predictive value as biomarkers of disease progression in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (iPD).</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients with Lewy body diseases were enrolled and prospectively evaluated at 3 years, including patients with iPD (n = 42), dementia with Lewy bodies (n = 4), E46K‐<i>SNCA</i> mutation carriers (n = 4), and controls (n = 17). All participants underwent Spectralis retinal optical coherence tomography and Montreal Cognitive Assessment, and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale score was obtained in patients. Macular ganglion cell–inner plexiform layer complex (GCIPL) and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness reduction rates were estimated with linear mixed models. Risk ratios were calculated to evaluate the association between baseline GCIPL and pRNFL thicknesses and the risk of subsequent cognitive and motor worsening, using clinically meaningful cutoffs.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>GCIPL thickness in the parafoveal region (1‐ to 3‐mm ring) presented the largest reduction rate. The annualized atrophy rate was 0.63μm in iPD patients and 0.23μm in controls (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). iPD patients with lower parafoveal GCIPL and pRNFL thickness at baseline presented an increased risk of cognitive decline at 3 years (relative risk [RR] = 3.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.10–11.1, <i>p</i> = 0.03 and RR = 3.28, 95% CI = 1.03–10.45, <i>p</i> = 0.045, respectively). We did not identify significant associations between retinal thickness and motor deterioration.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results provide evidence of the potential use of optical coherence tomography–measured parafoveal GCIPL thickness to monitor neurodegeneration and to predict the risk of cognitive worsening over time in iPD. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<p>The central complex plays a key role in goal directed orientation of insects. Immunocytochemistry shows that the neuropeptide orcokinin is present in the central complex of the desert locust in neurons of all stages of signal processing and likely serves as cotransmitter with GABA and Dip‐allatostatin in certain cell types.

</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The central complex is a group of highly interconnected neuropils in the insect brain. It is involved in the control of spatial orientation, based on external compass cues and various internal needs. The functional and neurochemical organization of the central complex has been studied in detail in the desert locust <i>Schistocerca gregaria</i>. In addition to classical neurotransmitters, immunocytochemistry has provided evidence for a major contribution of neuropeptides to neural signaling within the central complex. To complement these data, we have identified all orcokinin‐immunoreactive neurons in the locust central complex and associated brain areas. About 50 bilateral pairs of neurons innervating all substructures of the central complex exhibit orcokinin immunoreactivity. Among these were about 20 columnar neurons, 33 bilateral pairs of tangential neurons of the central body, and seven pairs of tangential neurons of the protocerebral bridge. In silico transcript analysis suggests the presence of eight different orcokinin‐A type peptides in the desert locust. Double label experiments showed that all orcokinin‐immunostained tangential neurons of the lateral accessory lobe cluster were also immunoreactive for GABA and the GABA‐synthesizing enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase. Two types of tangential neurons of the upper division of the central body were, furthermore, also labeled with an antiserum against Dip‐allatostatin I. No colocalization was found with serotonin immunostaining. The data provide additional insights into the neurochemical organization of the locust central complex and suggest that orcokinin‐peptides of the orcokinin‐A gene act as neuroactive substances at all stages of signal processing in this brain area.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The neural retina is organized along central‐peripheral, dorsal‐ventral, and laminar planes. Cellular density and distributions vary along the central‐peripheral and dorsal‐ventral axis in species including primates, mice, fish, and birds. Differential distribution of cell types within the retina is associated with sensitivity to different types of damage that underpin major retinal diseases, including macular degeneration and glaucoma. Normal variation in retinal distribution remains unreported for multiple cell types in widely used research models, including mouse. Here we map the distribution of all known OFF bipolar cell (BC) populations and horizontal cells. We report significant variation in the distribution of OFF BC populations and horizontal cells along the dorsal‐ventral and central‐peripheral axes of the retina. Distribution patterns are much more pronounced for some populations of OFF BC cells than others and may correspond to the cell type's specialized functions.</p>

Background<p>To explore an expression profile in plasma exosomal miRNAs of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (mTLE + HS) patients and investigate the associated clinical significance and putative pathways involved.</p>Methods<p>Plasma exosomal miRNAs were measured in six mTLE + HS patients who were confirmed with pre-surgical stereo-electroencephalography and six without hippocampal sclerosis (mTLE−HS) using Illumina HiSeq 2500. Then six dysregulated miRNAs were chosen for validation in an independent sample of 18 mTLE + HS patients and 18 mTLE−HS controls using RT-qPCR. Receiver operating characteristic curve was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic value of miRNAs in HS. Bioinformatic analyses were conducted to reveal in which pathways these miRNAs were involved.</p>Results<p>We revealed that a total of 42 exosomal miRNAs were differentially expressed in mTLE + HS. Among them, 25 were increased and 17 decreased. After validation, hsa-miR-129-5p, -214-3p, -219a-5p, and -34c-5p were confirmed as being upregulated, while hsa-miR-421 and -184 were significantly downregulated in mTLE + HS. Moreover, hsa-miR-184 had the best diagnostic value for discriminating mTLE + HS with 88.9% sensitivity and 83.3% specificity. These six miRNAs regulated several genes from neurotrophin-, hippo-, p53-, TGF- beta-, HIF- 1-, mTOR-related pathways.</p>Conclusion<p>Six miRNAs were dysregulated in mTLE + HS patients and targeted several genes. This result might facilitate pathological mechanistic studies of miRNAs in HS and represent potential diagnostic biomarkers. These provided the rationale for further confirmation studies in larger cohorts of prospective patients.</p>

<p>In neuroscience, much attention is paid to intercellular interactions, in particular, to synapses. However, many researchers do not pay due attention to the contribution of intracellular contacts to the work of intercellular interactions. Nevertheless, along with synapses, intracellular contacts also have complex organization and a tremendous number of regulatory elements. Mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum contacts (MERCs) are a specific site of interaction between the two organelles; they provide a basis for a large number of cellular functions, such as calcium homeostasis, lipid metabolism, autophagy, and apoptosis. Despite the presence of these contacts in various parts of neurons and glial cells, it is yet not known whether they fulfill the same functions. There are still many unsolved questions about the work of these intracellular contacts, and one of the most important among them is if MERCs, with their broad implication into synaptic events, can be considered the assistant to neurotransmission?</p>

<p>We report a qualitative study on central nervous system (CNS) damage that demonstrates the ability of X-ray phase contrast tomography (XPCT) to confirm data obtained with standard 2D methodology and permits the description of additional features that are not detected with 2D or other 3D techniques. In contrast to magnetic resonance or computed tomography, XPCT makes possible the high-resolution 3D imaging of soft tissues classically considered “invisible” to X-rays without the use of additional contrast agents, or without the need for intense processing of the tissue required by 2D techniques. Most importantly for studies of CNS diseases, XPCT enables a concomitant multi-scale 3D biomedical imaging of neuronal and vascular networks ranging from cells through to the CNS as a whole. In the last years, we have used XPCT to investigate neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and multiple sclerosis (MS), to shed light on brain damage and extend the observations obtained with standard techniques. Here, we show the cutting-edge ability of XPCT to highlight in 3D, concomitantly, vascular occlusions and damages, close associations between plaques and damaged vessels, as well as dramatic changes induced at neuropathological level by treatment in AD mice. We corroborate data on the well-known blood-brain barrier dysfunction in the animal model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and further show its extent throughout the CNS axis and at the level of the single vessel/capillary.</p>

<p>The extensible neuroimaging archive toolkit (XNAT) is a common platform for storing and distributing neuroimaging data and is used by many key repositories of public neuroimaging data. Some examples include the Neuroimaging Informatics Tools and Resources Clearinghouse (NITRC, https://nitrc.org/), the ConnectomeDB for the Human Connectome Project (https://db.humanconnectome.org/), and XNAT Central (https://central.xnat.org/). We introduce Rxnat (https://github.com/adigherman/Rxnat), an open-source R package designed to interact with any XNAT-based repository. The program has similar capabilities with PyXNAT and XNATpy, which were developed for Python users. Rxnat was developed to address the increased popularity of R among neuroimaging researchers. The Rxnat package can query multiple XNAT repositories and download all or a specific subset of images for further processing. This provides a lingua franca for the large community of R analysts to interface with multiple XNAT-based publicly available neuroimaging repositories. The potential of Rxnat is illustrated using an example of neuroimaging data normalization from two neuroimaging repositories, NITRC and HCP.</p>

<p>Epilepsy is a serious hazard to human health. Minimally invasive surgery is currently an extremely effective treatment to refractory epilepsy. However, it is challenging to localize the lesion for most patients because they are MRI negative. The identification of epileptic foci in local brain region will be helpful to the localization of epileptic foci because we can infer whether there is a lesion from the results of the classification. For the sake of simplicity and the data we collected, only the hippocampus was segmented as a local brain region and classified in this paper. We recruited 59 children with hippocampus epilepsy and 70 age- and sex-matched normal controls, and diffusion kurtosis images (DKI) for all subjects were collected because DKI can understand the pathological changes of local tissues and other regions of epileptic foci at the molecular level. Then, a mask of hippocampus was made to segment the hippocampus of FA, MD, and MK images for all subjects, which are the parameter images of DKI and were used to perform the independent-sample t-test and the classification task. At last, a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on transfer learning technique was developed to extract features of FA, MD, MK, and the fusion of FA and MK, and support vector machine was employed to classify epilepsy and normal control. Finally, the classifier produced 90.8% accuracy for patient vs. normal controls. Experimental results showed that the features extraction based on CNN is very effective, and the high accuracy of classification means that FA and MK are two remarkable features to identify epilepsy, which indicates that DKI images can act as an important biomarker for epilepsy from the point of view of clinical diagnosis.</p>

<p>Objectives: To study whether and to what extent the therapeutic impedance and current change under long-term deep brain stimulation (DBS) with constant stimulation settings, which could inform the role of constant current stimulation.</p><p>Methods: Therapy impedance and current measurements were retrospectively collected from patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) undergoing DBS of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or essential tremor (ET) undergoing ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM). Baseline and follow-up measurements were obtained for intervals of at least 6 months without changes in stimulation settings. The single longest interval of constant stimulation for each electrode was included. Temporal trends in impedance and current were analyzed as absolute and relative differences and as the rate of change.</p><p>Results: Impedance and current data from 79 electrodes (60 in STN, 19 in VIM) in 44 patients (32 with PD, 12 with ET) met inclusion criteria. The duration between baseline and follow-up measurements with constant stimulation settings was 17 months (median, with an interquartile range of 12–26 months) in the mixed group. Therapy impedance decreased by 27 ± 12 Ω/year (mean ± 2 standard errors; p &lt; 0.0001), and therapy current increased at a rate of 0.142 ± 0.063 mA/year (p &lt; 0.0001). Similar results were observed in the STN and VIM subgroups.</p><p>Conclusions: Impedance decreases gradually over time, even when stimulation settings are kept constant. The rate of decrease is smaller than previously reported, suggesting that changes in stimulation settings contribute to impedance drift. Stimulation-independent impedance drift is gradual but relevant to constant-current programming.</p>

<p>Introduction:Typing on a keyboard requires complex collaboration between visuospatial/procedural memory, language, and motor function. The impaired ability to type, independent of motor deficits, apraxia, or aphasia has been coined “dystypia.”</p><p>Case Presentation: A 68-year-old woman with a history of blepharospasm, oromandibular, and segmental dystonia underwent bilateral pallidal deep brain stimulation (DBS) because of a waning response to botulinum toxin therapy. Following DBS, she discovered she no longer “remembered” how to type fluidly and had to “hunt and peck” for letters on the keyboard. This issue persisted at a 2-year follow-up. The patient underwent serial typing tests with the DBS ON vs. OFF. Post-operative lead reconstruction was performed using Lead-DBS. The volume of tissue activation (VTA) modeling was combined with whole-brain tractography.</p><p>Results: Typing improved when the device was switched to the DBS OFF state. Cortical mapping revealed strong modulation of the right angular gyrus, left calcarine fissure, and left cuneus. There was also activation of bilateral supplemental motor areas and superior parietal gyri.</p><p>Discussion: Shared lesion topography analysis of dystypia cases in the literature has suggested the involvement of the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF). The SLF involves the superior parietal lobe, angular gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, and arcuate fasciculus. Our patient’s connectivity pattern suggested SLF involvement. The improvement in OFF state typing and her imaging together suggested that the dystypia in her case was a stimulation-induced side effect.</p><p>Conclusion: Dystypia is a rare side effect of Globus Pallidus Internus (GPi) DBS therapy and may be associated with SLF involvement.</p>

<p>Several studies have implied gender differences in startle reaction to emotional facial expressions. However, few studies have been designed to investigate the difference between responding to emotional female vs. male faces, nor gender differences in responses. The present experiment investigated startle EMG responses to a startle probe while viewing pictures of neutral, happy, angry, fearful, and sad facial expressions presented by female and male models. Participants were divided into female and male groups. Results showed that emotional facial expressions interact with model gender to produce startle potentiation to a probe: greater responses were found while viewing angry expressions by male models, and while viewing happy faces by female models. There were no differences in responses between male and female participants. We argue that these findings underline theimportance of controlling for model gender in research using facial expressions as stimuli.</p>

<p>Whether brain function is altered in patients with dry eye disease (DED) remains unclear. Twenty patients with DED and 23 healthy controls (HCs) were scanned using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) and support vector machine (SVM) were used to analyze the imaging data. Relative to the HCs, the patients with DED showed significantly increased ReHo values in the left inferior occipital gyrus (IOG), left superior temporal gyrus, and right superior medial prefrontal cortex, and significantly decreased ReHo values in the right superior frontal gyrus/middle frontal gyrus and bilateral middle cingulum (MC). SVM results indicated that the combination of ReHo values in the left MC and the left IOG in distinguishing patients with DED from HCs had a sensitivity of 95.00%, a specificity of 91.30%, and an accuracy of 93.02%. The present study found that the patients with DED had abnormal ReHo values in the limbic-cortical circuits. A combination of ReHo values in the left MC and the left IOG could be applied as a potential imaging biomarker to distinguish patients with DED from HCs. The dysfunction of limbic-cortical circuits may play an important role in the pathophysiology of DED.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.569519">Streptococcal Infection as a Major Historical Cause of Stuttering: Data, Mechanisms, and Current Importance</a></h4>

<p>Stuttering is one of the most well-known speech disorders, but the underlying neurological mechanisms are debated. In addition to genetic factors, there are also major non-genetic contributions. It is here proposed that infection with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GAS) was a major underlying cause of stuttering until the mid-1900s when penicillin was introduced in 1943. The main mechanism proposed is an autoimmune reaction from tonsillitis, targeting specific molecules, for example within the basal ganglia. It is here also proposed that GAS infections may have continued to cause stuttering to some extent, to the present date, though more rarely. If so, early diagnosis of such cases would be of importance. Childhood cases with sudden onset of stuttering after throat infection may be particularly important to assess for possible GAS infection. The support for this hypothesis primarily comes from three lines of argument. First, medical record data from the 1930s strongly indicates that there was one type of medical event in particular that preceded the onset of childhood stuttering with unexpected frequency: diseases related to GAS throat infections. In particular, this included tonsillitis and scarlet fever, but also rheumatic fever. Rheumatic fever is a childhood autoimmune sequela of GAS infection, which was a relatively widespread medical problem until the early 1960s. Second, available reports of changes of the childhood prevalence of stuttering indicate striking parallels between stuttering and the incidence of rheumatic fever, with: (1) decline from the early 1900s; (2) marked decline from the introduction of penicillin in the mid 1940s; and (3) reaching a more stable level in the 1960s. The correlations between the data for stuttering and rheumatic fever after the introduction of penicillin are very high, at about 0.95. Third, there are established biological mechanisms linking GAS tonsillitis to immunological effects on the brain. Also, a small number of more recent case reports have provided further support for the hypothesis linking stuttering to GAS infection. Overall, it is proposed that the available data provides strong evidence for the hypothesis that GAS infection was a major cause of stuttering until the mid-1900s, interacting with genetic predisposition.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.564969">Neural Signatures of Handgrip Fatigue in Type 1 Diabetic Men and Women</a></h4>

<p>Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is associated with reduced muscular strength and greater muscle fatigability. Along with changes in muscular mechanisms, T1D is also linked to structural changes in the brain. How the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying muscle fatigue is altered with T1D and sex related differences of these mechanisms are still not well investigated. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of T1D on the neural correlates of handgrip fatigue and examine sex and T1D related differences in neuromuscular performance parameters, neural activation and functional connectivity patterns between the motor regions of the brain. Forty-two adults, balanced by condition (healthy vs T1D) and sex (male vs female), and performed submaximal isometric handgrip contractions until voluntary exhaustion. Initial strength, endurance time, strength loss, force variability, and complexity measures were collected. Additionally, hemodynamic responses from motor-function related cortical regions, using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), were obtained. Overall, females exhibited lower initial strength (p &lt; 0.0001), and greater strength loss (p = 0.023) than males. While initial strength was significantly lower in the T1D group (p = 0.012) compared to the healthy group, endurance times and strength loss were comparable between the two groups. Force complexity, measured as approximate entropy, was found to be lower throughout the experiment for the T1D group (p = 0.0378), indicating lower online motor adaptability. Although, T1D and healthy groups fatigued similarly, only the T1D group exhibited increased neural activation in the left (p = 0.095) and right (p = 0.072) supplementary motor areas (SMA) over time. A sex × condition × fatigue interaction effect (p = 0.044) showed that while increased activation was observed in both T1D females and healthy males from the Early to Middle phase, this was not observed in healthy females or T1D males. These findings demonstrate that T1D adults had lower adaptability to fatigue which they compensated for by increasing neural effort. This study highlights the importance of examining both neural and motor performance signatures when investigating the impact of chronic conditions on neuromuscular fatigue. Additionally, the findings have implications for developing intervention strategies for training, rehabilitation, and ergonomics considerations for individuals with chronic conditions.</p>

<p>The diversity and dense interconnectivity of cells in the nervous system present a huge challenge to understanding how brains work. Recent progress toward such understanding, however, has been fuelled by the development of techniques for selectively monitoring and manipulating the function of distinct cell types—and even individual neurons—in the brains of living animals. These sophisticated techniques are fundamentally genetic and have found their greatest application in genetic model organisms, such as the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Drosophila combines genetic tractability with a compact, but cell-type rich, nervous system and has been the incubator for a variety of methods of neuronal targeting. One such method, called Split Gal4, is playing an increasingly important role in mapping neural circuits in the fly. In conjunction with functional perturbations and behavioral screens, Split Gal4 has been used to characterize circuits governing such activities as grooming, aggression, and mating. It has also been leveraged to comprehensively map and functionally characterize cells composing important brain regions, such as the central complex, lateral horn, and the mushroom body—the latter being the insect seat of learning and memory. With connectomics data emerging for both the larval and adult brains of Drosophila, Split Gal4 is also poised to play an important role in characterizing neurons of interest based on their connectivity. We summarize the history and current state of the Split Gal4 method and indicate promising areas for further development or future application.</p>

<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is behaviorally defined and diagnosed by delayed and/or impeded language, stereotyped repetitive behaviors, and difficulties with social interactions. Additionally, there are disruptions in motor processing, which includes the intent to execute movements, interrupted/inhibited action chain sequences, impaired execution of speech, and repetitive motor behaviors. Cortical loops through basal ganglia (BG) structures are known to play critical roles in the typical functioning of these actions. Specifically, corticostriate projections to the dorsal striatum (caudate and putamen) convey abundant input from motor, cognitive and limbic cortices and subsequently project to other BG structures. Excitatory dopamine (DA) type 1 receptors are predominantly expressed on GABAergic medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the dorsal striatum as part of the “direct pathway” to GPi and SNpr whereas inhibitory DA type 2 receptors are predominantly expressed on MSNs that primarily project to GPe. This study aimed to better understand how this circuitry may be altered in ASD, especially concerning the neurochemical modulation of GABAergic MSNs within the two major BG pathways. We utilized two classical methods to analyze the postmortem BG in ASD in comparison to neurotypical cases: ligand binding autoradiography to quantify densities of GABA-A, GABA-B, 5-HT<sub>2</sub>, and DA type 1 and 2 receptors and in situ hybridization histochemistry (ISHH) to quantify mRNA for D1, D2 receptors and three key GABAergic subunits (α1, β2, and γ2), as well as the GABA synthesizing enzymes (GAD65/67). Results demonstrated significant increases in D2 mRNA within MSNs in both the caudate and putamen, which was further verified by proenkephalin mRNA that is co-expressed with the D2 receptor in the indirect pathway MSNs. In contrast, all other GABAergic, serotonergic and dopaminergic markers in the dorsal striatum had comparable labeling densities. These results indicate alterations in the indirect pathway of the BG, with possible implications for the execution of competing motor programs and E/I imbalance in the direct/indirect motor feedback pathways through thalamic and motor cortical areas. Results also provide insights regarding the efficacy of FDA-approved drugs used to treat individuals with ASD acting on specific DA and 5-HT receptor subtypes.</p>

<p>Golgi-Cox staining has been used extensively in neuroscience. Despite its unique ability to identify neuronal interconnections and neural processes, its lack of consistency and time-consuming nature reduces its appeal to researchers. Here, using a spared nerve injury (SNI) mouse model and control mice, we present a modified Golgi-Cox staining protocol that can stain mouse hippocampal neurons within 8 days. In this improved procedure, the mouse brain was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and then stored in a modified Golgi-Cox solution at 37 ± 2°C. The impregnation period was reduced from 5–14 days to 36–48 h. Brain slices prepared in this way could be preserved long-term at –80°C for up to 8 weeks. In addition to minimizing frequently encountered problems and reducing the time required to conduct the method, our modified protocol maintained, and even improved, the quality of traditional Golgi-Cox staining as applied to hippocampal neuronal morphology in SNI mice.</p>

<p>Immunofluorescence staining is the most frequently applied technique to detect and visualize various molecules in biological samples. Many protocols can be found in the literature and the websites of commercial antibody producers. This can result in a time-consuming and costly methodical work to establish “simple” antibody staining. We here summarize in a stepwise manner an easy-to-follow immunofluorescence staining protocol with an improved specific fluorescent signal and a reduced background and non-specific binding signal. This will help scientists to save time, effort, and antibody costs during the application of such a valuable technique.</p>

<p>In the absence of an effective treatment to alter the progressive course of cognitive decline and dementia, identification of modifiable risk factors that could promote healthy cognitive aging has become a public health research priority. This study seeks to comprehensively determine the contemporaneous associations of a broad spectrum of time-varying modifiable lifestyle factors with age-related cognitive decline in a large population-based cohort of older adults. A total of 5,711 subjects aged 50 and older from the WHO Study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE) in Shanghai were studied. Repeated measures of lifestyle factors and cognitive performance were conducted in 2009–2010 and 2014–2015. Linear random slope models were used to evaluate the contemporaneous associations between time-varying lifestyle factors and cognitive performance. Person-mean centering method was used to disaggregate the between- and within-person effects in the time-varying lifestyle factors in the random slope models. We found that higher vegetable and fruit consumption, as well as higher level of physical activity were positively associated with all cognitive domains. Body mass index (BMI) was negatively associated with all cognitive domains, whereas waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) was negatively associated with verbal fluency score only. Sedentary time was negatively associated with digit span score but positively associated with verbal fluency score. The between-person effects seem to be more dominant than within-person effects. Overall, our findings suggest better management of multiple lifestyle factors may protect against cognitive decline in later life. Higher vegetable and fruit consumption and physical activity are protective, whereas obesity is detrimental to cognitive decline in older adults. This study underpins the development of multi-domain lifestyle recommendations to promote healthy cognitive aging.</p>

<p>Introduction: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) might not only be circumscribed to the motor system but also involves other neuronal systems including sensory abnormalities. In line with this notion, we aimed to assess the pathophysiology of sensory disturbances in the SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mouse model of ALS, focusing on the satellite glial cells (SGCs) at the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) as a new potential target of the disease.</p><p>Material and Methods: The presence of sensory disturbances was evaluated using von Frey, hot plate, and hot water tail immersion tests at 75 days old, which represented the motor-pre-symptomatic stage. Cell biology analysis was performed at 75 and 95 days old and included conventional histology, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy of sensory neuron-SGC unit dissociates as a well as western blotting from DRG lysates.</p><p>Results: At 75 days old, von Frey and hot plate tests demonstrated clear thermoalgesic disturbances in ALS transgenic mice. Histological studies of the SN-SGC units revealed abnormal SOD1 accumulation, which was associated with nitro-oxidative stress and biogenesis of lipid droplets in SGCs. Interestingly, these alterations led to a progressive lysosomal storage disorder and occasionally vacuolar degeneration in SGCs.</p><p>Conclusions: SGCs emerge as a primary pathophysiological target in the SOD1 transgenic murine model of ALS, clearly reinforcing the pathogenic role of glial cells in motor neuron disease. Presymptomatic alterations of SGCs, might not only be responsible of sensory disturbances in ALS, but due to spinal cord sensory-motor circuits could also contribute to anterior horn motor disturbances.</p>

Background<p>Sensory peripheral neuropathy (PN) is associated with gait, balance problems and high fall risk. The walk2Wellness trial investigates effects of long-term, home-based daily use of a wearable sensory prosthesis on gait function, balance, quality of life and fall rates in PN patients. The device (Walkasins<sup>®</sup>, RxFunction Inc., MN, United States) partially substitutes lost nerve function related to plantar sensation providing directional tactile cues reflecting plantar pressure measurements during standing and walking. We tested the null hypothesis that the Functional Gait Assessment (FGA) score would remain unchanged after 10 weeks of use.</p>Methods<p>Participants had PN with lost plantar sensation, gait and balance problems, an FGA score &lt; 23 (high fall risk), and ability to sense tactile stimuli above the ankle. Clinical outcomes included FGA, Gait Speed, Timed Up&amp;Go (TUG) and 4-Stage Balance Test. Patient-reported outcomes included Activities-Specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale, Vestibular Disorders Activities of Daily Living Scale, PROMIS participation and satisfaction scores, pain rating, and falls. Evaluations were performed at baseline and after 2, 6, and 10 weeks. Subjects were not made aware of changes in outcomes. No additional balance interventions were allowed.</p>Results<p>Forty-five participants of 52 enrolled across four sites completed in-clinic assessments. FGA scores improved from 15.0 to 19.1 (p &lt; 0.0001), normal and fast gait speed from 0.86 m/s to 0.95 m/s (p &lt; 0.0001) and 1.24 m/s to 1.33 m/s (p = 0.002), respectively, and TUG from 13.8 s to 12.5 s (p = 0.012). Four-Stage Balance Test did not improve. Several patient-reported outcomes were normal at baseline and remained largely unchanged. Interestingly, subjects with baseline ABC scores lower than 67% (high fall risk cut-off) increased their ABC scores (49.9% to 59.3%, p = 0.01), whereas subjects with ABC scores above 67% showed a decrease (76.6% to 71.8%, p = 0.019). Subjects who reported falls in the prior 6 months (n = 25) showed a decrease in the number of fall-risk factors (5.1 to 4.3, p = 0.023) and a decrease in fall rate (13.8 to 7.4 falls/1000 days, p = 0.014). Four pre-study non-fallers (n = 20) fell during the 10 weeks.</p>Conclusion<p>A wearable sensory prosthesis presents a new way to treat gait and balance problems and manage falls in high fall-risk patients with PN.</p>Trial registration<p>ClinicalTrials.gov (#NCT03538756).</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>With global increases in the aging population, the number of patients with dementia is greatly increasing, which has become a big social problem. Many studies have shown strong associations between oral disorders and systemic disorders, such as diabetes, arthritis, sepsis, aspiration pneumonia, arteriosclerosis, bacterial endocarditis, and other cardiovascular diseases. Similarly, numerous cross‐sectional studies showed that patients with dementia usually have poor oral conditions and tooth loss. These have long been considered as a result of difficulty with oral care due to impaired cognitive function, memory, and physical ability in patients with dementia. Indeed, even in patients with mild cognitive impairment, oral care becomes insufficient owing to decreases in spontaneity of grooming and finger dexterity. However, recent studies have shown that tooth loss and occlusal dysfunction may affect brain function and trigger the onset of dementia found in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease. In this review, we highlight the relationships among aging, oral dysfunction, and the development of dementia. Increasing evidence suggests that oral dysfunction is not only a result of dementia in the elderly people, but could also be a causative factor for the onset of dementia.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25948?af=R">Socioeconomic Status Mediates Racial Differences Seen Using the AT(N) Framework</a></h4>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>African Americans are at greater risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia than non‐Hispanic whites. In addition to biological considerations (eg, genetic influences and comorbid disorders), social and environmental factors may increase the risk of AD dementia. This paper (1) assesses neuroimaging biomarkers of amyloid (A), tau (T), and neurodegeneration (N) for potential racial differences and (2) considers mediating effects of socioeconomic status (SES) and measures of small vessel and cardiovascular disease on observed race differences.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Imaging measures of AT(N) (amyloid and tau positron emission tomography [PET]) structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and resting state functional connectivity (rs‐fc) were collected from African American (n = 131) and white (n = 685) cognitively normal participants age 45 years and older. Measures of small vessel and cardiovascular disease (white matter hyperintensities [WMHs] on MRI, blood pressure, and body mass index [BMI]) and area‐based SES were included in mediation analyses.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared to white participants, African American participants had greater neurodegeneration, as measured by decreased cortical volumes (Cohen's <i>f</i>
<sup>
   <i>2</i>
</sup> = 0.05, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). SES mediated the relationship between race and cortical volumes. There were no significant race effects for amyloid, tau, or rs‐fc signature.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Modifiable factors, such as differences in social contexts and resources, particularly area‐level SES, may contribute to observed racial differences in AD. Future studies should emphasize collection of relevant psychosocial factors in addition to the development of intentional diversity and inclusion efforts to improve the racial/ethnic and socioeconomic representativeness of AD studies.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine whether a low residual quantity of dystrophin protein is associated with delayed clinical milestones in patients with <i>DMD</i> mutations.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a retrospective multicentric cohort study by using molecular and clinical data from patients with <i>DMD</i> mutations registered in the UMD‐DMD‐France database. Patients with intronic, splice site, or nonsense <i>DMD</i> mutations, with available muscle biopsy western blot data, were included irrespective of whether they presented with severe Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) or milder Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD). Patients were separated into three groups based on dystrophin protein levels. Clinical outcomes were ages at appearance of first symptoms; loss of ambulation; fall in vital capacity and left ventricular ejection fraction; interventions such as spinal fusion, tracheostomy, and noninvasive ventilation; and death.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 3880 patients with <i>DMD</i> mutations, 90 with mutations of interest were included. 42 patients expressed no dystrophin (group A), and 31/42 (74%) developed DMD. 34 patients had dystrophin quantities &lt;5<i>%</i> (group B), and 21/34 (61%) developed BMD. 14 patients had dystrophin quantities ≥5% (group C), and all but 4 who lost ambulation beyond 24 years of age were ambulant. Dystrophin quantities &lt;5%, as low as &lt;0.5%, were associated with milder phenotype for most of the evaluated clinical outcomes, including age at loss of ambulation (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Very low residual dystrophin protein quantity can cause a shift in disease phenotype from DMD towards BMD.</p>

<p>Advances in genetic discoveries have created substantial opportunities for precision medicine in neurodevelopmental disorders. Many of the genes implicated in these diseases encode proteins that regulate gene expression, such as chromatin associated proteins, transcription factors, and RNA‐binding proteins. The identification of targeted therapeutics for individuals carrying mutations in these genes remains a challenge, as the encoded proteins can theoretically regulate thousands of downstream targets in a considerable number of cell types. Here, we propose the application of a drug discovery approach originally developed for cancer called “transcriptome reversal” for these neurodevelopmental disorders. This approach attempts to identify compounds that reverse gene‐expression signatures associated with disease states.</p>

<p>by Toshiyuki Ishii, Toshihiko Hosoya</p>

Neurons in various regions of the brain generate spike bursts. While the number of spikes within a burst has been shown to carry information, information coding by interspike intervals (ISIs) is less well understood. In particular, a burst with <i>k</i> spikes has <i>k−</i>1 intraburst ISIs, and these <i>k−</i>1 ISIs could theoretically encode <i>k−</i>1 independent values. In this study, we demonstrate that such combinatorial coding occurs for retinal bursts. By recording ganglion cell spikes from isolated salamander retinae, we found that intraburst ISIs encode oscillatory light sequences that are much faster than the light intensity modulation encoded by the number of spikes. When a burst has three spikes, the two intraburst ISIs combinatorially encode the amplitude and phase of the oscillatory sequence. Analysis of trial-to-trial variability suggested that intraburst ISIs are regulated by two independent mechanisms responding to orthogonal oscillatory components, one of which is common to bursts with a different number of spikes. Therefore, the retina encodes multiple stimulus features by exploiting all degrees of freedom of burst spike patterns, i.e., the spike number and multiple intraburst ISIs.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/w8_kA1Ixbko" width="1" />

<p>by Pei-Yau Lung, Dongrui Zhong, Xiaodong Pang, Yan Li, Jinfeng Zhang</p>

Reusability is part of the FAIR data principle, which aims to make data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. One of the current efforts to increase the reusability of public genomics data has been to focus on the inclusion of quality metadata associated with the data. When necessary metadata are missing, most researchers will consider the data useless. In this study, we developed a framework to predict the missing metadata of gene expression datasets to maximize their reusability. We found that when using predicted data to conduct other analyses, it is not optimal to use all the predicted data. Instead, one should only use the subset of data, which can be predicted accurately. We proposed a new metric called Proportion of Cases Accurately Predicted (PCAP), which is optimized in our specifically-designed machine learning pipeline. The new approach performed better than pipelines using commonly used metrics such as F1-score in terms of maximizing the reusability of data with missing values. We also found that different variables might need to be predicted using different machine learning methods and/or different data processing protocols. Using differential gene expression analysis as an example, we showed that when missing variables are accurately predicted, the corresponding gene expression data can be reliably used in downstream analyses.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/F6Pjad6S8o0" width="1" />

The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to unprecedented social and economic consequences. The risk of morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19 increases dramatically in the presence of coexisting medical conditions, while the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Furthermore, there are no approved therapies for COVID-19. This study aims to identify SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, disease manifestations, and COVID-19 therapies using network medicine methodologies along with clinical and multi-omics observations. We incorporate SARS-CoV-2 virus–host protein–protein interactions, transcriptomics, and proteomics into the human interactome. Network proximity measurement revealed underlying pathogenesis for broad COVID-19-associated disease manifestations. Analyses of single-cell RNA sequencing data show that co-expression of <i>ACE2</i> and <i>TMPRSS2</i> is elevated in absorptive enterocytes from the inflamed ileal tissues of Crohn disease patients compared to uninflamed tissues, revealing shared pathobiology between COVID-19 and inflammatory bowel disease. Integrative analyses of metabolomics and transcriptomics (bulk and single-cell) data from asthma patients indicate that COVID-19 shares an intermediate inflammatory molecular profile with asthma (including <i>IRAK3</i> and <i>ADRB2</i>). To prioritize potential treatments, we combined network-based prediction and a propensity score (PS) matching observational study of 26,779 individuals from a COVID-19 registry. We identified that melatonin usage (odds ratio [OR] = 0.72, 95% CI 0.56–0.91) is significantly associated with a 28% reduced likelihood of a positive laboratory test result for SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction assay. Using a PS matching user active comparator design, we determined that melatonin usage was associated with a reduced likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 positive test result compared to use of angiotensin II receptor blockers (OR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.54–0.92) or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (OR = 0.69, 95% CI 0.52–0.90). Importantly, melatonin usage (OR = 0.48, 95% CI 0.31–0.75) is associated with a 52% reduced likelihood of a positive laboratory test result for SARS-CoV-2 in African Americans after adjusting for age, sex, race, smoking history, and various disease comorbidities using PS matching. In summary, this study presents an integrative network medicine platform for predicting disease manifestations associated with COVID-19 and identifying melatonin for potential prevention and treatment of COVID-19.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/uvpeSBS7OcA" width="1" />

Cues of maternal and paternal origins interact to control seed development, and the underlying molecular mechanisms are still far from clear. Here, we show that <i>TOPOISOMERASE Iα</i> (<i>TOP1α</i>), <i>UP-FRAMESHIFT SUPPRESSOR 1</i> (<i>UPF1</i>), and <i>TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA2</i> (<i>TTG2</i>) gametophytically, biparentally regulate seed size in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. <i>TOP1α</i> and <i>UPF1</i> are mainly expressed in antipodal cells, and loss of their function leads to ectopic <i>TTG2</i> expression in these female gametophytic cells. We further demonstrate that TOP1α and UPF1 directly repress <i>TTG2</i> expression through affecting its chromatin status and determine its relative expression in antipodal cells versus sperm cells, which controls seed size in a dosage-dependent and parent-of-origin-dependent manner. The molecular interplay among these three genes explains their biparental gametophytic effect during diploidy and interploidy reciprocal crosses. Taken together, our findings reveal a molecular framework of parental interaction for seed size control.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/c7D7CMFvyYo" width="1" />

<p>by Zvi N. Roth, Minyoung Ryoo, Elisha P. Merriam</p>

The brain exhibits widespread endogenous responses in the absence of visual stimuli, even at the earliest stages of visual cortical processing. Such responses have been studied in monkeys using optical imaging with a limited field of view over visual cortex. Here, we used functional MRI (fMRI) in human participants to study the link between arousal and endogenous responses in visual cortex. The response that we observed was tightly entrained to task timing, was spatially extensive, and was independent of visual stimulation. We found that this response follows dynamics similar to that of pupil size and heart rate, suggesting that task-related activity is related to arousal. Finally, we found that higher reward increased response amplitude while decreasing its trial-to-trial variability (i.e., the noise). Computational simulations suggest that increased temporal precision underlies both of these observations. Our findings are consistent with optical imaging studies in monkeys and support the notion that arousal increases precision of neural activity.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/v9y0OkBopAc" width="1" />

There is a great need for antiviral drugs to treat enterovirus (EV) and rhinovirus (RV) infections, which can be severe and occasionally life-threatening. The conserved nonstructural protein 2C, which is an AAA+ ATPase, is a promising target for drug development. Here, we present a structure-activity relationship study of a previously identified compound that targets the 2C protein of EV-A71 and several EV-B species members, but not poliovirus (PV) (EV-C species). This compound is structurally related to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug fluoxetine—which also targets 2C—but has favorable chemical properties. We identified several compounds with increased antiviral potency and broadened activity. Four compounds showed broad-spectrum EV and RV activity and inhibited contemporary strains of emerging EVs of public health concern, including EV-A71, coxsackievirus (CV)-A24v, and EV-D68. Importantly, unlike (<i>S</i>)-fluoxetine, these compounds are no longer neuroactive. By raising resistant EV-A71, CV-B3, and EV-D68 variants against one of these inhibitors, we identified novel 2C resistance mutations. Reverse engineering of these mutations revealed a conserved mechanism of resistance development. Resistant viruses first acquired a mutation in, or adjacent to, the α2 helix of 2C. This mutation disrupted compound binding and provided drug resistance, but this was at the cost of viral fitness. Additional mutations at distantly localized 2C residues were then acquired to increase resistance and/or to compensate for the loss of fitness. Using computational methods to identify solvent accessible tunnels near the α2 helix in the EV-A71 and PV 2C crystal structures, a conserved binding pocket of the inhibitors is proposed.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/GgWFfF1rxno" width="1" />

<p>by Benjamin D. Knapp, Lillian Zhu, Kerwyn Casey Huang</p>

Single-cell imaging, combined with recent advances in image analysis and microfluidic technologies, have enabled fundamental discoveries of cellular responses to chemical perturbations that are often obscured by traditional liquid-culture experiments. Temperature is an environmental variable well known to impact growth and to elicit specific stress responses at extreme values; it is often used as a genetic tool to interrogate essential genes. However, the dynamic effects of temperature shifts have remained mostly unstudied at the single-cell level, due largely to engineering challenges related to sample stability, heatsink considerations, and temperature measurement and feedback. Additionally, the few commercially available temperature-control platforms are costly. Here, we report an inexpensive (&lt;$110) and modular Single-Cell Temperature Controller (SiCTeC) device for microbial imaging—based on straightforward modifications of the typical slide-sample-coverslip approach to microbial imaging—that controls temperature using a ring-shaped Peltier module and microcontroller feedback. Through stable and precise (±0.15°C) temperature control, SiCTeC achieves reproducible and fast (1–2 min) temperature transitions with programmable waveforms between room temperature and 45°C with an air objective. At the device’s maximum temperature of 89°C, SiCTeC revealed that <i>Escherichia coli</i> cells progressively shrink and lose cellular contents. During oscillations between 30°C and 37°C, cells rapidly adapted their response to temperature upshifts. Furthermore, SiCTeC enabled the discovery of rapid morphological changes and enhanced sensitivity to substrate stiffness during upshifts to nonpermissive temperatures in temperature-sensitive mutants of cell-wall synthesis enzymes. Overall, the simplicity and affordability of SiCTeC empowers future studies of the temperature dependence of single-cell physiology.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/HHvrzfx-gmo" width="1" />

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Metals have been suggested as a risk factor for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but only retrospective studies are available to date. We compared metal levels in prospectively collected blood samples from ALS patients and controls, to explore whether metals are associated with ALS mortality.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A nested ALS case–control study was conducted within the prospective EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition) cohort. Cases were identified through death certificates. We analyzed metal levels in erythrocyte samples obtained at recruitment, as a biomarker for metal exposure from any source. Arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead, manganese, mercury, selenium, and zinc concentrations were measured by inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry. To estimate ALS risk, we applied conditional logistic regression models.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The study population comprised 107 cases (65% female) and 319 controls matched for age, sex, and study center. Median time between blood collection and ALS death was 8 years (range = 1–15). Comparing the highest with the lowest tertile, cadmium (odds ratio [OR] = 2.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.08–3.87) and lead (OR = 1.89, 95% CI = 0.97–3.67) concentrations suggest associations with increased ALS risk. Zinc was associated with a decreased risk (OR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.27–0.94). Associations for cadmium and lead remained when limiting analyses to noncurrent smokers.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This is the first study to compare metal levels before disease onset, minimizing reverse causation. The observed associations suggest that cadmium, lead, and zinc may play a role in ALS etiology. Cadmium and lead possibly act as intermediates on the pathway from smoking to ALS. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25952?af=R">Timeline of REM Sleep Behavior Disorder in Overt Alpha‐Synucleinopathies</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To analyze the timeline, prevalence, and survival of REM sleep‐behavior disorder in patients who developed alpha‐synucleinopathies: Parkinson disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and Parkinson disease dementia compared to age‐ and sex‐matched controls in a population‐based incident‐cohort study.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used a population‐based, 1991‐2010 incident‐cohort study of alpha‐synucleinopathies. A movement‐disorder specialist reviewed medical records to confirm diagnoses. REM sleep‐behavior disorder was diagnosed by reported dream‐enactment symptoms or polysomnography. Probable RBD and polysomnography‐ confirmed RBD were analyzed singularly and combined.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among the 444 incident cases of alpha‐synucleinopathy, 86 were clinically diagnosed with REM sleep‐behavior disorder (19.8%) including 30 (35%) by polysomnography and 56(65%) as probable. Idiopathic REM sleep‐behavior‐disorder prevalence at alpha‐synucleinopathy diagnosis was 3.4%, increasing to 23.8% after 15 years. Cumulative lifetime incidence was 53 times greater in alpha‐synucleinopathies patients than controls (OR=53.1, 95% CI: 13.0‐ 217.2, p&lt;.0001), higher in dementia with Lewy bodies than Parkinson's disease, (OR=2.57, 95% CI: 1.50–4.40, p=.0004), and men than women with PD/DLB/PDD (OR = 3.70, 95% CI: 2.07–6.62, p&lt;.0001) but did not increase mortality risk .</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our cohort had REM sleep‐behavior disorder incidence of 3.4%. Overall REM sleep‐behavior disorder increased to 23.8% after 15 years, with overall incidence of 2.5 cases/100 person years. With 53 times greater lifetime incidence in alpha‐synucleinopathies patients than controls, REM sleep‐behavior disorder was more likely to develop in dementia with Lewy bodies than Parkinson's disease or Parkinson's disease dementia, and in men than women but did not increase mortality risk within our cohort.</p>

Background<p>Investigations into the benefits of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) through pre-clinical and clinical research have led to promising findings for treating several disorders. Despite proven effectiveness of VNS on conditions such as epilepsy and depression, understanding of off-target effects and contributing factors such as sex differences can be beneficial to optimize therapy design.</p>New Methods<p>In this article, we assessed longitudinal effects of VNS on cardiovascular and immune systems, and studied potential sex differences using a rat model of long-term VNS. Rats were implanted with cuff electrodes around the left cervical vagus nerve for VNS, and wireless physiological monitoring devices for continuous monitoring of cardiovascular system using electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. ECG morphology and heart rate variability (HRV) features were extracted to assess cardiovascular changes resulting from VNS in short-term and long-term timescales. We also assessed VNS effects on expression of inflammatory cytokines in blood during the course of the experiment. Statistical analysis was performed to compare results between Treatment and Sham groups, and between male and female animals from Treatment and Sham groups.</p>Results<p>Considerable differences between male and female rats in cardiovascular effects of VNS were observed in multiple cardiovascular features. However, the effects seemed to be transient with approximately 1-h recovery after VNS. While short-term cardiovascular effects were mainly observed in male rats, females in general showed more significant long-term effects even after VNS stopped. We did not observe notable changes or sex differences in systemic cytokine levels resulting from VNS.</p>Comparison With Existing Methods<p>Compared to existing methods, our study design incorporated wireless physiological monitoring and systemic blood cytokine level analysis, along with long-term VNS experiments in unanesthetized rats to study sex differences.</p>Conclusion<p>The contribution of sex differences for long-term VNS off-target effects on cardiovascular and immune systems was assessed using awake behaving rats. Although VNS did not change the concentration of inflammatory biomarkers in systemic circulation for male and female rats, we observed significant differences in cardiovascular effects of VNS characterized using ECG morphology and HRV analyses.</p>

<p>To improve the spatial resolution of imaging and get more effective brain function information, a multi-distance probe configuration with three distances (28.2, 40, and 44.7 mm) and 52 channels is designed. At the same time, a data conversion method of modified Beer–Lambert law (MBLL) with partial pathlength (PPL) is proposed. In the experiment, three kinds of tasks, grip of left hand, grip of right hand, and rest, are performed with eight healthy subjects. First, with a typical single-distance probe configuration (30 mm, 24 channels), the feasibility of the proposed MBLL with PPL is preliminarily validated. Further, the characteristic of the proposed method is evaluated with the multi-distance probe configuration. Compared with MBLL with differential pathlength factor (DPF), the proposed MBLL with PPL is able to acquire more obvious concentration change and can achieve higher classification accuracy of the three tasks. Then, with the proposed method, the performance of the multi-distance probe configuration is discussed. Results show that, compared with a single distance, the combination of the three distances has better spatial resolution and could explore more accurate brain activation information. Besides, the classification accuracy of the three tasks obtained with the combination of three distances is higher than that of any combination of two distances. Also, with the combination of the three distances, the two-class classification between different tasks is carried out. Both theory and experimental results demonstrate that, using multi-distance probe configuration and the MBLL with PPL method, the performance of brain function detected by NIRS can be improved.</p>

<p>The genes involved in the metabolic pathways of amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau proteins significantly influence the etiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Various studies have explored the associations between some of these genes and AD in the Caucasian population; however, researches regarding these associations remain limited in the Chinese population. To systematically evaluate the associations of these genes with AD, we investigated 19 genes involved in the metabolism of Aβ and tau based on previous studies selected using the PubMed database. This study included 372 patients with sporadic late-onset AD (sLOAD) and 345 cognitively healthy individuals from southern China. The results were replicated in the International Genomics of Alzheimer’s Project (IGAP). Protein–protein interactions were determined using the STRING v11 database. We found that a single-nucleotide polymorphism, rs11682128, of BIN1 conferred susceptibility to sLOAD after adjusting for age, sex, and APOE ε4 status and performing the Bonferroni correction {corrected P = 0.000153, odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] = 1.403 (1.079–1.824)}, which was replicated in the IGAP. Protein–protein interactions indicated that BIN1 was correlated with MAPT. Moreover, rare variants of NEP and FERMT2 (0.0026 &lt; corrected P &lt; 0.05), and the Aβ degradation, tau pathology, and tau phosphatase pathways (0.01 &lt; corrected P &lt; 0.05), were nominally significantly associated with sLOAD. This study suggested that the genes involved in the metabolic pathways of Aβ and tau contributed to the etiology of sLOAD in the southern Han Chinese population.</p>

<p>by Carolin Zitzmann, Lars Kaderali, Alan S. Perelson</p>

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes acute hepatitis C and can lead to life-threating complications if it becomes chronic. The HCV genome is a single plus strand of RNA. Its intracellular replication is a spatiotemporally coordinated process of RNA translation upon cell infection, RNA synthesis within a replication compartment, and virus particle production. While HCV is mainly transmitted via mature infectious virus particles, it has also been suggested that HCV-infected cells can secrete HCV RNA carrying exosomes that can infect cells in a receptor independent manner. In order to gain insight into these two routes of transmission, we developed a series of intracellular HCV replication models that include HCV RNA secretion and/or virus assembly and release. Fitting our models to <i>in vitro</i> data, in which cells were infected with HCV, suggests that initially most secreted HCV RNA derives from intracellular cytosolic plus-strand RNA, but subsequently secreted HCV RNA derives equally from the cytoplasm and the replication compartments. Furthermore, our model fits to the data suggest that the rate of virus assembly and release is limited by host cell resources. Including the effects of direct acting antivirals in our models, we found that in spite of decreasing intracellular HCV RNA and extracellular virus concentration, low level HCV RNA secretion may continue as long as intracellular RNA is available. This may possibly explain the presence of detectable levels of plasma HCV RNA at the end of treatment even in patients that ultimately attain a sustained virologic response.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rQYSbDpFc8I" width="1" />

Resources are rarely distributed uniformly within a population. Heterogeneity in the concentration of a drug, the quality of breeding sites, or wealth can all affect evolutionary dynamics. In this study, we represent a collection of properties affecting the fitness at a given location using a color. A green node is rich in resources while a red node is poorer. More colors can represent a broader spectrum of resource qualities. For a population evolving according to the birth-death Moran model, the first question we address is which structures, identified by graph connectivity and graph coloring, are evolutionarily equivalent. We prove that all properly two-colored, undirected, regular graphs are evolutionarily equivalent (where “properly colored” means that no two neighbors have the same color). We then compare the effects of background heterogeneity on properly two-colored graphs to those with alternative schemes in which the colors are permuted. Finally, we discuss dynamic coloring as a model for spatiotemporal resource fluctuations, and we illustrate that random dynamic colorings often diminish the effects of background heterogeneity relative to a proper two-coloring.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3hN2z9vY2h4" width="1" />

Interactive digital notebooks provide an opportunity for researchers and educators to carry out data analysis and report the results in a single digital format. Further to just being digital, the format allows for rich content to be created in order to interact with the code and data contained in such a notebook to form an educational narrative. This primer introduces some of the fundamental aspects involved in using Jupyter notebooks in an educational setting for teaching in the bio/health informatics disciplines. We also provide 2 case studies that detail how we used Jupyter notebooks to teach non-coders programming skills on a blended Master’s degree module for a Health Informatics programme and a fully online distance learning unit on Programming for a postgraduate certificate (PG Cert) in Clinical Bioinformatics with a more technical audience.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kU7-jU-ioWY" width="1" />

In eukaryotes, polyadenylation (poly(A)) is an essential process during mRNA maturation. Identifying the <i>cis</i>-determinants of poly(A) signal (PAS) on the DNA sequence is the key to understand the mechanism of translation regulation and mRNA metabolism. Although machine learning methods were widely used in computationally identifying PAS, the need for tremendous amounts of annotation data hinder applications of existing methods in species without experimental data on PAS. Therefore, cross-species PAS identification, which enables the possibility to predict PAS from untrained species, naturally becomes a promising direction. In our works, we propose a novel deep learning method named Poly(A)-DG for cross-species PAS identification. Poly(A)-DG consists of a Convolution Neural Network-Multilayer Perceptron (CNN-MLP) network and a domain generalization technique. It learns PAS patterns from the training species and identifies PAS in target species without re-training. To test our method, we use three species and build cross-species training sets with two of them and evaluate the performance of the remaining one. Moreover, we test our method against insufficient data and imbalanced data issues and demonstrate that Poly(A)-DG not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods but also maintains relatively high accuracy when it comes to a smaller or imbalanced training set.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XwVqYO6XZ-M" width="1" />

Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations seek to provide atomic-level insights into conformationally dynamic biological systems at experimentally relevant time resolutions, such as those afforded by single-molecule fluorescence measurements. However, limitations in the time scales of MD simulations and the time resolution of single-molecule measurements have challenged efforts to obtain overlapping temporal regimes required for close quantitative comparisons. Achieving such overlap has the potential to provide novel theories, hypotheses, and interpretations that can inform idealized experimental designs that maximize the detection of the desired reaction coordinate. Here, we report MD simulations at time scales overlapping with <i>in vitro</i> single-molecule Förster (fluorescence) resonance energy transfer (smFRET) measurements of the amino acid binding protein LIV-BP<sup>SS</sup> at sub-millisecond resolution. Computationally efficient all-atom structure-based simulations, calibrated against explicit solvent simulations, were employed for sampling multiple cycles of LIV-BP<sup>SS</sup> clamshell-like conformational changes on the time scale of seconds, examining the relationship between these events and those observed by smFRET. The MD simulations agree with the smFRET measurements and provide valuable information on local dynamics of fluorophores at their sites of attachment on LIV-BP<sup>SS</sup> and the correlations between fluorophore motions and large-scale conformational changes between LIV-BP<sup>SS</sup> domains. We further utilize the MD simulations to inform the interpretation of smFRET data, including Förster radius (R<sub>0</sub>) and fluorophore orientation factor (κ<sup>2</sup>) determinations. The approach we describe can be readily extended to distinct biochemical systems, allowing for the interpretation of any FRET system conjugated to protein or ribonucleoprotein complexes, including those with more conformational processes, as well as those implementing multi-color smFRET.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NTOMs9cRepw" width="1" />

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Friedreich ataxia (FA) is a progressive genetic neurodegenerative disorder with no approved treatment. Omaveloxolone, an Nrf2 activator, improves mitochondrial function, restores redox balance, and reduces inflammation in models of FA. We investigated the safety and efficacy of omaveloxolone in patients with FA.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted an international, double‐blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled, parallel‐group, registrational phase 2 trial at 11 institutions in the United States, Europe, and Australia (NCT02255435, EudraCT2015‐002762‐23). Eligible patients, 16 to 40 years of age with genetically confirmed FA and baseline modified Friedreich's Ataxia Rating Scale (mFARS) scores between 20 and 80, were randomized 1:1 to placebo or 150mg per day of omaveloxolone. The primary outcome was change from baseline in the mFARS score in those treated with omaveloxolone compared with those on placebo at 48 weeks.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>One hundred fifty‐five patients were screened, and 103 were randomly assigned to receive omaveloxolone (n = 51) or placebo (n = 52), with 40 omaveloxolone patients and 42 placebo patients analyzed in the full analysis set. Changes from baseline in mFARS scores in omaveloxolone (−1.55 ± 0.69) and placebo (0.85 ± 0.64) patients showed a difference between treatment groups of –2.40 ± 0.96 (<i>p</i> = 0.014). Transient reversible increases in aminotransferase levels were observed with omaveloxolone without increases in total bilirubin or other signs of liver injury. Headache, nausea, and fatigue were also more common among patients receiving omaveloxolone.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In the MOXIe trial, omaveloxolone significantly improved neurological function compared to placebo and was generally safe and well tolerated. It represents a potential therapeutic agent in FA. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<p>Exome sequencing was performed in 2 unrelated families with progressive myoclonus epilepsy. Affected individuals from both families shared a rare, homozygous c.191A &gt; G variant affecting a splice site in <i>SLC7A6OS</i>. Analysis of cDNA from lymphoblastoid cells demonstrated partial splice site abolition and the creation of an abnormal isoform. Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blot showed a marked reduction of protein expression. Haplotype analysis identified a ~0.85cM shared genomic region on chromosome 16q encompassing the c.191A &gt; G variant, consistent with a distant ancestor common to both families. Our results suggest that biallelic loss‐of‐function variants in <i>SLC7A6OS</i> are a novel genetic cause of progressive myoclonus epilepsy. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<p>In the present study, we physiologically mapped the representation of lower jaw (chin vibrissae, chin microvibrissae, and lower lip) in rat primary somatosensory cortex (SI) and correlated the physiological map to the underlying morphological barrel field map in the lower jaw barrel subfield in SI. We report that the lower jaw barrel subfield is somatopically organized in a single map of the contralateral lower jaw skin surface.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Barrel subfields in rodent primary somatosensory cortex (SI) are important model systems for studying cortical organization and reorganization. During cortical reorganization that follows limb deafferentation, neurons in deafferented forelimb SI become responsive to previously unexpressed inputs from the lower jaw. Although the lower jaw barrel subfield (LJBSF) is a likely source of the input, this subfield has received little attention. Our aim was to describe the structural and functional organization of the normal LJBSF. To investigate LJBSF organization, a nomenclature for lower jaw skin surface was developed, cytochrome oxidase (CO) was used to label flattened‐cut LJBSF sections, microelectrodes were used to map the lower jaw skin surface representation in SI, and electrolytic lesions, recovered from electrode penetrations, were used to align the physiological map to the underlying barrel map. LJBSF is a tear‐shaped subfield containing approximately 24 barrels, arranged in eight mediolateral rows and a barrel‐free zone capping the anterior border. The representation of the lower jaw skin consisting of chin vibrissae and microvibrissae embedded in common fur is somatotopically organized in a single map in the contralateral SI. This physiological map shows that the activity from the vibrissae aligns with the CO‐staining of the underlying LJBSF. LJBSF barrels receive topographically ordered barrel‐specific input from individual vibrissa and microvibrissae in the lower jaw but not from trident whiskers. The barrel‐free zone receives topographically ordered input from the lower lip. These data demonstrating that the LJBSF is a highly organized subfield are essential for understanding its possible role in cortical reorganization.</p>

<p>The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is susceptible to continuous fibrillar beta amyloid plaque deposition in aged amyloid precursor protein/PS1 mice. In contrast, after 12 months of age, fibrillar plaque load plateaus in the primary motor cortex (M1) and somatosensory cortex (SS2). Midlife (6–12 months of age) environmental enrichment (EE) decreases the accumulation of fibrillar plaque in M1 and SS2, but not in the PFC region.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Environmentally enriched housing conditions can increase performance on cognitive tasks in amyloid precursor protein (APP)/PS1 mice; however, the potential effects of environmental enrichment (EE) on disease modification in terms of pathological change are inconclusive. We hypothesized that previous contrasting findings may be attributable to regional differences in susceptibility to amyloid beta (Aβ) plaque deposition in cortical regions that are functionally associated with EE. We characterized fibrillar plaque deposition in 6, 12, and 18–22 months old APP/PS1 mice in the prefrontal (PFC), somatosensory (SS2), and primary motor cortex (M1). We found a significant increase in plaque load between 6 and 12 months in all regions. In animals over 12 months, only the PFC region continued to significantly accumulate plaques. Additionally, 12 months old animals subjected to 6 months of EE showed improved spatial navigation and had significantly fewer plaques in M1 and SS2, but not in the PFC. These findings suggest that the PFC region is selectively susceptible to Aβ deposition and less responsive to the attenuating effects of EE. In contrast, M1 and SS2 regions plateau with respect to Aβ deposition by 12 months of age and are susceptible to amyloid pathology modification by midlife EE.</p>

<p>In comparison to conventional repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), theta burst stimulation is stronger and more effective as a brain stimulation approach within short periods. Although this deep rTMS technique is being applied in treating neuropsychiatric disorders, few animal studies have attempted to clarify the neurobiological mechanisms underlying its beneficial effects. This animal study examined the effects of deep rTMS on the cuprizone-induced neuropathologic and behavioral anomalies and explored the underlying mechanism. Adolescent male C57BL/6 mice were fed a rodent chow without or with cuprizone (CPZ; 0.2% w/w) for 5 weeks. Another two groups of mice were subjected to deep rTMS or sham rTMS once a day during weeks 2–5 of the CPZ-feeding period. The behaviors of all mice were assessed after the withdrawal of CPZ before neuropathological and immunological analyses. Compared to the CNT group, mice in CPZ and CPZ + Sham groups showed deficits in social recognition and spatial working memory as well as anxiety-like behavior, in addition to myelin breakdown and OL loss in the corpus callosum (CC), caudate putamen, cerebral cortex, and hippocampus of the brain. Deep rTMS effectively reduced behavioral anomalies and blocked myelin breakdown and OL loss in CPZ-fed mice. Besides, it also dampened microglia activation at lesion sites and rectified cytokines levels (IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10) in CPZ-affected regions. The most significant effect was seen in the cerebral cortex where alleviated neuropathology co-existed with less microglia activation and higher IL-10 level. These data provided experimental evidence for the beneficial effects of deep rTMS in CPZ-fed mice and revealed a neurobiological mechanism of the modality.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.580692">Activated Erk Is an Early Retrograde Signal After Spinal Cord Injury in the Lamprey</a></h4>

<p>We previously reported that spinal cord transection (TX) in the lamprey causes mRNA to accumulate in the injured tips of large reticulospinal (RS) axons. We sought to determine whether this mRNA accumulation results from phosphorylation and transport of retrograde signals, similar to what has been reported in mammalian peripheral nerve. Extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (Erk), mediates the neurite outgrowth-promoting effects of many neurotrophic factors. To assess the role of Erk in retrograde signaling of RS axon injury, we used immunoblot and immunohistochemistry to determine the changes in phosphorylated Erk (p-Erk) in the spinal cord after spinal cord TX. Immunostaining for p-Erk increased within axons and local cell bodies, most heavily within the 1-2 mm closest to the TX site, at between 3 and 6 h post-TX. In axons, p-Erk was concentrated in 3-5 μm granules that became less numerous with distance from the TX. The retrograde molecular motor dynein colocalized with p-Erk, but vimentin, which in peripheral nerve was reported to participate with p-Erk as part of a retrograde signal complex, did not colocalize with p-Erk, even though vimentin levels were elevated post-TX. The results suggest that p-Erk, but not vimentin, may function as a retrograde axotomy signal in lamprey central nervous system neurons, and that this signal may induce transcription of mRNA, which is then transported down the axon to its injured tip.</p>

In this review, we summarize metabolic alterations in aging brain and AD-related metabolic deficits associated with glucose metabolism dysregulation, glycolysis dysfunction, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) deficits, and pentose phosphate pathway impairment. Additionally, we discuss recent treatment strategies targeting metabolic defects in AD, including their limitations, in an effort to encourage the development of novel therapeutic strategies.</p>

<p>Gait is one of the fundamental behaviors we use to interact with the world. The functionality of the locomotor system is thus related to enriching interactions with our environment. The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) has been found to contribute to motor adaptation during both visuomotor and postural adaptation tasks. Additionally, structural or functional deficits of the PPC lead to impairments in gaits such as shortened steps and increased step width. Based on the aforementioned roles of the PPC, and the importance of gait adaptability, the current investigation sought to identify the role of the PPC in gait adaptation. To achieve this, we performed transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the bilateral PPC before performing a split-belt treadmill gait adaptation paradigm. We used three stimulation conditions in a within-subject design. tDCS was administered in a randomized and double-blinded order. Following each stimulation session, subjects first performed baseline walking with both belts running at the same speed. Then, subjects walked for 15 min on an uncoupled treadmill, with the belts being driven at a 3:1 speed ratio. Last, they returned to normal (i.e., tied-belt) walking for 5 min. Results from 15 young and healthy subjects identified that subjects required more steps to adapt to split-belt walking following the suppression of the left hemisphere PPC, contralateral to the fast belt. Furthermore, while suppression of the left hemisphere PPC did not increase the number of steps required to re-adapt to tied-belt walking, this condition did lead to increased magnitude of after-effects. Together, these findings indicate that the PPC is involved in locomotor adaptation. These results support previous literature regarding the upper body or postural adaptation and extend these findings to the realm of gait. Results highlight the PPC as a potential target for neurorehabilitation designed to improve gait adaptability.</p>

<p>Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) offer unique windows into the cognitive processes underlying human-machine interaction. Identifying and analyzing the appropriate brain activity to have access to such windows is often difficult due to technical or psycho-physiological constraints. Indeed, studying interactions through this approach frequently requires adapting them to accommodate specific BCI-related paradigms which change the functioning of their interface on both the human-side and the machine-side. The combined examination of Electroencephalography and Eyetracking recordings, mainly by means of studying Fixation-Related Potentials, can help to circumvent the necessity for these adaptations by determining interaction-relevant moments during natural manipulation. In this contribution, we examine how properties contained within the bi-modal recordings can be used to assess valuable information about the interaction. Practically, three properties are studied which can be obtained solely through data obtained from analysis of the recorded biosignals. Namely, these properties consist of relative gaze metrics, being abstractions of the gaze patterns, the amplitude variations in the early brain activity potentials and the brain activity frequency band differences between fixations. Through their observation, information about three different aspects of the explored interface are obtained. Respectively, the properties provide insights about general perceived task difficulty, locate moments of higher attentional effort and discriminate between moments of exploration and moments of active interaction.</p>

<p>Background: In recent years, vibrotactile haptic feedback technology has been widely used for user interfaces in the mobile devices. Although functional neuroimaging studies have investigated human brain responses to different types of tactile inputs, the neural mechanisms underlying high-frequency vibrotactile perception are still relatively unknown. Our aim was to investigate neuromagnetic brain responses to high-frequency vibrotactile stimulation, using magnetoencephalography (MEG).</p><p>Methods: We measured 152-channel whole-head MEG in 30 healthy, right-handed volunteers (aged 20–28 years, 15 females). A total of 300 vibrotactile stimuli were presented at the tip of either the left index finger or the right index finger in two separate sessions. Sinusoidal vibrations at 150 Hz for 200 ms were generated with random inter-stimulus intervals between 1.6 and 2.4 s. Both time-locked analysis and time-frequency analysis were performed to identify peak responses and oscillatory modulations elicited by high-frequency vibrations. The significance of the evoked and induced responses for dominant and non-dominant hand stimulation conditions was statistically tested, respectively. The difference in responses between stimulation conditions was also statistically evaluated.</p><p>Results: Prominent peak responses were observed at 56 ms (M50) and at 100 ms (M100) for both stimulation conditions. The M50 response revealed clear dipolar field patterns in the contralateral side with significant cortical activations in the contralateral primary sensorimotor area, whereas the M100 response was not as prominent as the M50. Vibrotactile stimulation induced significant suppression of both alpha (8–12 Hz) and beta (20–30 Hz) band activity during the mid-latency period (0.2–0.4 s), primarily in sensorimotor areas contralateral to the stimulation side. In addition, a significant alpha enhancement effect in posterior regions was accompanied with alpha suppressions in sensorimotor regions. The alpha suppression was observed in a broader distribution of cortical areas for the non-dominant hand stimulation.</p><p>Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that high-frequency tactile vibrations, which is known to primarily activate Pacinian corpuscles, elicit somatosensory M50 and M100 responses in the evoked fields and induce modulations of alpha and beta band oscillations during mid-latency periods. Our study is also consistent with that the primary sensorimotor area is significantly involved in the processing of high-frequency vibrotactile information with contralateral dominance.</p>

<p>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD) and essential-tremor (ET). In adaptive DBS (aDBS) systems, online tuning of stimulation parameters as a function of neural signals may improve treatment efficacy and reduce side-effects. State-of-the-art aDBS systems use symptom surrogates derived from neural signals—so-called neural markers (NMs)—defined on the patient-group level, and control strategies assuming stationarity of symptoms and NMs. We aim at improving these aDBS systems with (1) a data-driven approach for identifying patient- and session-specific NMs and (2) a control strategy coping with short-term non-stationary dynamics. The two building blocks are implemented as follows: (1) The data-driven NMs are based on a machine learning model estimating tremor intensity from electrocorticographic signals. (2) The control strategy accounts for local variability of tremor statistics. Our study with three chronically implanted ET patients amounted to five online sessions. Tremor quantified from accelerometer data shows that symptom suppression is at least equivalent to that of a continuous DBS strategy in 3 out-of 4 online tests, while considerably reducing net stimulation (at least 24%). In the remaining online test, symptom suppression was not significantly different from either the continuous strategy or the no treatment condition. We introduce a novel aDBS system for ET. It is the first aDBS system based on (1) a machine learning model to identify session-specific NMs, and (2) a control strategy coping with short-term non-stationary dynamics. We show the suitability of our aDBS approach for ET, which opens the door to its further study in a larger patient population.</p>

<p>Many current computational models that aim to simulate cortical and hippocampal modules of the brain depend on artificial neural networks. However, such classical or even deep neural networks are very slow, sometimes taking thousands of trials to obtain the final response with a considerable amount of error. The need for a large number of trials at learning and the inaccurate output responses are due to the complexity of the input cue and the biological processes being simulated. This article proposes a computational model for an intact and a lesioned cortico-hippocampal system using quantum-inspired neural networks. This cortico-hippocampal computational quantum-inspired (CHCQI) model simulates cortical and hippocampal modules by using adaptively updated neural networks entangled with quantum circuits. The proposed model is used to simulate various classical conditioning tasks related to biological processes. The output of the simulated tasks yielded the desired responses quickly and efficiently compared with other computational models, including the recently published Green model.</p>

<p>The ability of humans and animals to localize the source of a sound in a complex acoustic environment facilitates communication and survival. Two cues are used for sound localization at horizontal planes, interaural time and level differences (ITD and ILD), which are analyzed by distinct neural circuits in the brainstem. Here, we review the studies on metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-mediated neuromodulation of both intrinsic and synaptic properties of brainstem neurons in these circuits. Both mammalian and avian animal models have been used, with each having their advantages that are not present in the other. For the mammalian model, we discuss mGluR neuromodulation in the ILD circuit, with an emphasis on the recent discovery of differential modulation of synaptic transmission of different transmitter release modes. For the avian model, we focus on reviewing mGluR neuromodulation in the ITD pathway, with an emphasis on tonotopic distribution and synaptic plasticity of mGluR modulation in coincidence detector neurons. Future works are proposed to further investigate the functions and mechanisms of mGluRs in the sound localization circuits.</p>

<p>Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC) plays an essential role in the control of food intake and energy expenditure. Melanocortin-4 receptors (MC4Rs) are expressed in key areas that are implicated in regulating energy homeostasis. Although the importance of MC4Rs in the paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH) has been well documented, the role of MC4Rs in the medial amygdala (MeA) on feeding remains controversial. In this study, we specifically examine the role of a novel ARC<sup>POMC</sup>→MeA neural circuit in the regulation of short-term food intake. To map a local melanocortinergic neural circuit, we use monosynaptic anterograde as well as retrograde viral tracers and perform double immunohistochemistry to determine the identity of the neurons receiving synaptic input from POMC neurons in the ARC. To investigate the role of the ARC<sup>POMC</sup>→MeA projection on feeding, we optogenetically stimulate channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-expressing POMC fibers in the MeA. Anterograde viral tracing studies reveal that ARC POMC neurons send axonal projections to estrogen receptor-α (ER-α)- and MC4R-expressing neurons in the MeA. Retrograde viral tracing experiments show that the neurons projecting to the MeA is located mainly in the lateral part of the ARC. Optogenetic stimulation of the ARC<sup>POMC</sup>→MeA pathway reduces short-term food intake. This anorectic effect is blocked by treatment with the MC4R antagonist SHU9119. In addition to the melanocortinergic local circuits within the hypothalamus, this extrahypothalamic ARC<sup>POMC</sup>→MeA neural circuit would play a role in regulating short-term food intake.</p>

<p>During the last 50 years, the serotonergic (5-HT) system was reported to exert a complex modulation of locomotor activity. Here, we focus on two key factors that likely contribute to such complexity. First, locomotion is modulated directly and indirectly by 5-HT neurons. The locomotor circuitry is directly innervated by 5-HT neurons in the caudal brainstem and spinal cord. Also, indirect control of locomotor activity results from ascending projections of 5-HT cells in the rostral brainstem that innervate multiple brain centers involved in motor action planning. Second, each approach used to manipulate the 5-HT system likely engages different 5-HT-dependent mechanisms. This includes the recruitment of different 5-HT receptors, which can have excitatory or inhibitory effects on cell activity. These receptors can be located far or close to the 5-HT release sites, making their activation dependent on the level of 5-HT released. Here we review the activity of different 5-HT nuclei during locomotor activity, and the locomotor effects of 5-HT precursors, exogenous 5-HT, selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), electrical or chemical stimulation of 5-HT neurons, genetic deletions, optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulations. We highlight both the coherent and controversial aspects of 5-HT modulation of locomotor activity from basal vertebrates to mammals. This mini review may hopefully inspire future studies aiming at dissecting the complex effects of 5-HT on locomotor function.</p>

<p>Neurons typically receive synaptic input in their dendritic arbor, integrate inputs in their soma, and send output action potentials through their axon, following Cajal’s law of dynamic polarization. Two notable exceptions are retinal amacrine cells and olfactory granule cells (GCs), which flout Cajal’s edict by providing synaptic output from the same dendrites that collect synaptic input. Amacrine cells, a diverse cell class comprising &gt;60 subtypes, employ various dendritic input/output strategies, but A17 amacrine cells (A17s) in particular share further interesting functional characteristics with GCs: both receive excitatory synaptic input from neurons in the primary glutamatergic pathway and return immediate, reciprocal feedback via GABAergic inhibitory synapses to the same synaptic terminals that provided input. Both neurons thereby process signals locally within their dendrites, shaping many parallels, signaling pathways independently. The similarities between A17s and GCs cast into relief striking differences that may indicate distinct processing roles within their respective circuits: First, they employ partially dissimilar molecular mechanisms to transform excitatory input into inhibitory output; second, GCs fire action potentials, whereas A17s do not. Third, GC signals may be influenced by cortical feedback, whereas the mammalian retina receives no such retrograde input. Finally, A17s constitute just one subtype within a diverse class that is specialized in a particular task, whereas the more homogeneous GCs may play more diverse signaling roles via multiple processing modes. Here, we review these analogies and distinctions between A17 amacrine cells and granule cells, hoping to gain further insight into the operating principles of these two sensory circuits.</p>

<p>Vision, hearing, smell, taste, and touch are the tools used to perceive and navigate the world. They enable us to obtain essential resources such as food and highly desired resources such as mates. Thanks to the investments in biomedical research the molecular unpinning’s of human sensation are rivaled only by our knowledge of sensation in the laboratory mouse. Humans rely heavily on vision whereas mice use smell as their dominant sense. Both modalities have many features in common, starting with signal detection by highly specialized primary sensory neurons—rod and cone photoreceptors (PR) for vision, and olfactory sensory neurons (OSN) for the smell. In this chapter, we provide an overview of how these two types of primary sensory neurons operate while highlighting the similarities and distinctions.</p>

<p>Injuries in the central nervous system (CNS) often causes neuronal loss and glial scar formation. We have recently demonstrated NeuroD1-mediated direct conversion of reactive glial cells into functional neurons in adult mouse brains. Here, we further investigate whether such direct glia-to-neuron conversion technology can reverse glial scar back to neural tissue in a severe stab injury model of the mouse cortex. Using an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based gene therapy approach, we ectopically expressed a single neural transcription factor NeuroD1 in reactive astrocytes in the injured areas. We discovered that the reactive astrocytes were efficiently converted into neurons both before and after glial scar formation, and the remaining astrocytes proliferated to repopulate themselves. The astrocyte-converted neurons were highly functional, capable of firing action potentials and establishing synaptic connections with other neurons. Unexpectedly, the expression of NeuroD1 in reactive astrocytes resulted in a significant reduction of toxic A1 astrocytes, together with a significant decrease of reactive microglia and neuroinflammation. Furthermore, accompanying the regeneration of new neurons and repopulation of new astrocytes, new blood vessels emerged and blood-brain-barrier (BBB) was restored. These results demonstrate an innovative neuroregenerative gene therapy that can directly reverse glial scar back to neural tissue, opening a new avenue for brain repair after injury.</p>

<p>The auditory system relies on temporal precise information transfer, requiring an interplay of synchronously activated inputs and rapid postsynaptic integration. During late postnatal development synaptic, biophysical, and morphological features change to enable mature auditory neurons to perform their appropriate function. How the number of minimal required input fibers and the relevant EPSC time course integrated for action potential generation changes during late postnatal development is unclear. To answer these questions, we used in vitro electrophysiology in auditory brainstem structures from pre-hearing onset and mature Mongolian gerbils of either sex. Synaptic and biophysical parameters changed distinctively during development in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB), the medial superior olive (MSO), and the ventral and dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (VNLL and DNLL). Despite a reduction in input resistance in most cell types, all required fewer inputs in the mature stage to drive action potentials. Moreover, the EPSC decay time constant is a good predictor of the EPSC time used for action potential generation in all nuclei but the VNLL. Only in MSO neurons, the full EPSC time course is integrated by the neuron’s resistive element, while otherwise, the relevant EPSC time matches only 5–10% of the membrane time constant, indicating membrane charging as a dominant role for output generation. We conclude, that distinct developmental programs lead to a general increase in temporal precision and integration accuracy matched to the information relaying properties of the investigated nuclei.</p>

<p>Increasing evidence foresees the secretome of neural stem cells (NSCs) to confer superimposable beneficial properties as exogenous NSC transplants in experimental treatments of traumas and diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). Naturally produced secretome biologics include membrane-free signaling molecules and extracellular membrane vesicles (EVs) capable of regulating broad functional responses. The development of high-throughput screening pipelines for the identification and validation of NSC secretome targets is still in early development. Encouraging results from pre-clinical animal models of disease have highlighted secretome-based (acellular) therapeutics as providing significant improvements in biochemical and behavioral measurements. Most of these responses are being hypothesized to be the result of modulating and promoting the restoration of key inflammatory and regenerative programs in the CNS. Here, we will review the most recent findings regarding the identification of NSC-secreted factors capable of modulating the immune response to promote the regeneration of the CNS in animal models of CNS trauma and inflammatory disease and discuss the increased interest to refine the pro-regenerative features of the NSC secretome into a clinically available therapy in the emerging field of Regenerative Neuroimmunology.</p>

<p>Huntington disease (HD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene. Disrupted cortico-striatal transmission is an early event that contributes to neuronal spine and synapse dysfunction primarily in striatal medium spiny neurons, the most vulnerable cell type in the disease, but also in neurons of other brain regions including the cortex. Although striatal and cortical neurons eventually degenerate, these synaptic and circuit changes may underlie some of the earliest motor, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms. Moreover, synaptic dysfunction and spine loss are hypothesized to be therapeutically reversible before neuronal death occurs, and restoration of normal synaptic function may delay neurodegeneration. One of the earliest synaptic alterations to occur in HD mouse models is enhanced striatal extrasynaptic NMDA receptor expression and activity. This activity is mediated primarily through GluN2B subunit-containing receptors and is associated with increased activation of cell death pathways, inhibition of survival signaling, and greater susceptibility to excitotoxicity. Death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) is a pro-apoptotic kinase highly expressed in neurons during development. In the adult brain, DAPK1 becomes re-activated and recruited to extrasynaptic NMDAR complexes during neuronal death, where it phosphorylates GluN2B at S1303, amplifying toxic receptor function. Approaches to reduce DAPK1 activity have demonstrated benefit in animal models of stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and chronic stress, indicating that DAPK1 may be a novel target for neuroprotection. Here, we demonstrate that dysregulation of DAPK1 occurs early in the YAC128 HD mouse model, and contributes to elevated extrasynaptic GluN2B S1303 phosphorylation. Inhibition of DAPK1 normalizes extrasynaptic GluN2B phosphorylation and surface expression, and completely prevents YAC128 striatal spine loss in cortico-striatal co-culture, thus validating DAPK1 as a potential target for synaptic protection in HD and warranting further development of DAPK1-targeted therapies for neurodegeneration.</p>

<p>Microglia—the brain’s primary immune cells—exert a tightly regulated cascade of pro- and anti-inflammatory effects upon brain pathology, either promoting regeneration or neurodegeneration. Therefore, harnessing microglia emerges as a potential therapeutic concept in neurological research. Recent studies suggest that—besides being affected by chemokines and cytokines—various cell entities in the brain relevantly respond to the mechanical properties of their microenvironment. For example, we lately reported considerable effects of elasticity on neural stem cells, regarding quiescence and differentiation potential. However, the effects of elasticity on microglia remain to be explored.Under the hypothesis that the elasticity of the microenvironment affects key characteristics and functions of microglia, we established an in vitro model of primary rat microglia grown in a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer-based cell culture system. This way, we simulated the brain’s physiological elasticity range and compared it to supraphysiological stiffer PDMS controls. We assessed functional parameters of microglia under “resting” conditions, as well as when polarized towards a pro-inflammatory phenotype (M1) by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or an anti-inflammatory phenotype (M2) by interleukin-4 (IL-4). Microglia viability was unimpaired on soft substrates, but we found various significant effects with a more than two-fold increase in microglia proliferation on soft substrate elasticities mimicking the brain (relative to PDMS controls). Furthermore, soft substrates promoted the expression of the activation marker vimentin in microglia. Moreover, the M2-marker CD206 was upregulated in parallel to an increase in the secretion of Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1). The upregulation of CD206 was abolished by blockage of stretch-dependent chloride channels. Our data suggest that the cultivation of microglia on substrates of brain-like elasticity promotes a basic anti-inflammatory activation state via stretch-dependent chloride channels. The results highlight the significance of the omnipresent but mostly overlooked mechanobiological effects exerted on microglia and contribute to a better understanding of the complex spatial and temporal interactions between microglia, neural stem cells, and glia, in health and disease.</p>

<p>Recent evidence highlighted the importance of white matter tracts in typical and atypical behaviors. White matter dynamically changes in response to learning, stress, and social experiences. Several lines of evidence have reported white matter dysfunction in psychiatric conditions, including depression, stress- and anxiety-related disorders. The mechanistic underpinnings of these associations, however, remain poorly understood. Here, we outline an integrative perspective positing a link between aberrant myelin plasticity and anxiety. Drawing on extant literature and emerging new findings, we suggest that in anxiety, unique changes may occur in response to threat and to safety learning and the ability to discriminate between both types of stimuli. We propose that altered myelin plasticity in the neural circuits underlying these two forms of learning relates to the emergence of anxiety-related disorders, by compromising mechanisms of neural network synchronization. The clinical and translational implications of this model for anxiety-related disorders are discussed.</p>

<p>Acute alcohol exposure impairs hippocampus-dependent spatial memory. However, there is little evidence for the effects of ethanol on the spike patterns of hippocampal cell populations. Here, we examined how the spatial firing patterns of place cells, neurons that encode specific locations, were altered in rats that were intraperitoneally injected with 1.5 g/kg ethanol. Ethanol administration partly reduced or abolished place-selective spiking of a subset of place cells during running periods in a spatial task, whereas a subset of place fields newly emerged, suggesting a partial reorganization of hippocampal spatial maps by ethanol. On the other hand, ethanol administration did not significantly alter the frequency of hippocampal sharp-wave ripple (SWRs) and synchronous spike patterns during resting periods, suggesting that offline memory consolidation and retrieval mechanisms underpinned by hippocampal neuronal synchronization are not strongly affected by ethanol. These results indicate that acute ethanol intake mainly affects the encoding of external information but has little impact on internal memory processing.</p>

<p>Objective: The association between hippocampal volume and memory is continuing to be characterized in healthy older adults. Prior research suggests smaller hippocampal volume in healthy older adults is associated with poorer episodic memory and processing speed, as well as working memory, verbal learning, and executive functioning as measured by the NIH Toolbox Fluid (Fluid Cognition Composite, FCC) and Crystalized Cognition Composites (CCC). This study aimed to replicate these findings and to evaluate the association between: (1) hippocampal asymmetry index and cognition; and (2) independent contributions of the left and right hippocampal volume and cognition in a large sample of healthy older adults.</p><p>Participants and Methods: One-hundred and eighty-three healthy older adults (M age = 71.72, SD = 5.3) received a T1-weighted sequence on a 3T scanner. Hippocampal subfields were extracted using FreeSurfer 6.0 and combined to provide left, right, and total hippocampal volumes. FCC subtests include Dimensional Change Card Sort, Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention, List Sorting, Picture Sequence Memory, and Pattern Comparison. CCC subtests include Picture Vocabulary and Oral Reading Recognition. Multiple linear regressions were performed predicting cognition composites from the total, left and right, and asymmetry of hippocampal volume, controlling for sex, education, scanner, and total intracranial volume. Multiple comparisons in primary analyses were corrected using a false discovery rate (FDR) of p &lt; 0.05.</p><p>Results: FCC scores were positively associated with total (β = 0.226, FDR q = 0.044) and left (β = 0.257, FDR q = 0.024) hippocampal volume. Within FCC, Picture Sequence Memory scores positively associated with total (β = 0.284, p = 0.001) and left (β = 0.98, p = 0.001) hippocampal volume. List Sorting scores were also positively associated with left hippocampal volume (β = 0.189, p = 0.029).</p><p>Conclusions: These results confirm previous research suggesting that bilateral hippocampal volume is associated with FCC, namely episodic memory. The present study also suggests the left hippocampal volume may be more broadly associated with both episodic and working memory. Studies should continue to investigate lateralized hippocampal contributions to aging processes to better identify predictors of cognitive decline.</p>

<p>Postoperative delirium (POD) is the most common postoperative complication affecting elderly patients, yet the underlying mechanism is elusive, and effective therapies are lacking. The neuroinflammation hypothesis for the pathogenesis of POD has recently emerged. Accumulating evidence is supporting the role of specialized proresolving lipid mediators (SPMs) in regulating inflammation. Neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1), a novel docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-derived lipid mediator, has shown potent immunoresolvent and neuroprotective effects in several disease models associated with inflammation. Here, using a mouse model of POD, we investigated the role of NPD1 in postoperative cognitive impairment by assessing systemic inflammatory changes, the permeability of the blood–brain barrier (BBB), neuroinflammation, and behavior in aged mice at different time points. We report that a single dose of NPD1 prophylaxis decreased the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha TNF-α and interleukin (IL)-6 and upregulated the expression of IL-10 in peripheral blood, the hippocampus, and the prefrontal cortex. Additionally, NPD1 limited the leakage of the BBB by increasing the expression of tight junction (TJ)-associated proteins such as ZO-1, claudin-5, and occludin. NPD1 also abolished the activation of microglia and astrocytes in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, which is associated with improved general and memory function after surgery. In addition, NPD1 treatment modulated the inflammatory cytokine expression profile and improved the expression of the M2 marker CD206 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages, which may partly explain the beneficial effects of NPD1 on inflammation. Collectively, these findings shed light on the proresolving activities of NPD1 in the pro-inflammatory milieu both in vivo and in vitro and may bring a novel therapeutic approach for POD.</p>

Background<p>Excessive aggregation of α-synuclein is the key pathophysiological feature of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is also associated with synucleinopathies and considered as a powerful predictor of PD. Growing evidence suggests the diminished clearance of α-synuclein may be partly attributable to poor interstitial fluid drainage, which can be reflected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-visible enlarged perivascular space (EPVS). However, the effect of MRI-visible EPVS on iRBD and PD, and their correlation with clinical characteristics remain unclear.</p>Objective<p>To evaluate the clinical and neuroimaging significance of MRI-visible EPVS in iRBD and PD patients.</p>Methods<p>We enrolled 33 iRBD patients, 82 PD (with and without RBD) patients, and 35 healthy controls (HCs), who underwent clinical evaluation and 3.0 Tesla MRI. Two neurologists assessed MRI-visible EPVS in centrum semiovale (CSO), basal ganglia (BG), substantia nigra (SN), and brainstem (BS). Independent risk factors for iRBD and PD were investigated using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Spearman analysis was used to test the correlation of MRI-visible EPVS with clinical characteristics of patients.</p>Results<p>iRBD patients had significantly higher EPVS burdens (CSO, BG, SN, and BS) than PD patients. Higher CSO-EPVS and BS-EPVS burdens were independent risk factors for iRBD. Furthermore, higher CSO-EPVS and SN-EPVS burdens were positively correlated with the severity of clinical symptom in iRBD patients, and higher BG-EPVS burden was positively correlated with the severity of cognitive impairment in PD patients.</p>Conclusion<p>iRBD and PD patients have different MRI-visible EPVS burdens, which may be related with a compensatory mechanism in glymphatic system. Lower MRI-visible EPVS burden in PD patients may be a manifestation of severe brain waste drainage dysfunction. These findings shed light on the pathophysiologic relationship between iRBD and PD with respect to neuroimaging marker of PD.</p>

<p>Cognition emerges from coordinated processing among distributed cortical brain regions, enabled through interconnected white matter networks. Cortical disconnection caused by age-related decline in white matter integrity (WMI) is likely to contribute to age-related cognitive decline. Physical activity (PA) has been suggested to have beneficial effects on white matter structure. However, its potential to counteract age-related decline in WMI is not yet well established. The present explorative study analyzed if PA was associated with WMI in cognitively healthy older adults and if this association was modulated by age. Forty-four cognitively healthy older individuals (aged 60–88 years) with diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) and PA measurements were included from the AgeGain study. Voxelwise analysis using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) demonstrated that PA was associated with WMI in older adults. However, results emphasized that this association was restricted to high age. The association between PA and WMI was found in widespread white matter regions suggesting a global rather than a regional effect. Supplementary analyses demonstrated an association between the integrity of these regions and the performance in memory [verbal learning and memory test (VLMT)] and executive functioning (Tower of London).Results of the present explorative study support the assumption that PA is associated with WMI in older adults. However, results emphasize that this association is restricted to high age. Since cognitive decline in the elderly is typically most pronounced in later stages of aging, PA qualifies as a promising tool to foster resilience against age-related cognitive decline, via the preservation of the integrity of the brains WM.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s dementia (AD) begins many years before its clinical symptoms. Metabolic dysfunction represents a core feature of AD and cognitive impairment, but few metabolomic studies have focused on cognitive aging in midlife. Using an untargeted metabolomics approach, we identified metabolic predictors of cognitive aging in midlife using fasting plasma sample from 30 middle-aged (mean age 57.2), male-male twin pairs enrolled in the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging (VETSA). For all twin pairs, one twin developed incident MCI, whereas his co-twin brother remained to be cognitively normal during an average 5.5-year follow-up. Linear mixed model was used to identify metabolites predictive of MCI conversion or cognitive change over time, adjusting for traditional risk factors. Results from twins were replicated in an independent cohort of middle-aged adults (mean age 59.1) in the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer’s Prevention (WRAP). Results in twins showed that higher baseline levels of four plasma metabolites, including sphingomyelin (d18:1/20:1 and d18:2/20:0), sphingomyelin (d18:1/22:1, d18:2/22:0, and d16:1/24:1), DAG (18:2/20:4), and hydroxy-CMPF, were significantly associated with a slower decrease in one or more domains of cognitive function. The association of sphingomyelin (d18:1/20:1 and d18:2/20:0) was replicated in WRAP. Our results support that metabolic perturbation occurs many years before cognitive impairment and plasma metabolites may serve as early biomarkers for prediction or monitoring of cognitive aging and AD in midlife.</p>

<p>Aggregated tau is a hallmark neuropathological feature in numerous neurodegenerative disorders. Previous studies aiming to validate aggregated tau pathology as a pathogenic driver of neurodegeneration in correlation to characteristic behavioral phenotypes have had shortcomings. Although studies on soluble tau pathology have effectively addressed these shortcomings, the role of soluble tau in the molecular pathogenesis of neurodegeneration is not yet unequivocally established. In sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the relevance of soluble tau pathology in endolysosomal dysfunction and autophagic stress, some of the earliest disease manifestations, is unclear. In this study, we report that soluble 4R0N tau overexpression affects the expression levels of certain markers associated with the endolysosomal system and autophagy. Moreover, through live-cell imaging, we found that the vesicular dynamics of early endosomes were affected with respect to spatiotemporal parameters and vesicle maturation. Additionally, we observed the localization of amyloid precursor protein (APP) along the endocytic pathway and found that upon overexpression of soluble 4R0N tau, APP was preferentially localized to the endocytic compartments implicated in the amyloidogenic pathway. Overall, our observations indicate that soluble 4R0N tau abrogates the dynamics of the endolysosomal system, autophagy, and affects the trafficking of APP. Since the amyloidogenic processing of APP occurs during its progression through the endocytic pathway, our results suggest that the generation of amyloid-β (Aβ) might also be modulated.</p>

<p>Aging is a lifelong process that starts at birth. Throughout the course of their life, individuals are exposed to various levels of stimulating activities. A higher level of engagement in such activities is suspected to protect against the normal course of cognitive aging or the cognitive manifestations of age-related brain diseases. However, the exact mechanism underlying such protective action remains unclear. The concept of the neurocognitive reserve was introduced to refer to the hypothesis that engagement in stimulating activities shapes brain structure and function, thus indirectly allowing for better preserved cognitive abilities. Although it is known that word production is among the best-preserved cognitive abilities in aging, the underlying neurofunctional mechanisms that allow this relative preservation are still unknown, and it is still unclear how engagement in stimulating activities affects these processes. The objective of this study is to describe the brain functional connectivity patterns associated with picture-naming abilities in younger and older adults with varying levels of engagement in stimulating activities, as a proxy for neurocognitive reserve. A mediation analysis was applied to determine whether the association between reserve proxies and naming accuracy is dependent on task FC. Results show that naming accuracy depends on the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) functional decoupling in both younger and older adults but through different pathways. While high-performing older adults rely on the asynchronization of this area from motor speech regions’ activity, the best-performing younger adults rely on the functional decoupling with language-related regions. Mediation analysis reveals that the PCC decoupling mediates the relationship between the level of engagement in stimulating activities and naming accuracy in younger adults, but not in older adults. These findings suggest that reserve-related mechanisms may be more critical for naming in early adult life, while older adults’ neurofunctional organization may benefit more from a lifetime of acquired knowledge.</p>

<p>by Joshua Kimrey, Theodore Vo, Richard Bertram</p>

The pumping of blood through the heart is due to a wave of muscle contractions that are in turn due to a wave of electrical activity initiated at the sinoatrial node. At the cellular level, this wave of electrical activity corresponds to the sequential excitation of electrically coupled cardiac cells. Under some conditions, the normally-long action potentials of cardiac cells are extended even further by small oscillations called early afterdepolarizations (EADs) that can occur either during the plateau phase or repolarizing phase of the action potential. Hence, cellular EADs have been implicated as a driver of potentially lethal cardiac arrhythmias. One of the major determinants of cellular EAD production and repolarization failure is the size of the overlap region between Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activation and inactivation, called the window region. In this article, we interpret the role of the window region in terms of the fast-slow structure of a low-dimensional model for ventricular action potential generation. We demonstrate that the effects of manipulation of the size of the window region can be understood from the point of view of canard theory. We use canard theory to explain why enlarging the size of the window region elicits EADs and why shrinking the window region can eliminate them. We also use the canard mechanism to explain why some manipulations in the size of the window region have a stronger influence on cellular electrical behavior than others. This dynamical viewpoint gives predictive power that is beyond that of the biophysical explanation alone while also uncovering a common mechanism for phenomena observed in experiments on both atrial and ventricular cardiac cells.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Avz3Jy_sx2s" width="1" />

<p>by Peter M. C. Harrison, Roberta Bianco, Maria Chait, Marcus T. Pearce</p>

Statistical learning and probabilistic prediction are fundamental processes in auditory cognition. A prominent computational model of these processes is Prediction by Partial Matching (PPM), a variable-order Markov model that learns by internalizing <i>n</i>-grams from training sequences. However, PPM has limitations as a cognitive model: in particular, it has a perfect memory that weights all historic observations equally, which is inconsistent with memory capacity constraints and recency effects observed in human cognition. We address these limitations with PPM-Decay, a new variant of PPM that introduces a customizable memory decay kernel. In three studies—one with artificially generated sequences, one with chord sequences from Western music, and one with new behavioral data from an auditory pattern detection experiment—we show how this decay kernel improves the model’s predictive performance for sequences whose underlying statistics change over time, and enables the model to capture effects of memory constraints on auditory pattern detection. The resulting model is available in our new open-source R package, <i>ppm</i> (https://github.com/pmcharrison/ppm).<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wnRZs66WMSA" width="1" />

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Even though genetic predisposition has proven to be an important element in Parkinson's disease (PD) etiology, monozygotic (MZ) twins with PD displayed a concordance rate of only about 20% despite their shared identical genetic background.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We recruited 5 pairs of MZ twins discordant for idiopathic PD and established skin fibroblast cultures to investigate mitochondrial phenotypes in these cellular models against the background of a presumably identical genome. To test for genetic differences, we performed whole genome sequencing, deep mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequencing, and tested for mitochondrial deletions by multiplex real‐time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the fibroblast cultures. Further, the fibroblast cultures were tested for mitochondrial integrity by immunocytochemistry, immunoblotting, flow cytometry, and real‐time PCR to quantify gene expression.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Genome sequencing did not identify any genetic difference. We found decreased mitochondrial functionality with reduced cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, altered mitochondrial morphology, elevated protein levels of superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), and increased levels of peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor‐gamma coactivator‐α (<i>PPARGC1A</i>) messenger RNA (mRNA) in skin fibroblast cultures from the affected compared to the unaffected twins. Further, there was a tendency for a higher number of somatic mtDNA variants among the affected twins.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We demonstrate disease‐related differences in mitochondrial integrity in the genetically identical twins. Of note, the clinical expression matches functional alterations of the mitochondria. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<p>The success of clinical trials of selective B‐cell depletion in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS) and primary progressive MS has led to a conceptual shift in the understanding of MS pathogenesis, away from the classical model in which T cells were the sole central actors and toward a more complex paradigm with B cells having an essential role in both the inflammatory and neurodegenerative components of the disease process. The role of B cells in MS was selected as the topic of the 27th Annual Meeting of the European Charcot Foundation. Results of the meeting are presented in this concise review, which recaps current concepts underlying the biology and therapeutic rationale behind B‐cell–directed therapeutics in MS, and proposes strategies to optimize the use of existing anti–B‐cell treatments and provide future directions for research in this area.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Congenital heart disease (CHD) is associated with abnormal brain development in utero. We applied innovative fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques to determine whether reduced fetal cerebral substrate delivery impacts the brain globally, or in a region‐specific pattern. Our novel design included two control groups, one with and the other without a family history of CHD, to explore the contribution of shared genes and/or fetal environment to brain development.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>From 2014 to 2018, we enrolled 179 pregnant women into 4 groups: “HLHS/TGA” fetuses with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) or transposition of the great arteries (TGA), diagnoses with lowest fetal cerebral substrate delivery; “CHD‐other,” with other CHD diagnoses; “CHD‐related,” healthy with a CHD family history; and “optimal control,” healthy without a family history. Two MRIs were obtained between 18 and 40 weeks gestation. Random effect regression models assessed group differences in brain volumes and relationships to hemodynamic variables.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>HLHS/TGA (n = 24), CHD‐other (50), and CHD‐related (34) groups each had generally smaller brain volumes than the optimal controls (71). Compared with CHD‐related, the HLHS/TGA group had smaller subplate (−13.3% [standard error = 4.3%], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) and intermediate (−13.7% [4.3%], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) zones, with a similar trend in ventricular zone (−7.1% [1.9%], <i>p</i> = 0.07). These volumetric reductions were associated with lower cerebral substrate delivery.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Fetuses with CHD, especially those with lowest cerebral substrate delivery, show a region‐specific pattern of small brain volumes and impaired brain growth before 32 weeks gestation. The brains of fetuses with CHD were more similar to those of CHD‐related than optimal controls, suggesting genetic or environmental factors also contribute. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Obesity is a chronic condition associated with adverse memory and emotional outcomes in humans and animal models. We have recently demonstrated that post‐weaning (i.e., periadolescent) high‐fat diet (HFD)‐induced obesity has opposite effect on hippocampal and amygdala‐dependent memory in rodents: while HFD consumption impairs spatial and relational memory, it enhances cue‐dependent emotional memory. However, it is still not clear whether this bidirectional HFD effect on memory is related to bidirectional alterations of hippocampal and amygdala synaptic plasticity and if it is influenced by the duration of diet intake. In the current study, we compared in male rats the impact of 2–3 and 6–7 months of HFD intake starting at weaning, thus covering adolescence, on in vivo long‐term potentiation (LTP) recorded simultaneously in the hippocampal area CA1 and the basolateral amygdala (BLA). As expected, 6–7 months of HFD intake abolished LTP in the CA1 and enhanced LTP in the BLA. However, 2–3 months of of HFD exposure enhanced LTP in both CA1 and BLA suggesting a transient compensatory mechanism in hippocampus. These results indicate that post‐weaning HFD intake progressively leads to bidirectional modulation of hippocampal and amygdala synaptic plasticity, as we previously demonstrated for related memory processes, yet with a different temporal dynamic.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus carries out multiple functions: spatial cognition dorsally (DH) and regulation of emotionality‐driven behavior ventrally (VH). Previously, we showed that dendrites of DH and VH pyramidal neurons of female rats are still developing robustly during adolescence and are altered by the experience of food restriction and voluntary exercise on a wheel. We tested whether such anatomical changes during adolescence impact anxiety‐like behavior and spatial cognition. Four groups of female rats were evaluated for these behaviors: those with wheel access in its cage from postnatal day (P) 36–44 (EX); those with food access restricted to 1 hr per day, from P40 to 44 (FR); those with EX from P36 to 44, combined with FR from P40 to 44, which we will refer to as EX + FR; and controls, CON (no EX, no FR). Open field test for anxiety‐like behavior and active place avoidance test for spatial cognition were conducted at P47–49, the age when food restricted animals have restored body weight, or at P54–56, to identify more enduring effects. Anxiety‐like behavior was elevated for the EX and FR groups at P47–49 but not for the EX + FR group. By P54–56, the EX + FR and EX groups exhibited less anxiety‐like behavior, indicating a beneficial delayed main effect of exercise. There was a beneficial main effect of food restriction upon cognition, as the FR group showed cognition superior to CONs' at P44–46 and P54–56, while the EX + FR animals also showed enhanced spatial learning at P54–56. EX + FR animals with best adaptation to the feeding schedule showed the best spatial learning performance but with a delay. The EX group exhibited only a transient improvement. These findings indicate that FR, EX, and EX + FR in mid‐adolescence are all beneficial in reducing anxiety‐like behavior and improving spatial cognition but with subtle differences in the timing of their manifestation, possibly reflecting the protracted maturation of the hippocampus.</p>

<p>Being widespread across different brain systems, the neuromodulatory action of acetylcholine plays a critical role in a vast range of neural processes such as learning and memory, attention, motor control, and sensory processing. In this study, we describe the spatial distribution of cholinergic neurons throughout the brain of the weakly electric fish, <i>Apteronotus leptorhynchus</i>, using in situ hybridization of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) mRNA. The presence of ChAT in brain nuclei harboring feedback projections directed to primary centers of the electrosensory pathway supports and extends our previous findings on a neuromodulatory effect of acetylcholine on the early stages of electrosensory processing.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Acetylcholine acts as a neurotransmitter/neuromodulator of many central nervous system processes such as learning and memory, attention, motor control, and sensory processing. The present study describes the spatial distribution of cholinergic neurons throughout the brain of the weakly electric fish, <i>Apteronotus leptorhynchus</i>, using in situ hybridization of choline acetyltransferase mRNA. Distinct groups of cholinergic cells were observed in the telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon, and hindbrain. These included cholinergic cell groups typically identified in other vertebrate brains, for example, motor neurons. Using both in vitro and ex vivo neuronal tracing methods, we identified two new cholinergic connections leading to novel hypotheses on their functional significance. Projections to the nucleus praeeminentialis (nP) arise from isthmic nuclei, possibly including the nucleus lateralis valvulae (nLV) and the isthmic nucleus (nI). The nP is a central component of all electrosensory feedback pathways to the electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL). We have previously shown that some neurons in nP, TS, and tectum express muscarinic receptors. We hypothesize that, based on nLV/nI cell responses in other teleosts and isthmic connectivity in <i>A</i>. <i>leptorhynchus</i>, the isthmic connections to nP, TS, and tectum modulate responses to electrosensory and/or visual motion and, in particular, to looming/receding stimuli. In addition, we found that the octavolateral efferent (OE) nucleus is the likely source of cholinergic fibers innervating the ELL. In other teleosts, OE inhibits octavolateral hair cells during locomotion. In gymnotiform fish, OE may also act on the first central processing stage and, we hypothesize, implement corollary discharge modulation of electrosensory processing during locomotion.</p>

<p>Early brain insult, interfering with its maturation, may result in psychotic-like disturbances in adult life. Redox dysfunctions and neuroinflammation contribute to long-term psychiatric consequences due to neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Here, we investigated the effects of early pharmacological modulation of the redox and inflammatory states, through celastrol, and indomethacin administration, on reactive oxygen species (ROS) amount, levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase 1, SOD1, glutathione, GSH, and catalase, CAT), as well as of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, TNF-α, interleukin-6, IL-6, and interleukin-1 beta, IL-1β), in the prefrontal cortex of adult mice exposed to a neurotoxic insult, i.e. ketamine administration, in postnatal life. Early celastrol or indomethacin prevented ketamine-induced elevations in cortical ROS production. MDA levels in ketamine-treated mice, also administered with celastrol, were comparable with the control ones. Indomethacin also prevented the increase in lipid peroxidation following early ketamine administration. Whereas no significant differences were detected in SOD1, GSH, and CAT levels between ketamine and saline-administered mice, celastrol elevated the cortical amount of these antioxidant enzymes and the same effect was induced by indomethacin per se. Both celastrol and indomethacin prevented ketamine-induced enhancement in TNF-α and IL-1β levels, however, they had no effects on increased IL-6 amount resulting from ketamine exposure in postnatal life. In conclusion, our data suggest that an early increase in cortical ROS scavenging and reduction of lipid peroxidation, via the enhancement of antioxidant defense, together with inhibition of neuroinflammation, may represent a therapeutic opportunity against psychotic-like disturbances resulting, later in life, from the effects of a neurotoxic insult on the developing brain.</p>

<p>Tauopathies are the most common type of neurodegenerative proteinopathy, being characterized by cytoplasmic aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. The formation and morphologies of these tau inclusions, the distribution of the lesions and related metabolic changes in cytoplasm differ among different tauopathies. The aim of this study was to examine whether there are differences in the post-translational modifications (PTMs) in the pathological tau proteins. We analyzed sarkosyl-insoluble pathological tau proteins prepared from brains of patients with Alzheimer’s disease, Pick’s disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, globular glial tauopathy, and frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonisms linked to chromosome 17 with tau inclusions using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. In pathological tau proteins associated with a wide range of tauopathies, 170 PTMs in total were identified including new PTMs. Among them, common PTMs were localized in the N- and C-terminal flanking regions of the microtubule binding repeats and PTMs, which were considered to be disease-specific, were found in microtubule binding repeats forming filament core. These suggested that the differences in PTMs reflected the differences in tau filament core structures in each disease.</p>

<p>How neurons in the eye feed signals back to photoreceptors to optimize sensitivity to patterns of light appears to be mediated by one or more unconventional mechanisms. Via these mechanisms, horizontal cells control photoreceptor synaptic gain and enhance key aspects of temporal and spatial center-surround receptive field antagonism. After the transduction of light energy into an electrical signal in photoreceptors, the next key task in visual processing is the transmission of an optimized signal to the follower neurons in the retina. For this to happen, the release of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate from photoreceptors is carefully regulated via horizontal cell feedback, which acts as a thermostat to keep the synaptic transmission in an optimal range during changes to light patterns and intensities. Novel findings of a recently described model that casts a classical neurotransmitter system together with ion transport mechanisms to adjust the alkaline milieu outside the synapse are reviewed. This novel inter-neuronal messaging system carries feedback signals using two separate, but interwoven regulated systems. The complex interplay between these two signaling modalities, creating synaptic modulation-at-a-distance, has obscured it’s being defined. The foundations of our understanding of the feedback mechanism from horizontal cells to photoreceptors have been long established: Horizontal cells have broad receptive fields, suitable for providing surround inhibition, their membrane potential, a function of stimulus intensity and size, regulates inhibition of photoreceptor voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, and strong artificial pH buffering eliminates this action. This review compares and contrasts models of how these foundations are linked, focusing on a recent report in mammals that shows tonic horizontal cell release of GABA activating Cl<sup>−</sup> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> permeable GABA autoreceptors. The membrane potential of horizontal cells provides the driving force for GABAR-mediated HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> efflux, alkalinizing the cleft when horizontal cells are hyperpolarized by light or adding to their depolarization in darkness and contributing to cleft acidification via NHE-mediated H<sup>+</sup> efflux. This model challenges interpretations of earlier studies that were considered to rule out a role for GABA in feedback to cones.</p>

<p>Glioblastoma (GBM) is the deadliest brain tumor. Its poor prognosis is due to cell heterogeneity, invasiveness, and high vascularization that impede an efficient therapeutic approach. In the past few years, several molecular links connecting GBM to neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) were identified at preclinical and clinical level. In particular, giving the increasing critical role that epigenetic alterations play in both GBM and NDDs, we deeply analyzed the role of miRNAs, small non-coding RNAs acting epigenetic modulators in several key biological processes. Specific miRNAs, transported by extracellular vesicles (EVs), act as intercellular communication signals in both diseases. In this way, miRNA-loaded EVs modulate GBM tumorigenesis, as they spread oncogenic signaling within brain parenchyma, and control the aggregation of neurotoxic protein (Tau, Aβ-amyloid peptide, and α-synuclein) in NDDs. In this review, we highlight the most promising miRNAs linking GBM and NDDs playing a significant pathogenic role in both diseases.</p>

<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by the progressive degeneration of the motor neurons that innervate muscle, resulting in gradual paralysis and culminating in the inability to breathe or swallow. This neuronal degeneration occurs in a spatiotemporal manner from a point of onset in the central nervous system (CNS), suggesting that there is a molecule that spreads from cell-to-cell. There is strong evidence that the onset and progression of ALS pathology is a consequence of protein misfolding and aggregation. In line with this, a hallmark pathology of ALS is protein deposition and inclusion formation within motor neurons and surrounding glia of the proteins TAR DNA-binding protein 43, superoxide dismutase-1, or fused in sarcoma. Collectively, the observed protein aggregation, in conjunction with the spatiotemporal spread of symptoms, strongly suggests a prion-like propagation of protein aggregation occurs in ALS. In this review, we discuss the role of protein aggregation in ALS concerning protein homeostasis (proteostasis) mechanisms and prion-like propagation. Furthermore, we examine the experimental models used to investigate these processes, including in vitro assays, cultured cells, invertebrate models, and murine models. Finally, we evaluate the therapeutics that may best prevent the onset or spread of pathology in ALS and discuss what lies on the horizon for treating this currently incurable disease.</p>

Background<p>Corticospinal tract impairment is no longer an absolute exclusion in the updated Movement Disorder Society Parkinson’s disease criteria. Triple stimulation technique (TST) is an accurate method to quantitatively assess the integrity and impairment of corticospinal pathway in a variety of neurological diseases. This study aims to evaluate the corticospinal tract impairment in Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients using TST.</p>Methods<p>Ten PD patients, 19 multiple-system atrophy parkinsonian variant (MSA-P) patients, and 12 healthy controls (HC) were sequentially recruited in this study. Information of age, disease duration, pyramidal signs, and Hoehn and Yahr (H&amp;Y) stage was obtained from all patients. The TST was assessed at right abductor digiti minimi for HCs and both sides for patients. The Chi-square test was used for categorical variables, and variance analysis was performed for continuous variables in comparing the difference among PD, MSA-P, and HC, plus the post hoc tests for pairwise comparisons.</p>Results<p>All subjects were age and gender matched. There was no significant difference in disease duration (p = 0.855), H-Y stage (p = 0.067), and the percentage of pyramidal signs present (p = 0.581) between MSA-P and PD patients. The mean TST ratio was 55.5 ± 32.2%, 81.7 ± 19.8%, and 96.8 ± 3.0% for PD, MSA-P, and HCs, correspondingly. PD patients had a significant lower TST amplitude ratio than MSA-P and HCs. The TST ratio of MSA-P was lower than HCs, but there was no significant difference (p = 0.160). Additionally, it was significantly higher in percentage of abnormal TST ratio between PD patients and MSA-P (p = 0.010).</p>Conclusion<p>Corticospinal tract impairment is not a rare manifestation in PD and can be quantitatively evaluated with TST. The result needs to be verified in amplified sample.</p>

<p>The pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD) remains elusive. Current thinking suggests that the activation of microglia and the subsequent release of inflammatory factors, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), are involved in the pathogenesis of PD. P2X4 receptor (P2X4R) is a member of the P2X superfamily of ion channels activated by ATP. To study the possible effect of the ATP-P2X4R signal axis on IL-6 in PD, lentivirus carrying the P2X4R-overexpression gene or empty vector was injected into the substantia nigra (SN) of rats, followed by treatment of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) or saline 1 week later. The research found the relative expression of P2X4R in the 6-OHDA-induced PD rat models was notably higher than that in the normal. And P2X4R overexpression could upregulate the expression of IL-6, reduce the amount of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the SN of PD rats, suggesting that P2X4R may mediate the production of IL-6 to damage DA neurons in the SN. Our data revealed the important role of P2X4R in modulating IL-6, which leads to neuroinflammation involved in PD pathogenesis.</p>

Background<p>The corpus callosum (CC) is an important feature of Parkinson’s disease (PD) not only in motor but also in non-motor functions.

According to their specific callosal–cortical connectivity, 3D CC was divided into five subsections (including prefrontal, premotor, motor, somatosensory, and temporal–parietal–occipital subsection). The fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and volume of whole CC and its subsections were computed and compared between groups. Regression model was constructed to explore the relationships between callosal structure and clinical performance.</p>Results<p>At baseline, PD did not show any significant macro/microstructural difference compared with NC. During disease course, there was a decreased FA and increased MD of whole CC as well as its subsections (except temporal–parietal–occipital subsection), and the volume of motor subsection was decreased. Moreover, the FA of temporal–parietal–occipital subsection and volume of motor subsection were correlated with the mood domain at baseline, and the MD of somatosensory subsection was associated with the motor domain at follow-up.</p>Conclusion<p>The structure of CC and its connectivity-specific subsections remain preserved at a relatively early stage in PD and are progressively disrupted during disease course.

<p>by Zhewei Zhang, Huzi Cheng, Tianming Yang</p>

The brain makes flexible and adaptive responses in a complicated and ever-changing environment for an organism’s survival. To achieve this, the brain needs to understand the contingencies between its sensory inputs, actions, and rewards. This is analogous to the statistical inference that has been extensively studied in the natural language processing field, where recent developments of recurrent neural networks have found many successes. We wonder whether these neural networks, the gated recurrent unit (GRU) networks in particular, reflect how the brain solves the contingency problem. Therefore, we build a GRU network framework inspired by the statistical learning approach of NLP and test it with four exemplar behavior tasks previously used in empirical studies. The network models are trained to predict future events based on past events, both comprising sensory, action, and reward events. We show the networks can successfully reproduce animal and human behavior. The networks generalize the training, perform Bayesian inference in novel conditions, and adapt their choices when event contingencies vary. Importantly, units in the network encode task variables and exhibit activity patterns that match previous neurophysiology findings. Our results suggest that the neural network approach based on statistical sequence learning may reflect the brain’s computational principle underlying flexible and adaptive behaviors and serve as a useful approach to understand the brain.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7aA5WRiolew" width="1" />

<p>by Mario Castro, Rob J. de Boer</p>

Successful mathematical modeling of biological processes relies on the expertise of the modeler to capture the essential mechanisms in the process at hand and on the ability to extract useful information from empirical data. A model is said to be structurally unidentifiable, if different quantitative sets of parameters provide the same observable outcome. This is typical (but not exclusive) of partially observed problems in which only a few variables can be experimentally measured. Most of the available methods to test the structural identifiability of a model are either too complex mathematically for the general practitioner to be applied, or require involved calculations or numerical computation for complex non-linear models. In this work, we present a new analytical method to test structural identifiability of models based on ordinary differential equations, based on the invariance of the equations under the scaling transformation of its parameters. The method is based on rigorous mathematical results but it is easy and quick to apply, even to test the identifiability of sophisticated highly non-linear models. We illustrate our method by example and compare its performance with other existing methods in the literature.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HAYuyv4tK4U" width="1" />

The regulatory noncoding small RNAs (sRNAs) of bacteria are key elements influencing gene expression; however, there has been little evidence that beneficial bacteria use these molecules to communicate with their animal hosts. We report here that the bacterial sRNA SsrA plays an essential role in the light-organ symbiosis between <i>Vibrio fischeri</i> and the squid <i>Euprymna scolopes</i>. The symbionts load SsrA into outer membrane vesicles, which are transported specifically into the epithelial cells surrounding the symbiont population in the light organ. Although an SsrA-deletion mutant (Δ<i>ssrA</i>) colonized the host to a normal level after 24 h, it produced only 2/10 the luminescence per bacterium, and its persistence began to decline by 48 h. The host’s response to colonization by the Δ<i>ssrA</i> strain was also abnormal: the epithelial cells underwent premature swelling, and host robustness was reduced. Most notably, when colonized by the Δ<i>ssrA</i> strain, the light organ differentially up-regulated 10 genes, including several encoding heightened immune-function or antimicrobial activities. This study reveals the potential for a bacterial symbiont’s sRNAs not only to control its own activities but also to trigger critical responses promoting homeostasis in its host. In the absence of this communication, there are dramatic fitness consequences for both partners.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Ky-s1sD_AiM" width="1" />

Experiences are represented in the brain by patterns of neuronal activity. Ensembles of neurons representing experience undergo activity-dependent plasticity and are important for learning and recall. They are thus considered cellular engrams of memory. Yet, the cellular events that bias neurons to become part of a neuronal representation are largely unknown. In rodents, turnover of structural connectivity has been proposed to underlie the turnover of neuronal representations and also to be a cellular mechanism defining the time duration for which memories are stored in the hippocampus. If these hypotheses are true, structural dynamics of connectivity should be involved in the formation of neuronal representations and concurrently important for learning and recall. To tackle these questions, we used deep-brain 2-photon (2P) time-lapse imaging in transgenic mice in which neurons expressing the Immediate Early Gene (IEG) <i>Arc</i> (activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein) could be permanently labeled during a specific time window. This enabled us to investigate the dynamics of excitatory synaptic connectivity—using dendritic spines as proxies—of hippocampal CA1 (cornu ammonis 1) pyramidal neurons (PNs) becoming part of neuronal representations exploiting <i>Arc</i> as an indicator of being part of neuronal representations. We discovered that neurons that will prospectively express <i>Arc</i> have slower turnover of synaptic connectivity, thus suggesting that synaptic stability prior to experience can bias neurons to become part of representations or possibly engrams. We also found a negative correlation between stability of structural synaptic connectivity and the ability to recall features of a hippocampal-dependent memory, which suggests that faster structural turnover in hippocampal CA1 might be functional for memory.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/0J66rjU2rN0" width="1" />

During active tactile exploration, the dynamic patterns of touch are transduced to electrical signals and transformed by the brain into a mental representation of the object under investigation. This transformation from sensation to perception is thought to be a major function of the mammalian cortex. In primary somatosensory cortex (S1) of mice, layer 5 (L5) pyramidal neurons are major outputs to downstream areas that influence perception, decision-making, and motor control. We investigated self-motion and touch representations in L5 of S1 with juxtacellular loose-seal patch recordings of optogenetically identified excitatory neurons. We found that during rhythmic whisker movement, 54 of 115 active neurons (47%) represented self-motion. This population was significantly more modulated by whisker angle than by phase. Upon active touch, a distinct pattern of activity was evoked across L5, which represented the whisker angle at the time of touch. Object location was decodable with submillimeter precision from the touch-evoked spike counts of a randomly sampled handful of these neurons. These representations of whisker angle during self-motion and touch were independent, both in the selection of which neurons were active and in the angle-tuning preference of coactive neurons. Thus, the output of S1 transiently shifts from a representation of self-motion to an independent representation of explored object location during active touch.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/8D57Lxj_qPU" width="1" />

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To assess whether cerebral small vessel disease CT biomarkers are associated with long‐term outcome after intracerebral hemorrhage.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a prospective, community‐based cohort study of adults diagnosed with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage between 1<sup>st</sup> June 2010 – 31<sup>st</sup> May 2013. A neuroradiologist rated the diagnostic brain CT for acute intracerebral hemorrhage features and small vessel disease biomarkers. We used severity of white matter lucencies and cerebral atrophy, and the number of lacunes to calculate the CT SVD score. We assessed the association between CT small vessel disease biomarkers and either death or death or dependence (modified Rankin scale scores 4‐6) one year after first‐ever intracerebral hemorrhage using logistic regression, adjusting for known predictors of outcome.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Within one year of intracerebral hemorrhage, 224 (56%) of 402 patients died. In separate models, one‐year death was associated with severe atrophy (aOR 2.54, 95%CI 1.44‐4.49, p=0.001) but not lacunes or severe white matter lucencies, and CT SVD sum score ≥1 (aOR 2.50, 95%CI 1.40‐4.45, p=0.002). Two hundred and seventy‐seven (73%) of 378 patients with modified Rankin scale data were dead or dependent at one year. In separate models, one‐year death or dependence was associated with severe atrophy (aOR 3.67, 95%CI 1.71‐7.89, p=0.001) and severe white matter lucencies (aOR 2.18, 95%CI 1.06‐4.51, p=0.035) but not lacunes, and CT SVD sum score ≥1 (aOR 2.81, 95%CI 1.45‐5.46, p=0.002).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Small vessel disease biomarkers on the diagnostic brain CT are associated with one‐year death and dependence after intracerebral hemorrhage, independent of known predictors of outcome.</p>

<p>Neurons derived from patient induced pluripotent stem cells harboring ACTL6B p.(Val421_Cys425del) variant display reduced expression and stability of ACTL6B protein and increased spontaneous neuronal activity <i>in vitro</i>.</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>ACTL6B is a component of the neuronal BRG1/brm‐associated factor (nBAF) complex, which is required for chromatin remodeling in postmitotic neurons. We recently reported biallelic pathogenic variants in <i>ACTL6B</i> in patients diagnosed with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy, subtype 76 (EIEE‐76), presenting with severe, global developmental delay, epileptic encephalopathy, cerebral atrophy, and abnormal central nervous system myelination. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying their phenotype is unknown. Here, we investigate the molecular pathogenesis of ACTL6B p.(Val421_Cys425del) using <i>in silico</i> 3D protein modeling predictions and patient‐specific induced pluripotent stem cell‐derived neurons. We found neurons derived from EIEE‐76 patients showed impaired accumulation of ACTL6B compared to unaffected relatives, caused by reduced protein stability. Furthermore, EIEE‐76 patient‐derived neurons had dysregulated nBAF target gene expression, including genes important for neuronal development and disease. Multielectrode array system analysis unveiled elevated electrophysiological activity of EIEE‐76 patients‐derived neurons, consistent with the patient phenotype. Taken together, our findings validate a new model for EIEE‐76 and reveal how reduced ACTL6B expression affects neuronal function.</p>

<p>The ventral tegmental area (VTA) underlies motivation and reinforcement of natural rewards. The lateral preoptic area (LPO) is an anterior hypothalamic brain region that sends direct projections to the VTA and to other brain structures known to regulate VTA activity. Here, we investigated the functional connection between the LPO and subpopulations of VTA neurons and explored the reinforcing and valence qualities of the LPO in rats. We found that the LPO and the LPO→VTA pathway inhibit the activity of VTA GABA neurons and have mixed effects on VTA dopamine neurons. Furthermore, we found that the LPO supports operant responding but drives avoidance, and we explored the apparent discrepancy between these two results. Finally, using fiber photometry, we show that the LPO signals aversive events but not rewarding events. Together, our findings demonstrate that the LPO modulates the activity of the VTA and drives motivated behavior and represents an overlooked modulator of reinforcement.</p>

<p>Aging is associated with subjective memory complaints. Approximately half of those with subjective memory complaints have objective cognitive impairment. Previous studies have provided evidence of an association between genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and dementia progression. Also, aging is a significant risk factor for vascular pathology that may underlie at least some of the cognitive changes. This study investigates the relative contribution of subjective cognitive complaints (SCC), vascular function, and genetic risk for dementia in predicting objective cognitive performance. Multiple regression and relative importance analysis were used to investigate the relative contribution of vascular function, self-reported SCC, and dementia genetic risk, in predicting objective cognition in a sample of 238 healthy community-dwelling older adults. Age, sex, premorbid cognitive abilities, subjective verbal memory complaints, higher cerebrovascular blood flow during submaximal exercise, and certain dementia risk alleles were significant predictors of worse objective verbal memory performance (p &lt; 0.001, R<sup>2</sup> = 35.2–36.4%). Using relative importance analysis, subjective verbal memory complaints, and certain dementia risk alleles contributed more variance than cerebrovascular measures. These results suggest that age-related changes in memory in healthy older adults can be predicted by subjective memory complaints, genetic risk, and to a lesser extent, cerebrovascular function.</p>

Objective<p>Freezing of gait (FOG) is a common disabling motor symptom in Parkinson’s disease (PD), but the potential pathogenic mechanisms are still unclear.</p>Methods<p>A total of 22 patients with PD with FOG (PD-FOG), 28 patients with PD without FOG (PD-nFOG), and 33 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited in this study. Degree centrality (DC)—a graph theory-based measurement of global connectivity at the voxel level by measuring the number of instantaneous functional connections between one region and the rest of the brain—can map brain hubs with high sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility. DC was used to explore alterations in the centrality of PD-FOG correlated with brain node levels. PD-FOG cognitive network dysfunction was further revealed via a seed-based functional connectivity (FC) analysis. In addition, correlation analyses were carried out between clinical symptoms and acquired connectivity measurement.</p>Results<p>Compared to the PD-nFOG group, the PD-FOG group showed remarkably increased DC values in the right middle frontal gyrus (RMFG). There were no significant differences in other gray matter regions. Importantly, the clinical severity of FOG was related to the mean DC values in the RMFG. This brain region served as a seed in secondary seed-based FC analysis, and we further found FC changes in the right precuneus, right inferior frontal gyrus, right superior frontal gyrus (SFG), and cerebellum.</p>Conclusion<p>Increased RMFG activity and FC network alterations in the middle frontal cortex with the precuneus, inferior, and SFG, and the cerebellum may have great potential in brain dysfunction in PD with FOG.</p>

<p>Photoreceptor death contributes to 50% of irreversible vision loss in the western world. Pro23His (P23H) transgenic albino rat strains are widely used models for the most common rhodopsin gene mutation associated with the autosomal dominant form of retinitis pigmentosa. However, the mechanism(s) by which photoreceptor death occurs are not well understood and were the principal aim of this study. We first used electroretinogram recording and optical coherence tomography to confirm the time course of functional and structural loss. Electroretinogram analyses revealed significantly decreased rod photoreceptor (a-wave), bipolar cell (b-wave) and amacrine cell responses (oscillatory potentials) from P30 onward. The cone-mediated b-wave was also decreased from P30. TUNEL analysis showed extensive cell death at P18, with continued labeling detected until P30. Focused gene expression arrays indicated activation of, apoptosis, autophagy and necroptosis in whole retina from P14-18. However, analysis of mitochondrial permeability changes (ΔΨm) using JC-1 dye, combined with immunofluorescence markers for caspase-dependent (cleaved caspase-3) and caspase-independent (AIF) cell death pathways, indicated mitochondrial-mediated cell death was not a major contributor to photoreceptor death. By contrast, reverse-phase protein array data combined with RIPK3 and phospho-MLKL immunofluorescence indicated widespread necroptosis as the predominant mechanism of photoreceptor death. These findings highlight the complexity of mechanisms involved in photoreceptor death in the Pro23His rat model of degeneration and suggest therapies that target necroptosis should be considered for their potential to reduce photoreceptor death.</p>

<p>The retrosplenial cortex forms part of the cingulate cortex and is involved in memory and navigation. It is ventral region, the granular retrosplenial cortex, or GRSC is characterized by the presence, of small pyramidal neurons with a distinctive late-spiking (LS) firing pattern in layer 2/3. Using in vitro brain slices of the mouse GRSC we have studied the electrophysiological properties and synaptic responses of these LS neurons, comparing them with neighboring non-LS pyramidal neurons. LS and non-LS neurons showed different responses during cortical propagation of epileptiform discharges. All non-LS neurons generated large supra-threshold excitatory responses that generated bursts of action potentials. Contrastingly, the LS neurons showed small, and invariably subthreshold excitatory synaptic potentials. Although both types of pyramidal neurons were readily intermingled in the GRSC, we observed differences in their innervation by cortico-cortical axons. The application of glutamate to activate cortical neurons evoked synaptic responses in LS neurons only when applied at less than 250 μm, while in non-LS neurons we found synaptic responses when glutamate was applied at larger distances. Analysis of the synaptic responses evoked by long-range cortico-cortical axons (with the origin at 1200 μm from the recorded neurons or in the contralateral hemisphere) confirmed that non-LS neurons were strongly innervated by these axons, while they evoked only small responses or no response at all in the LS neurons (contralateral stimulation, non-LS: 194.0 ± 196.63 pA, n = 22; LS: 51.91 ± 35.26 pA, n = 10; p = 0.004). The excitatory/inhibitory balance was similar in both types of pyramidal neurons, but the latency of the EPSCs evoked by long-range cortico-cortical axons was longer in LS neurons (contralateral stimulation non-LS: 8.13 ± 1.23 ms, n = 17; LS: 10.76 ± 1.58 ms, n = 7; p = 0.004) suggesting a disynaptic mechanism. Our findings highlight the differential cortico-cortical axonal innervation of LS and non-LS pyramidal neurons, and that the two types of neurons are incorporated in different cortico-cortical neuronal circuits. This strongly suggests that the functional organization of the dorsal part of the GRSC is based on independent cortico-cortical circuits (among other elements).</p>

<p>The current study investigates the neurotrophic effects of Clostridium botulinum C3 transferase (C3bot) on highly purified, glia-free, GABAergic, and glutamatergic neurons. Incubation with nanomolar concentrations of C3bot promotes dendrite formation as well as dendritic and axonal outgrowth in rat GABAergic neurons. A comparison of C3bot effects on sorted mouse GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons obtained from newly established NexCre;Ai9xVGAT Venus mice revealed a higher sensitivity of GABAergic cells to axonotrophic and dendritic effects of C3bot in terms of process length and branch formation. Protein biochemical analysis of known C3bot binding partners revealed comparable amounts of β1 integrin in both cell types but a higher expression of vimentin in GABAergic neurons. Accordingly, binding of C3bot to GABAergic neurons was stronger than binding to glutamatergic neurons. A combinatory treatment of glutamatergic neurons with C3bot and vimentin raised the amount of bound C3bot to levels comparable to the ones in GABAergic neurons, thereby confirming the specificity of effects. Overall, different surface vimentin levels between GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons exist that mediate neurotrophic C3bot effects.</p>

<p>Non-evoked miniature release of neurotransmitters is increasingly recognized as playing an important role in neural function and is implicated in synaptic plasticity, metaplasticity, and homeostasis. Spontaneous miniature release events (minis) are usually measured electrophysiologically by recording the miniature postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) that they evoke. However, this indirect technique can be confounded by changes within the postsynaptic neuron. Here, using the fluorescent probe SynaptopHluorin 2×, we have developed an optical method for the measurement of minis that enables direct assessment of release events. We use the technique to reveal that the frequency of minis following incubation of hippocampal neurons with Amyloid β oligomers (Aβo) is increased. Electrophysiological mEPSC recordings obtained under the same conditions report a decrease in frequency, with the discrepancy likely due to Aβo-induced changes in quantal size. Optical quantal analysis of minis may therefore have a role in the study of minis in both normal physiology and disease, as it can circumvent potential confounds caused by postsynaptic changes.</p>

<p>The effective management and therapies for Parkinson’s disease (PD) require appropriate clinical evaluation. The Parkinson’s KinetiGraph (PKG) is a wearable sensor system that can monitor the motion characteristics of PD objectively and continuously. This study was aimed to assess the correlations between PKG data and clinical scores of bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, and fluctuation. It also aims to explore the application value of identifying early motor symptoms. An observational study of 100 PD patients wearing the PKG for ≥ 6 days was performed. It provides a series of data, such as the bradykinesia score (BKS), percent time tremor (PTT), dyskinesia score (DKS), and fluctuation and dyskinesia score (FDS). PKG data and UPDRS scores were analyzed, including UPDRS III total scores, UPDRS III-bradykinesia scores (UPDRS III-B: items 23–26, 31), UPDRS III-rigidity scores (UPDRS III-R: item 22), and scores from the Wearing-off Questionnaire (WOQ-9). This study shows that there was significant correlation between BKS and UPDRS III scores, including UPDRS III total scores, UPDRS III-B, and UPDRS III-R scores (r = 0.479–0.588, p ≤ 0.001), especially in the early-stage group (r = 0.682, p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, we found that BKS in patients with left-sided onset (33.57 ± 5.14, n = 37) is more serious than in patients with right-sided onset (29.87 ± 6.86, n = 26). Our findings support the feasibility of using the PKG to detect abnormal movements, especially bradykinesia in PD. It is suitable for the early detection, remote monitoring, and timely treatment of PD symptoms.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most common forms of dementia, marked by progressively degrading cognitive function. Although cerebellar changes occur throughout AD progression, its involvement and predictive contribution in its earliest stages, as well as gray or white matter components involved, remains unclear. We used MRI machine learning-based classification to assess the contribution of two tissue components [volume fraction myelin (VFM), and gray matter (GM) volume] within the whole brain, the neocortex, the whole cerebellum as well as its anterior and posterior parts and their predictive contribution to the first two stages of AD and typically aging controls. While classification accuracy increased with AD stages, VFM was the best predictor for all early stages of dementia when compared with typically aging controls. However, we document overall higher cerebellar prediction accuracy when compared to the whole brain with distinct structural signatures of higher anterior cerebellar contribution to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and higher posterior cerebellar contribution to mild/moderate stages of AD for each tissue property. Based on these different cerebellar profiles and their unique contribution to early disease stages, we propose a refined model of cerebellar contribution to early AD development.</p>

<p>by Anahita Bayani, Joanne L. Dunster, Jonathan J. Crofts, Martin R. Nelson</p>

Many common medical conditions (such as cancer, arthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and others) are associated with inflammation, and even more so when combined with the effects of ageing and multimorbidity. While the inflammatory response varies in different tissue types, under disease and in response to therapeutic interventions, it has common interactions that occur between immune cells and inflammatory mediators. Understanding these underlying inflammatory mechanisms is key in progressing treatments and therapies for numerous inflammatory conditions. It is now considered that constituent mechanisms of the inflammatory response can be actively manipulated in order to drive resolution of inflammatory damage; particularly, those mechanisms related to the pro-inflammatory role of neutrophils and the anti-inflammatory role of macrophages. In this article, we describe the assembly of a hybrid mathematical model in which the spatial spread of inflammatory mediators is described through partial differential equations, and immune cells (neutrophils and macrophages) are described individually via an agent-based modelling approach. We pay close attention to how immune cells chemotax toward pro-inflammatory mediators, presenting a model for cell chemotaxis that is calibrated against experimentally observed cell trajectories in healthy and COPD-affected scenarios. We illustrate how variations in key model parameters can drive the switch from resolution of inflammation to chronic outcomes, and show that aberrant neutrophil chemotaxis can move an otherwise healthy outcome to one of chronicity. Finally, we reflect on our results in the context of the on-going hunt for new therapeutic interventions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/53zyQmYx9RA" width="1" />

Cytochrome P450 2D6 (<i>CYP2D6</i>) is a highly polymorphic gene whose protein product metabolizes more than 20% of clinically used drugs. Genetic variations in <i>CYP2D6</i> are responsible for interindividual heterogeneity in drug response that can lead to drug toxicity and ineffective treatment, making <i>CYP2D6</i> one of the most important pharmacogenes. Prediction of CYP2D6 phenotype relies on curation of literature-derived functional studies to assign a functional status to <i>CYP2D6</i> haplotypes. As the number of large-scale sequencing efforts grows, new haplotypes continue to be discovered, and assignment of function is challenging to maintain. To address this challenge, we have trained a convolutional neural network to predict functional status of <i>CYP2D6</i> haplotypes, called Hubble.2D6. Hubble.2D6 predicts haplotype function from sequence data and was trained using two pre-training steps with a combination of real and simulated data. We find that Hubble.2D6 predicts <i>CYP2D6</i> haplotype functional status with 88% accuracy in a held-out test set and explains 47.5% of the variance in <i>in vitro</i> functional data among star alleles with unknown function. Hubble.2D6 may be a useful tool for assigning function to haplotypes with uncurated function, and used for screening individuals who are at risk of being poor metabolizers.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Luls_obX_7o" width="1" />

<p>by Román Zapién-Campos, Michael Sieber, Arne Traulsen</p>

Macroorganisms are inhabited by microbial communities that often change through the lifespan of an individual. One of the factors contributing to this change is colonization from the environment. The colonization of initially microbe-free hosts is particularly interesting, as their microbiome depends entirely on microbes of external origin. We present a mathematical model of this process with a particular emphasis on the effect of ecological drift and a finite host lifespan. Our results indicate the host lifespan becomes especially relevant for short-living organisms (e.g. <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, and <i>Danio rerio</i>). In this case, alternative microbiome states (often called enterotypes), the coexistence of microbe-free and colonized hosts, and a reduced probability of colonization can be observed in our model. These results unify multiple reported observations around colonization and suggest that no selective or deterministic drivers are necessary to explain them.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tutDqAxOPYY" width="1" />

Using mRNA sequencing and de novo transcriptome assembly, we identified, cloned, and characterized 9 previously undiscovered fluorescent protein (FP) homologs from <i>Aequorea victoria</i> and a related <i>Aequorea</i> species, with most sequences highly divergent from <i>A</i>. <i>victoria</i> green fluorescent protein (avGFP). Among these FPs are the brightest green fluorescent protein (GFP) homolog yet characterized and a reversibly photochromic FP that responds to UV and blue light. Beyond green emitters, <i>Aequorea</i> species express purple- and blue-pigmented chromoproteins (CPs) with absorbances ranging from green to far-red, including 2 that are photoconvertible. X-ray crystallography revealed that <i>Aequorea</i> CPs contain a chemically novel chromophore with an unexpected crosslink to the main polypeptide chain. Because of the unique attributes of several of these newly discovered FPs, we expect that <i>Aequorea</i> will, once again, give rise to an entirely new generation of useful probes for bioimaging and biosensing.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/8dUh_jGbLL4" width="1" />

<p>by Abdalla Akef, Kathy McGraw, Steven D. Cappell, Daniel R. Larson</p>

U2 Small Nuclear RNA Auxiliary Factor 1 (U2AF1) forms a heterodimeric complex with U2AF2 that is primarily responsible for 3ʹ splice site selection. U2AF1 mutations have been identified in most cancers but are prevalent in Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), and the most common mutation is a missense substitution of serine-34 to phenylalanine (S34F). The U2AF heterodimer also has a noncanonical function as a translational regulator. Here, we report that the U2AF1-S34F mutation results in specific misregulation of the translation initiation and ribosome biogenesis machinery. The net result is an increase in mRNA translation at the single-cell level. Among the translationally up-regulated targets of U2AF1-S34F is Nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1), which is a major driver of myeloid malignancy. Depletion of NPM1 impairs the viability of the U2AF1-S34F mutant cells and causes ribosomal RNA (rRNA) processing defects, thus indicating an unanticipated synthetic interaction between U2AF1, NPM1, and ribosome biogenesis. Our results establish a unique molecular phenotype for the U2AF1 mutation that recapitulates translational misregulation in myeloid disease.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/4lfV0dZva7M" width="1" />
