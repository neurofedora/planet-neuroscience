              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19772">External light schedules can induce nighttime sleep disruptions in a Homeostat-Circadian-Light Model for sleep in young children</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.19772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sleep disturbances, particularly nighttime waking, are highly prevalent in young children and can significantly disrupt not only the child's well-being but also family functioning. Behavioral and environmental strategies, including the regulation of light exposure, are typically recommended treatments for nighttime waking. Using the Homeostatic-Circadian-Light (HCL) mathematical model for sleep timing based on the interaction of the circadian rhythm, the homeostatic sleep drive and external light, we analyze how external light schedules can influence the occurrence of nighttime waking in young children. We fit the model to data for sleep homeostasis and sleep behavior in 2 - 3.5 year olds and identified subsets of parameter ranges that fit the data but indicated a susceptibility to nighttime waking. This suggests that as children develop they may exhibit more or less propensity to awaken during the night. Notably, parameter sets exhibiting earlier sleep timing were more susceptible to nighttime waking. For a model parameter set susceptible to, but not exhibiting, nighttime waking, we analyze how external light schedules affect sleep patterns. We find that low daytime light levels can induce nighttime sleep disruptions and extended bright-light exposure also promotes nighttime waking. Further results suggest that consistent daily routines are essential; irregular schedules, particularly during weekends, markedly worsen the consolidation of nighttime sleep. Specifically, weekend delays in morning lights-on and evening lights-off times result in nighttime sleep disruptions and can influence sleep timing during the week. These results highlight how external light, daily rhythms, and parenting routines interact to shape childrens' sleep health, providing a useful framework for improving sleep management practices.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19944">Attractive and Repulsive Perceptual Biases Naturally Emerge in Generative Adversarial Inference</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.19944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human perceptual estimates exhibit a striking reversal in bias depending on uncertainty: they shift toward prior expectations under high sensory uncertainty, but away from them when internal noise is dominant. While Bayesian inference combined with efficient coding can explain this dual bias, existing models rely on handcrafted priors or fixed encoders, offering no account of how such representations and inferences could emerge through learning. We introduce a Generative Adversarial Inference (GAI) network that simultaneously learns sensory representations and inference strategies directly from data, without assuming explicit likelihoods or priors. Through joint reconstruction and adversarial training, the model learns a representation that approximates an efficient code consistent with information-theoretic predictions. Trained on Gabor stimuli with varying signal-to-noise ratios, GAI spontaneously reproduces the full transition from prior attraction to repulsion, and recovers the Fisher information profile predicted by efficient coding theory. It also captures the characteristic bias reversal observed in human perception more robustly than supervised or variational alternatives. These results show that a single adversarially trained network can jointly acquire an efficient sensory code and support Bayesian-consistent behavior, providing a neurally plausible, end-to-end account of perceptual bias that unifies normative theory and deep learning.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20205">Signed Higher-Order Interactions for Brain Disorder Diagnosis via Multi-Channel Transformers</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.20205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately characterizing higher-order interactions of brain regions and extracting interpretable organizational patterns from Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging data is crucial for brain disease diagnosis. Current graph-based deep learning models primarily focus on pairwise or triadic patterns while neglecting signed higher-order interactions, limiting comprehensive understanding of brain-wide communication. We propose HOI-Brain, a novel computational framework leveraging signed higher-order interactions and organizational patterns in fMRI data for brain disease diagnosis. First, we introduce a co-fluctuation measure based on Multiplication of Temporal Derivatives to detect higher-order interactions with temporal resolution. We then distinguish positive and negative synergistic interactions, encoding them in signed weighted simplicial complexes to reveal brain communication insights. Using Persistent Homology theory, we apply two filtration processes to these complexes to extract signed higher-dimensional neural organizations spatiotemporally. Finally, we propose a multi-channel brain Transformer to integrate heterogeneous topological features. Experiments on Alzheimer' s disease, Parkinson' s syndrome, and autism spectrum disorder datasets demonstrate our framework' s superiority, effectiveness, and interpretability. The identified key brain regions and higher-order patterns align with neuroscience literature, providing meaningful biological insights.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20601">Comparing and Scaling fMRI Features for Brain-Behavior Prediction</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.20601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting behavioral variables from neuroimaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has the potential to allow the development of neuroimaging biomarkers of mental and neurological disorders. A crucial processing step to this aim is the extraction of suitable features. These can differ in how well they predict the target of interest, and how this prediction scales with sample size and scan time. Here, we compare nine feature subtypes extracted from resting-state functional MRI recordings for behavior prediction, ranging from regional measures of functional activity to functional connectivity (FC) and metrics derived with graph signal processing (GSP), a principled approach for the extraction of structure-informed functional features. We study 979 subjects from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset, predicting summary scores for mental health, cognition, processing speed, and substance use, as well as age and sex. The scaling properties of the features are investigated for different combinations of sample size and scan time. FC comes out as the best feature for predicting cognition, age, and sex. Graph power spectral density is the second best for predicting cognition and age, while for sex, variability-based features show potential as well. When predicting sex, the low-pass graph filtered coupled FC slightly outperforms the simple FC variant. None of the other targets were predicted significantly. The scaling results point to higher performance reserves for the better-performing features. They also indicate that it is important to balance sample size and scan time when acquiring data for prediction studies. The results confirm FC as a robust feature for behavior prediction, but also show the potential of GSP and variability-based measures. We discuss the implications for future prediction studies in terms of strategies for acquisition and sample composition.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19956">Predicting Brain Responses To Natural Movies With Multimodal LLMs</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.19956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present MedARC's team solution to the Algonauts 2025 challenge. Our pipeline leveraged rich multimodal representations from various state-of-the-art pretrained models across video (V-JEPA2), speech (Whisper), text (Llama 3.2), vision-text (InternVL3), and vision-text-audio (Qwen2.5-Omni). These features extracted from the models were linearly projected to a latent space, temporally aligned to the fMRI time series, and finally mapped to cortical parcels through a lightweight encoder comprising a shared group head plus subject-specific residual heads. We trained hundreds of model variants across hyperparameter settings, validated them on held-out movies and assembled ensembles targeted to each parcel in each subject. Our final submission achieved a mean Pearson's correlation of 0.2085 on the test split of withheld out-of-distribution movies, placing our team in fourth place for the competition. We further discuss a last-minute optimization that would have raised us to second place. Our results highlight how combining features from models trained in different modalities, using a simple architecture consisting of shared-subject and single-subject components, and conducting comprehensive model selection and ensembling improves generalization of encoding models to novel movie stimuli. All code is available on GitHub.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20189">NeuroCLIP: A Multimodal Contrastive Learning Method for rTMS-treated Methamphetamine Addiction Analysis</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.20189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Methamphetamine dependence poses a significant global health challenge, yet its assessment and the evaluation of treatments like repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) frequently depend on subjective self-reports, which may introduce uncertainties. While objective neuroimaging modalities such as electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) offer alternatives, their individual limitations and the reliance on conventional, often hand-crafted, feature extraction can compromise the reliability of derived biomarkers. To overcome these limitations, we propose NeuroCLIP, a novel deep learning framework integrating simultaneously recorded EEG and fNIRS data through a progressive learning strategy. This approach offers a robust and trustworthy biomarker for methamphetamine addiction. Validation experiments show that NeuroCLIP significantly improves discriminative capabilities among the methamphetamine-dependent individuals and healthy controls compared to models using either EEG or only fNIRS alone. Furthermore, the proposed framework facilitates objective, brain-based evaluation of rTMS treatment efficacy, demonstrating measurable shifts in neural patterns towards healthy control profiles after treatment. Critically, we establish the trustworthiness of the multimodal data-driven biomarker by showing its strong correlation with psychometrically validated craving scores. These findings suggest that biomarker derived from EEG-fNIRS data via NeuroCLIP offers enhanced robustness and reliability over single-modality approaches, providing a valuable tool for addiction neuroscience research and potentially improving clinical assessments.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21016">Predicting Cognition from fMRI:A Comparative Study of Graph, Transformer, and Kernel Models Across Task and Rest Conditions</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.21016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting cognition from neuroimaging data in healthy individuals offers insights into the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive abilities, with potential applications in precision medicine and early detection of neurological and psychiatric conditions. This study systematically benchmarked classical machine learning (Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR)) and advanced deep learning (DL) models (Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Transformer-GNN (TGNN)) for cognitive prediction using Resting-state (RS), Working Memory, and Language task fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset.
  Our results, based on R2 scores, Pearson correlation coefficient, and mean absolute error, revealed that task-based fMRI, eliciting neural responses directly tied to cognition, outperformed RS fMRI in predicting cognitive behavior. Among the methods compared, a GNN combining structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) consistently achieved the highest performance across all fMRI modalities; however, its advantage over KRR using FC alone was not statistically significant. The TGNN, designed to model temporal dynamics with SC as a prior, performed competitively with FC-based approaches for task-fMRI but struggled with RS data, where its performance aligned with the lower-performing GNN that directly used fMRI time-series data as node features. These findings emphasize the importance of selecting appropriate model architectures and feature representations to fully leverage the spatial and temporal richness of neuroimaging data.
  This study highlights the potential of multimodal graph-aware DL models to combine SC and FC for cognitive prediction, as well as the promise of Transformer-based approaches for capturing temporal dynamics. By providing a comprehensive comparison of models, this work serves as a guide for advancing brain-behavior modeling using fMRI, SC and DL.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06500">Advantageous and disadvantageous inequality aversion can be taught through vicarious learning of others' preferences</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2405.06500v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While enforcing egalitarian social norms is critical for human society, punishing social norm violators often incurs a cost to the self. This cost looms even larger when one can benefit from an unequal distribution of resources (i.e. advantageous inequity), as in receiving a higher salary than a colleague with the identical role. In the Ultimatum Game, a classic test bed for fairness norm enforcement, individuals rarely reject (punish) such unequal proposed divisions of resources because doing so entails a sacrifice of one's own benefit. Recent work has demonstrated that observing another's punitive responses to unfairness can efficiently alter the punitive preferences of an observer. It remains an open question, however, whether such contagion is powerful enough to impart advantageous inequity aversion to individuals. Using a variant of the Ultimatum Game in which participants are tasked with responding to fairness violations on behalf of another 'Teacher' - whose aversion to advantageous (versus disadvantageous) inequity was systematically manipulated-we probe whether individuals subsequently increase their punishment unfair after experiencing fairness violations on their own behalf. In two experiments, we found individuals can acquire aversion to advantageous inequity 'vicariously' through observing (and implementing) the Teacher's preferences. Computationally, these learning effects were best characterized by a model which learns the latent structure of the Teacher's preferences, rather than a simple Reinforcement Learning account. In summary, our study is the first to demonstrate that people can swiftly and readily acquire another's preferences for advantageous inequity, suggesting in turn that behavioral contagion may be one promising mechanism through which social norm enforcement - which people rarely implement in the case of advantageous inequality - can be enhanced.

                arXiv:2506.06191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hypothalamus plays an important role in the regulation of the bodys metabolic state and behaviors related to survival. Despite its importance however, many questions exist regarding the intrinsic and extrinsic connections of the hypothalamus in humans, especially its relationship with the cortex. As a heterogeneous structure, it is possible that the hypothalamus is composed of different subregions, which have their own distinct relationships with the cortex. Previous work on functional connectivity in the human hypothalamus have either treated it as a unitary structure or relied on methodological approaches that are limited in modeling its intrinsic functional architecture. Here, we used resting state data from ultrahigh field 7 Tesla fMRI and a data driven analytical approach to identify functional subregions of the human hypothalamus. Our approach identified four functional hypothalamic subregions based on intrinsic functional connectivity, which in turn showed distinct patterns of functional connectivity with cortex. Overall, all hypothalamic subregions showed stronger connectivity with a cortical network, Cortical Network 1 composed primarily of frontal, midline, and limbic cortical areas and weaker connectivity with a second cortical network composed largely of posterior sensorimotor regions, Cortical Network 2. Of the hypothalamic subregions, the anterior hypothalamus showed the strongest connection to Cortical Network 1, while a more ventral subregion containing the anterior hypothalamus extending to the tuberal region showed the weakest connectivity. The findings support the use of ultrahigh field, high resolution imaging in providing a more incisive investigation of the human hypothalamus that respects its complex internal structure and extrinsic functional architecture.

Abstract: Biostasis has the potential to extend human lives by offering a bridge to powerful life extension technologies that may be developed in the future. However, key questions in the field remain unresolved, including which biomarkers reliably indicate successful preservation, what technical obstacles pose the greatest barriers, and whether different proposed revival methods are theoretically feasible. To address these gaps, we conducted a collaborative forecasting exercise with 22 practitioners in biostasis, including individuals with expertise in neuroscience, cryobiology, and clinical care. Our results reveal substantial consensus in some areas, for example that synaptic connectivity can serve as a reliable surrogate biomarker for information preservation quality. Practitioners identified three most likely failure modes in contemporary biostasis: inadequate preservation quality even under ideal conditions, geographic barriers preventing timely preservation, and poor procedural execution. Regarding revival strategies, most respondents believe that provably reversible cryopreservation of whole mammalian organisms is most likely decades away, with provably reversible human cryopreservation expected even later, if it is ever achieved. Among revival strategies from contemporary preservation methods, whole brain emulation was considered the most likely to be developed first, though respondents were divided on the metaphysical question of whether it could constitute genuine revival. Molecular nanotechnology was viewed as nearly as likely to be technically feasible, and compatible with both pure cryopreservation and aldehyde-based methods. Taken together, these findings delineate current barriers to high-quality preservation, identify future research priorities, and provide baseline estimates for key areas of uncertainty.

                arXiv:2507.16674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Transformer architectures have revolutionized most fields of artificial intelligence, relying on an attentional mechanism based on the agreement between keys and queries to select and route information in the network. In previous work, we introduced a novel, brain-inspired architecture that leverages a similar implementation to achieve a global 'routing by agreement' mechanism. Such a system modulates the network's activity by matching each neuron's key with a single global query, pooled across the entire network. Acting as a global attentional system, this mechanism improves noise robustness over baseline levels but is insufficient for multi-classification tasks. Here, we improve on this work by proposing a novel mechanism that combines aspects of the Transformer attentional operations with a compelling neuroscience theory, namely, binding by synchrony. This theory proposes that the brain binds together features by synchronizing the temporal activity of neurons encoding those features. This allows the binding of features from the same object while efficiently disentangling those from distinct objects. We drew inspiration from this theory and incorporated angular phases into all layers of a convolutional network. After achieving phase alignment via Kuramoto dynamics, we use this approach to enhance operations between neurons with similar phases and suppresses those with opposite phases. We test the benefits of this mechanism on two datasets: one composed of pairs of digits and one composed of a combination of an MNIST item superimposed on a CIFAR-10 image. Our results reveal better accuracy than CNN networks, proving more robust to noise and with better generalization abilities. Overall, we propose a novel mechanism that addresses the visual binding problem in neural networks by leveraging the synergy between neuroscience and machine learning.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence chatbots have achieved unprecedented adoption, with millions now using these systems for emotional support and companionship in contexts of widespread social isolation and capacity-constrained mental health services. While some users report psychological benefits, concerning edge cases are emerging, including reports of suicide, violence, and delusional thinking linked to perceived emotional relationships with chatbots. To understand this new risk profile we need to consider the interaction between human cognitive and emotional biases, and chatbot behavioural tendencies such as agreeableness (sycophancy) and adaptability (in-context learning). We argue that individuals with mental health conditions face increased risks of chatbot-induced belief destabilization and dependence, owing to altered belief-updating, impaired reality-testing, and social isolation. Current AI safety measures are inadequate to address these interaction-based risks. To address this emerging public health concern, we need coordinated action across clinical practice, AI development, and regulatory frameworks.

                arXiv:2507.20746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks possess the advantage of low energy consumption due to their event-driven nature. Compared with binary spike outputs, their inherent floating-point dynamics are more worthy of attention. The threshold level and re- set mode of neurons play a crucial role in determining the number and timing of spikes. The existing hard reset method causes information loss, while the improved soft reset method adopts a uniform treatment for neurons. In response to this, this paper designs an adaptive reset neuron, establishing the correlation between input, output and reset, and integrating a simple yet effective threshold adjustment strategy. It achieves excellent performance on various datasets while maintaining the advantage of low energy consumption.

                arXiv:2507.20810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper preliminarily investigates the duality between flow matching in generative models and particle swarm optimization (PSO) in evolutionary computation. Through theoretical analysis, we reveal the intrinsic connections between these two approaches in terms of their mathematical formulations and optimization mechanisms: the vector field learning in flow matching shares similar mathematical expressions with the velocity update rules in PSO; both methods follow the fundamental framework of progressive evolution from initial to target distributions; and both can be formulated as dynamical systems governed by ordinary differential equations. Our study demonstrates that flow matching can be viewed as a continuous generalization of PSO, while PSO provides a discrete implementation of swarm intelligence principles. This duality understanding establishes a theoretical foundation for developing novel hybrid algorithms and creates a unified framework for analyzing both methods. Although this paper only presents preliminary discussions, the revealed correspondences suggest several promising research directions, including improving swarm intelligence algorithms based on flow matching principles and enhancing generative models using swarm intelligence concepts.

                arXiv:2507.20923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOP) frequently arise in practical applications that require the simultaneous optimization of conflicting objectives. Although traditional evolutionary algorithms can be effective, they typically depend on domain knowledge and repeated parameter tuning, limiting flexibility when applied to unseen MOCOP instances. Recently, integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into evolutionary computation has opened new avenues for automatic heuristic generation, using their advanced language understanding and code synthesis capabilities. Nevertheless, most existing approaches predominantly focus on single-objective tasks, often neglecting key considerations such as runtime efficiency and heuristic diversity in multi-objective settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce Multi-heuristics for MOCOP via Pareto-Grid-guided Evolution of LLMs (MPaGE), a novel enhancement of the Simple Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization (SEMO) framework that leverages LLMs and Pareto Front Grid (PFG) technique. By partitioning the objective space into grids and retaining top-performing candidates to guide heuristic generation, MPaGE utilizes LLMs to prioritize heuristics with semantically distinct logical structures during variation, thus promoting diversity and mitigating redundancy within the population. Through extensive evaluations, MPaGE demonstrates superior performance over existing LLM-based frameworks, and achieves competitive results to traditional Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), with significantly faster runtime. Our code is available at: https://github.com/langkhachhoha/MPaGE.

                arXiv:2401.13330v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early Exit Neural Networks (EENNs) endow astandard Deep Neural Network (DNN) with Early Exit Classifiers (EECs), to provide predictions at intermediate points of the processing when enough confidence in classification is achieved. This leads to many benefits in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. Currently, the design of EENNs is carried out manually by experts, a complex and time-consuming task that requires accounting for many aspects, including the correct placement, the thresholding, and the computational overhead of the EECs. For this reason, the research is exploring the use of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to automatize the design of EENNs. Currently, few comprehensive NAS solutions for EENNs have been proposed in the literature, and a fully automated, joint design strategy taking into consideration both the backbone and the EECs remains an open problem. To this end, this work presents Neural Architecture Search for Hardware Constrained Early Exit Neural Networks (NACHOS), the first NAS framework for the design of optimal EENNs satisfying constraints on the accuracy and the number of Multiply and Accumulate (MAC) operations performed by the EENNs at inference time. In particular, this provides the joint design of backbone and EECs to select a set of admissible (i.e., respecting the constraints) Pareto Optimal Solutions in terms of best tradeoff between the accuracy and number of MACs. The results show that the models designed by NACHOS are competitive with the state-of-the-art EENNs. Additionally, this work investigates the effectiveness of two novel regularization terms designed for the optimization of the auxiliary classifiers of the EENN

                arXiv:2507.19639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stock trading has always been a challenging task due to the highly volatile nature of the stock market. Making sound trading decisions to generate profit is particularly difficult under such conditions. To address this, we propose four novel loss functions to drive decision-making for a portfolio of stocks. These functions account for the potential profits or losses based with respect to buying or shorting respective stocks, enabling potentially any artificial neural network to directly learn an effective trading strategy. Despite the high volatility in stock market fluctuations over time, training time-series models such as transformers on these loss functions resulted in trading strategies that generated significant profits on a portfolio of 50 different S&P 500 company stocks as compared to a benchmark reinforcment learning techniques and a baseline buy and hold method. As an example, using 2021, 2022 and 2023 as three test periods, the Crossformer model adapted with our best loss function was most consistent, resulting in returns of 51.42%, 51.04% and 48.62% respectively. In comparison, the best performing state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods, PPO and DDPG, only delivered maximum profits of around 41%, 2.81% and 41.58% for the same periods.

                arXiv:2507.20998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Memristor-based Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with temporal spike encoding enable ultra-low-energy computation, making them ideal for battery-powered intelligent devices. This paper presents a circuit-level memristive spiking neural network (SNN) architecture trained using a proposed novel supervised in-situ learning algorithm inspired by spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). The proposed architecture efficiently implements lateral inhibition and the refractory period, eliminating the need for external microcontrollers or ancillary control hardware. All synapses of the winning neurons are updated in parallel, enhancing training efficiency. The modular design ensures scalability with respect to input data dimensions and output class count. The SNN is evaluated in LTspice for pattern recognition (using 5x3 binary images) and classification tasks using the Iris and Breast Cancer Wisconsin (BCW) datasets. During testing, the system achieved perfect pattern recognition and high classification accuracies of 99.11\% (Iris) and 97.9\% (BCW). Additionally, it has demonstrated robustness, maintaining an average recognition rate of 93.4\% under 20\% input noise. The impact of stuck-at-conductance faults and memristor device variations was also analyzed.

Abstract: The paper explores the capability of continuous-time recurrent neural networks to store and recall precisely timed scores of spike trains. We show (by numerical experiments) that this is indeed possible: within some range of parameters, any random score of spike trains (for all neurons in the network) can be robustly memorized and autonomously reproduced with stable accurate relative timing of all spikes, with probability close to one. We also demonstrate associative recall under noisy conditions.
  In these experiments, the required synaptic weights are computed offline, to satisfy a template that encourages temporal stability.

                arXiv:2501.15081v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in language understanding and reasoning across diverse domains. Recently, there has been increasing interest in utilizing LLMs not merely as assistants in optimization tasks, but as primary optimizers, particularly for network-structured combinatorial problems. However, before LLMs can be reliably deployed in this role, a fundamental question must be addressed: Can LLMs iteratively manipulate solutions that consistently adhere to problem constraints? In this work, we propose a systematic framework to evaluate the capability of LLMs to engage with problem structures. Rather than treating the model as a black-box generator, we adopt the commonly used evolutionary optimizer (EVO) and propose a comprehensive evaluation framework that rigorously assesses the output fidelity of LLM-based operators across different stages of the evolutionary process. To enhance robustness, we introduce a hybrid error-correction mechanism that mitigates uncertainty in LLMs outputs. Moreover, we explore a cost-efficient population-level optimization strategy that significantly improves efficiency compared to traditional individual-level approaches. Extensive experiments on a representative node-level combinatorial network optimization task demonstrate the effectiveness, adaptability, and inherent limitations of LLM-based EVO. Our findings present perspectives on integrating LLMs into evolutionary computation and discuss paths that may support scalable and context-aware optimization in networked systems.

                arXiv:2503.08703v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Event cameras provide superior temporal resolution, dynamic range, power efficiency, and pixel bandwidth. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) naturally complement event data through discrete spike signals, making them ideal for event-based tracking. However, current approaches that combine Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and SNNs, along with suboptimal architectures, compromise energy efficiency and limit tracking performance. To address these limitations, we propose the first Transformer-based spike-driven tracking pipeline. Our Global Trajectory Prompt (GTP) method effectively captures global trajectory information and aggregates it with event streams into event images to enhance spatiotemporal representation. We then introduce SDTrack, a Transformer-based spike-driven tracker comprising a Spiking MetaFormer backbone and a tracking head that directly predicts normalized coordinates using spike signals. The framework is end-to-end, does not require data augmentation or post-processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SDTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining the lowest parameter count and energy consumption across multiple event-based tracking benchmarks, establishing a solid baseline for future research in the field of neuromorphic vision.

Abstract: Grey wolf optimizer (GWO) is a nature-inspired stochastic meta-heuristic of the swarm intelligence field that mimics the hunting behavior of grey wolves. Differential evolution (DE) is a popular stochastic algorithm of the evolutionary computation field that is well suited for global optimization. In this part, we introduce a new algorithm based on the hybridization of GWO and two DE variants, namely the GWO-DE algorithm. We evaluate the new algorithm by applying various numerical benchmark functions. The numerical results of the comparative study are quite satisfactory in terms of performance and solution quality.

                arXiv:2507.14270v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the APTx Neuron, a novel, unified neural computation unit that integrates non-linear activation and linear transformation into a single trainable expression. The APTx Neuron is derived from the APTx activation function, thereby eliminating the need for separate activation layers and making the architecture both computationally efficient and elegant. The proposed neuron follows the functional form $y = \sum_{i=1}^{n} ((\alpha_i + \tanh(\beta_i x_i)) \cdot \gamma_i x_i) + \delta$, where all parameters $\alpha_i$, $\beta_i$, $\gamma_i$, and $\delta$ are trainable. We validate our APTx Neuron-based architecture on the MNIST dataset, achieving up to 96.69% test accuracy within 11 epochs using approximately 332K trainable parameters. The results highlight the superior expressiveness and computational efficiency of the APTx Neuron compared to traditional neurons, pointing toward a new paradigm in unified neuron design and the architectures built upon it.

                arXiv:2402.03328v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many animal species can approximately judge the number of objects in a visual scene at a single glance, and humans can further determine the exact cardinality of a set by deploying systematic counting procedures. In contrast, it has been observed that even state-of-the-art AI systems have very limited enumeration skills. In this work, we propose two benchmark tasks inspired by cognitive science that allow to precisely evaluate the visual enumeration capabilities of multimodal foundation models, thereby providing an objective measure of their number sense and counting level. We consider popular visual question answering models (BLIP, LLaVA and ViLT) as well as advanced image-to-text (Gemini, GPT and Qwen) and text-to-image (DALL-E, FLUX and Stable Diffusion) AI systems. Our analyses show that even the most advanced models cannot reliably name the number of objects in simple visual stimuli or generate images containing a target number of items, as indexed by their low accuracy in both types of tasks. Especially for numbers outside the subitizing range, their responses are often far from the target numerosity, and, in stark contrast with human behavior, in many cases the distribution of errors depends on the object category. We also observe some striking mistakes with small numbers. Our findings demonstrate that developing an intuitive visual understanding of number remains challenging for AI models and that merely increasing model size might not be a viable strategy to promote the emergence of systematic counting skills. We release the full code of our benchmark to facilitate the evaluation of enumeration skills in future AI systems.

                arXiv:2406.14917v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents LLM2TEA, a Large Language Model (LLM) driven MultiTask Evolutionary Algorithm, representing the first agentic AI designer of its kind operating with generative evolutionary multitasking (GEM). LLM2TEA enables the crossbreeding of solutions from multiple domains, fostering novel solutions that transcend disciplinary boundaries. Of particular interest is the ability to discover designs that are both novel and conforming to real-world physical specifications. LLM2TEA comprises an LLM to generate genotype samples from text prompts describing target objects, a text-to-3D generative model to produce corresponding phenotypes, a classifier to interpret its semantic representations, and a computational simulator to assess its physical properties. Novel LLM-based multitask evolutionary operators are introduced to guide the search towards high-performing, practically viable designs. Experimental results in conceptual design optimization validate the effectiveness of LLM2TEA, showing 97% to 174% improvements in the diversity of novel designs over the current text-to-3D baseline. Moreover, over 73% of the generated designs outperform the top 1% of designs produced by the text-to-3D baseline in terms of physical performance. The designs produced by LLM2TEA are not only aesthetically creative but also functional in real-world contexts. Several of these designs have been successfully 3D printed, demonstrating the ability of our approach to transform AI-generated outputs into tangible, physical designs. These designs underscore the potential of LLM2TEA as a powerful tool for complex design optimization and discovery, capable of producing novel and physically viable designs.

Abstract: Lagrangian Neural Networks (LNNs) are a powerful tool for addressing physical systems, particularly those governed by conservation laws. LNNs can parametrize the Lagrangian of a system to predict trajectories with nearly conserved energy. These techniques have proven effective in unconstrained systems as well as those with holonomic constraints. In this work, we adapt LNN techniques to mechanical systems with nonholonomic constraints. We test our approach on some well-known examples with nonholonomic constraints, showing that incorporating these restrictions into the neural network's learning improves not only trajectory estimation accuracy but also ensures adherence to constraints and exhibits better energy behavior compared to the unconstrained counterpart.

                arXiv:2503.03361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Early in development, infants learn a range of useful concepts, which can be challenging from a computational standpoint. This early learning comes together with an initial understanding of aspects of the meaning of concepts, e.g., their implications, causality, and using them to predict likely future events. All this is accomplished in many cases with little or no supervision, and from relatively few examples, compared with current network models. In learning about objects and human-object interactions, early acquired and possibly innate concepts are often used in the process of learning additional, more complex concepts. In the current work, we model how early-acquired concepts are used in the learning of subsequent concepts, and compare the results with standard deep network modeling. We focused in particular on the use of the concepts of animacy and goal attribution in learning to predict future events. We show that the use of early concepts in the learning of new concepts leads to better learning (higher accuracy) and more efficient learning (requiring less data). We further show that this integration of early and new concepts shapes the representation of the concepts acquired by the model. The results show that when the concepts were learned in a human-like manner, the emerging representation was more useful, as measured in terms of generalization to novel data and tasks. On a more general level, the results suggest that there are likely to be basic differences in the conceptual structures acquired by current network models compared to human learning.

                arXiv:2507.06020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) Multiple Signal Classification algorithm is a powerful technique for high-resolution direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation in array signal processing. However, the exhaustive search over the 2D an-gular domain leads to high computa-tional cost, limiting its applicability in real-time scenarios. In this work, we reformulate the peak-finding process as a multimodal optimization prob-lem, and propose a Differential Evolu-tion algorithm with Neighborhood Mutation (DE-NM) to efficiently lo-cate multiple spectral peaks without requiring dense grid sampling. Simu-lation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable estimation accuracy to the traditional grid search, while significantly reduc-ing computation time. This strategy presents a promising solution for real-time, high-resolution DOA estimation in practical applications. The imple-mentation code is available at https://github.com/zzb-nice/DOA_multimodel_optimize.

                <p>Hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) are critical events implicated in memory consolidation, planning, and the reactivation of recent experiences. Under freely moving conditions, a well-established dichotomy exists: hippocampal networks predominantly generate theta oscillations during periods of reward pursuit (preparatory behaviors) and exhibit pronounced SWR activity once the reward is achieved (consummatory behaviors). Here, it was examined how SWRs are modulated by reward delivery and small movements in head-fixed rats. Contrary to the canonical view established in freely moving settings, the results revealed that the dominant and more enduring effect was a sustained suppression of SWR activity immediately following water delivery. Moreover, even minor, localized movements (such as whisking or body adjustments) decreased SWR occurrence, demonstrating that hippocampal ripple generation is highly sensitive to motor engagement, irrespective of reward timing. Such movement-induced suppression of ripples persisted during both sleep-like states and quiet wakefulness, suggesting that while large-scale brain states modulate the overall likelihood of SWR generation, local motor-related influences exert a state-independent inhibitory effect on hippocampal ripples. These results show that SWR modulation by behavioral states and body movements is more context dependent than previously appreciated.</p>

                <p>Neural circuits that consolidate sensory cues are essential for neurological functioning. Neural circuits that perform sensory integration can vary greatly because the sensory processing regions of the brain employ various neural motifs. Here, we investigate a neural circuit that mediates the response to conflicting stimuli in <I>Caenorhabditis elegans</I>. We concurrently expose animals to an aversive dispersal pheromone, osas#9, and an attractive bacterial extract. While worms usually avoid osas#9 alone, they suppress this avoidance behavior in the presence of a bacterial extract. Loss-of-function mutants and cell-specific rescues reveal that signaling from the ADF and NSM neurons is essential for bacterial extract-induced osas#9 avoidance attenuation. The inhibitory serotonin receptor, MOD-1, which is widely expressed on interneurons and motor neurons, is required for this sensory integration, suggesting that serotonin acts in an inhibitory manner. By performing calcium imaging on the ADF neurons in synaptic signaling (<I>unc-13</I>) and peptidergic (<I>unc-31</I>) signaling mutant backgrounds, we show that the ADF neurons require input from other neurons to respond to food extracts. We reveal a cue integration neural circuit in which serotonergic signaling and sensory neurons silence an aversive neural signal.</p>

                <p>Recognition of conspecific individuals in mammals is an important skill, thought to be mediated by a distributed array of neural networks, including those processing olfactory cues. Recent data from our groups have shown that social memory can be supported by olfactory cues alone and that interactions with an individual lead to increased neural representations of that individual in the anterior olfactory nucleus, an olfactory network strongly modulated by the neuropeptide oxytocin. We here show, using a computational model, how enhanced representations in the AON can easily arise during the encoding phase, how they can be modulated by OXT, and how a dynamic memory signature in the form of enhanced oscillations in the beta range arises from the architecture of the neural networks involved. These findings have implications for our understanding how social memories are formed and retrieved and generate further hypotheses that can be tested experimentally.</p>

                <p>by David J. Degnan, Lisa M. Bramer, Lisa Truong, Robyn L. Tanguay, Sara M. Gosline, Katrina M. Waters</p>

Though chemical exposures are known to potentially have negative impacts on health, including contributing to chronic diseases such as cancer, the quantitative contribution of risk is not fully understood for every chemical. A commonly used approach to quantify levels of risk is to measure the proportion of organisms (such as a total number of zebrafish on a plate or mice in a cage) with abnormal behavioral responses or morphology at increasing concentrations of chemical exposure. A particular challenge with processing the proportional data from these assays is the appropriate estimation of chemical concentration levels that result in malformations or acute toxicity, as these values typically vary between experimental measurements. The recommended approach by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is to fit benchmark dose curves with specific filters and model fitting steps, which are crucial to properly processing the proportional data. Several tools exist for the fitting of benchmark dose response curves, but none are standalone Python libraries built to process both morphological and behavioral with all the EPA recommended filters, filter parameters, models, and model parameters. Thus, here we present the benchmark dose response curve (<i>bmdrc</i>) Python library, which was built to closely follow these EPA guidelines with helpful visualizations of filters and fitted model curves, and reports for reproducibility purposes. <i>bmdrc</i> is open-source and has demonstrated utility as a support package to an existing web portal for information on chemicals (https://srp.pnnl.gov). Our package will support any toxicology analysis where the response is a proportional value at increasing levels of a concentration of a chemical or chemical mixture.

Exploring how local perturbations of cortical activity propagate across the brain network not only helps us understanding causal mechanisms of brain networks, but also offers a network insight into neurobiological mechanisms for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) treatment response. The concurrent combination of TMS and electroencephalography (EEG) enables researchers to track the TMS-evoked activity, defined here as scalp-recorded electrical signals reflecting the brain’s response to TMS, with millisecond-level temporal resolution. Based on this technique, we proposed a quantitative framework which combined sparse non-negative matrix factorization and stage-dependent effective connectivity methods to infer the causal pathways in TMS-evoked brain responses. We found that single-pulse TMS firstly induces local activity in the directly stimulated regions (left primary motor cortex, M1), and then propagates to the contralateral hemisphere and other brain regions. Finally, it propagates back from the contralateral region (right M1) to the stimulation region (left M1). This study provides preliminary evidence demonstrating how local perturbations propagate through brain networks to influence various cortical regions, and offers insights into the neural mechanism of TMS-evoked brain responses from a network perspective.

                <p>by Christian Brodbeck, Thomas Hannagan, James S. Magnuson</p>

Human speech recognition transforms a continuous acoustic signal into categorical linguistic units, by aggregating information that is distributed in time. It has been suggested that this kind of information processing may be understood through the computations of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that receives input frame by frame, linearly in time, but builds an incremental representation of this input through a continually evolving internal state. While RNNs can simulate several key <i>behavioral</i> observations about human speech and language processing, it is unknown whether RNNs also develop computational dynamics that resemble human <i>neural speech processing</i>. Here we show that the internal dynamics of long short-term memory (LSTM) RNNs, trained to recognize speech from auditory spectrograms, predict human neural population responses to the same stimuli, beyond predictions from auditory features. Variations in the RNN architecture motivated by cognitive principles further improved this predictive power. Specifically, modifications that allow more human-like phonetic competition also led to more human-like temporal dynamics. Overall, our results suggest that RNNs provide plausible computational models of the cortical processes supporting human speech recognition.

                <p>by Jordan Moutet, Eric Rivals, Fabio Pardi</p>

Ancestral sequence reconstruction is an important task in bioinformatics, with applications ranging from protein engineering to the study of genome evolution. When sequences can only undergo substitutions, optimal reconstructions can be efficiently computed using well-known algorithms. However, accounting for indels in ancestral reconstructions is much harder. First, for biologically-relevant problem formulations, no polynomial-time exact algorithms are available. Second, multiple reconstructions are often equally parsimonious or likely, making it crucial to correctly display uncertainty in the results. Here, we consider a parsimony approach where only deletions are allowed, while addressing the aforementioned limitations. First, we describe an exact algorithm to obtain all the optimal solutions. The algorithm runs in polynomial time if only one solution is sought. Second, we show that all possible optimal reconstructions for a fixed node can be represented using a graph computable in polynomial time. While previous studies have proposed graph-based representations of ancestral reconstructions, this result is the first to offer a solid mathematical justification for this approach. Finally we provide arguments for the relevance of the deletion-only case for the general case.

During evolution, plants have developed the ability to produce a vast array of specialized metabolites, which play crucial roles in helping plants adapt to different environmental niches. However, their biosynthetic pathways remain largely elusive. In the past decades, increasing numbers of plant biosynthetic pathways have been elucidated based on approaches utilizing genomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics. These efforts, however, are limited by the fact that they typically adopt a target-based approach, requiring prior knowledge. Here, we present MEANtools, a systematic and unsupervised computational integrative omics workflow to predict candidate metabolic pathways de novo by leveraging knowledge of general reaction rules and metabolic structures stored in public databases. In our approach, possible connections between metabolites and transcripts that show correlated abundance across samples are identified using reaction rules linked to the transcript-encoded enzyme families. MEANtools thus assesses whether these reactions can connect transcript-correlated mass features within a candidate metabolic pathway. We validate MEANtools using a paired transcriptomic-metabolomic dataset recently generated to reconstruct the falcarindiol biosynthetic pathway in tomato. MEANtools correctly anticipated five out of seven steps of the characterized pathway and also identified other candidate pathways involved in specialized metabolism, which demonstrates its potential for hypothesis generation. Altogether, MEANtools represents a significant advancement to integrate multi-omics data for the elucidation of biochemical pathways in plants and beyond.

Age-related thymic involution leads to diminished output of naïve T-cells. While this process is suggested to increase the risk of disease severity in the elderly following infection, direct evidence is lacking. We developed two mouse models that allow us to experimentally prevent or reverse thymic involution. Constitutive Myc expression in thymic epithelial cells (TEC) of middle-aged mice enhanced thymic function, and increased numbers of peripheral naïve CD4 and CD8 T-cells. Inducible Myc expression reversed age-related thymic involution and partially recovered peripheral naïve T-cell numbers. Importantly, improving thymic function in these settings preserved T-cell-dependent antibody responses and significantly reduced T-cell-associated mortality after infection with <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>. Improved thymic function also rebalanced age-associated alterations in the Treg pool, and mitigated loss of the transcriptional Th1 signature in aged conventional T-cells. Our findings support the value of TEC-focused thymic regeneration strategies for enhancement of T-cell-mediated immunity in the elderly.

Adult stem cell niches relays in the acquisition of a reversible state of quiescence to ensure long-lasting DNA integrity and cell expansion. Neural stem cells (NSCs) in the dentate gyrus (DG) enter quiescence before the adult hippocampal neurogenic niche is fully established. However, the mechanisms controlling NSC first quiescence entry and quiescence deepness are largely unknown. Using conditional mutant mouse during embryonic or postnatal stages, we have determined that transcription factor Sox5 is required to restrict first entry in quiescence. Moreover, we have found a critical window during the second postnatal week when NSCs build up a shallow quiescent state. Loss of Sox5 leads to an excess of NSCs in shallow quiescence, which are prone to activate, leading to a neurogenic burst in the adult DG and precocious depletion of the NSC pool. Mechanistically, Sox5 prevents an excess of BMP canonical signaling, a pathway that is required to maintain the correct levels of NSC quiescence during the second postnatal week. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that Sox5 is required to control the correct balance between shallow and deep quiescence during the first postnatal weeks of DG development, a balance which is essential for establishing long-lasting adult neurogenesis.

                Reid et al. develop MultiVINE-seq to map thousands of non-coding disease variants to genes in human brain vascular cells. Cerebrovascular disease variants compromise vessel integrity, whereas Alzheimer’s variants amplify immune activity, notably in T cells. This reveals how vascular genetic variation drives distinct neurological diseases through divergent molecular pathways.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99767">Optimal information gain at the onset of habituation to repeated stimuli</a></h4>

              
                Biological and living systems process information across spatiotemporal scales, exhibiting the hallmark ability to constantly modulate their behavior to ever-changing and complex environments. In the presence of repeated stimuli, a distinctive response is the progressive reduction of the activity at both sensory and molecular levels, known as habituation. In this work, we solve a minimal microscopic model devoid of biological details, where habituation to an external signal is driven by negative feedback provided by a slow storage mechanism. We show that our model recapitulates the main features of habituation, such as spontaneous recovery, potentiation, subliminal accumulation, and input sensitivity. Crucially, our approach enables a complete characterization of the stochastic dynamics, allowing us to compute how much information the system encodes on the input signal. We find that an intermediate level of habituation is associated with a steep increase in information. In particular, we are able to characterize this region of maximal information gain in terms of an optimal trade-off between information and energy consumption. We test our dynamical predictions against experimentally recorded neural responses in a zebrafish larva subjected to repeated looming stimulations, showing that our model captures the main components of the observed neural habituation. Our work makes a fundamental step towards uncovering the functional mechanisms that shape habituation in biological systems from an information-theoretic and thermodynamic perspective.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104423">Phosphoglycerate mutase regulates Treg differentiation through control of serine synthesis and one-carbon metabolism</a></h4>

              
                The differentiation and suppressive functions of regulatory CD4 T cells (Tregs) are supported by a broad array of metabolic changes, providing potential therapeutic targets for immune modulation. In this study, we focused on the regulatory role of glycolytic enzymes in Tregs and identified phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM) as being differentially overexpressed in Tregs and associated with a highly suppressive phenotype. Pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of PGAM reduced Treg differentiation and suppressive function while reciprocally inducing markers of a pro-inflammatory, T helper 17 (Th17)-like state. The regulatory role of PGAM was dependent on the contribution of 3-phosphoglycerate (3 PG), the PGAM substrate, to de novo serine synthesis. Blocking de novo serine synthesis from 3 PG reversed the effect of PGAM inhibition on Treg polarization, while exogenous serine directly inhibited Treg polarization. Additionally, altering serine levels in vivo with a serine/glycine-free diet increased peripheral Tregs and attenuated autoimmunity in a murine model of multiple sclerosis. Mechanistically, we found that serine limits Treg polarization by contributing to one-carbon metabolism and methylation of Treg-associated genes. Inhibiting one-carbon metabolism increased Treg polarization and suppressive function both in vitro and in vivo in a murine model of autoimmune colitis. Our study identifies a novel physiologic role for PGAM and highlights the metabolic interconnectivity between glycolysis, serine synthesis, one-carbon metabolism, and epigenetic regulation of Treg differentiation and suppressive function.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99302">Learning place cells and remapping by decoding the cognitive map</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal place cells are known for their spatially selective firing and are believed to encode an animal’s location while forming part of a cognitive map of space. These cells exhibit marked tuning curves and rate changes when an animal’s environment is sufficiently manipulated, in a process known as remapping. Place cells are accompanied by many other spatially tuned cells, such as border cells and grid cells, but how these cells interact during navigation and remapping is unknown. In this work, we build a normative place cell model wherein a neural network is tasked with accurate position reconstruction and path integration. Motivated by the notion of a cognitive map, the network’s position is estimated directly from its learned representations. To obtain a position estimate, we propose a non-trainable decoding scheme applied to network output units, inspired by the localized firing patterns of place cells. We find that output units learn place-like spatial representations, while upstream recurrent units become boundary-tuned. When the network is trained to perform the same task in multiple simulated environments, its place-like units learn to remap like biological place cells, displaying global, geometric, and rate remapping. These remapping abilities appear to be supported by rate changes in upstream units. While the model does not learn grid-like units, its place unit centers form clusters organized in a hexagonal lattice in open fields. When we decode the center locations of CA1 place fields in mice, we find preliminary evidence of a similar clustering tendency. This suggests a potential mechanism for the interaction between place cells, border cells, and grid cells. Our model provides a normative framework for learning spatial representations previously reserved for biological place cells, providing new insight into place cell field formation and remapping.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106509">A computational pipeline to track chromatophores and analyze their dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Cephalopod chromatophores are small dermal neuromuscular organs, each consisting of a pigment-containing cell and 10–20 surrounding radial muscles. Their expansions and contractions, controlled and coordinated by the brain, are used to modify the animal’s appearance during camouflaging and signaling. Building up on tools developed by this lab, we propose a flexible computational pipeline to track and analyze chromatophore dynamics from high-resolution videos of behaving cephalopods. This suite of functions, which we call CHROMAS, segments and classifies individual chromatophores, compensates for animal movements and skin deformations, thus enabling precise and parallel measurements of chromatophore dynamics and long-term tracking over development. A high-resolution tool for the analysis of chromatophore deformations during behavior reveals details of their motor control and thus, their likely innervation. When applied to many chromatophores simultaneously and combined with statistical and clustering tools, this analysis reveals the complex and distributed nature of the chromatophore motor units. We apply CHROMAS to the skins of the bobtail squid <i>Euprymna berryi</i> and the European cuttlefish <i>Sepia officinalis</i>, illustrating its performance with species with widely different chromatophore densities and patterning behaviors. More generally, CHROMAS offers many flexible and easily reconfigured tools to quantify the dynamics of pixelated biological patterns.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93906">Refining the resolution of the yeast genotype–phenotype map using single-cell RNA-sequencing</a></h4>

              
                Genotype–phenotype mapping (GPM), or the association of trait variation to genetic variation, has been a long-lasting problem in biology. The existing approaches to this problem allowed researchers to partially understand within- and between-species variation as well as the emergence or evolution of phenotypes. However, traditional GPM methods typically ignore the transcriptome or have low statistical power due to challenges related to dataset scale. Thus, it is not clear to what extent selection modulates transcriptomes and whether cis- or trans-regulatory elements are more important. To overcome these challenges, we leveraged the cost efficiency and scalability of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) by collecting data from 18,233 yeast cells from 4489 F2 segregants derived from an F1 cross between the laboratory strain BY4741 and the vineyard strain RM11-1a. More precisely, we performed expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping with the scRNA-seq data to identify single-cell eQTL and transcriptome variation patterns associated with fitness variation inferred from the segregant bulk fitness assay. Due to the larger scale of our dataset and its multidimensionality, we could recapitulate results from decades of work in GPM from yeast bulk assays while revealing new associations between phenotypic and transcriptomic variations at a broad scale. We evaluated the strength of the association between phenotype variation and expression variation, revealed new hotspots of gene expression regulation associated with trait variation, revealed new gene functions with high expression heritability, and highlighted the larger aggregate effect of trans-regulation compared to cis-regulation. Altogether, these results suggest that integrating large-scale scRNA-seq data into GPM improves our understanding of trait variation in the context of transcriptomic regulation.

">The UAP56 mRNA Export Factor is Required for Dendrite and Synapse Pruning via Actin Regulation in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Neurite and synapse pruning are conserved mechanisms that adapt neuronal circuitry to different developmental stages. Drosophila sensory c4da neurons prune their larval dendrites and their presynaptic terminals during metamorphosis using a gene expression programme that is induced by the steroid hormone ecdysone and involves posttranscriptional regulation pathways. Here we show that loss of the helicase UAP56, an important mediator of nuclear mRNA export, causes strong dendrite and presynapse pruning defects. Loss of UAP56 is linked to actin regulation, as it causes defects in the expression of the actin severing enzyme Mical during dendrite pruning, and actin accumulation at presynapses, where cofilin is required for pruning. Our findings suggest specificity in mRNA export pathways and identify a role for actin disassembly during presynapse pruning.

">Platelets from early-stage Alzheimer patients show enhanced amyloid binding, an elevated open canalicular system and sex-specific differences in their activation profile</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Alzheimers disease (AD) is associated with neurodegeneration and dementia. The clinical parameters include the deposition of amyloid-beta into senile plaques in the brain parenchyma and in cerebral vessels known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Currently, beta-amyloid-antibodies are emerging as possible therapy for AD. Several biomarkers, such as beta-Amyloid and tau-protein have gained significant value for diagnosing early AD. However, these biomarkers require cerebrospinal fluid. Blood tests for screening of AD are urgently needed. Methods: Patients diagnosed with early AD were analyzed for extracellular amyloid-beta binding to platelets, platelet morphology and platelet activation and compared to age-matched controls. Results: Beside unaltered platelet number and size, we detected increased binding of amyloid-beta to activated platelets isolated from AD patients. Electron microscopy revealed an altered platelet morphology in AD patients including the number of dense granules and the area of the open canalicular system (OCS) as compared to controls. While only minor differences in platelet activation were detected between patients and controls, a significant reduction of integrin alphaIIbbeta3 (fibrinogen receptor) activation was evident in platelets from female compared to male AD patients as determined by flow cytometry. Conclusion: The here presented results emphasize the importance to increase our understanding how platelets contribute to AD pathology in patients in a sex-specific manner. Furthermore, platelet parameters might serve as an ideal biomarker for a first prognosis of AD because platelets can be easily accessed by blood samples. These parameters might include a sex-specific platelet activation profile, the capability to bind Abeta to the platelet surface and the dimension of the OCS by electron microscopy.

">Dynamics of Excitability in Axonal Trees</a></h4>

              
                We report that axons of cortical neurons, structurally intricate excitable media, maintain somatic spike timing with high fidelity during spontaneous network activity, even at short (2--3 msec) inter-spike intervals. However, long series of external stimulation at physiological frequencies expose a vulnerability that varies depending on distance and branching. At 10 Hz, propagation delays increase within seconds, and failures accumulate over time, particularly in distal axonal branches. These effects are negligible at frequencies of 1--4 Hz. We attribute this phenomenon to the gradual and cumulative inactivation of sodium channels at vulnerable sites. Simulations incorporating this mechanism replicate the observed dynamics. Our findings underscore a limit on axonal reliability. To the extent that a sustained (seconds) drive at ca. 10 Hz or higher is physiologically feasible, axons should be regarded as active, heterogeneous structures with context-sensitive excitability.

">Two classes of amine/glutamate multi-transmitter neurons innervate Drosophila internal male reproductive organs</a></h4>

              
                The essential outcome of a successful mating is the transfer of genetic material from males to females in sexually reproducing animals from insects to mammals. In males, this culminates in ejaculation, a precisely timed sequence of organ contractions driven by the concerted activity of interneurons, sensory neurons, and motor neurons. Although central command circuits that trigger copulation have been mapped, the motor architecture and the chemical logic that couple specific neuronal subclasses to organ specific contractility, seminal fluid secretion, and sperm emission remain largely uncharted. This gap in knowledge limits our ability to explain how neural circuits adapt to varying contexts and how their failure contributes to infertility. Here we present an in-depth anatomical and functional analysis of the motor neurons that innervate the internal male reproductive tract of Drosophila melanogaster. We identify two classes of multi-transmitter motor neurons based on neurotransmitter usage, namely octopamine and glutamate neurons (OGNs) and serotonin and glutamate neurons (SGNs), each with a biased pattern of innervation: SGNs predominate in the accessory glands, OGNs in the ejaculatory duct, with equal contributions of each to the seminal vesicles. Both classes co-express vesicular transporters for glutamate (vGlut) and amines (vMAT), confirming their dual chemical identity. Their target organs differentially express receptors for glutamate, octopamine, and serotonin, suggesting combinatorial neuromodulation of contractility. Functional manipulations show that SGNs are essential for male fertility but OGNs are dispensable. Glutamatergic transmission from both classes is also dispensable for fertility. These findings provide the first high-resolution map linking multi-transmitter motor neurons to specific reproductive organs, reveal an unexpected division of labor between serotonergic and octopaminergic signaling pathways, and establish a framework for dissecting conserved neural principles that govern ejaculation and male fertility.

">Illusory tilt does not induce optostatic torsion</a></h4>

              
                Viewing tilted images that contain spatial information about gravity and verticality, such as rotated landscapes, or leaning buildings, produces an eye movement response known as optostatic torsion (OST). OST consists of a small-amplitude rotation ~1deg of the eyes around the line of sight, in the same direction of image tilt. Here we aimed to determine whether illusory perceptions of visual tilt were sufficient to produce OST. The illusory stimulus was a variation of the Cafe Wall illusion, applied to four "walls" to approximate the appearance of a tilted room. In a first experiment we determined the perceived magnitude of tilt of the illusory stimulus using a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) task, measuring the amount of tilt required to cancel the perceived illusory tilt for clockwise (CW) or counterclockwise (CCW) configurations. We found an illusory tilt of +3.67+-0.57deg and -3.80+-0.93deg, respectively. Then, in a second experiment, we recorded 3 dimensions of binocular eye movements in ten healthy subjects viewing one of four possible stimuli: 1) illusory, 2) non-illusory with small tilt, 3) landscape with small tilt, and 4) landscape with large tilt. Both the landscape (+-4deg tilt: 0.4+-0.1, p<0.05; +-30deg tilt: 0.5+-0.1, p<0.01;) and control stimulus (0.2deg+-0.1deg, p<0.05) produced a significant amount of OST when comparing left tilt and right tilt configurations while the illusory stimulus (0.11deg+-0.07deg, p=0.15) did not. This indicates a potential dissociation between our perception of tilt and the processing of tilt that drives the motor response of OST.

">Distinct Roles of CaMKII in Synaptic Vesicle Dynamics at Zebrafish Retinal Rod Bipolar Ribbon Synapses</a></h4>

              
                Calcium (Ca2+) not only serves as a fundamental trigger for neurotransmitter release but also participates in shaping neurotransmitter release (NTR) during prolonged presynaptic stimulation via multiple Ca2+-dependent processes. The Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is enriched at various presynaptic terminals, including ribbon synapses, where it associates with synaptic ribbons and thus may contribute to the modulation of Ca2+-dependent NTR. This could arise via its ability to influence one or more steps that control either the Ca2+ signal, the release process, or synaptic vesicle dynamics affecting available pools. Yet, recent studies have yielded conflicting results regarding the ability of CaMKII to influence NTR at rod bipolar cell (RBC) ribbon synapses. To address this, we acutely manipulated CaMKII activity in synaptic terminals of zebrafish RBCs by infusion of either inhibitory peptides targeting CaMKII or CaM, or a constitutively active CaMKII, while using a combination of imaging and electrophysiological approaches. Neither inhibiting nor enhancing CaMKII activity affects presynaptic Ca2+ channel activity. However, capacitance measurements revealed that inhibition of either CaMKII or CaM reduces exocytosis. CaMKII inhibition also reduces synaptic vesicle replenishment. Surprisingly, elevation of CaMKII activity also diminished vesicle fusion, similar to the effect of CaMKII inhibition, suggesting that CaMKII activity naturally exists at optimal levels to support neurotransmitter release. In contrast to CaMKII inhibition, CaMKII activity elevation did not impair vesicle replenishment. Collectively, these data suggest that distinct synaptic vesicle populations are differentially reliant on the level of CaMKII activity.

">Locomotion Selectively Amplifies Sensitizing Neurons in Primary Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Sensory processing in the cortex is shaped both by adaptation to external stimuli and by changes in internal state but it is not known how these processes interact, in large part because neuromodulatory changes in synaptic strength are difficult to quantify in behaving animals. Here we combine two-photon calcium imaging, optogenetics and circuit modelling to investigate how locomotion adjusts adaptation in layer 2/3 of mouse primary visual cortex (V1). We show that this change in state preferentially increases gain in PCs that sensitize during a high-contrast visual stimulus, while having weaker effects on PCs that depress. A population model constrained by a number of optogenetic manipulations accounts for the differential modulation of PCs during locomotion on the basis of i) variations in the connections that individual PCs receive from PV and SST interneurons, ii) a broad weakening of PC and PV synapses to all local targets, and iii) enhanced inhibition from SST synapses targetting depressing PCs. These results provide a quantitative and integrated understanding of how state-dependent modulation of cortical circuits can selectively bias cortical computation toward different adaptive regimes. The apparently paradoxical combination of increased PC gain but decreased synaptic strength suggests a state-dependent gating mechanism that boosts signals leaving V1 for higher visual areas while simultaneously preventing disruption of the excitatory-inhibitory balance required for stable local computation.

">Direction-selective retinal ganglion cells encode motion direction uniformly, despite having discretely distributed cardinal preferences</a></h4>

              
                On-Off direction-selective retinal ganglion cells (DS RGCs) exhibit broad tuning curves, responding robustly to motion aligned with or near their preferred direction. These cells comprise four major subtypes, each tuned to motion along one of the four cardinal axes: nasal, superior, temporal, or inferior. However, natural stimuli can move in any direction, and it remains unclear whether intermediate directions are encoded less effectively, or whether this cardinal organization nevertheless supports uniform direction encoding. Here, we combined previous electrophysiological recordings with an information-theoretic measure, the Stimulus Specific Information, to estimate the directional sensitivity of small populations of recorded neurons. This analysis revealed that DS RGC populations are uniformly sensitive across all directions of motion. We then asked whether the observed homogeneous sensitivity was a consequence of DS RGCs maximizing the average stimulus information. Simulations with artificially modified tuning curve widths revealed that DS cells prioritize avoiding pronounced drops in sensitivity over maximizing the average transmitted Information. Maximizing this minimal sensitivity may therefore be a principle to understand the organization of sensory systems.

">Inception: Simulating Personalized Long-Term Recovery in Disorders of Consciousness using Whole-Brain Computational Perturbations</a></h4>

              
                Advancements in the treatment of Disorders of Consciousness have seen significant progress with perturbative techniques and pharmacological therapies. Despite their potential, the underlying mechanisms of their variable efficacy remain poorly understood. To address this challenge, recent studies have utilised whole-brain modelling to simulate in silico perturbations. However, existing models focus exclusively on system behaviour during active stimulations, leaving unexplored how the brain dynamics evolve in post-acute and long-term stages, crucial in the recovery of consciousness. Here, we introduce Inception, a novel personalized approach to in silico perturbation modelling. We use a whole-brain models to simulate the perturbations and to unravel information about the long term effects of the proposed intervention. Applied to fMRI data from patients in a minimally conscious state and an unresponsive wakefulness state, our approach effectively simulates the transition to a healthy state, generating perturbed data closely resembling healthy brain activity. Moreover, we show that Inception enhances patient classification through machine learning, outperforming functional connectivity-based approaches. Finally, we investigate the correlation between perturbation responses and brain neuroreceptors, proposing that Inception might capture the long-term effects of pharmacological interventions in Disorders of Consciousness treatment.

">NG2-Glia Heterogeneity Across Cortical Layers</a></h4>

              
                NG2-glia are a unique and heterogeneous glial cell population with diverse roles in the central nervous system. However, their morphological diversity across brain regions and cortical layers remains poorly understood. Here, we use StarTrack labeling and in utero electroporation at embryonic day 14 (E14) to reconstruct individual NG2-glial cells in the adult mouse cortex and corpus callosum. Through detailed two- and three-dimensional morphometric analyses, including Sholl analysis, principal component analysis, and hierarchical clustering, we uncover striking layer-specific patterns. NG2-glia in deep cortical layers (L5-6) exhibit significantly larger somatic areas, more elaborate arborizations, and higher process complexity compared to those in superficial layers (L1-4) and the corpus callosum. In contrast, NG2-glia in layer 1 and the corpus callosum share a compact morphology characterized by smaller somata and simplified processes, suggesting common microenvironmental constraints. Moreover, Sholl analysis, principal component analysis, and hierarchical clustering reveal distinct morphological subpopulations within the NG2-glial population and highlight heterogeneity in upper cortical layers. Comparative analyses with astrocytes reveal fundamental structural differences: NG2-glia have thinner, longer processes and larger enclosing radii but occupy smaller volumes, whereas astrocytes form denser, more compact arbors with higher branch numbers. Together, our finding establish the first comprehensive morphological atlas of cortical adult NG2-glia, highlighting region- and layer-specific adaptations that likely underlie their diverse roles in CNS physiology and repair.

">Sex-specific hypothalamic axis disruption in the rNLS8 mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)</a></h4>

              
                Sex-related differences have gained increasing attention in recent years due to evidence of varying prevalence, pathophysiology, survival rates, and disease progression between males and females in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Differences in brain metabolism between sexes in ALS patients have also been reported; however, the specific molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. As growing evidence supports a strong metabolic component in ALS, this study investigates alterations in leptin, one of the key regulators of metabolism, that is known to be altered during ALS progression in rNLS8 mice, a transgenic mouse model of ALS which closely recapitulates the TAR DNA-binding protein (TDP-43) pathology observed in most patients with ALS. We also examined changes in hypothalamic neuronal genes involved in metabolic regulation through food intake in rNLS8 mice. Additionally, pathological alterations in the spinal cord, a primary site of ALS pathology, were also assessed. Using molecular biology techniques we analysed the expression levels of leptin, its long receptor (Ob-Rb), and its downstream signaling pathways (Akt and STAT3) in rNLS8 mice compared to age- and sex-matched wild-type littermates. Our results revealed significant sex- and disease stage-dependent differences in leptin and Ob-Rb expression in white adipose tissue and the hypothalamus, along with increased activation of the Akt signaling pathway in the spinal cord of rNLS8 mice. These findings suggest that ALS progression differs by sex in rNLS8 mice, which may impact overall disease progression and the effectiveness of potential therapeutic interventions targeting metabolism, such as nutritional strategies that influence leptin levels.

">The Alzheimer's therapeutic Lecanemab induces an amyloid-clearing program in microglia</a></h4>

              
                Controversies over anti-amyloid immunotherapies underscore the need to elucidate their mechanisms of action. Here we demonstrate that Lecanemab, a leading anti-A{beta} antibody, mediates amyloid clearance by triggering effector functions in the microglia. Using a human microglia xenograft model, we show that Lecanemab significantly reduces A{beta} pathology and associated neuritic damage, while neither Fc-inactivated Lecanemab nor microglia deficiency elicit this effect despite intact plaque binding. Single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomic analyses reveal that Lecanemab induces a focused transcriptional program that enhances phagocytosis, lysosomal degradation, metabolic reprogramming, interferon gamma genes, and antigen presentation. Finally, we identify SPP1/osteopontin as a major factor induced by Lecanemab treatment and demonstrate its role in promoting A{beta} clearance. These findings highlight that effective amyloid removal depends on the engagement of microglia through Fc fragment, providing critical insights for optimizing anti-amyloid therapies in AD.

">Paraquat Licences α-Synuclein to Trigger NLRP3-Dependent Pyroptosis in Microglia</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by dopaminergic neurodegeneration and the pathological accumulation of -synuclein (Syn) aggregates. While its etiology is multifactorial, environmental toxicants such as paraquat, a widely used herbicide banned in over 70 countries but still permitted in some regions, including Australia, are strongly implicated. We previously showed that Syn activates the NLRP3 inflammasome in microglia, inducing interleukin-1{beta} (IL-1{beta}) release without triggering pyroptosis. Here, we examine how paraquat modulates microglial NLRP3 activation by Syn. Using primary microglia from wild-type (WT) and Nlrp3 knockout (Nlrp3 KO) mice, alongside human monocyte-derived microglia, we demonstrate that paraquat induces dose-dependent NLRP3 activation in LPS-primed WT microglia via NADPH oxidase-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. This results in ASC speck formation and IL-1{beta} release, which is absent in Nlrp3 KO microglia and blocked by the selective NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950. While Syn alone fails to induce pyroptosis, co-treatment with paraquat resulted in caspase-1-dependent lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and gasdermin-D cleavage, hallmarks of pyroptotic cell death. This response was also suppressed by NLRP3 inhibition. Our findings reveal that paraquat acts as a critical second hit to license Syn-induced inflammasome-dependent pyroptosis in microglia, highlighting a mechanistic link between environmental toxin exposure and innate immune activation in PD pathogenesis. Targeting this axis with brain-penetrant NLRP3 inhibitors may offer an alternative therapeutic avenue for synucleinopathies associated with environmental toxins.

">Sensory Entrained TMS (seTMS) enhances motor cortex plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Neural excitability fluctuates with sensory events, creating windows of opportunity to enhance brain stimulation. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), including intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS), is a promising treatment for neurological and psychiatric disorders, but does not account for fluctuations in neural excitability, likely contributing to variable outcomes. Sensory Entrained TMS (seTMS) leverages sensorimotor oscillations to enhance corticospinal responses, but the sustained effects as a repetitive protocol are unknown. We extend seTMS to iTBS, measuring motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) as a physiological readout. In a randomized crossover study comparing standard iTBS with sensory entrained iTBS (se-iTBS; n=20), we found that se-iTBS more than doubled the MEP effect (55% vs 26% MEP enhancement) and persisted for at least 30 minutes. Notably, at least 80% of participants showed larger responses with se-iTBS at all time points. se-iTBS may provide a robust and practical framework for optimizing TMS that bridges electrophysiological mechanisms and clinical applications.

">High speed functional imaging with a microfluidics-compatible open-top light-sheet microscope enabled by model predictive control of a tunable lens</a></h4>

              
                Functional fluorescence imaging of small, transparent organisms has proven to be a powerful tool for understanding the development and function of intact nervous systems at the cellular level, particularly when combined with microfluidic tools that enable precise manipulation of sensory cues. Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy has a number of advantages for functional imaging, including efficient axial sectioning, reduced photobleaching, and high speed compared to confocal methods, but many configurations with ideal properties for efficient functional imaging place constraints on sample access and geometry that preclude their use with microfluidics. We present an open-top light-sheet microscope that uses a simplified inverted water immersion interface coupled with tunable lens remote focusing to achieve high-speed, multichannel 3D imaging of specimens in conventional microfluidics. We use model predictive control to efficiently optimize drive signals for an electrically tunable lens, providing reliable, camera-limited scanning of the imaging volume. We then demonstrate the utility of this approach by recording calcium activity from C. elegans at volume rates up to 20 Hz, including both whole-brain response to chemical stimulation and compartmentalized dendritic response of the PVD neuron to mechanical stimulation. Our approaches are flexible and inexpensive to implement, and could be adapted to improve performance and sample compatibility for a wide range of imaging techniques.

">TWITCHES DURING N2 AND N3 ARE COUPLED WITH SLEEP SPINDLES BUT NOT DELTA OSCILLATIONS IN 6-MONTH-OLD INFANTS</a></h4>

              
                Twitches are discrete movements that characterize REM sleep. However, recent work showed that twitches also occur during NREM sleep in human infants beginning around 3 months of age, a time when sleep spindles and the cortical delta rhythm are also emerging. Further, NREM twitches co-occur with sleep spindles, suggesting a unique functional role. Given that NREM sleep is composed of distinct substages, we investigated whether twitching and twitch-spindle coupling are differentially expressed during N2 and N3 sleep. In 6-month-old human infants (n=21; 7 females), we recorded EEG, respiration, and video during daytime sleep. We found that the high intensity of twitching during N2 resembled REM more than N3. In contrast, sleep spindles exhibited similar temporal characteristics during N2 and N3. Also, despite differences in the intensity of twitching during N2 and N3, significant twitch-spindle coupling occurred in both stages. Finally, twitch rate was inversely related to delta power across NREM periods. These findings suggest that although twitching occurs during REM, N2, and N3 sleep at this age, its expression is compatible with some sleep components (e.g., rapid eye movements, sleep spindles) but not others (e.g., cortical delta), highlighting the continuing need to better understand the dynamic organization of sleep and its individual components in early development.

">Continuous partitioning of neuronal variability</a></h4>

              
                Neural variability poses a major challenge to understanding the information content of neural codes. Recent work by Goris et al. (Nat. Neurosci 2014) has provided new insights into variability in the visual pathway by partitioning it into two components: a stimulus component reflecting sensory tuning, and a modulatory component arising from stimulus-independent fluctuations in excitability. However, a key limitation of this framework is that it lacks a continuous-time interpretation; it applies only to spike counts measured in time bins of a given size, and does not generalize to different bin sizes. Here we overcome this limitation using a new model for continuous-time partitioning of neural variability, the "continuous modulated Poisson'' (CMP). This model extends the partitioning model of Goris et al. (Nat. Neurosci 2014) by modeling a neuron's instantaneous firing rate as the product of a time-varying stimulus drive and a continuous-time stochastic gain process. We apply this model to spike responses from four different visual areas (LGN, V1, V2, and MT) and show that it accurately captures spike train variability across timescales and throughout the visual hierarchy. Moreover, we demonstrate that the modulatory gain process decays according to an exponentiated power law, with higher variance and slower decay at later stages of the visual hierarchy. This model provides new insights into the organization of both stimulus-driven and stimulus-independent modulatory processes and provides a powerful framework for characterizing neural variability across brain regions.

">HBMAP: Bayesian inference of neural circuits from DNAbarcoded projection mapping</a></h4>

              
                Decoding how the brain routes information through its precise, long-range wiring remains a central challenge in neuroscience. Barcode-based mapping of axonal projections allows brain-wide, high-throughput investigation of projections at single-neuron resolution offering a powerful solution. However, principled methods for statistical analysis of barcode count data that can detect common projection rules and effectively integrate datasets across subjects are lacking. To address these issues, we developed a model-based clustering approach through hierarchical Bayesian mixtures which we call hierarchical Bayesian mapping of axonal projections (HBMAP). We show that the inferred model accurately reflects the features of the data and allows simultaneous identification of projection patterns and characterization of uncertainty that accounts for subject variability. Our study presents the first Bayesian approach to barcode-based projection mapping, offering a general solution for this class of data.

">Cognitive training effects are shaped more by individual brain dynamics than age - Evidence from younger and older women</a></h4>

              
                Given the well-established structural and functional changes in the aging brain, it is widely assumed that cognitive aging is primarily driven by robust group-level differences between young and older adults. However, our individual-level EEG functional connectivity analysis challenges this notion. We investigated the impact of cognitive training on functional brain connectivity using task-switching paradigms in 39 younger (18-25 years) and 40 older (60-75 years) women. Participants were randomly assigned to either a training group, which completed eight individualized one-hour cognitive training sessions, or a no-contact control group. EEG was recorded at both pre- and post-training sessions across three task-switching paradigms (trained and near-transfer versions). Unique functional connectivity of different sources of variation was examined by calculating how much variance was shared across stable traits (e.g., individual, age, and common factors), or dynamic states (e.g., task and training effects). Our results revealed that age accounted for only a modest proportion of variance, whereas self-similarity was a dominant factor - particularly in older adults. Similarly, group-level training effects were small but strongly modulated by individual neural profiles, suggesting person-specific trajectories. Participants recruited distinct neural networks across tasks, and even within the same task engaged unique, individual-specific network configurations, reflecting personalised brain adaptations to cognitive demands. Importantly, older adults displayed a shift from common to individual network patterns, consistent with increased neural specialization and compensatory mechanisms. These findings underscore the importance of moving beyond group-level contrasts toward models that capture the complexity of individual brain dynamics in cognitive aging and training responsiveness.

">Functional analysis of ligand-gated chloride channels in a cnidarian sheds light on the evolution of inhibitory signalling</a></h4>

              
                {psi}-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the predominant inhibitory transmitter in the vertebrate nervous system. Fast inhibitory signalling is mediated by type A GABA receptors (GABAARs), which form pentameric ligand-gated ion channels. While GABA is also present in plants and prokaryotes, it is unknown when it was first used for fast neuronal transmission. Cnidaria represent a sister group to all Bilateria and possess a variety of putative GABAARs, none of which has been functionally characterized. In this study, we surveyed putative inhibitory ion channel receptors from the model cnidarians Nematostella and Hydra. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a surprising complexity of these receptors. The majority formed a cnidarian-specific radiation with some receptors forming a basal clade. We functionally analyzed seven putative Nematostella GABAARs of this radiation and found that none was activated by GABA or glycine, whereas three were activated by glutamate. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we identified a lysine residue in the canonical ligand-binding pocket that is important for activation by glutamate. Our results identified a group of inhibitory ion channel receptors in Cnidaria that uses glutamate as a ligand. Moreover, they suggest that inhibitory ion channel receptors in Cnidaria massively diversified, which may have been instrumental in the evolution of complex behaviors and sensory processing by the cnidarian nervous system. This work lays the foundation for understanding the diversity and evolution of inhibitory receptors in Cnidaria and the evolution of inhibitory signalling in animal nervous systems.

">Frontotemporal bursting supports human working memory</a></h4>

              
                Cortical neural activity varies dynamically during memory periods, when relevant information is not present in the environment. But how those dynamics are related to a code defining working memory (WM) performance is not known. Recent data shows brief bursts of activity in the high gamma (70-140 Hz) and beta (12-30 Hz) band within non-human primate lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) is associated with WM processing. However, WM may be related to activity within a network of frontal executive and posterior sensory areas involved in stimulus perception. Here we tested whether gamma and beta bursting exist in lateral PFC and multisensory lateral temporal areas in humans during visual WM, and whether these areas are coupled via a phase-burst code. We used intracranial macroelectrode recordings from the middle frontal gyrus (MFG), which includes dorsolateral PFC, and from the middle temporal gyrus (MTG), an area important for visual processing. High gamma bursting increased in human left PFC during encoding and delay periods while beta bursting decreased. Interestingly, beta bursting increased in multisensory areas during encoding and remained high during the delay period, more so on the right. These effects varied with WM performance. Finally, we quantify the degree to which delay-period gamma bursting is locked to beta phase within and between regions of this network using a proposed metric termed phase-burst coupling (PBC). We find evidence that delay-period gamma bursting in temporal areas is locked to beta phase in PFC. Our findings suggest that WM may use bursting to support memory maintenance until readout.

">Visual Word Form Area demonstrates individual and task-agnostic consistency but inter-individual variability</a></h4>

              
                Ventral Occipital Temporal Cortex (VOTC) is home to a mosaic of categorically-selective functional regions that respond to visual stimuli. Within left VOTC lies the Visual Word Form Area (VWFA) - a text-selective region that develops as an individual learns to read. While there is consistency in the general location of text-selective responses - within the posterior portion of the occipitotemporal sulcus (OTS) - there is also substantial variability across individuals in the size and precise anatomical location. Moreover, there is an ongoing debate over the extent to which the VWFA a) encodes the visual features of text, versus b) is driven by the task of reading. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we scanned adults and children as they completed two tasks while viewing text, pseudo fonts, faces, objects, limbs. Experimental tasks were: (1) a fixation task where they were instructed to ignore the stimuli while making psychophysical judgements on the fixation dot; (2) a one-back task where they were instructed to attend to the stimuli and detect repeats. We found that a consistent VWFA location could be identified on each individuals cortical surface using either task. At the same time, the response to text during the one-back task evoked a larger territory of text-selective response (leading to a larger ROI) than the fixation task. However, when averaged in template space, text-selective cortex could not be identified due to variability in the relative locations of text-, face-, object-, and limb-selective cortex. Thus, for both children and adults, a text-selective region (i.e., VWFA) can be localized on the individual cortical surface. This resulting region consistently responds to text irrespective of cognitive task, but text-selective responses are masked when averaged in template space due to variability in the exact configuration of category-selective regions.

">Intrinsic noise reveals the stability of a neuronal network</a></h4>

              
                The stability of rhythmic activity in neural networks is an important aspect in the study of central pattern generators (CPGs). Different from other physiological rhythms, the activity of CPGs has not been fully characterized in terms of its stability, especially using quantitative methods. We propose a method that takes advantage of the natural noise present in CPGs to quantify the stability of the rhythmic activity. Furthermore, we used the stationary bootstrap method to define confidence intervals of the results. We applied this method to study the influence of a synaptic modification on the pyloric CPG circuit, using artificial synapses implemented in dynamic clamp software. We show that even after removing one of its strongest synapses, the CPG stability remains unaltered. This analysis suggests that CPGs are designed to be strongly stable regardless of the parameter perturbations they undergo.

">Amyloid precursor protein mediates deficits in corticogenesis in Down syndrome cortical organoids</a></h4>

              
                Down syndrome (DS), due to trisomy 21 (T21), occurs in approximately 14.14 per 10,000 live births in the United States. Reduced neural progenitor cell (NPC) proliferation, delayed neurogenesis, impaired cortical lamination and altered cell fate specification are thought to contribute to cognitive impairments in DS individuals. The molecular mechanisms underlying these deficits are not fully understood. Notably, Amyloid precursor protein (APP), located on human chromosome 21 (HSA21), has been extensively implicated in these processes. Mouse models only partially recapitulate DS phenotypes due to genetic, developmental, and species specific differences. Recent advances in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived 3D cortical organoids allow for the study of DS cortical development in a human model system. Here, we show that normalizing APP gene copy number in DS cortical organoids ameliorated deficits in NPC proliferation, neuronal differentiation, and transcriptional programs. Our results demonstrate the value of cortical organoids in uncovering gene-specific roles in DS pathogenesis and identify APP as a promising target for addressing early neurodevelopmental impairments.

                Metabolism requires precise gene regulation to balance energy intake and expenditure for an organism's well-being, with misregulation often leading to metabolic syndromes. This study reveals that the brain-specific microRNA miR-1000 regulates fat storage by controlling the expression of a neuropeptide gene, Nplp1. Loss of miR-1000 increases Nplp1 expression, leading to higher body weight, increased fat storage, improved survival under food deprivation conditions, and a reduced overall lifespan in Drosophila. We further show that miR-1000 promotes fat storage upon feeding by regulating TAG synthesis and storage in lipid droplets, thereby playing a crucial role in metabolic regulation.

">Control of walking direction by descending and dopaminergic neurons in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Animals need to fine-control the speed and direction of locomotion to navigate complex and dynamic environments. To achieve this, they integrate multimodal sensory inputs with their internal drive to constantly adjust their motor output. This integration involves the interplay of neuronal populations across different hierarchical levels along the sensorimotor axis - from sensory, central, and modulatory neurons in the brain to descending neurons and motor networks in the nerve cord. Here, we characterize two populations of neurons that control distinct aspects of walking on different hierarchical levels in Drosophila. First, we use in-vivo electrophysiological recordings to demonstrate that moonwalker descending neurons (MDN) integrate antennal touch to drive changes in walking direction from forward to backward. Second, we establish DopaMeander as an important component in the control of forward walking through a combination of optogenetic activation, silencing, connectomics, and in-vivo recordings. These dopaminergic modulatory neurons drive forward walking with increased turning, and the activity of individual neurons is correlated with ipsiversive turning. Hence, MDN and DopaMeander control opposite regimes of walking on different hierarchical levels. Computational models reveal that their activity predicts key parameters of spontaneous walking. Moreover, we find that both MDN and DopaMeander are gated out during flight. This suggests that neuronal populations across levels of control are modulated by the behavioral state to minimize cross-talk between motor programs.

">Acute EtOH enhances septohippocampal coordination but disrupts intrinsic hippocampal theta dynamics during foraging</a></h4>

              
                Theta oscillations - rhythmic patterns of synchronous activity within discrete brain regions - are known to support memory, navigation, and behavioral coordination, and are sensitive to pharmacological manipulation. Acute ethanol (EtOH) exposure has been shown to alter theta oscillations, but its effects on transient theta bursts and cross-regional coordination during naturalistic behavior remain unclear. We recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from the medial septum (MS), hippocampal Cornu Ammonis 1 (CA1), and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in freely foraging mice following intraperitoneal injection of EtOH (1.5 g/kg) or saline. We analyzed spectral power, theta burst dynamics, phase, and lag timing. Burst features from CA1 were used to train a machine learning classifier to predict session condition. EtOH impaired locomotion and reduced goal-directed behaviors, particularly early in the session. In CA1, theta power shifted toward lower frequencies and lagged coherence declined. EtOH increased the frequency but reduced the duration of theta bursts in CA1, and in MS, only burst count increased. EtOH enhanced the temporal alignment of MS-CA1 burst pairs. Phase-locking between CA1 and MS during coupled bursts remained present but showed altered structure. Our classifier achieved robust performance using burst features such as skew and entropy, and reliably distinguished treatment conditions. EtOH modulates septohippocampal dynamics by altering the timing and structure of theta bursts. These results suggest that burst-level features are sensitive markers of EtOH's circuit-level effects during naturalistic behavior.

">Human hippocampal ripples loosen medial prefrontal constraints to foster creative thinking</a></h4>

              
                Creative thinking often requires breaking away from dominant mental schemas to generate novel and useful ideas. Yet how the human brain relaxes schematic constraints to enable creativity remains unclear. Using human intracranial EEG recordings, we found that moments of creative idea generation were accompanied by increased hippocampal ripple events, a concurrent reduction in ripple-triggered high-frequency activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and greater divergence of ripple-triggered mPFC activity patterns from the typical, schema-like task state. These effects followed a dorsal-ventral gradient within the mPFC and were most pronounced in the ventromedial PFC (vmPFC), a region heavily involved in schematic representation. Together, our findings suggest that hippocampal ripples can transiently disengage medial prefrontal schema constraints, thereby promoting more flexible and creative thinking.

">Normal aging impacts the extent and diversity of neural plasticity induced in the mouse brain with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an attractive tool to promote healthy brain ageing in older adults and treat age-related neurological conditions. Despite its popularity, the neurological processes and plasticity mechanisms altered by rTMS in the aged brain, and where these changes occur in the brain are unknown. Furthermore, it is not known why different rTMS protocols induce different changes in the aged brain, or why rTMS is less effective in older adults compared to younger adults. Using spatial transcriptomics, we uncovered that rTMS primarily acts on genes related to synaptic plasticity in both cortical and subcortical circuits in aged mice, but the specific changes were dependent on the brain region and even down to individual cortical layers in the motor and somatosensory cortices. Comparing our results from aged mice to young adult mice revealed that rTMS acts on a larger variety of neural plasticity mechanisms in the young adult brain, and that rTMS was less effective at altering gene expression related to neural plasticity in the aged brain, but this varied between brain regions and the protocol of rTMS applied. These findings provide a comprehensive map of the mechanisms altered by rTMS across the aged brain and highlight the need to consider the effect of ageing when optimising rTMS protocols for older populations.

">Spatial transcriptomic profiling uncovers the molecular effects of the neurotoxicant polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the brains of adult mice</a></h4>

              
                Environmental toxicants, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), are highly stable synthetic organic compounds that are present in air, water, and soil. PCBs have been identified in post-mortem human brains of individuals with neurodegenerative diseases, indicating a possible link between environmental factors and disease risk. Research has revealed an association between PCB exposure and cognitive decline. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate how PCB mixtures relevant to humans affect brain function and cognition. To investigate the effects of PCBs on memory and transcriptomic profiles, we exposed adult male C57BL/6J mice orally to a synthetic PCB mixture daily. After seven weeks of exposure, the mice were assessed in a spatial object recognition task (SOR) to evaluate long-term spatial memory. Our findings showed that mice exposed to PCBs exhibited deficits in long-term spatial memory. To examine the molecular effects of PCB on the brain, we used a spatial transcriptomics technique to analyze gene expression changes in five brain regions: the hippocampus, neocortex, thalamus, caudal putamen, and fiber tracts. Our analysis of spatial gene expression revealed the molecular signatures influenced by PCB in these susceptible brain regions of mice. Network analysis suggests that these changes are associated with higher chlorinated PCBs present in the brain. Additionally, we show that PCB exposure disrupts the expression of tight junction proteins, which are crucial for maintaining the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Thus, our results offer mechanistic insights into how PCB exposure affects brain function and cognition.

However, it remains unclear how preparatory brain activity influences the temporal dynamics of ER during reinterpretation. Thirty-four young adults involving an adapted ER task, downregulated their negative emotional experiences through reinterpretation. Strategy preparation nearly aligns with strategy use during reactive ER, while preparation precedes use during proactive ER. Behavioral data showed that reactive ER was more effective than proactive ER. Event-related potential (ERP) and decoding results revealed that goal representation engaged attentional resources to maintain regulatory information and suppress irrelevant interference during preparation. This intensive resource allocation may impair the working memory capacity, thereby reducing the regulatory effect in proactive ER. In contrast, reactive ER, unhindered by the preparation stage, preserved sufficient cognitive resources to adaptively re-engage in ER as necessary. Overall, preparation not only influenced the timing of ER but also impeded strategy use. The regulatory effect was determined by the brain activation patterns observed during the regulation stage.</span>

Previous studies show that individuals with agenesis of the corpus callosum show overall preserved default-mode network functional connectivity, suggesting compensatory mechanisms for maintaining bilaterally correlated activity. In this study, we aimed to explore white matter pathways that support default-mode network-related networks in 15 children with agenesis of the corpus callosum and 27 typically developing controls, using combined diffusion and functional magnetic resonance imaging. A seed-based and dynamic functional connectivity approach enabled us to examine default-mode network spatial and temporal properties and their white matter substrates. While spatial default-mode network patterns were similar across groups, we found differences in temporal dynamics of 1 network and in white matter–default-mode network correspondence. These differences were either observed in white matter tracts directly associated with complete or partial absence of the corpus callosum or in white matter tracts such as the fornix and the anterior and posterior commissures, which have been previously implicated in neuroplasticity in agenesis of the corpus callosum. Our findings show that default-mode network dynamics can remain functionally preserved despite significant white matter alterations.</span>

Here, we investigated how covert shifts of attention and associated modulations of posterior alpha power are affected after FEF inhibition by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Neither right nor left FEF disruption impaired attention task performance. This absence of behavioral effects seems to be related to the here employed long cue-target intervals, giving the attention system sufficient time to compensate (across trials) for the TMS insult. Alpha power modulation was quantified both in the entire cue-target interval, and in two additional time windows: after cue presentation (early) and before target appearance (late). TMS effects on alpha power clearly differed across time windows, being strongest in the early time window. The reduced TMS effect in the late window might reflect recovery/compensation employed by the attention system, possibly explaining the lack of TMS-induced behavioral effects. These results are in line with a central role of the FEF in the control of visuospatial attention and support the notion of compensation mechanisms in cognitive brain systems in the temporal domain.</span>

                <p>There is a growing imperative to understand the neurophysiological impact of our rapidly changing and diverse technological, social, chemical, and physical environments. To untangle the multidimensional and interacting effects requires data at scale across diverse populations, taking measurement out of a controlled lab environment and into the field. Electroencephalography (EEG), which has correlates with various environmental factors as well as cognitive and mental health outcomes, has the advantage of both portability and cost-effectiveness for this purpose. However, with numerous field researchers spread across diverse locations, data quality issues and researcher idle time due to insufficient participants can quickly become unmanageable and expensive problems. In programs we have established in India and Tanzania, we demonstrate that with appropriate training, structured teams, and daily automated analysis and feedback on data quality, nonspecialists can reliably collect EEG data alongside various survey and assessments with consistently high throughput and quality. Over a 30&nbsp;week period, research teams were able to maintain an average of 25.6 participants per week, collecting data from a diverse sample of 7,933 participants ranging from Hadzabe hunter-gatherers to office workers. Furthermore, data quality, computed on the first 5,831 records using two common methods, PREP and FASTER, was comparable to benchmark datasets from controlled lab conditions. Altogether this resulted in a cost per participant of under $50, a fraction of the cost typical of such data collection, opening up the possibility for large-scale programs particularly in low- and middle-income countries.</p>

                <p>Previous research suggests that stress predisposes individuals to develop substance use disorders by disrupting the brain processing of rewards. Yet, how stressful experiences disrupt the brain processing of reward-related cues at the neuronal level is poorly understood. Intermittent social defeat (ISD) is a stress animal model that increases reward-seeking behavior, drug self-administration, and choice impulsivity up to several weeks after stress. We tested the hypothesis that ISD disrupts the neuronal encoding of reward cues in key areas of the brain that regulate reward-seeking. We examined in vivo neuronal dynamics in response to reward cues in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) simultaneously, and longitudinally, in control and stressed Long&ndash;Evans male rats during a discriminative stimulus reward-seeking task. In the dmPFC, ISD decreased cue-evoked neuronal activity 1 and 15&nbsp;d after stress, which indicates a long-term degradation of outcome anticipation-related processing. In the VTA, ISD increased cue-evoked neuronal activity 1&nbsp;d after stress but decreased cue-evoked activity 15&nbsp;d after stress. Moreover, decoding analysis in single neurons and populations showed parallel increases and decreases in reward discrimination accuracy in the VTA which points to time-dependent changes in incentive salience after stress. These results demonstrate that ISD differently disrupts the neuronal encoding of reward cues in the dmPFC and the VTA and identify novel neurofunctional signatures that underlie a higher predisposition to seek out rewards after stress.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to investigate the relationships among subthalamic nucleus (STN) activity, gait initiation (GI), and freezing of gait (FOG) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We recorded GI and STN local field potentials (LFPs) via externalized cables in 38 patients with PD (35 reporting FOG in daily life), both OFF- and ON-dopamine (DOPA). GI was also recorded in 24 age-matched controls. GI scores related to pace, rhythm, and balance were derived from kinetics, and FOG was identified using kinematics. We compared GI performance related to FOG and DOPA, and GI-LFP relationships between posterior-sensorimotor versus central-associative STN regions.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>DOPA<sup>OFF</sup>, 12 patients with PD had FOG observed (FOG-OBS, 263 episodes), occurring at a mean of 8 steps after GI, and 26 had no FOG observed (NOBS; FOG-NOBS). GI pace scores were worse in FOG-OBS than in FOG-NOBS patients with PD, even when not followed by FOG, with weaker association with alpha/low-beta activity in the posterior STN. Although rhythm/balance scores were similar between groups, their association with low-beta activity was stronger in FOG-OBS patients, with rhythm correlating more in the central STN and balance in the posterior STN. GI was worse preceding imminent FOG, with disrupted low-beta GI-LFP associations and emergent high-beta correlations with reversed spatial distribution (pace/rhythm-posterior STN, balance-central). Dopamine improved pace, rhythm, and FOG, and partially restored STN activity.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results reveal 3 distinct GI patterns in patients with PD associated with absence, predisposition to, or imminent occurrence of FOG, with STN neuronal modulations differing dynamically between the posterior and central subregions. These markers could support developing adaptive DBS strategies tailored for episodic gait impairments. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Recent studies report reduced dementia risk following shingles vaccination, suggesting that varicella-zoster virus (VZV) latency contributes to neuroimmune vulnerability. We propose that subclinical VZV reactivation acts as a renewable peripheral immune stressor, amplifying microglial priming in aging brains. Shingles vaccination may suppress this viral reservoir, reducing cumulative inflammatory tone. In this opinion article we contrast this mechanism with trained immunity and highlight how pathogen-specific and systemic effects may converge. Finally, we discuss the role of innate phagocytosis and resolution, suggesting that impaired clearance, rather than activation alone, sustains neuroinflammatory risk. Vaccination may thus modulate innate responsiveness and preserve neuroimmune balance in later life.

                Dong et al. establish that somatic electroacupuncture potentiates gastric motility in a manner critically dependent on both stimulation intensity and needle insertion depth while delineating the underlying neuroanatomical basis comprising somatosensory primary afferents and vagal motor efferents.

                Microglial ADGRG1 drives a protective state in Alzheimer’s disease by activating the transcription factor MYC, which upregulates genes associated with homeostasis, phagocytosis, and lysosomal functions. This leads to increased Aβ clearance, improved neuronal health, and preserved cognitive function.

                Harhai and collaborators expand the catalog of genes essential for oxidative phosphorylation and implicate FAM136A in mitochondrial proteostasis. Their findings suggest a mitochondrial contribution to familial Ménière’s disease and provide a resource to advance the diagnosis and study of mitochondrial disorders.

                Xing et al. report the first high-confidence list of cryptic 3′ss used by SF3B1-mutant cells. To address the underlying mechanism, they analyzed whether knockout/knockdown of any of 600 RBPs recapitulated these events. Strikingly, only one, SUGP1, did so, implicating SUGP1 loss from mutant spliceosomes as the sole driver of missplicing.

                Takemura et al. demonstrate that the birth process triggers the transformation of radial glia (RG)-to-postnatal neural stem cells (NSCs) through calpain- and endocytosis-mediated fiber transection. Importantly, RG adhesion to endothelial cells via N-cadherin depends on birth timing; preterm birth disrupts this, impairing NSC morphology and reducing stemness in adulthood.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88598">Cell type-specific contributions to a persistent aggressive internal state in female Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Persistent internal states are important for maintaining survival-promoting behaviors, such as aggression. In female <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, we have previously shown that individually activating either aIPg or pC1d cell types can induce aggression. Here we investigate further the individual roles of these cholinergic, sexually dimorphic cell types, and the reciprocal connections between them, in generating a persistent aggressive internal state. We find that a brief 30-second optogenetic stimulation of aIPg neurons was sufficient to promote an aggressive internal state lasting at least 10 minutes, whereas similar stimulation of pC1d neurons did not. While we previously showed that stimulation of pC1e alone does not evoke aggression, persistent behavior could be promoted through simultaneous stimulation of pC1d and pC1e, suggesting an unexpected synergy of these cell types in establishing a persistent aggressive state. Neither aIPg nor pC1d show persistent neuronal activity themselves, implying that the persistent internal state is maintained by other mechanisms. Moreover, inactivation of pC1d did not significantly reduce aIPg-evoked persistent aggression, arguing that the aggressive state did not depend on pC1d-aIPg recurrent connectivity. Our results suggest the need for alternative models to explain persistent female aggression.
