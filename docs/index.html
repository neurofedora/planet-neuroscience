	<p>Inhibitory control, as an essential cognitive ability, affects the development of higher cognitive functions. Rhythmic perceptual stimulation has been used to improve cognitive abilities. It is unclear, however, whether it can be used to improve inhibitory control. This study used the Go/NoGo task and the Stroop task to assess various levels of inhibitory control using rhythmic audio-visual stimuli as the stimulus mode. Sixty subjects were randomly divided into three groups to receive 6 Hz, 10 Hz, and white noise stimulation for 30 min. Two tasks were completed by each subject both before and after the stimulus. Before and after the task, closed-eye resting EEG data were collected. The results showed no differences in behavioral and EEG measures of the Go/NoGo task among the three groups. While both 6 Hz and 10 Hz audio-visual stimulation reduced the conflict effect in the Stroop task, only 6 Hz audio-visual stimulation improved the amplitude of the N2 component and decreased the conflict score. Although rhythmic audio-visual stimulation did not enhance response inhibition, it improved conflict inhibition.</p>

                <p>The corpus callosum is composed of several subregions, distinct in cellular and functional organization. This organization scheme may render these subregions differentially vulnerable to the aging process. Callosal integrity may be further compromised by cardiovascular risk factors, which negatively influence white matter health. Here, we test for heterochronicity of aging, hypothesizing an anteroposterior gradient of vulnerability to aging that may be altered by the effects of cardiovascular health. In 174 healthy adults across the adult lifespan (mean age = 53.56 &plusmn; 18.90; range, 20&ndash;94 years old, 58.62% women), pulse pressure (calculated as participant's systolic minus diastolic blood pressure) was assessed to determine cardiovascular risk. A deterministic tractography approach via diffusion-weighted imaging was utilized to extract fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD) from each of five callosal subregions, serving as estimates of microstructural health. General linear models tested the effects of age, hypertension, and pulse pressure on these cross-sectional metrics. We observed no significant effect of hypertensive diagnosis on callosal microstructure. We found a significant main effect of age and an age&ndash;pulse pressure interaction whereby older age and elevated pulse pressure were associated with poorer FA, AD, and RD. Age effects revealed nonlinear components and occurred along an anteroposterior gradient of severity in the callosum. This gradient disappeared when pulse pressure was considered. These results indicate that age-related deterioration across the callosum is regionally variable and that pulse pressure, a proxy of arterial stiffness, exacerbates this aging pattern in a large lifespan cohort.</p>

                <p>by Tara Hameed, Natasha Motsi, Elaine Bignell, Reiko J. Tanaka</p>

Quantifying fungal growth underpins our ability to effectively treat severe fungal infections. Current methods quantify fungal growth rates from time-course morphology-specific data, such as hyphal length data. However, automated large-scale collection of such data lies beyond the scope of most clinical microbiology laboratories. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model of fungal growth to estimate morphology-specific growth rates from easy-to-collect, but indirect, optical density (OD<sub>600</sub>) data of <i>Aspergillus fumigatus</i> growth (filamentous fungus). Our method accounts for OD<sub>600</sub> being an indirect measure by explicitly including the relationship between the indirect OD<sub>600</sub> measurements and the calibrating true fungal growth in the model. Therefore, the method does not require <i>de novo</i> generation of calibration data. Our model outperformed reference models at fitting to and predicting OD<sub>600</sub> growth curves and overcame observed discrepancies between morphology-specific rates inferred from OD<sub>600</sub> versus directly measured data in reference models that did not include calibration.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012095">Interpretable online network dictionary learning for inferring long-range chromatin interactions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Vishal Rana, Jianhao Peng, Chao Pan, Hanbaek Lyu, Albert Cheng, Minji Kim, Olgica Milenkovic</p>

Dictionary learning (DL), implemented via matrix factorization (MF), is commonly used in computational biology to tackle ubiquitous clustering problems. The method is favored due to its conceptual simplicity and relatively low computational complexity. However, DL algorithms produce results that lack interpretability in terms of real biological data. Additionally, they are not optimized for graph-structured data and hence often fail to handle them in a scalable manner.
In order to address these limitations, we propose a novel DL algorithm called <i>online convex network dictionary learning</i> (online cvxNDL). Unlike classical DL algorithms, online cvxNDL is implemented via MF and designed to handle extremely large datasets by virtue of its online nature. Importantly, it enables the interpretation of dictionary elements, which serve as cluster representatives, through convex combinations of real measurements. Moreover, the algorithm can be applied to data with a network structure by incorporating specialized subnetwork sampling techniques.
To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we apply cvxNDL on 3D-genome RNAPII ChIA-Drop data with the goal of identifying important long-range interaction patterns (long-range dictionary elements). ChIA-Drop probes higher-order interactions, and produces data in the form of hypergraphs whose nodes represent genomic fragments. The hyperedges represent observed physical contacts. Our hypergraph model analysis has the objective of creating an interpretable dictionary of long-range interaction patterns that accurately represent global chromatin physical contact maps. Through the use of dictionary information, one can also associate the contact maps with RNA transcripts and infer cellular functions.
To accomplish the task at hand, we focus on RNAPII-enriched ChIA-Drop data from <i>Drosophila Melanogaster</i> S2 cell lines. Our results offer two key insights. First, we demonstrate that online cvxNDL retains the accuracy of classical DL (MF) methods while simultaneously ensuring unique interpretability and scalability. Second, we identify distinct collections of proximal and distal interaction patterns involving chromatin elements shared by related processes across different chromosomes, as well as patterns unique to specific chromosomes. To associate the dictionary elements with biological properties of the corresponding chromatin regions, we employ Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and perform multiple RNA coexpression studies.

Cells use signaling pathways to sense and respond to their environments. The transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) pathway produces context-specific responses. Here, we combined modeling and experimental analysis to study the dependence of the output of the TGF-β pathway on the abundance of signaling molecules in the pathway. We showed that the TGF-β pathway processes the variation of TGF-β receptor abundance using Liebig’s law of the minimum, meaning that the output-modifying factor is the signaling protein that is most limited, to determine signaling responses across cell types and in single cells. We found that the abundance of either the type I (TGFBR1) or type II (TGFBR2) TGF-β receptor determined the responses of cancer cell lines, such that the receptor with relatively low abundance dictates the response. Furthermore, nuclear SMAD2 signaling correlated with the abundance of TGF-β receptor in single cells depending on the relative expression levels of TGFBR1 and TGFBR2. A similar control principle could govern the heterogeneity of signaling responses in other signaling pathways.

The eukaryotic mRNA life cycle includes transcription, nuclear mRNA export and degradation. To quantify all these processes simultaneously, we perform thiol-linked alkylation after metabolic labeling of RNA with 4-thiouridine (4sU), followed by sequencing of RNA (SLAM-seq) in the nuclear and cytosolic compartments of human cancer cells. We develop a model that reliably quantifies mRNA-specific synthesis, nuclear export, and nuclear and cytosolic degradation rates on a genome-wide scale. We find that nuclear degradation of polyadenylated mRNA is negligible and nuclear mRNA export is slow, while cytosolic mRNA degradation is comparatively fast. Consequently, an mRNA molecule generally spends most of its life in the nucleus. We also observe large differences in the nuclear export rates of different 3’UTR transcript isoforms. Furthermore, we identify genes whose expression is abruptly induced upon metabolic labeling. These transcripts are exported substantially faster than average mRNAs, suggesting the existence of alternative export pathways. Our results highlight nuclear mRNA export as a limiting factor in mRNA metabolism and gene regulation.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002594">Robust genetic codes enhance protein evolvability</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hana Rozhoňová, Carlos Martí-Gómez, David M. McCandlish, Joshua L. Payne</p>

The standard genetic code defines the rules of translation for nearly every life form on Earth. It also determines the amino acid changes accessible via single-nucleotide mutations, thus influencing protein evolvability—the ability of mutation to bring forth adaptive variation in protein function. One of the most striking features of the standard genetic code is its robustness to mutation, yet it remains an open question whether such robustness facilitates or frustrates protein evolvability. To answer this question, we use data from massively parallel sequence-to-function assays to construct and analyze 6 empirical adaptive landscapes under hundreds of thousands of rewired genetic codes, including those of codon compression schemes relevant to protein engineering and synthetic biology. We find that robust genetic codes tend to enhance protein evolvability by rendering smooth adaptive landscapes with few peaks, which are readily accessible from throughout sequence space. However, the standard genetic code is rarely exceptional in this regard, because many alternative codes render smoother landscapes than the standard code. By constructing low-dimensional visualizations of these landscapes, which each comprise more than 16 million mRNA sequences, we show that such alternative codes radically alter the topological features of the network of high-fitness genotypes. Whereas the genetic codes that optimize evolvability depend to some extent on the detailed relationship between amino acid sequence and protein function, we also uncover general design principles for engineering nonstandard genetic codes for enhanced and diminished evolvability, which may facilitate directed protein evolution experiments and the bio-containment of synthetic organisms, respectively.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002195">Acute stress during witnessing injustice shifts third-party interventions from punishing the perpetrator to helping the victim</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Huagen Wang, Xiaoyan Wu, Jiahua Xu, Ruida Zhu, Sihui Zhang, Zhenhua Xu, Xiaoqin Mai, Shaozheng Qin, Chao Liu</p>

People tend to intervene in others’ injustices by either punishing the transgressor or helping the victim. Injustice events often occur under stressful circumstances. However, how acute stress affects a third party’s intervention in injustice events remains open. Here, we show a stress-induced shift in third parties’ willingness to engage in help instead of punishment by acting on emotional salience and central-executive and theory-of-mind networks. Acute stress decreased the third party’s willingness to punish the violator and the severity of the punishment and increased their willingness to help the victim. Computational modeling revealed a shift in preference of justice recovery from punishment the offender toward help the victim under stress. This finding is consistent with the increased dorsolateral prefrontal engagement observed with higher amygdala activity and greater connectivity with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in the stress group. A brain connectivity theory-of-mind network predicted stress-induced justice recovery in punishment. Our findings suggest a neurocomputational mechanism of how acute stress reshapes third parties’ decisions by reallocating neural resources in emotional, executive, and mentalizing networks to inhibit punishment bias and decrease punishment severity.

                Vitamin D functions as a prohormone that promotes bone mineralization by regulating calcium and phosphate levels in the skeletal system. It is a fat-soluble vitamin that is required for immunomodulation, cytokine regulation, and cell proliferation. As a result, Vitamin D is a powerful hormone with pleiotropic effects that improve overall health. Sepsis is the leading cause of death in critically unwell people. According to a recent study, numerous trace minerals and nutrients have the ability to alter the human body, and supplementing these nutrients can improve the prognosis of sepsis patients. A considerable number of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) have low vitamin D levels, a frequent condition that can increase the risk of infectious diseases. According to various studies, severely ill patients admitted to the ICU who have a vitamin D deficiency are at a higher risk of requiring mechanical ventilation and facing a higher likelihood of mortality. Nonetheless, the connection between insufficient vitamin D levels and mortality in sepsis patients remains a topic of debate.

<p>We investigate the association between brain entropy (BEN) estimated from resting-state fMRI and pain intensity in a sample including young adults, middle-aged participants, and elders. Main results show that the interaction between age and pain intensity is related to BEN increase in pain-related brain regions.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Pain is a multidimensional subjective experience sustained by multiple brain regions involved in different aspects of pain experience. We used brain entropy (BEN) estimated from resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) data to investigate the neural correlates of pain experience. BEN was estimated from rs-fMRI data provided by two datasets with different age range: the Human Connectome Project-Young Adult (HCP-YA) and the Human Connectome project-Aging (HCP-A) datasets. Retrospective assessment of experienced pain intensity was retrieved from both datasets. No main effect of pain intensity was observed. The interaction between pain and age, however, was related to increased BEN in several pain-related brain regions, reflecting greater variability of spontaneous brain activity. Dividing the sample into a young adult group (YG) and a middle age-aging group (MAG) resulted in two divergent patterns of pain–BEN association: In the YG, pain intensity was related to reduced BEN in brain regions involved in the sensory processing of pain; in the MAG, pain was associated with increased BEN in areas related to both sensory and cognitive aspects of pain experience.</p>

                A recent study by Hadler and colleagues uncovered a novel form of plasticity of gamma oscillations in an ex vivo hippocampal slice preparation which they term 'gamma potentiation'. We discuss the potential cellular mechanisms of this form of plasticity and its functional and translational implications.

                Spyropoulos et al. show that attention modulates V1-V4 firing rates and gamma phase-locking via distinct feedforward and feedback pathways. Firing-rate modulation is strongest and earliest in Layers II/III of V4, consistent with feedback. Gamma phase-locking to feedforward V1 gamma is confined to fast-spiking interneurons in Layer IV of V4.

They find that stress responses are heterogeneously activated in the microenvironment and highly activated near cancer cells. They identify specific subsets of cancer-associated fibroblasts and pericytes showing distinct activation of the oxidative stress response.

ESYT1-driven repression of GPR133 signaling is relieved by increases in cytosolic Ca2+. This interaction may be relevant to the pathogenesis of glioblastoma.

                Synaptic transmission is energetically costly. Myeong et al. demonstrate that hippocampal synapses can bypass glycolysis using oxidative fuels. Mitochondria, rather than glycolysis, control the spatiotemporal properties of vesicle release and ultrafast endocytosis. Mitochondrial localization in nerve terminals enhances vesicle release and reuptake, thus representing a form of synaptic plasticity.

">Impact of microchannel width on axons for brain-on-chip applications</a></h4>

              
                Technologies for axon guidance for in vitro disease models and bottom up investigations are increasingly being used in neuroscience research. One of the most prevalent patterning methods is using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microstructures due to compatibility with microscopy and electrophysiology which enables systematic tracking of axon development with precision and efficiency. Previous investigations of these guidance platforms have noted axons tend to follow edges and avoid sharp turns; however, the specific impact of spatial constraints remains only partially explored. We investigated the influence of microchannel width beyond a constriction point, as well as the number of available microchannels, on axon growth dynamics. Further, by manipulating the size of micron/submicron-sized PDMS tunnels we investigated the space restriction that prevents growth cone penetration showing that restrictions smaller than 350nm were sufficient to exclude axons. This research offers insights into the interplay of spatial constraints, axon development, and neural behavior. The findings are important for designing in vitro platforms and in vivo neural interfaces for both fundamental neuroscience and translational applications in rapidly evolving neural implant technologies.

">Methodology for isolation of serum, cerebrospinal fluid, and hippocampal neuron proteins from rat and their analysis using mass spectrometry-based shotgun proteomics</a></h4>

              
                Emerging interests in the field of research related to diseases such as Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease, cognition, and other mental health-related disorders have prompted a need for a common method for the isolation of serum, CSF, and hippocampus. The hippocampus is responsible for learning and memory. It can be affected by various neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, the process of collecting samples such as CSF and hippocampal neurons is challenging, especially for small animals like rats. We have presented here a method for the isolation of serum, CSF, and hippocampal neurons that can be used for its downstream applications such as proteomics. We have used high-speed centrifugation instruments and density gradient centrifugation methods, which are easy to follow. Additionally, we have tested the proteins identified through mass spectrometry. Our method enables the study of proteins in serum, CSF, and neural cells for researching protein cross-talks and neurological disorder mechanisms.

">A linear sensorimotor transformation accounts for response range-dependent biases in human heading estimation</a></h4>

              
                Accurate estimation of heading direction from optic flow is a crucial aspect of human spatial perception. Previous studies have shown that humans are typically biased in their estimates of heading directions, but the reported results are inconsistent. While some studies found that humans generally underestimate heading direction (central bias), others find the opposite, an overestimation of heading direction (peripheral bias). We conducted three psychophysical experiments showing that these conflicting findings do not reflect inherent differences in heading perception. Rather we found that they are caused by the different sizes of the response range that participants were allowed to utilize when reporting their estimates. Notably, we show that participants' heading estimates monotonically scale with the size of the response range, leading to underestimation for small and overestimation for large response ranges. Additionally, neither the speed profile of the optic flow pattern nor the response method (mouse vs. keyboard) significantly affected participants' estimates. Furthermore, we derived a Bayesian observer model to quantitatively account for participants' estimation behavior. The model assumes an efficient sensory encoding of heading direction according to the natural prior of freely behaving humans. In addition, the model incorporates a motor stage that linearly maps the percept to the reported estimate with a scaling factor that depends on the size of the response range. This perception-action model accurately predicts participants' estimates both in terms of mean and variance. Our findings underscore that human heading perception follows efficient Bayesian inference; differences in participants' reported estimates can be solely attributed to differences in linear mapping from percept to probe response.

">Effects of Concussion on the Relative Contributions of Sensorimotor Memories during Adaptation to Unpredictable Spring-Like Loads</a></h4>

              
                We examined the extent to which concussion impacts how implicit sensorimotor memories are used to compensate for changes in hand-held loads during goal-directed reaching. Recently concussed individuals performed computerized cognition tests and a robotic test of sensorimotor adaptation on three occasions: as soon as possible after injury; after clearance to return to activity; three months after injury. Non-concussed individuals (controls) were tested at inter-session intervals mimicking concussed group intervals. During robotic testing, subjects grasped the handle of a horizontal planar robot while reaching repeatedly to a target. The robot exerted spring-like forces that changed unpredictably between trials; this allowed us to estimate contributions of implicit sensorimotor memories to trial-by-trial performance by fitting a computational model to the time series of reach errors and robot forces. Symptom severity varied considerably within the concussed group at the first session. Computerized cognition tests revealed longer reaction times in the concussed group relative to control group in Session 1 only. Concussed subjects likewise had slower reaction time in the reaching task during the first but not later sessions. Computational modeling found abnormally high values of effective limb compliance in concussed individuals relative to the control group in the first session only, but did not find group differences in how sensorimotor memories contribute to reach adaptation in any session. Analysis of control group models identified a practice effect affecting the memory coefficients that may have masked initial effects of concussion on how implicit memories contribute to sensorimotor adaptation. Although a practice effect and a heterogeneous concussed cohort preclude strong conclusions, our findings suggest procedural improvements that may decrease the robotic test's sensitivity to practice effects and increase its sensitivity to concussion-related changes in how implicit memories contribute to sensorimotor adaptation to unpredictable hand-held loads during reaching.

">A Demographic-Conditioned Variational Autoencoder for fMRI Distribution Sampling and Removal of Confounds</a></h4>

              
                Objective: fMRI and derived measures such as functional connectivity (FC) have been used to predict brain age, general fluid intelligence, psychiatric disease status, and preclinical neurodegenerative disease. However, it is not always clear that all demographic confounds, such as age, sex, and race, have been removed from fMRI data. Additionally, many fMRI datasets are restricted to authorized researchers, making dissemination of these valuable data sources challenging. Methods: We create a variational autoencoder (VAE)-based model, DemoVAE, to decorrelate fMRI features from demographics and generate high-quality synthetic fMRI data based on user-supplied demographics. We train and validate our model using two large, widely used datasets, the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) and Bipolar and Schizophrenia Network for Intermediate Phenotypes (BSNIP). Results: We find that DemoVAE recapitulates group differences in fMRI data while capturing the full breadth of individual variations. Significantly, we also find that most clinical and computerized battery fields that are correlated with fMRI data are not correlated with DemoVAE latents. An exception are several fields related to schizophrenia medication and symptom severity. Conclusion: Our model generates fMRI data that captures the full distribution of FC better than traditional VAE or GAN models. We also find that most prediction using fMRI data is dependent on correlation with, and prediction of, demographics. Significance: Our DemoVAE model allows for generation of high quality synthetic data conditioned on subject demographics as well as the removal of the confounding effects of demographics. We identify that FC-based prediction tasks are highly influenced by demographic confounds.

">Functional brain networks predicting sustained attention are not specific to perceptual modality</a></h4>

              
                Sustained attention is essential for daily life and can be directed to information from different perceptual modalities including audition and vision. Recently, cognitive neuroscience has aimed to identify neural predictors of behavior that generalize across datasets. Prior work has shown strong generalization of models trained to predict individual differences in sustained attention performance from patterns of fMRI functional connectivity. However, it is an open question whether predictions of sustained attention are specific to the perceptual modality in which they are trained. In the current study we test whether connectome-based models predict performance on attention tasks performed in different modalities. We show first that a predefined network trained to predict adults' visual sustained attention performance generalizes to predict auditory sustained attention performance in three independent datasets (N1=29, N2=62, N3=17; both sexes). Next, we train new network models to predict performance on visual and auditory attention tasks separately. We find that functional networks are largely modality-general, with both model-unique and shared model features predicting sustained attention performance in independent datasets regardless of task modality. Results support the supposition that visual and auditory sustained attention rely on shared neural mechanisms and demonstrate robust generalizability of whole-brain functional network models of sustained attention.

">FlyBox: A Flexible Open-Source Behavior Monitoring System</a></h4>

              
                Over the past two decades, the vast majority of circadian behavior in Drosophila has been recorded in Drosophila Activity Monitor (DAM) boards. Though simple and robust, locomotor behavior recording via DAM boards can be prohibitively expensive, especially when taking incubator costs into consideration. Furthermore, their simplicity limits their experimental options and resolution. Here, we present the FlyBox: a simple, open-source benchtop locomotor activity recording system. FlyBox was designed to monitor activity in animals loaded into a standard laboratory multi-well plate. It features light-tight construction and multiple programmable LEDs for simulating day/night cycles and optogenetic manipulation. In total, a single FlyBox costs approximately $750 to build and around two days of labor. In addition, we also present the FlyBoxScanner software to simplify activity monitoring while maintaining compatibility with DAM analysis software. FlyBox is an attractive and affordable package for behavior monitoring that also offers considerable room for customization. Materials and instructions for the FlyBox are available at https://github.com/Rosbash-Lab-FlyBox/FlyBox, and FlyBoxScanner is available at https://github.com/jose-elias-alvarez/flybox-scanner.

">Visual network modularity and communication alterations in ADHD subtypes: evidence from source localized EEG and graph theoretical analysis</a></h4>

              
                The neurobiological basis of ADHD and its subtypes remains unclear, with inconsistent findings from studies using electrophysiology and neuroimaging. Some studies suggest ADHD-I is a distinct disorder, but there is also evidence of similar neural basis in ADHD-I and ADHD-C subtypes. This study investigates the neural basis of ADHD and its subtypes using a subnetwork modularity approach based on graph theoretical analysis of EEG data from 35 children aged 7-11. EEG was recorded in the eyes open condition and preprocessed. After preprocessing, data was analyzed using LORETA algorithm to estimate current densities in 84 regions of interest (ROIs) in the cortex and calculate functional connectivity between these ROIs in different EEG frequency bands. Then, we evaluated modularity of five functional brain networks (default mode, central control, salience, visual, and sensorimotor) using Newman modularity algorithm. Further, we evaluated edge betweenness centrality to assess communications between these functional brain networks. The study found that different brain networks have modularity in certain frequency bands, and ADHD groups showed reduced modularity of the visual network compared to normal groups in the alpha1 band (8-10 Hz). The communication between the visual network and other brain networks, except the salience network, was also reduced in ADHD groups (in the alpha1 band). However, there were no significant differences in the modularity of brain networks and communication among them between two ADHD subtypes. The results suggest a novel mechanism for ADHD involving lower intrinsic modularity in the visual network, disturbed communication between the visual network and other networks, and potential impact on the function of control and sensorimotor networks. Further, our results suggest that there may be a common neural basis for both subtypes, involving a shared disturbance in the modularity and connectivity of the ventral network. This supports the idea that ADHD-I and ADHD-C are subtypes within the same category and contradicts previous studies that suggest they are separate disorders.

">Feature selective adaptation of numerosity perception</a></h4>

              
                Perceptual adaptation has been used to infer the existence of numerosity detectors, which allow humans to quickly estimate the number of objects in a scene. While adaptation was originally thought to affect numerosity perception regardless of the low-level features of the items, a recent study demonstrated that adaptation is more pronounced when the adapting and adapted (test) stimuli share the same color, compared to when they were colored differently. In this study we explored whether such adaptation reduction depends on a novelty effect induced by changes in stimulus features or whether this effect is observed only when implying an identity change of the stimuli. To this aim, we performed six experiments in which numerosity adaptation was investigated in conditions in which adapting and adapted stimuli were either matched or differed for several low-level (color, luminance, shape, and motion) or high-level (letters' identity, face emotions) features. Numerosity adaptation was consistently observed across all conditions, but it was reduced when adaptor and test differed in color, luminance and shape. However, when stimuli differed in their motion profile, a very salient perceptual change that does not imply a change in items' identity, adaptation selectivity vanished. Moreover, adaptation selectivity was not observed when items' identity was changed by spatial rotations of the same stimulus (letters) or when stimuli were matched for the global configuration (face outline) but differed for the arrangement of local features (mouth, nose, eyes). Interestingly, image dissimilarity between test and adaptor, as quantified by Gabor filters simulating a simplified model of the primary visual cortex, nicely predicted the strength of numerosity adaptation across all conditions. Overall, changes in stimulus identity defined by low-level features, rather than novelty in general, determined the strength of the adaptation effects, provided that the changes were readily noticeable. Our findings suggest that numerosity mechanisms may be able to operate on segregated and categorized visual items in addition to the total quantity of the set, with part of the aftereffects induced by numerosity adaptation occurring after feature-binding.

">ninjaCap: A fully customizable and 3D printable headgear for fNIRS and EEG brain imaging</a></h4>

              
                Significance: Accurate sensor placement is vital for non-invasive brain imaging, particularly for functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and diffuse optical tomography (DOT), which lack standardized layouts like EEG. Custom, manually prepared probe layouts on textile caps are often imprecise and labor-intensive. Aim: We introduce a method for creating personalized, 3D-printed headgear, enabling accurate translation of 3D brain coordinates to 2D printable panels for custom fNIRS and EEG sensor layouts, reducing costs and manual labor. Approach: Our approach uses atlas-based or subject-specific head models and a spring-relaxation algorithm for flattening 3D coordinates onto 2D panels, using 10-5 EEG coordinates for reference. This process ensures geometrical fidelity, crucial for accurate probe placement. Probe geometries and holder types are customizable and printed directly on the cap, making the approach agnostic to instrument manufacturers and probe types. Results: Our ninjaCap method offers 2.2 {+/-} 1.5 mm probe placement accuracy. Over the last five years, we have developed and validated this approach with over 50 cap models and 500 participants. A cloud-based ninjaCap generation pipeline along with detailed instructions is now available at openfnirs.org. Conclusions: The ninjaCap marks a significant advancement in creating individualized neuroimaging caps, reducing costs and labor while improving probe placement accuracy, thereby reducing variability in research.

">Alternative splicing across the C. elegans nervous system</a></h4>

              
                Alternative splicing is a key mechanism that shapes neuronal transcriptomes, helping to define neuronal identity and modulate function. Here, we present an atlas of alternative splicing across the nervous system of Caenorhabditis elegans. Our analysis identifies novel alternative splicing in key neuronal genes such as unc-40/DCC and sax-3/ROBO. Globally, we delineate patterns of differential alternative splicing in almost 2,000 genes, and estimate that a quarter of neuronal genes undergo differential splicing. We introduce a web interface for examination of splicing patterns across neuron types. We explore the relationship between neuron type and splicing patterns, and between splicing patterns and differential gene expression. We identify RNA features that correlate with differential alternative splicing, and describe the enrichment of microexons. Finally, we compute a splicing regulatory network that can be used to generate hypotheses on the regulation and targets of alternative splicing in neurons.

">A neuroimaging dataset during sequential color qualia similarity judgments with and without reports</a></h4>

              
                Recent neuroscientific research has advanced our understanding of consciousness, yet the connection between specific qualitative aspects of consciousness, known as "qualia," and particular brain regions or networks remains elusive. Traditional methods that rely on verbal descriptions from participants pose challenges in neuroimaging studies. To address this, our group has introduced a novel "qualia structure" paradigm that leverages exhaustive, structural, and relational comparisons among qualia instead of verbal reports. In this study, we present the first fMRI dataset that captures relational similarity judgments among two out of nine color qualia per trial from 35 participants. This dataset also includes a "no-report" condition in half of the trials to assess the impact of overt reporting. Additionally, each participant's color discriminability was evaluated with a hue test conducted outside the scanner. Our data offer valuable insights into the brain functions associated with color qualia and contribute to a deeper understanding of the neural foundations of consciousness.

">The number of effectors limits the relative sleep gain: Insights from seven finger tapping experiments</a></h4>

              
                The role of sleep in motor memory consolidation is still a matter of ongoing debate. A classic task to investigate mechanisms of motor memory consolidation is the finger tapping task, which reliably shows small effects in performance enhancement after sleep but not after a corresponding wake interval. However, variants of the task with a varying number of effectors (e.g., one hand) failed to demonstrate this effect on motor memory consolidation. Thus, in a series of seven experiments we investigate five variants of the classic finger tapping task in which the number of effectors (1 or 2 hands combined with 1, 2 or 4 fingers) used to perform the task are systematically varied. For the groups, where sleep immediately followed learning, a beneficial effect of sleep in comparison with a corresponding wake interval was found, except for the task variant where the finger tapping task was performed with 1 hand and 1 finger. However, no clear-cut pattern could be identified for the numbers of effectors used to perform the task and the magnitude of offline motor memory consolidation. Furthermore, for groups with an intervening wake interval between learning and sleep no differences between the post-sleep and post-wake gain were observed.

">Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS)-induced changes of resting-state brain entropy (BEN)</a></h4>

              
                Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) is a novel protocol of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). While iTBS has shown better therapeutic effects for depression than conventional high-frequency rTMS (HF-rTMS), its underlying neuronal mechanism remains elusive. Brain entropy (BEN), a measure of irregularity of brain activity, has recently emerged as a novel marker of regional brain activity. Our previous studies have shown the sensitivity of BEN to depression and HF-rTMS, suggesting BEN as a sensitive tool for understanding the brain mechanism of iTBS. To assess this possibility, we calculated BEN using resting state fMRI data provided by an open dataset in OpenNeuro. Sixteen healthy participants underwent 600 pulses of iTBS applied over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC) at two intensities (90% and 120% of individual resting motor threshold (rMT)) on separate days. We assessed the pre-post stimulation BEN difference and its associations with neurotransmitter receptor and transporter binding maps. Our results showed that subthreshold iTBS (90% rMT) decreased striatal BEN, while suprathreshold iTBS (120% rMT) increased striatal BEN. We also found significant differences in the spatial correlation between BEN changes induced by different stimulation intensities and various neurotransmitters. These results suggest that differences in BEN caused by iTBS stimulation intensity may be related to the release of other neurotransmitters. The study underscores the significance of iTBS stimulation intensity and provides a basis for future clinical investigations to identify stimulation intensities with good therapeutic benefits.

">The cost of behavioral flexibility: reversal learning driven by a spiking neural network</a></h4>

              
                To survive in a changing world, animals often need to suppress an obsolete behavior and acquire a new one. This process is known as reversal learning (RL). The neural mechanisms underlying RL in spatial navigation have received limited attention and it remains unclear what neural mechanisms maintain behavioral flexibility. We extended an existing closed-loop simulator of spatial navigation and learning, based on spiking neural networks (Ghazinouri et al. 2023). The activity of place cells and boundary cells were fed as inputs to action selection neurons, which drove the movement of the agent. When the agent reached the goal, behavior was reinforced with spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) coupled with an eligibility trace which marks synaptic connections for future reward-based updates. The modeled RL task had an ABA design, where the goal was switched between two locations A and B every 10 trials. Agents using symmetric STDP excel initially on finding target A, but fail to find target B after the goal switch, persevering on target A. Using asymmetric STDP, using many small place fields, and injecting short noise pulses to action selection neurons were effective in driving spatial exploration in the absence of rewards, which ultimately led to finding target B. However, this flexibility came at the price of slower learning and lower performance. Our work shows three examples of neural mechanisms that achieve flexibility at the behavioral level, each with different characteristic costs.

">Therapeutic dose prediction of α5-GABA receptor modulation from simulated EEG of depression severity</a></h4>

              
                Treatment for major depressive disorder (depression) often has partial efficacy and a large portion of patients are treatment resistant. Recent studies implicate reduced somatostatin (SST) interneuron inhibition in depression, and new pharmacology boosting this inhibition via positive allosteric modulators of 5-GABAA receptors (5-PAM) offers a promising effective treatment. However, testing the effect of 5-PAM on human brain activity is limited, meriting the use of detailed simulations. We utilized our previous detailed computational models of human depression microcircuits with reduced SST interneuron inhibition and 5-PAM effects, to simulate EEG of virtual subjects across depression severity and 5-PAM doses. We developed machine learning models that predicted optimal dose from EEG with high accuracy and recovered microcircuit activity and EEG. This study provides dose prediction models for 5-PAM administration based on EEG biomarkers of depression severity. Given limitations in doing the above in the living human brain, the results and tools we developed will facilitate translation of 5-PAM treatment to clinical use.

">Balancing postural control and motor inhibition during gait initiation</a></h4>

              
                This study explores the link between cancelling a prepared gait initiation in response to sudden environmental changes and maintaining body stability. To address this, we developed a gait initiation version of the Stop Signal Task (SST), a widely used tool for evaluating motor inhibition during different forms of action control. To understand the relevance of postural control during gait initiation and suppression, we evaluated the underlying changes in anticipatory postural adjustments (APA). We report that specific trial-level variables, like the time to initiate or cancel stepping, interacted with biomechanical factors such as the center of mass displacement relative to the base of support, impacting performance. We identified a critical biomechanical threshold beyond which halting the movement became improbable. These findings underscore the tight connection between limb action control and overall body equilibrium, providing a framework within an established motor control paradigm. By incorporating biomechanical elements into this model, we demonstrate its efficacy for simulating complex real-life scenarios. This approach defines essential variables for studying neural correlations between action and postural control, guiding the development of tools for injury prevention and rehabilitation devices for individuals with movement and posture impairments, including those suffering of neurodegenerative disorders.

">DeepVID v2: Self-Supervised Denoising with Decoupled Spatiotemporal Enhancement for Low-Photon Voltage Imaging</a></h4>

              
                Significance: Voltage imaging is a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of neuronal activities in the brain. However, voltage imaging data are fundamentally corrupted by severe Poisson noise in the low-photon regime, which hinders the accurate extraction of neuronal activities. Self-supervised deep learning denoising methods have shown great potential in addressing the challenges in low-photon voltage imaging without the need for ground truth, but usually suffer from the tradeoff between spatial and temporal performance. Aim: We present DeepVID v2, a novel self-supervised denoising framework with decoupled spatial and temporal enhancement capability to significantly augment low-photon voltage imaging. Approach: DeepVID v2 is built on our original DeepVID framework, which performs frame-based denoising by utilizing a sequence of frames around the central frame targeted for denoising to leverage temporal information and ensure consistency. The network further integrates multiple blind pixels in the central frame to enrich the learning of local spatial information. Additionally, DeepVID v2 introduces a new edge extraction branch to capture fine structural details in order to learn high spatial resolution information. Results: We demonstrate that DeepVID v2 is able to overcome the tradeoff between spatial and temporal performance, and achieve superior denoising capability in resolving both high-resolution spatial structures and rapid temporal neuronal activities. We further show that DeepVID v2 is able to generalize to different imaging conditions, including time-series measurements with various signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and in extreme low-photon conditions. Conclusions: Our results underscore DeepVID v2 as a promising tool for enhancing voltage imaging. This framework has the potential to generalize to other low-photon imaging modalities and greatly facilitate the study of neuronal activities in the brain.

                Purpose: Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of mutant huntingtin (mHTT) aggregates is a potential tool to monitor disease progression as well as the efficacy of candidate therapeutic interventions for Huntington's disease (HD). To date, the focus has been mainly on the investigation of 11C radioligands; however, favorable 18F radiotracers will facilitate future clinical translation. This work aimed at characterizing the novel [18F]CHDI-650 PET radiotracer using a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches in a mouse model of HD. Methods: After characterizing [18F]CHDI-650 using in vitro autoradiography, we assessed in vivo plasma and brain radiotracer stability as well as kinetics through dynamic PET imaging in the heterozygous (HET) zQ175DN mouse model of HD and wild-type (WT) littermates at 9 months of age. Additionally, we performed a head-to-head comparison study at 3 months with the previously published [11C]CHDI-180R radioligand. Results: Plasma and brain radiometabolite profiles indicated a suitable metabolic profile for in vivo imaging of [18F]CHDI-650. Both in vitro autoradiography and in vivo [18F]CHDI-650 PET imaging at 9 months of age demonstrated a significant genotype effect (p<0.0001) despite the poor test-retest reliability. [18F]CHDI-650 PET imaging at 3 months of age displayed higher differentiation between genotypes when compared to [11C]CHDI-180R. Conclusion: Overall, [18F]CHDI-650 allows for discrimination between HET and WT zQ175DN mice at 9 and 3 months of age. [18F]CHDI-650 represents the first suitable 18F radioligand to image mHTT aggregates in mice and its clinical evaluation is underway.

">Functional benefits of continuous vs. categorical listening strategies on the neural encoding and perception of noise-degraded speech</a></h4>

              
                Acoustic information in speech changes continuously, yet listeners form discrete perceptual categories to ease the demands of perception. Being a more continuous/gradient as opposed to a discrete/categorical listener may be further advantageous for understanding speech in noise by increasing perceptual flexibility and resolving ambiguity. The degree to which a listener's responses to a continuum of speech sounds are categorical versus continuous can be quantified using visual analog scaling (VAS) during speech labeling tasks. Here, we recorded event-related brain potentials (ERPs) to vowels along an acoustic-phonetic continuum (/u/ to /a/) while listeners categorized phonemes in both clean and noise conditions. Behavior was assessed using standard two alternative forced choice (2AFC) and VAS paradigms to evaluate categorization under task structures that promote discrete (2AFC) vs. continuous (VAS) hearing, respectively. Behaviorally, identification curves were steeper under 2AFC vs. VAS categorization but were relatively immune to noise, suggesting robust access to abstract, phonetic categories even under signal degradation. Behavioral slopes were positively correlated with listeners' QuickSIN scores, suggesting a behavioral advantage for speech in noise comprehension conferred by gradient listening strategy. At the neural level, electrode level data revealed P2 peak amplitudes of the ERPs were modulated by task and noise; responses were larger under VAS vs. 2AFC categorization and showed larger noise-related delay in latency in the VAS vs. 2AFC condition. More gradient responders also had smaller shifts in ERP latency with noise, suggesting their neural encoding of speech was more resilient to noise degradation. Interestingly, source-resolved ERPs showed that more gradient listening was also correlated with stronger neural responses in left superior temporal gyrus. Our results demonstrate that listening strategy (i.e., being a discrete vs. continuous listener) modulates the categorical organization of speech and behavioral success, with continuous/gradient listening being more advantageous to speech in noise perception.

                Edge time series decompose functional connections into their fine-scale, framewise contributions. Previous studies have demonstrated that global high-amplitude "events" in edge time series can be clustered into distinct patterns. To date, however, it is unknown whether events and their patterns change or persist throughout the human lifespan. Here, we directly address this question by clustering event frames using the Nathan Kline Institute-Rockland sample that includes subjects with ages spanning the human lifespan. We find evidence of two main clusters that appear across subjects and age groups. We also find that these patterns of clusters systematically change in magnitude and frequency with age. Our results also demonstrate that such event clusters have distinct, heterogeneous relationships with structural connectivity-derived communication measures, which change with age. Finally, event clusters were found to outperform non-events in predicting phenotypes regarding human intelligence and achievement. Collectively, our findings fill several gaps in current knowledge about co-fluctuation patterns in edge time series and human aging, setting the stage for future investigation into the causal origins of changes in functional connectivity throughout the human lifespan.

">Impaired sleep-dependent memory consolidation predicted by reduced sleep spindles in Rolandic epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                Background and Objectives: Sleep spindles are prominent thalamocortical brain oscillations during sleep that have been mechanistically linked to sleep-dependent memory consolidation in animal models and healthy controls. Sleep spindles are decreased in Rolandic epilepsy and related sleep-activated epileptic encephalopathies. We investigate the relationship between sleep spindle deficits and deficient sleep dependent memory consolidation in children with Rolandic epilepsy. Methods: In this prospective case-control study, children were trained and tested on a validated probe of memory consolidation, the motor sequence task (MST). Sleep spindles were measured from high-density EEG during a 90-minute nap opportunity between MST training and testing using a validated automated detector. Results: Twenty-three children with Rolandic epilepsy (14 with resolved disease), and 19 age- and sex-matched controls were enrolled. Children with active Rolandic epilepsy had decreased memory consolidation compared to control children (p=0.001, mean percentage reduction: 25.7%, 95% CI [10.3, 41.2]%) and compared to children with resolved Rolandic epilepsy (p=0.007, mean percentage reduction: 21.9%, 95% CI [6.2, 37.6]%). Children with active Rolandic epilepsy had decreased sleep spindle rates in the centrotemporal region compared to controls (p=0.008, mean decrease 2.5 spindles/min, 95% CI [0.7, 4.4] spindles/min). Spindle rate positively predicted sleep-dependent memory consolidation (p=0.004, mean MST improvement of 3.9%, 95% CI [1.3, 6.4]%, for each unit increase in spindles per minute). Discussion: Children with Rolandic epilepsy have a sleep spindle deficit during the active period of disease which predicts deficits in sleep dependent memory consolidation. This finding provides a mechanism and noninvasive biomarker to aid diagnosis and therapeutic discovery for cognitive dysfunction in Rolandic epilepsy and related sleep activated epilepsy syndromes.

">Differential modulation of sensory response dynamics by cilia structure and intraflagellar transport within and across chemosensory neurons</a></h4>

              
                Sensory neurons contain morphologically diverse primary cilia that are built by intraflagellar transport (IFT) and house sensory signaling molecules. Since both ciliary structural and signaling proteins are trafficked via IFT, it has been challenging to decouple the contributions of IFT and cilia structure to neuronal responses. By acutely inhibiting IFT without altering cilia structure and vice versa, here we describe the differential roles of ciliary trafficking and sensory ending morphology in shaping chemosensory responses in C. elegans. We show that a minimum cilium length but not continuous IFT is necessary for a subset of responses in the ASH nociceptive neurons. In contrast, neither cilia nor continuous IFT are necessary for odorant responses in the AWA olfactory neurons. Instead, continuous IFT differentially modulates response dynamics in AWA. Upon acute inhibition of IFT, cilia-destined odorant receptors are shunted to ectopic branches emanating from the cilia base. Spatial segregation of receptors in these branches from a cilia-restricted regulatory kinase results in odorant desensitization defects, highlighting the importance of precise organization of signaling molecules at sensory endings in regulating response dynamics. We also find that adaptation of AWA responses upon repeated exposure to an odorant is mediated by IFT-driven removal of its cognate receptor, whereas adaptation to a second odorant is regulated via IFT-independent mechanisms. Our results reveal unexpected complexity in the contribution of IFT and cilia organization to the regulation of responses even within a single chemosensory neuron type, and establish a critical role for these processes in the precise modulation of olfactory behaviors.

">Left-right-alternating theta sweeps in the entorhinal-hippocampal spatial map</a></h4>

              
                Place cells in the hippocampus and grid cells in the entorhinal cortex are elements of a neural map of self- position. To benefit navigation, this representation must be dynamically related to surrounding locations. A candidate mechanism for linking places along an animal's path has been described in place cells, where the sequence of spikes within each cycle of the hippocampal theta oscillation encodes a trajectory from the animal's current location towards upcoming locations. In mazes that bifurcate, such trajectories alternately traverse the two upcoming arms as the animal approaches the choice point, raising the possibility that the trajectories express available forward paths encoded on previous trials. However, to bridge the animal's path with the wider environment, beyond places previously or subsequently visited, an experience-independent spatial sampling mechanism might be required. Here we show in freely moving rats, that within individual theta cycles, ensembles of grid cells and place cells encode a position signal that sweeps linearly outwards from the animal's location into the ambient environment, with sweep direction alternating stereotypically between left and right across successive theta cycles. These sweeps were accompanied by, and aligned with, a similarly alternating directional signal in a discrete population of parasubiculum cells with putative connections to grid cells via conjunctive gridxdirection cells. Sweeps extended into never-visited locations that were inaccessible to the animal and persisted during REM sleep. Sweep directions could be explained by an algorithm that maximizes cumulative coverage of surrounding space. The sustained and unconditional expression of theta-patterned left-right-alternating sweeps in the entorhinal-hippocampal positioning system provides an efficient 'look-around' mechanism for sampling locations beyond the travelled path.

">Molecular mechanisms driving divergent development of the human frontal and visual cortex during prenatal development</a></h4>

              
                Key principles of structural brain organization are established very early in fetal development. The frontal cortex is an important hub for integration and control of information, and its integrity and connectivity within the wider neural system are linked to individual differences across multiple cognitive domains and neurodevelopmental conditions. Here we leveraged fetal brain transcriptomics to investigate molecular mechanisms during prenatal development that drive early differences between the two regions at the opposite poles of the physical and representational gradient of the brain - the frontal and visual cortex. We show that the frontal cortex exhibits significantly higher cumulative gene expression for pathways involved in the continued growth and maintenance of larger neurons. These pathways include the gene ontology terms of neuron development and neuronal cell body as well as glucose metabolism important in trophically supporting larger cell sizes. Whole pathways for axonal growth (axonal growth cone, microtubules, filopodia, lamellipodia) and single genes involved in circuit connectivity exhibited increased expression in the frontal cortex. In contrast, in line with the established earlier completion of neurogenesis and lower number of neurons in the anterior cortex, expression of genes involved in DNA replication was significantly lower relative to the visual cortex. We further demonstrate differential cellular composition with higher expression of marker genes for inhibitory neurons in the prenatal frontal cortex. Together, these results suggest that the cellular architecture and composition facilitates earlier connectivity in the frontal cortex which may determine its role as an integrative hub in the global brain organization.

">A left-lateralized dorsolateral prefrontal network for naming</a></h4>

              
                The ability to connect the form and meaning of a concept, known as word retrieval, is fundamental to human communication. While various input modalities could lead to identical word retrieval, the exact neural dynamics supporting this convergence relevant to daily auditory discourse remain poorly understood. Here, we leveraged neurosurgical electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings from 48 patients and dissociated two key language networks that highly overlap in time and space integral to word retrieval. Using unsupervised temporal clustering techniques, we found a semantic processing network located in the middle and inferior frontal gyri. This network was distinct from an articulatory planning network in the inferior frontal and precentral gyri, which was agnostic to input modalities. Functionally, we confirmed that the semantic processing network encodes word surprisal during sentence perception. Our findings characterize how humans integrate ongoing auditory semantic information over time, a critical linguistic function from passive comprehension to daily discourse.

">Developmental and adult striatal patterning of nociceptin ligand marks striosomal population with direct dopamine projections</a></h4>

              
                Circuit influences on the midbrain dopamine system are crucial to adaptive behavior and cognition. Recent developments in the study of neuropeptide systems have enabled high-resolution investigations of the intersection of neuromodulatory signals with basal ganglia circuitry, identifying the nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) endogenous opioid peptide system as a prospective regulator of striatal dopamine signaling. Using a prepronociceptin-Cre reporter mouse line, we characterized highly selective striosomal patterning of Pnoc mRNA expression in mouse dorsal striatum, reflecting early developmental expression of Pnoc. In the ventral striatum, Pnoc expression was clustered across the nucleus accumbens core and medial shell, including in adult striatum. We found that PnoctdTomato reporter cells largely comprise a population of dopamine receptor D1 (Drd1) expressing medium spiny projection neurons localized in dorsal striosomes, known to be unique among striatal projections neurons for their direct innervation of midbrain dopamine neurons. These findings provide new understanding of the intersection of the N/OFQ system among basal ganglia circuits with particular implications for developmental regulation or wiring of striato-nigral circuits.

	<p>Electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities are the most common cardiac complications after acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and predict poor outcomes. The arterial baroreflex is an essential determinant of cardiovascular autonomic regulation, with receptors mainly residing in carotid sinuses and aortic arch. The atherosclerosis of these baroreceptor-resident arteries (BRA) is very common in AIS patients and might impair baroreflex function. However, the associations between the atherosclerosis of BRA and ECG abnormalities after AIS are still unknown. In total, 228 AIS patients within 7 days after onset without a pre-existing heart disease were prospectively recruited. With computed tomography angiography, atherosclerosis conditions in 10 segments of the carotid sinuses and aortic arch were scored and summed as the Total Atherosclerosis Burden of BRA (TAB-BRA), and asymptomatic coronary artery stenosis (ACAS) &amp;amp;ge;50% was simultaneously assessed. We performed 12-lead ECG to dynamically detect abnormal repolarization, and 24 h Holter ECG to monitor arrhythmias and heart rate variability (HRV) parameters, which are reliable indicators to assess cardiac autonomic function. We found that TAB-BRA was positively associated with abnormal repolarization (OR 1.09; CI% 1.03&amp;amp;ndash;1.16; p = 0.003) and serious cardiac arrhythmias (OR 1.08; CI% 1.01&amp;amp;ndash;1.15; p = 0.021). In addition, TAB-BRA was an important predictor of abnormal repolarization, persisting over 3 days (OR 1.17; CI% 1.05&amp;amp;ndash;1.30; p = 0.003). However, ACAS &amp;amp;ge; 50% did not relate to these ECG abnormalities. TAB-BRA was negatively correlated with parasympathetic-related HRV parameters. Our results indicated that AIS patients with a high TAB-BRA are more likely to have ECG abnormalities and delayed normalization, which may relate to the decreased cardiac parasympathetic activity, but not the accompanied ACAS &amp;amp;ge; 50%.</p>

	<p>Empathy is a crucial component to infer and understand others&amp;amp;rsquo; emotions. However, a synthesis of studies regarding empathy and its neuronal correlates in perceptual tasks using event-related potentials (ERPs) has yet to occur. The current systematic review aimed to provide that overview. Upon bibliographic research, 30 studies featuring empathy assessments and at least one perceptual task measuring ERP components in healthy participants were included. Four main focus categories were identified, as follows: Affective Pictures, Facial Stimuli, Mental States, and Social Language. The Late Positive Potential was the most analyzed in Affective Pictures and was reported to be positively correlated with cognitive and affective empathy, along with other late components. In contrast, for Facial Stimuli, early components presented significant correlations with empathy scales. Particularly, the N170 presented negative correlations with cognitive and affective empathy. Finally, augmented N400 was suggested to be associated with higher empathy scores in the Mental States and Social Language categories. These findings highlight the relevance of early perceptual stages of empathic processing and how different EEG/ERP methodologies provide relevant information.</p>

	<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting individuals worldwide and characterized by deficits in social interaction along with the presence of restricted interest and repetitive behaviors. Despite decades of behavioral research, little is known about the brain mechanisms that influence social behaviors among children with ASD. This, in part, is due to limitations of traditional imaging techniques specifically targeting pediatric populations. As a portable and scalable optical brain monitoring technology, functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) provides a measure of cerebral hemodynamics related to sensory, motor, or cognitive function. Here, we utilized fNIRS to investigate the prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity of young children with ASD and with typical development while they watched social and nonsocial video clips. The PFC activity of ASD children was significantly higher for social stimuli at medial PFC, which is implicated in social cognition/processing. Moreover, this activity was also consistently correlated with clinical measures, and higher activation of the same brain area only during social video viewing was associated with more ASD symptoms. This is the first study to implement a neuroergonomics approach to investigate cognitive load in response to realistic, complex, and dynamic audiovisual social stimuli for young children with and without autism. Our results further confirm that new generation of portable fNIRS neuroimaging can be used for ecologically valid measurements of the brain function of toddlers and preschool children with ASD.</p>

                <p>The perception of food relies on the integration of olfactory and gustatory signals originating from the mouth. This multisensory process generates robust associations between odors and tastes, significantly influencing the perceptual judgment of flavors. However, the specific neural substrates underlying this integrative process remain unclear. Previous electrophysiological studies identified the gustatory cortex as a site of convergent olfactory and gustatory signals, but whether neurons represent multimodal odor&ndash;taste mixtures as distinct from their unimodal odor and taste components is unknown. To investigate this, we recorded single-unit activity in the gustatory cortex of behaving female rats during the intraoral delivery of individual odors, individual tastes, and odor&ndash;taste mixtures. Our results demonstrate that chemoselective neurons in the gustatory cortex are broadly responsive to intraoral chemosensory stimuli, exhibiting time-varying multiphasic changes in activity. In a subset of these chemoselective neurons, odor&ndash;taste mixtures elicit nonlinear cross-modal responses that distinguish them from their olfactory and gustatory components. These findings provide novel insights into multimodal chemosensory processing by the gustatory cortex, highlighting the distinct representation of unimodal and multimodal intraoral chemosensory signals. Overall, our findings suggest that olfactory and gustatory signals interact nonlinearly in the gustatory cortex to enhance the identity coding of both unimodal and multimodal chemosensory stimuli.</p>

                <p>A central question in consciousness theories is whether one is dealing with a dichotomous ("all-or-none") or a gradual phenomenon. In this 7T fMRI study, we investigated whether dichotomy or gradualness in fact depends on the brain region associated with perceptual awareness reports. Both male and female human subjects performed an emotion discrimination task (fear vs neutral bodies) presented under continuous flash suppression with trial-based perceptual awareness measures. Behaviorally, recognition sensitivity increased linearly with increased stimuli awareness and was at chance level during perceptual unawareness. Physiologically, threat stimuli triggered a slower heart rate than neutral ones during "almost clear" stimulus experience, indicating freezing behavior. Brain results showed that activity in the occipitotemporal, parietal, and frontal regions as well as in the amygdala increased with increased stimulus awareness while early visual areas showed the opposite pattern. The relationship between temporal area activity and perceptual awareness best fitted a gradual model while the activity in frontoparietal areas fitted a dichotomous model. Furthermore, our findings illustrate that specific experimental decisions, such as stimulus type or the approach used to evaluate awareness, play pivotal roles in consciousness studies and warrant careful consideration.</p>

                <p>The brain bidirectionally communicates with the gut to control food intake and energy balance, which becomes dysregulated in obesity. For example, endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling in the small-intestinal (SI) epithelium is upregulated in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice and promotes overeating by a mechanism that includes inhibiting gut&ndash;brain satiation signaling. Upstream neural and molecular mechanism(s) involved in overproduction of orexigenic gut eCBs in DIO, however, are unknown. We tested the hypothesis that overactive parasympathetic signaling at the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) in the SI increases biosynthesis of the eCB, 2-arachidonoyl-<I>sn</I>-glycerol (2-AG), which drives hyperphagia via local CB<SUB>1</SUB>Rs in DIO. Male mice were maintained on a high-fat/high-sucrose Western-style diet for 60&nbsp;d, then administered several mAChR antagonists 30&nbsp;min prior to tissue harvest or a food intake test. Levels of 2-AG and the activity of its metabolic enzymes in the SI were quantitated. DIO mice, when compared to those fed a low-fat/no-sucrose diet, displayed increased expression of cFos protein in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, which suggests an increased activity of efferent cholinergic neurotransmission. These mice exhibited elevated levels of 2-AG biosynthesis in the SI, that was reduced to control levels by mAChR antagonists. Moreover, the peripherally restricted mAChR antagonist, methylhomatropine bromide, and the peripherally restricted CB<SUB>1</SUB>R antagonist, AM6545, reduced food intake in DIO mice for up to 24&nbsp;h but had no effect in mice conditionally deficient in SI CB<SUB>1</SUB>Rs. These results suggest that hyperactivity at mAChRs in the periphery increases formation of 2-AG in the SI and activates local CB<SUB>1</SUB>Rs, which drives hyperphagia in DIO.</p>

                <p>Many initial movements require subsequent corrective movements, but how the motor cortex transitions to make corrections and how similar the encoding is to initial movements is unclear. In our study, we explored how the brain's motor cortex signals both initial and corrective movements during a precision reaching task. We recorded a large population of neurons from two male rhesus macaques across multiple sessions to examine the neural firing rates during not only initial movements but also subsequent corrective movements. AutoLFADS, an autoencoder-based deep-learning model, was applied to provide a clearer picture of neurons&rsquo; activity on individual corrective movements across sessions. Decoding of reach velocity generalized poorly from initial to corrective submovements. Unlike initial movements, it was challenging to predict the velocity of corrective movements using traditional linear methods in a single, global neural space. We identified several locations in the neural space where corrective submovements originated after the initial reaches, signifying firing rates different than the baseline before initial movements. To improve corrective movement decoding, we demonstrate that a state-dependent decoder incorporating the population firing rates at the initiation of correction improved performance, highlighting the diverse neural features of corrective movements. In summary, we show neural differences between initial and corrective submovements and how the neural activity encodes specific combinations of velocity and position. These findings are inconsistent with assumptions that neural correlations with kinematic features are global and independent, emphasizing that traditional methods often fall short in describing these diverse neural processes for online corrective movements.</p>

                <p>Protein misfolding, aggregation, and spread through the brain are primary drivers of neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis. Phagocytic glia are responsible for regulating the load of pathological proteins in the brain, but emerging evidence suggests that glia may also act as vectors for aggregate spread. Accumulation of protein aggregates could compromise the ability of glia to eliminate toxic materials from the brain by disrupting efficient degradation in the phagolysosomal system. A better understanding of phagocytic glial cell deficiencies in the disease state could help to identify novel therapeutic targets for multiple neurological disorders. Here, we report that mutant huntingtin (mHTT) aggregates impair glial responsiveness to injury and capacity to degrade neuronal debris in male and female adult <I>Drosophila</I> expressing the gene that causes Huntington's disease (HD). mHTT aggregate formation in neurons impairs engulfment and clearance of injured axons and causes accumulation of phagolysosomes in glia. Neuronal mHTT expression induces upregulation of key innate immunity and phagocytic genes, some of which were found to regulate mHTT aggregate burden in the brain. A forward genetic screen revealed Rab10 as a novel component of Draper-dependent phagocytosis that regulates mHTT aggregate transmission from neurons to glia. These data suggest that glial phagocytic defects enable engulfed mHTT aggregates to evade lysosomal degradation and acquire prion-like characteristics. Together, our findings uncover new mechanisms that enhance our understanding of the beneficial and harmful effects of phagocytic glia in HD and other neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

                <p>The reversal potential refers to the membrane potential at which the net current flow through a channel reverses direction. The reversal potential is determined by transmembrane ion gradients and, in turn, determines how the channel's activity will affect the membrane potential. Traditional investigation into the reversal potential of inhibitory ligand-gated ion channels (E<SUB>Inh</SUB>) has relied upon the activation of endogenous receptors, such as the GABA-A receptor (GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R). There are, however, challenges associated with activating endogenous receptors, including agonist delivery, isolating channel responses, and the effects of receptor saturation and desensitization. Here, we demonstrate the utility of using a light-gated anion channel, stGtACR2, to probe E<SUB>Inh</SUB> in the rodent brain. Using mice of both sexes, we demonstrate that the properties of this optically activated channel make it a suitable proxy for studying GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R receptor-mediated inhibition. We validate this agonist-independent optogenetic strategy in vitro and in vivo and further show how it can accurately capture differences in E<SUB>Inh</SUB> dynamics following manipulations of endogenous ion fluxes. This allows us to explore distinct resting E<SUB>Inh</SUB> differences across genetically defined neuronal subpopulations. Using this approach to challenge ion homeostasis mechanisms in neurons, we uncover cell-specific E<SUB>Inh</SUB> dynamics that are supported by the differential expression of endogenous ion handling mechanisms. Our findings therefore establish an effective optical strategy for revealing novel aspects of inhibitory reversal potentials and thereby expand the repertoire of optogenetics.</p>

                <p>Microglia undergo two-stage activation in neurodegenerative diseases, known as disease-associated microglia (DAM). TREM2 mediates the DAM2 stage transition, but what regulates the first DAM1 stage transition is unknown. We report that glucose dyshomeostasis inhibits DAM1 activation and PKM2 plays a role. As in tumors, PKM2 was aberrantly elevated in both male and female human AD brains, but unlike in tumors, it is expressed as active tetramers, as well as among TREM2<sup>+</sup> microglia surrounding plaques in 5XFAD male and female mice. snRNAseq analyses of microglia without <I>Pkm2</I> in 5XFAD mice revealed significant increases in DAM1 markers in a distinct metabolic cluster, which is enriched in genes for glucose metabolism, DAM1, and AD risk. 5XFAD mice incidentally exhibited a significant reduction in amyloid pathology without microglial <I>Pkm2</I>. Surprisingly, microglia in 5XFAD without <I>Pkm2</I> exhibited increases in glycolysis and spare respiratory capacity, which correlated with restoration of mitochondrial cristae alterations. In addition, in situ spatial metabolomics of plaque-bearing microglia revealed an increase in respiratory activity. These results together suggest that it is not only glycolytic but also respiratory inputs that are critical to the development of DAM signatures in 5XFAD mice.</p>

                <p>The superior colliculus (SC) is a prominent and conserved visual center in all vertebrates. In mice, the most superficial lamina of the SC is enriched with neurons that are selective for the moving direction of visual stimuli. Here, we study how these direction selective neurons respond to complex motion patterns known as plaids, using two-photon calcium imaging in awake male and female mice. The plaid pattern consists of two superimposed sinusoidal gratings moving in different directions, giving an apparent pattern direction that lies between the directions of the two component gratings. Most direction selective neurons in the mouse SC respond robustly to the plaids and show a high selectivity for the moving direction of the plaid pattern but not of its components. Pattern motion selectivity is seen in both excitatory and inhibitory SC neurons and is especially prevalent in response to plaids with large cross angles between the two component gratings. However, retinal inputs to the SC are ambiguous in their selectivity to pattern versus component motion. Modeling suggests that pattern motion selectivity in the SC can arise from a nonlinear transformation of converging retinal inputs. In contrast, the prevalence of pattern motion selective neurons is not seen in the primary visual cortex (V1). These results demonstrate an interesting difference between the SC and V1 in motion processing and reveal the SC as an important site for encoding pattern motion.</p>

                <p>The human hand possesses both consolidated motor skills and remarkable flexibility in adapting to ongoing task demands. However, the underlying mechanisms by which the brain balances stability and flexibility remain unknown. In the absence of external input or behavior, spontaneous (intrinsic) brain connectivity is thought to represent a prior of stored memories. In this study, we investigated how manual dexterity modulates spontaneous functional connectivity in the motor cortex during hand movement. Using magnetoencephalography, in 47 human participants (both sexes), we examined connectivity modulations in the &alpha; and &beta; frequency bands at rest and during two motor tasks (i.e., finger tapping or toe squeezing). The flexibility and stability of such modulations allowed us to identify two groups of participants with different levels of performance (high and low performers) on the nine-hole peg test, a test of manual dexterity. In the &alpha; band, participants with higher manual dexterity showed distributed decreases of connectivity, specifically in the motor cortex, increased segregation, and reduced nodal centrality. Participants with lower manual dexterity showed an opposite pattern. Notably, these patterns from the brain to behavior are mirrored by results from behavior to the brain. Indeed, when participants were divided using the median split of the dexterity score, we found the same connectivity patterns. In summary, this experiment shows that a long-term motor skill&mdash;manual dexterity&mdash;influences the way the motor systems respond during movements.</p>

                <p>Our prior research has identified neural correlates of cognitive control in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), leading us to hypothesize that the ACC is necessary for increasing attention as rats flexibly learn new contingencies during a complex reward-guided decision-making task. Here, we tested this hypothesis by using optogenetics to transiently inhibit the ACC, while rats of either sex performed the same two-choice task. ACC inhibition had a profound impact on behavior that extended beyond deficits in attention during learning when expected outcomes were uncertain. We found that ACC inactivation slowed and reduced the number of trials rats initiated and impaired both their accuracy and their ability to complete sessions. Furthermore, drift&ndash;diffusion model analysis suggested that free-choice performance and evidence accumulation (i.e., reduced drift rates) were degraded during initial learning&mdash;leading to weaker associations that were more easily overridden in later trial blocks (i.e., stronger bias). Together, these results suggest that in addition to attention-related functions, the ACC contributes to the ability to initiate trials and generally stay on task.</p>

                <p>The default mode network (DMN) typically deactivates to external tasks, yet supports semantic cognition. It comprises medial temporal (MT), core, and frontotemporal (FT) subsystems, but its functional organization is unclear: the requirement for perceptual coupling versus decoupling, input modality (visual/verbal), type of information (social/spatial), and control demands all potentially affect its recruitment. We examined the effect of these factors on activation and deactivation of DMN subsystems during semantic cognition, across four task-based human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets, and localized these responses in whole-brain state space defined by gradients of intrinsic connectivity. FT showed activation consistent with a central role across domains, tasks, and modalities, although it was most responsive to abstract, verbal tasks; this subsystem uniquely showed more "tuned" states characterized by increases in both activation and deactivation when semantic retrieval demands were higher. MT also activated to both perceptually coupled (scenes) and decoupled (autobiographical memory) tasks and showed stronger responses to picture associations, consistent with a role in scene construction. Core DMN consistently showed deactivation, especially to externally oriented tasks. These diverse contributions of DMN subsystems to semantic cognition were related to their location on intrinsic connectivity gradients: activation was closer to the sensory-motor cortex than deactivation, particularly for FT and MT, while activation for core DMN was distant from both visual cortex and cognitive control. These results reveal distinctive yet complementary DMN responses: MT and FT support different memory-based representations that are accessed externally and internally, while deactivation in core DMN is associated with demanding, external semantic tasks.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/20/e2009222024?rss=1">Neural Representations of Observed Interpersonal Synchrony/Asynchrony in the Social Perception Network</a></h4>

              
                <p>The visual perception of individuals is thought to be mediated by a network of regions in the occipitotemporal cortex that supports specialized processing of faces, bodies, and actions. In comparison, we know relatively little about the neural mechanisms that support the perception of multiple individuals and the interactions between them. The present study sought to elucidate the visual processing of social interactions by identifying which regions of the social perception network represent interpersonal synchrony. In an fMRI study with 32 human participants (26 female, 6 male), we used multivoxel pattern analysis to investigate whether activity in face-selective, body-selective, and interaction-sensitive regions across the social perception network supports the decoding of synchronous versus asynchronous head-nodding and head-shaking. Several regions were found to support significant decoding of synchrony/asynchrony, including extrastriate body area (EBA), face-selective and interaction-sensitive mid/posterior right superior temporal sulcus, and occipital face area. We also saw robust cross-classification across actions in the EBA, suggestive of movement-invariant representations of synchrony/asynchrony. Exploratory whole-brain analyses also identified a region of the right fusiform cortex that responded more strongly to synchronous than to asynchronous motion. Critically, perceiving interpersonal synchrony/asynchrony requires the simultaneous extraction and integration of dynamic information from more than one person. Hence, the representation of synchrony/asynchrony cannot be attributed to augmented or additive processing of individual actors. Our findings therefore provide important new evidence that social interactions recruit dedicated visual processing within the social perception network that extends beyond that engaged by the faces and bodies of the constituent individuals.</p>

                <p>Human frontocentral event-related potentials (FC-ERPs) are ubiquitous neural correlates of cognition and control, but their generating multiscale mechanisms remain mostly unknown. We used the Human Neocortical Neurosolver's biophysical model of a canonical neocortical circuit under exogenous thalamic and cortical drive to simulate the cell and circuit mechanisms underpinning the P2, N2, and P3 features of the FC-ERP observed after Stop-Signals in the Stop&ndash;Signal task (SST; <I>N</I> = 234 humans, 137 female). We demonstrate that a sequence of simulated external thalamocortical and corticocortical drives can produce the FC-ERP, similar to what has been shown for primary sensory cortices. We used this model of the FC-ERP to examine likely circuit-mechanisms underlying FC-ERP features that distinguish between successful and failed action-stopping. We also tested their adherence to the predictions of the horse-race model of the SST, with specific hypotheses motivated by theoretical links between the P3 and Stop process. These simulations revealed that a difference in P3 onset between successful and failed Stops is most likely due to a later arrival of thalamocortical drive in failed Stops, rather than, for example, a difference in the effective strength of the input. In contrast, the same model predicted that early thalamocortical drives underpinning the P2 and N2 differed in both strength and timing across stopping accuracy conditions. Overall, this model generates novel testable predictions of the thalamocortical dynamics underlying FC-ERP generation during action-stopping. Moreover, it provides a detailed cellular and circuit-level interpretation that supports links between these macroscale signatures and predictions of the behavioral race model.</p>

                <p>Aging dogs serve as a valuable preclinical model for Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to their natural age-related development of &beta;-amyloid (A&beta;) plaques, human-like metabolism, and large brains that are ideal for studying structural brain aging trajectories from serial neuroimaging. Here we examined the effects of chronic treatment with the calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) tacrolimus or the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)-inhibiting compound Q134R on age-related canine brain atrophy from a longitudinal study in middle-aged beagles (36 females, 7 males) undergoing behavioral enrichment. Annual MRI was analyzed using modern, automated techniques for region-of-interest-based and voxel-based volumetric assessments. We found that the frontal lobe showed accelerated atrophy with age, while the caudate nucleus remained relatively stable. Remarkably, the hippocampus increased in volume in all dogs. None of these changes were influenced by tacrolimus or Q134R treatment. Our results suggest that behavioral enrichment can prevent atrophy and increase the volume of the hippocampus but does not prevent aging-associated prefrontal cortex atrophy.</p>

                <p>Historically, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) has been implicated in a variety of behaviors ranging from reversal learning and inhibitory control to more complex representations of reward value and task space. While modern interpretations of the OFC's function have focused on a role in outcome evaluation, these cognitive processes often require an organism to inhibit a maladaptive response or strategy. Single-unit recordings from the OFC in rats performing a stop-change task show that the OFC responds strongly to STOP trials. To investigate the role that the OFC plays in stop-change performance, we expressed halorhodopsin (eNpHR3.0) in excitatory neurons in the OFC and tested rats on the stop-change task. Previous work suggests that the OFC differentiates between STOP trials based on trial sequence (i.e., gS trials: STOP trials preceded by a GO vs sS trials: STOP trials preceded by a STOP). We found that yellow light activation of the eNpHR3.0-expressing neurons significantly decreased accuracy only on STOP trials that followed GO trials (gS trials). Further, optogenetic inhibition of the OFC speeded reaction times on error trials. This suggests that the OFC plays a role in inhibitory control processes and that this role needs to be accounted for in modern interpretations of OFC function.</p>

                <p>Retinal prosthetics are one of the leading therapeutic strategies to restore lost vision in patients with retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration. Much work has described patterns of spiking in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in response to electrical stimulation, but less work has examined the underlying retinal circuitry that is activated by electrical stimulation to drive these responses. Surprisingly, little is known about the role of inhibition in generating electrical responses or how inhibition might be altered during degeneration. Using whole-cell voltage&ndash;clamp recordings during subretinal electrical stimulation in the <I>rd10</I> and wild-type (<I>wt</I>) retina, we found electrically evoked synaptic inputs differed between ON and OFF RGC populations, with ON cells receiving mostly excitation and OFF cells receiving mostly inhibition and very little excitation. We found that the inhibition of OFF bipolar cells limits excitation in OFF RGCs, and a majority of both pre- and postsynaptic inhibition in the OFF pathway arises from glycinergic amacrine cells, and the stimulation of the ON pathway contributes to inhibitory inputs to the RGC. We also show that this presynaptic inhibition in the OFF pathway is greater in the <I>rd10</I> retina, compared with that in the <I>wt</I> retina.</p>

                <p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is often associated with social communication impairments and specific sound processing deficits, for example, problems in following speech in noisy environments. To investigate underlying neuronal processing defects located in the auditory cortex (AC), we performed two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in <I>FMR1</I> (<I>fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein</I> <I>1</I>) knock-out (KO) mice, a model for fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common cause of hereditary ASD in humans. For primary AC (A1) and the anterior auditory field (AAF), topographic frequency representation was less ordered compared with control animals. We additionally analyzed ensemble AC activity in response to various sounds and found subfield-specific differences. In A1, ensemble correlations were lower in general, while in secondary AC (A2), correlations were higher in response to complex sounds, but not to pure tones. Furthermore, sound specificity of ensemble activity was decreased in AAF. Repeating these experiments 1&nbsp;week later revealed no major differences regarding representational drift. Nevertheless, we found subfield- and genotype-specific changes in ensemble correlation values between the two times points, hinting at alterations in network stability in <I>FMR1</I> KO mice. These detailed insights into AC network activity and topography in <I>FMR1</I> KO mice add to the understanding of auditory processing defects in FXS.</p>

                <p>The voltage-gated calcium channel subunit &alpha;2-2 controls calcium-dependent signaling in neurons, and loss of this subunit causes epilepsy in both mice and humans. To determine whether mice without &alpha;2-2 demonstrate hippocampal activation or histopathological changes associated with seizure activity, we measured expression of the activity-dependent gene c<I>-fos</I> and various histopathological correlates of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) in hippocampal tissue from wild-type (WT) and &alpha;2-2 knock-out (<I>CACNA2D2</I> KO) mice using immunohistochemical staining and confocal microscopy. Both genotypes demonstrated similarly sparse c-<I>fos</I> and <I>FosB</I> expressions within the hippocampal dentate granule cell layer (GCL) at baseline, consistent with no difference in basal activity of granule cells between genotypes. Surprisingly, when mice were assayed 1&nbsp;h after handling-associated convulsions, KO mice had fewer c-<I>fos</I>-positive cells but dramatically increased <I>FosB</I> expression in the dentate gyrus compared with WT mice. After administration of a subthreshold pentylenetetrazol dose, however, KO mice dentate had significantly more c-<I>fos</I> expression compared with WT mice. Other histopathological markers of TLE in these mice, including markers of neurogenesis, glial activation, and mossy fiber sprouting, were similar between WT and KO mice, apart from a small but statistically significant increase in hilar mossy cell density, opposite to what is typically found in mice with TLE. This suggests that the differences in seizure-associated dentate gyrus function in the absence of &alpha;2-2 protein are likely due to altered functional properties of the network without associated structural changes in the hippocampus at the typical age of seizure onset.</p>

Computational cognitive models have been used extensively to formalize cognitive processes. Model parameters offer a simple way to quantify individual differences in how humans process information. Similarly, model comparison allows researchers to identify which theories, embedded in different models, provide the best accounts of the data. Cognitive modeling uses statistical tools to quantitatively relate models to data that often rely on computing/estimating the likelihood of the data under the model. However, this likelihood is computationally intractable for a substantial number of models. These relevant models may embody reasonable theories of cognition, but are often under-explored due to the limited range of tools available to relate them to data. We contribute to filling this gap in a simple way using artificial neural networks (ANNs) to map data directly onto model identity and parameters, bypassing the likelihood estimation. We test our instantiation of an ANN as a cognitive model fitting tool on classes of cognitive models with strong inter-trial dependencies (such as reinforcement learning models), which offer unique challenges to most methods. We show that we can adequately perform both parameter estimation and model identification using our ANN approach, including for models that cannot be fit using traditional likelihood-based methods. We further discuss our work in the context of the ongoing research leveraging simulation-based approaches to parameter estimation and model identification, and how these approaches broaden the class of cognitive models researchers can quantitatively investigate.

Contrast transport models are widely used to quantify blood flow and transport in dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. These models analyze the time course of the contrast agent concentration, providing diagnostic and prognostic value for many biological systems. Thus, ensuring accuracy and repeatability of the model parameter estimation is a fundamental concern. In this work, we analyze the structural and practical identifiability of a class of nested compartment models pervasively used in analysis of MRI data. We combine artificial and real data to study the role of noise in model parameter estimation. We observe that although all the models are structurally identifiable, practical identifiability strongly depends on the data characteristics. We analyze the impact of increasing data noise on parameter identifiability and show how the latter can be recovered with increased data quality. To complete the analysis, we show that the results do not depend on specific tissue characteristics or the type of enhancement patterns of contrast agent signal.

                <p>by Nikhil Phaniraj, Rahel K. Brügger, Judith M. Burkart</p>

Synchronization is widespread in animals, and studies have often emphasized how this seemingly complex phenomenon can emerge from very simple rules. However, the amount of flexibility and control that animals might have over synchronization properties, such as the strength of coupling, remains underexplored. Here, we studied how pairs of marmoset monkeys coordinated vigilance while feeding. By modeling them as coupled oscillators, we noted that (1) individual marmosets do not show perfect periodicity in vigilance behaviors, (2) nevertheless, marmoset pairs started to take turns being vigilant over time, a case of anti-phase synchrony, (3) marmosets could couple flexibly; the coupling strength varied with every new joint feeding bout, and (4) marmosets could control the coupling strength; dyads showed increased coupling if they began in a more desynchronized state. Such flexibility and control over synchronization require more than simple interaction rules. Minimally, animals must estimate the current degree of asynchrony and adjust their behavior accordingly. Moreover, the fact that each marmoset is inherently non-periodic adds to the cognitive demand. Overall, our study provides a mathematical framework to investigate the cognitive demands involved in coordinating behaviors in animals, regardless of whether individual behaviors are rhythmic or not.

                <p>by Sean M. Cascarina, Eric D. Ross</p>

Low-complexity domains (LCDs) in proteins are typically enriched in one or two predominant amino acids. As a result, LCDs often exhibit unusual structural/biophysical tendencies and can occupy functional niches. However, for each organism, protein sequences must be compatible with intracellular biomolecules and physicochemical environment, both of which vary from organism to organism. This raises the possibility that LCDs may occupy sequence spaces in select organisms that are otherwise prohibited in most organisms. Here, we report a comprehensive survey and functional analysis of LCDs in all known reference proteomes (>21k organisms), with added focus on rare and unusual types of LCDs. LCDs were classified according to both the primary amino acid and secondary amino acid in each LCD sequence, facilitating detailed comparisons of LCD class frequencies across organisms. Examination of LCD classes at different depths (i.e., domain of life, organism, protein, and per-residue levels) reveals unique facets of LCD frequencies and functions. To our surprise, all 400 LCD classes occur in nature, although some are exceptionally rare. A number of rare classes can be defined for each domain of life, with many LCD classes appearing to be eukaryote-specific. Certain LCD classes were consistently associated with identical functions across many organisms, particularly in eukaryotes. Our analysis methods enable simultaneous, direct comparison of all LCD classes between individual organisms, resulting in a proteome-scale view of differences in LCD frequencies and functions. Together, these results highlight the remarkable diversity and functional specificity of LCDs across all known life forms.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Due to increased gene dose for the amyloid precursor protein (APP), elderly adults with Down syndrome (DS) are at a markedly increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD), known as DS-AD. How the increased APP gene dose acts and which APP products are responsible for DS-AD is not well understood, thus limiting strategies to target pathogenesis. As one approach to address this question, we used a novel class of γ-secretase modulators that promote γ-site cleavages by the γ-secretase complex, resulting in lower levels of the Aβ42 and Aβ40 peptides.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Ts65Dn mice, which serve as a model of DS, were treated via oral gavage with 10 mg/kg/weekday of BPN15606 (a potent and novel pyridazine-containing γ-secretase modulators). Treatment started at 3 months-of-age and lasted for 4 months.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Demonstrating successful target engagement, treatment with BPN15606 significantly decreased levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the cortex and hippocampus; it had no effect on full-length APP or its C-terminal fragments in either 2 N or Ts65Dn mice. Importantly, the levels of total amyloid-β were not impacted, pointing to BPN15606-mediated enhancement of processivity of γ-secretase. Additionally, BPN15606 rescued hyperactivation of Rab5, a protein responsible for regulating endosome function, and normalized neurotrophin signaling deficits. BPN15606 treatment also normalized the levels of synaptic proteins and tau phosphorylation, while reducing astrocytosis and microgliosis, and countering cognitive deficits.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings point to the involvement of increased levels of Aβ42 and/or Aβ40 in contributing to several molecular and cognitive traits associated with DS-AD. They speak to increased dosage of the <i>APP</i> gene acting through heightened levels of Aβ42 and/or Aβ40 as supporting pathogenesis. These findings further the interest in the potential use of γ-secretase modulators for treating and possibly preventing AD in individuals with DS. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) has a complex pathobiology, with genetic and environmental factors being crucial players. Understanding the mechanisms underlying heterogeneity in disease activity is crucial for tailored treatment. We explored the impact of DNA methylation, a key mechanism in the genetics-environment interplay, on disease activity in MS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Peripheral immune methylome profiling using Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChips was conducted on 249 untreated relapsing–remitting MS patients, sampled at the start of disease-modifying treatment (DMT). A differential methylation analysis compared patients with evidence of disease activity (EDA) to those with no evidence of disease activity (NEDA) over 2 years from DMT start. Utilizing causal inference testing (CIT) and Mendelian randomization (MR), we sought to elucidate the relationships between DNA methylation, gene expression, genetic variation, and disease activity.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Four differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified between EDA and NEDA. Examining the influence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 923 variants were found to account for the observed differences in the 4 DMRs. Importantly, 3 out of the 923 SNPs, affecting DNA methylation in a DMR linked to the anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) gene, were associated with disease activity risk in an independent cohort of 1,408 MS patients. CIT and MR demonstrated that DNA methylation in AMH acts as a mediator for the genetic risk of disease activity.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study uncovered a novel molecular pathway implicating the interaction between DNA methylation and genetic variation in the risk of disease activity in MS, emphasizing the role of sex hormones, particularly the AMH, in MS pathobiology. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Cross-sectional definitions of successful cognitive aging have been widely utilized, but longitudinal measurements can identify people who do not decline. We performed this study to contrast maintenance with declining trajectories, including clinical conversion.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included baseline cognitively unimpaired Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative participants with 3 or more cognitive testing sessions (n = 539, follow-up 6.1 ± 3.5 years) and calculated slopes of an episodic memory composite (MEM) to classify them into two groups: maintainers (slope ≥ 0) and decliners (slope &lt; 0). Within decliners, we examined a subgroup of individuals who became clinically impaired during follow-up. These groups were compared on baseline characteristics and cognitive performance, as well as both cross-sectional and longitudinal Alzheimer disease (AD) biomarker measures (beta-amyloid [Aβ], tau, and hippocampal volume).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Forty-one percent (n = 221) of the cohort were MEM maintainers, and 33% (n = 105) of decliners converted to clinical impairment during follow-up. Compared to those with superior baseline scores, maintainers had lower education and were more likely to be male. Maintainers and decliners did not differ on baseline MEM scores, but maintainers did have higher non-MEM cognitive scores. Maintainers had lower baseline global Aβ, lower tau pathology, and larger hippocampal volumes than decliners, even after removing converters. There were no differences in rates of change of any AD biomarkers between any cognitive trajectory groups except for a higher rate of hippocampal atrophy in clinical converters compared to maintainers.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Using longitudinal data to define cognitive trajectory groups reduces education and sex bias and reveals the prognostic importance of early onset of accumulation of AD pathology. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The ubiquity of nanoparticles, sourced from both natural environments and human activities, presents critical challenges for public health. While offering significant potential for innovative biomedical applications—especially in enhancing drug transport across the blood–brain barrier—these particles also introduce possible hazards due to inadvertent exposure. This concise review explores the paradoxical nature of nanoparticles, emphasizing their promising applications in healthcare juxtaposed with their potential neurotoxic consequences. Through a detailed examination, we delineate the pathways through which nanoparticles can reach the brain and the subsequent health implications. There is growing evidence of a disturbing association between nanoparticle exposure and the onset of neurodegenerative conditions, highlighting the imperative for comprehensive research and strategic interventions. Gaining a deep understanding of these mechanisms and enacting protective policies are crucial steps toward reducing the health threats of nanoparticles, thereby maximizing their therapeutic advantages.</p>

                Interest in the neurobiological substrates of consciousness has risen dramatically over the last few decades. This is reflected both in the steady increase in the number of papers published and in the recent surge of adversarial collaborations, in which researchers with opposing assumptions join forces to develop experiments to settle controversies and advance the field. Given this progress, we are enthusiastic to present this Neuron special issue on consciousness, with numerous reviews and commentaries each addressing a different area of consciousness research.

                Conscious experiences in infants remain poorly understood. In this NeuroView, Passos-Ferreira discusses recent evidence for and against consciousness in newborn babies. She argues that the weight of evidence from neuroimaging and behavioral studies supports the thesis that newborn infants are conscious.

                In this talk with Neuron, Christof Koch, a physicist and neuroscientist, advocates for a pragmatic program to track the footprints of consciousness in the brain and for team science, explains the recent pseudo-controversy regarding integrated information theory of consciousness, and speaks about the joy of exploring the mysteries around us.

                Cellular and systems neuroscience points to a thalamic contribution to consciousness. Matrix-thalamocortical loops support wakefulness and perceptual threshold, and core-thalamocortical loops maintain content and enable perceptual constancy. The mesoscale architecture of these loops may explain general properties of conscious contents.

">Cortico-amygdala synaptic structural abnormalities produced by templated aggregation of α-synuclein</a></h4>

              
                Parkinsons disease (PD) and Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are characterized by neuronal -synuclein (-syn) inclusions termed Lewy Pathology, which are abundant in the amygdala. The basolateral amygdala (BLA), in particular, receives projections from the thalamus and cortex. These projections play a role in cognition and emotional processing, behaviors which are impaired in -synucleinopathies. To understand if and how pathologic -syn impacts the BLA requires animal models of -syn aggregation. Injection of -synuclein pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) into the striatum induces robust -synuclein aggregation in excitatory neurons in the BLA that corresponds with reduced contextual fear conditioning. At early time points after aggregate formation, cortico-amygdala excitatory transmission is abolished. The goal of this project was to determine if -syn inclusions in the BLA induce synaptic degeneration and/or morphological changes. In this study, we used C57BL/6J mice injected bilaterally with PFFs in the dorsal striatum to induce -syn aggregate formation in the BLA. A method was developed using immunofluorescence and three-dimensional reconstruction to analyze excitatory cortico-amygdala and thalamo-amygdala presynaptic terminals closely juxtaposed to postsynaptic densities. The abundance and morphology of synapses were analyzed at 6- or 12-weeks post-injection of PFFs. -Syn aggregate formation in the BLA did not cause a significant loss of synapses, but cortico-amygdala and thalamo-amygdala presynaptic terminals and postsynaptic densities with aggregates of -synuclein show increased volumes, similar to previous findings in human DLB cortex, and in non-human primate models of PD. Transmission electron microscopy showed that PFF-injected mice showed reduced intervesicular distances similar to a recent study showing phospho-serine-129 -synuclein increases synaptic vesicle clustering. Thus, pathologic -synuclein causes major alterations to synaptic architecture in the BLA, potentially contributing to behavioral impairment and amygdala dysfunction observed in synucleinopathies.

">Dissociable encoding of evolving beliefs and momentary belief updates in distinct neural decision signals</a></h4>

              
                Making accurate decisions in noisy or otherwise uncertain environments requires integrating evidence over time. Using simple tasks requiring rapid evaluation of a stationary sensory feature, two human neurophysiological signals have been found to evolve with similar integration dynamics, with one (centroparietal positivity; CPP) appearing to compute the running integral and continuously feed it to the other (motor beta lateralisation; MBL). However, it remains unknown whether and how these signals serve more distinct functional roles in more complex scenarios where information arrives discontinuously and requires more computational steps to form appropriate belief updates. We employed a volatile expanded judgement task that permits dissociation of the encoding of raw sensory information in each of a series of discrete stimuli ('objective evidence'), the appropriately transformed belief updates from that information ('effective evidence'), and the evolving belief itself (accumulated evidence). Whereas MBL traced the evolving belief across stimuli, the CPP was found only to locally encode the effective evidence associated with each individual stimulus. Furthermore, fluctuations in CPP amplitude after each single stimulus could account for variability in the encoding of accumulated evidence in MBL. These results suggest a flexible computational hierarchy in which effective evidence can be computed sample-by-sample at an intermediate processing level to drive downstream belief updates for protracted decisions about discrete stimuli.

">Precision fMRI reveals that the language network exhibits adult-like left-hemispheric lateralization by 4 years of age</a></h4>

              
                Left hemisphere damage in adulthood often leads to linguistic deficits, but many cases of early damage leave linguistic processing preserved, and a functional language system can develop in the right hemisphere. To explain this early apparent equipotentiality of the two hemispheres for language, some have proposed that the language system is bilateral during early development and only becomes left-lateralized with age. We examined language lateralization using functional magnetic resonance imaging with two large pediatric cohorts (total n=273 children ages 4-16; n=107 adults). Strong, adult-level left-hemispheric lateralization (in activation volume and response magnitude) was evident by age 4. Thus, although the right hemisphere can take over language function in some cases of early brain damage, and although some features of the language system do show protracted development (magnitude of language response and strength of inter-regional correlations in the language network), the left-hemisphere bias for language is robustly present by 4 years of age.

	<p>Background: Applying deep brain stimulation (DBS) to several brain regions has been investigated in attempts to treat highly treatment-resistant depression, with variable results. Our initial pilot data suggested that the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) could be a promising therapeutic target. Objective: The aim of this study was to gather blinded data exploring the efficacy of applying DBS to the BNST in patients with highly refractory depression. Method: Eight patients with chronic severe treatment-resistant depression underwent DBS to the BNST. A randomised, double-blind crossover study design with fixed stimulation parameters was followed and followed by a period of open-label stimulation. Results: During the double-blind crossover phase, no consistent antidepressant effects were seen with any of the four stimulation parameters applied, and no patients achieved response or remission criteria during the blinded crossover phase or during a subsequent period of three months of blinded stimulation. Stimulation-related side effects, especially agitation, were reported by a number of patients and were reversible with adjustment of the stimulation parameters. Conclusions: The results of this study do not support the application of DBS to the BNST in patients with highly resistant depression or ongoing research utilising stimulation at this brain site. The blocked randomised study design utilising fixed stimulation parameters was poorly tolerated by the participants and does not appear suitable for assessing the efficacy of DBS at this location.</p>

	<p>The sensorimotor gating is a nervous system function that modulates the acoustic startle response (ASR). Prepulse inhibition (PPI) phenomenon is an operational measure of sensorimotor gating, defined as the reduction of ASR when a high intensity sound (pulse) is preceded in milliseconds by a weaker stimulus (prepulse). Brainstem nuclei are associated with the mediation of ASR and PPI, whereas cortical and subcortical regions are associated with their modulation. However, it is still unclear how the modulatory units can influence PPI. In the present work, we developed a computational model of a neural circuit involved in the mediation (brainstem units) and modulation (cortical and subcortical units) of ASR and PPI. The activities of all units were modeled by the leaky-integrator formalism for neural population. The model reproduces basic features of PPI observed in experiments, such as the effects of changes in interstimulus interval, prepulse intensity, and habituation of ASR. The simulation of GABAergic and dopaminergic drugs impaired PPI by their effects over subcortical units activity. The results show that subcortical units constitute a central hub for PPI modulation. The presented computational model offers a valuable tool to investigate the neurobiology associated with disorder-related impairments in PPI.</p>

	<p>Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) are a cornerstone data analysis strategy in behavioral research because of their robustness in handling non-normally distributed variables. Recently, their integration with ordered beta regression (OBR), a novel statistical tool for managing percentage data, has opened new avenues for analyzing continuous response data. Here, we applied this combined approach to investigate nuanced differences between the 3xTg-AD model of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) and their C57BL/6 non-transgenic (NTg) counterparts with normal aging in a 5-day Morris Water Maze (MWM) test protocol. Our longitudinal study included 22 3xTg-AD mice and 15 NTg mice (both male and female) assessed at 12 and 16 months of age. By identifying and analyzing multiple swimming strategies during three different paradigms (cue, place task, and removal), we uncovered genotypic differences in all paradigms. Thus, the NTg group exhibited a higher percentage of direct search behaviors, while an association between circling episodes and 3xTg-AD animals was found. Furthermore, we also propose a novel metric&amp;amp;mdash;the &amp;amp;ldquo;Cognitive Flexibility Index&amp;amp;rdquo;&amp;amp;mdash;which proved sensitive in detecting sex-related differences. Overall, our integrated GLMMs-OBR approach provides a comprehensive insight into mouse behavior in the MWM test, shedding light on the effects of aging and AD pathology.</p>

	<p>We assessed the aesthetic experience of patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) to understand their ability to experience feelings of the sublime and to be moved when viewing paintings. We exposed patients with bvFTD and control participants to concrete and abstract paintings and asked them how moved they were by these paintings and whether the latter were beautiful or ugly. Patients with bvFTD declared being less moved than control participants by both abstract and concrete paintings. No significant differences were observed between abstract and concrete paintings in both patients with bvFTD and control participants. Patients with bvFTD provided fewer &amp;amp;ldquo;beautiful&amp;amp;rdquo; and more &amp;amp;ldquo;ugly&amp;amp;rdquo; responses than controls for both abstract and concrete paintings. No significant differences in terms of &amp;amp;ldquo;beautiful&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;ugly&amp;amp;rdquo; responses were observed between abstract and concrete paintings in both patients with bvFTD and control participants. These findings suggest disturbances in the basic affective experience of patients with bvFTD when they are exposed to paintings, as well as a bias in their ability to judge the aesthetic quality of paintings.</p>

	<p>In this study, we investigated the feasibility of using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to differentiate between four distinct subject-driven cognitive states: resting state, narrative memory, music, and subtraction tasks. EEG data were collected from seven healthy male participants while performing these cognitive tasks, and the raw EEG signals were transformed into time&amp;amp;ndash;frequency maps using continuous wavelet transform. Based on these time&amp;amp;ndash;frequency maps, we developed a convolutional neural network model (TF-CNN-CFA) with a channel and frequency attention mechanism to automatically distinguish between these cognitive states. The experimental results demonstrated that the model achieved an average classification accuracy of 76.14% in identifying these four cognitive states, significantly outperforming traditional EEG signal processing methods and other classical image classification algorithms. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of varying lengths of EEG signals on classification performance and found that TF-CNN-CFA demonstrates consistent performance across different window lengths, indicating its strong generalization capability. This study validates the ability of EEG to differentiate higher cognitive states, which could potentially offer a novel BCI paradigm.</p>

	<p>This study explores the multifaceted influence of litter size, maternal care, exercise, and aging on rats&amp;amp;rsquo; neurobehavioral plasticity and dentate gyrus microglia dynamics. Body weight evolution revealed a progressive increase until maturity, followed by a decline during aging, with larger litters exhibiting lower weights initially. Notably, exercised rats from smaller litters displayed higher body weights during the mature and aged stages. The dentate gyrus volumes showed no significant differences among groups, except for aged sedentary rats from smaller litters, which exhibited a reduction. Maternal care varied significantly based on litter size, with large litter dams showing lower frequencies of caregiving behaviors. Behavioral assays highlighted the detrimental impact of a sedentary lifestyle and reduced maternal care/large litters on spatial memory, mitigated by exercise in aged rats from smaller litters. The microglial dynamics in the layers of dentate gyrus revealed age-related changes modulated by litter size and exercise. Exercise interventions mitigated microgliosis associated with aging, particularly in aged rats. These findings underscore the complex interplay between early-life experiences, exercise, microglial dynamics, and neurobehavioral outcomes during aging.</p>

In experiments, the distributions of mRNA or protein numbers in single cells are often fitted to the random telegraph model which includes synthesis and decay of mRNA or protein, and switching of the gene between active and inactive states. While commonly used, this model does not describe how fluctuations are influenced by crucial biological mechanisms such as feedback regulation, non-exponential gene inactivation durations, and multiple gene activation pathways. Here we investigate the dynamical properties of four relatively complex gene expression models by fitting their steady-state mRNA or protein number distributions to the simple telegraph model. We show that despite the underlying complex biological mechanisms, the telegraph model with three effective parameters can accurately capture the steady-state gene product distributions, as well as the conditional distributions in the active gene state, of the complex models. Some effective parameters are reliable and can reflect realistic dynamic behaviors of the complex models, while others may deviate significantly from their real values in the complex models. The effective parameters can also be applied to characterize the capability for a complex model to exhibit multimodality. Using additional information such as single-cell data at multiple time points, we provide an effective method of distinguishing the complex models from the telegraph model. Furthermore, using measurements under varying experimental conditions, we show that fitting the mRNA or protein number distributions to the telegraph model may even reveal the underlying gene regulation mechanisms of the complex models. The effectiveness of these methods is confirmed by analysis of single-cell data for <i>E. coli</i> and mammalian cells. All these results are robust with respect to cooperative transcriptional regulation and extrinsic noise. In particular, we find that faster relaxation speed to the steady state results in more precise parameter inference under large extrinsic noise.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012110">Learning with filopodia and spines: Complementary strong and weak competition lead to specialized, graded, and protected receptive fields</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Albert Albesa-González, Claudia Clopath</p>

Filopodia are thin synaptic protrusions that have been long known to play an important role in early development. It has recently been found that they are more abundant in the adult cortex than previously thought, and more plastic than spines (button-shaped mature synapses). Inspired by these findings, we introduce a new model of synaptic plasticity that jointly describes learning of filopodia and spines. The model assumes that filopodia exhibit strongly competitive learning dynamics -similarly to additive spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). At the same time it proposes that, if filopodia undergo sufficient potentiation, they consolidate into spines. Spines follow weakly competitive learning, classically associated with multiplicative, soft-bounded models of STDP. This makes spines more stable and sensitive to the fine structure of input correlations. We show that our learning rule has a selectivity comparable to additive STDP and represents input correlations as well as multiplicative models of STDP. We also show how it can protect previously formed memories and act as a synaptic consolidation mechanism. Overall, our results can be seen as a phenomenological description of how filopodia and spines could cooperate to overcome the difficulties that strong and weak competition each have.

                <p>by Tanmoy Sarkar, Matej Krajnc</p>

Cell rearrangements are fundamental mechanisms driving large-scale deformations of living tissues. In three-dimensional (3D) space-filling cell aggregates, cells rearrange through local topological transitions of the network of cell-cell interfaces, which is most conveniently described by the vertex model. Since these transitions are not yet mathematically properly formulated, the 3D vertex model is generally difficult to implement. The few existing implementations rely on highly customized and complex software-engineering solutions, which cannot be transparently delineated and are thus mostly non-reproducible. To solve this outstanding problem, we propose a reformulation of the vertex model. Our approach, called Graph Vertex Model (GVM), is based on storing the topology of the cell network into a knowledge graph with a particular data structure that allows performing cell-rearrangement events by simple graph transformations. Importantly, when these same transformations are applied to a two-dimensional (2D) polygonal cell aggregate, they reduce to a well-known T1 transition, thereby generalizing cell-rearrangements in 2D and 3D space-filling packings. This result suggests that the GVM’s graph data structure may be the most natural representation of cell aggregates and tissues. We also develop a Python package that implements GVM, relying on a graph-database-management framework Neo4j. We use this package to characterize an order-disorder transition in 3D cell aggregates, driven by active noise and we find aggregates undergoing efficient ordering close to the transition point. In all, our work showcases knowledge graphs as particularly suitable data models for structured storage, analysis, and manipulation of tissue data.

                <p>by Daniel L. Barton, Yow-Ren Chang, William Ducker, Jure Dobnikar</p>

In this work, we quantitatively compare computer simulations and existing cell tracking data of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> surface motility in order to analyse the underlying motility mechanism. We present a three dimensional twitching motility model, that simulates the extension, retraction and surface association of individual Type IV Pili (TFP), and is informed by recent experimental observations of TFP. Sensitivity analysis is implemented to minimise the number of model parameters, and quantitative estimates for the remaining parameters are inferred from tracking data by approximate Bayesian computation. We argue that the motility mechanism is highly sensitive to experimental conditions. We predict a TFP retraction speed for the tracking data we study that is in a good agreement with experimental results obtained under very similar conditions. Furthermore, we examine whether estimates for biologically important parameters, whose direct experimental determination is challenging, can be inferred directly from tracking data. One example is the width of the distribution of TFP on the bacteria body. We predict that the TFP are broadly distributed over the bacteria pole in both walking and crawling motility types. Moreover, we identified specific configurations of TFP that lead to transitions between walking and crawling states.

                <p>by Chun-Chih Tseng, Thomas E. Woolley, Ting-Xin Jiang, Ping Wu, Philip K. Maini, Randall B. Widelitz, Chuong Cheng-Ming</p>

Periodic patterning requires coordinated cell–cell interactions at the tissue level. Turing showed, using mathematical modeling, how spatial patterns could arise from the reactions of a diffusive activator-inhibitor pair in an initially homogenous 2D field. Most activators and inhibitors studied in biological systems are proteins, and the roles of cell–cell interaction, ions, bioelectricity, etc. are only now being identified. Gap junctions (GJs) mediate direct exchanges of ions or small molecules between cells, enabling rapid long-distance communications in a cell collective. They are therefore good candidates for propagating nonprotein-based patterning signals that may act according to the Turing principles. Here, we explore the possible roles of GJs in Turing-type patterning using feather pattern formation as a model. We found 7 of the 12 investigated GJ isoforms are highly dynamically expressed in the developing chicken skin. In ovo functional perturbations of the GJ isoform, <i>connexin 30</i>, by siRNA and the dominant-negative mutant applied before placode development led to disrupted primary feather bud formation. Interestingly, inhibition of gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) in the ex vivo skin explant culture allowed the sequential emergence of new feather buds at specific spatial locations relative to the existing primary buds. The results suggest that GJIC may facilitate the propagation of long-distance inhibitory signals. Thus, inhibition of GJs may stimulate Turing-type periodic feather pattern formation during chick skin development, and the removal of GJ activity would enable the emergence of new feather buds if the local environment were competent and the threshold to form buds was reached. We further propose Turing-based computational simulations that can predict the sequential appearance of these ectopic buds. Our models demonstrate how a Turing activator-inhibitor system can continue to generate patterns in the competent morphogenetic field when the level of intercellular communication at the tissue scale is modulated.

                <p>by Marie Morin, Mathias Jönsson, Conan K. Wang, David J. Craik, Sandie M. Degnan, Bernard M. Degnan</p>

Animals are influenced by the season, yet we know little about the changes that occur in most species throughout the year. This is particularly true in tropical marine animals that experience relatively small annual temperature and daylight changes. Like many coral reef inhabitants, the crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS), well known as a notorious consumer of corals and destroyer of coral reefs, reproduces exclusively in the summer. By comparing gene expression in 7 somatic tissues procured from wild COTS sampled on the Great Barrier Reef, we identified more than 2,000 protein-coding genes that change significantly between summer and winter. COTS genes that appear to mediate conspecific communication, including both signalling factors released into the surrounding sea water and cell surface receptors, are up-regulated in external secretory and sensory tissues in the summer, often in a sex-specific manner. Sexually dimorphic gene expression appears to be underpinned by sex- and season-specific transcription factors (TFs) and gene regulatory programs. There are over 100 TFs that are seasonally expressed, 87% of which are significantly up-regulated in the summer. Six nuclear receptors are up-regulated in all tissues in the summer, suggesting that systemic seasonal changes are hormonally controlled, as in vertebrates. Unexpectedly, there is a suite of stress-related chaperone proteins and TFs, including HIFa, ATF3, C/EBP, CREB, and NF-κB, that are uniquely and widely co-expressed in gravid females. The up-regulation of these stress proteins in the summer suggests the demands of oogenesis in this highly fecund starfish affects protein stability and turnover in somatic cells. Together, these circannual changes in gene expression provide novel insights into seasonal changes in this coral reef pest and have the potential to identify vulnerabilities for targeted biocontrol.

                <p>by Davide Crombie, Martin A. Spacek, Christian Leibold, Laura Busse</p>

The processing of sensory information, even at early stages, is influenced by the internal state of the animal. Internal states, such as arousal, are often characterized by relating neural activity to a single “level” of arousal, defined by a behavioral indicator such as pupil size. In this study, we expand the understanding of arousal-related modulations in sensory systems by uncovering multiple timescales of pupil dynamics and their relationship to neural activity. Specifically, we observed a robust coupling between spiking activity in the mouse dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of the thalamus and pupil dynamics across timescales spanning a few seconds to several minutes. Throughout all these timescales, 2 distinct spiking modes—individual tonic spikes and tightly clustered bursts of spikes—preferred opposite phases of pupil dynamics. This multi-scale coupling reveals modulations distinct from those captured by pupil size per se, locomotion, and eye movements. Furthermore, coupling persisted even during viewing of a naturalistic movie, where it contributed to differences in the encoding of visual information. We conclude that dLGN spiking activity is under the simultaneous influence of multiple arousal-related processes associated with pupil dynamics occurring over a broad range of timescales.

Oppenheim’s clinical and neuropathologic research covered a variety of disorders, but his name is best known for his work on senile dementia and CAA. Although Oppenheim was in fact not the first to discover CAA, his neuropathologic observations and inferences on neurodegenerative disease proved to be remarkably faithful to our modern understanding of neurodegenerative diseases. As a neurologist, he served in the First World War and was later subjected to religious persecutions in the leadup to the Holocaust but was not fortunate enough to emigrate before his death. The life, social impact, and previously overlooked contributions to science and medicine by Oppenheim are detailed.

     alt="The differential effects of palmitic acid and oleic acid on the metabolic response of hypothalamic astrocytes from male and female mice"/>
<p>Astrocytes in the hypothalamus differentially metabolize palmitic acid and oleic acid, two fatty acids commonly found in our diets, with this possibly being involved in our differential overall metabolic response to these nutrients.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Diets rich in saturated fats are more detrimental to health than those containing mono- or unsaturated fats. Fatty acids are an important source of energy, but they also relay information regarding nutritional status to hypothalamic metabolic circuits and when in excess can be detrimental to these circuits. Astrocytes are the main site of central fatty acid β-oxidation, and hypothalamic astrocytes participate in energy homeostasis, in part by modulating hormonal and nutritional signals reaching metabolic neurons, as well as in the inflammatory response to high-fat diets. Thus, we hypothesized that how hypothalamic astrocytes process-specific fatty acids participates in determining the differential metabolic response and that this is sex dependent as males and females respond differently to high-fat diets. Male and female primary hypothalamic astrocyte cultures were treated with oleic acid (OA) or palmitic acid (PA) for 24 h, and an untargeted metabolomics study was performed. A clear predictive model for PA exposure was obtained, while the metabolome after OA exposure was not different from controls. The observed modifications in metabolites, as well as the expression levels of key metabolic enzymes, indicate a reduction in the activity of the Krebs and glutamate/glutamine cycles in response to PA. In addition, there were specific differences between the response of astrocytes from male and female mice, as well as between hypothalamic and cerebral cortical astrocytes. Thus, the response of hypothalamic astrocytes to specific fatty acids could result in differential impacts on surrounding metabolic neurons and resulting in varied systemic metabolic outcomes.</p>

                The descending-pain modulating circuit controls the experience of pain by modulating transmission of sensory signals through the dorsal horn. This circuit’s key output node, the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), integrates ‘top-down’ and ‘bottom-up’ inputs that regulate functionally defined RVM cell types, ‘OFF-cells’ and ‘ON-cells’, which respectively suppress or facilitate pain-related sensory processing. While recent advances have sought molecular definition of RVM cell types, conflicting behavioral findings highlight challenges involved in aligning functional and molecularly defined types. This review summarizes current understanding, derived primarily from rodent studies but with corroborating evidence from human imaging, of the role of RVM populations in pain modulation and persistent pain states and explores recent advances outlining inputs to, and outputs from, RVM pain-modulating neurons.

	<p>Lucid dreaming involves becoming aware that one&amp;amp;rsquo;s current experience is a dream, which has similarities with the notion of mindfulness&amp;amp;mdash;becoming aware of moment-to-moment changes in experience. Additionally, meta-awareness, the ability to explicitly notice the current content of one&amp;amp;rsquo;s own mental state, has also been proposed to play an important role both in lucid dreaming and mindfulness meditation practices. However, research has shown conflicting strengths of associations between mindfulness, meditation, and lucid dreaming frequency, and the link between lucid dreaming and meta-awareness has not yet been empirically studied. This study evaluated the associations between lucid dreaming frequency and different meditation practice styles, mindfulness traits, and individual differences in meta-awareness through an online survey (n = 635). The results suggest that daily frequent meditators experience more lucid dreams than non-frequent meditators. However, weekly frequent meditators did not have a higher lucid dreaming frequency. A positive association was observed between open monitoring styles of meditation and lucid dreaming. The findings also indicate that meta-awareness is higher for meditators and weekly lucid dreamers. Furthermore, frequent lucid dreaming was commonly associated with a non-reactive stance and experiencing transcendence. Overall, the findings suggest a positive relationship between specific meditation practices and lucid dreaming as well as the importance of meta-awareness as a cognitive process linking meditation, mindfulness, and lucid dreaming.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/5/ENEURO.0408-23.2024?rss=1">Structural Neuroplasticity Effects of Singing in Chronic Aphasia</a></h4>

              
                <p>Singing-based treatments of aphasia can improve language outcomes, but the neural benefits of group-based singing in aphasia are unknown. Here, we set out to determine the structural neuroplasticity changes underpinning group-based singing-induced treatment effects in chronic aphasia. Twenty-eight patients with at least mild nonfluent poststroke aphasia were randomized into two groups that received a 4-month multicomponent singing intervention (singing group) or standard care (control group). High-resolution T1 images and multishell diffusion-weighted MRI data were collected in two time points (baseline/5&nbsp;months). Structural gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) neuroplasticity changes were assessed using language network region of interest-based voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and quantitative anisotropy-based connectometry, and their associations to improved language outcomes (Western Aphasia Battery Naming and Repetition) were evaluated. Connectometry analyses showed that the singing group enhanced structural WM connectivity in the left arcuate fasciculus (AF) and corpus callosum as well as in the frontal aslant tract (FAT), superior longitudinal fasciculus, and corticostriatal tract bilaterally compared with the control group. Moreover, in VBM, the singing group showed GM volume increase in the left inferior frontal cortex (Brodmann area 44) compared with the control group. The neuroplasticity effects in the left BA44, AF, and FAT correlated with improved naming abilities after the intervention. These findings suggest that in the poststroke aphasia group, singing can bring about structural neuroplasticity changes in left frontal language areas and in bilateral language pathways, which underpin treatment-induced improvement in speech production.</p>
