              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Computational modeling of threat learning reveals links with anxiety and neuroanatomy in humans</a></h4>

              
                Influential theories implicate variations in the mechanisms supporting threat learning in the severity of anxiety symptoms. We use computational models of associative learning in conjunction with structural imaging to explicate links among the mechanisms underlying threat learning, their neuroanatomical substrates, and anxiety severity in humans. We recorded skin-conductance data during a threat-learning task from individuals with and without anxiety disorders (N=251; 8-50 years; 116 females). Reinforcement-learning model variants quantified processes hypothesized to relate to anxiety: threat conditioning, threat generalization, safety learning, and threat extinction. We identified the best-fitting models for these processes and tested associations among latent learning parameters, whole-brain anatomy, and anxiety severity. Results indicate that greater anxiety severity related specifically to slower safety learning and slower extinction of response to safe stimuli. Nucleus accumbens gray-matter volume moderated learning-anxiety associations. Using a modeling approach, we identify computational mechanisms linking threat learning and anxiety severity and their neuroanatomical substrates.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fear engrams and NPYergic circuit in the dorsal dentate gyrus determine remote fear memory generalization.</a></h4>

              
                Generalization is a critical feature of aversive memories and significantly contributes to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) pathogenesis. While fear memories over time tend to generalize across differences in the contextual background and even to novel contextual settings, this effect can be counteracted by exposure to controlled reminder sessions even at remote time points. Using Pavlovian fear conditioning in mice, we show that generalization to a novel context of remote memory is associated with a loss of cellular engram activation in the dorsal dentate gyrus (dDG) and can be effectively counteracted by a preceding contextual reminder session. In addition to engram cells activation in response to a novel context, the reminder session also leads to a recovery of neuropeptide Y (NPY) function in the dDG and dDG-CA3 neurotransmission. In line with a proposed role of NPY as a resilience factor, we found that chronic viral knockdown of NPY in the dDG and blockage of its activity-dependent expression in NPYergic dDG interneurons with dominant-negative CREBS133A both increase remote memory generalization. With chemogenetic silencing of these interneurons, we could localize their critical involvement to a time window during and immediately following the fear memory acquisition. Together, these findings suggest that NPYergic interneurons of the dDG, shaping the memory engram during fear learning and early consolidation, determine fear generalization.

	<p>As many distributional learning (DL) studies have shown, adult listeners can achieve discrimination of a difficult non-native contrast after a short repetitive exposure to tokens falling at the extremes of that contrast. Such studies have shown using behavioural methods that a short distributional training can induce perceptual learning of vowel and consonant contrasts. However, much less is known about the neurological correlates of DL, and few studies have examined non-native lexical tone contrasts. Here, Australian-English speakers underwent DL training on a Mandarin tone contrast using behavioural (discrimination, identification) and neural (oddball-EEG) tasks, with listeners hearing either a bimodal or a unimodal distribution. Behavioural results show that listeners learned to discriminate tones after both unimodal and bimodal training; while EEG responses revealed more learning for listeners exposed to the bimodal distribution. Thus, perceptual learning through exposure to brief sound distributions (a) extends to non-native tonal contrasts, and (b) is sensitive to task, phonetic distance, and acoustic cue-weighting. Our findings have implications for models of how auditory and phonetic constraints influence speech learning.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">The Interaction of Cue Type and Its Associated Behavioral Response Dissociates the Neural Activity between the Perirhinal and Postrhinal Cortices</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The perirhinal cortex (PER) and postrhinal cortex (POR) in the medial temporal lobe are commonly described as two distinct systems that process nonspatial and spatial information, respectively. Recent findings suggest that the two regions exhibit functional overlap when processing stimulus information, especially when associative responses are required in goal-directed behavior. However, we lack the neural correlates of this. In the current study, we recorded spiking activities for single units of the PER and POR as rats were required to choose a response associated with the identity of a visual object or scene stimulus. We found that similar proportions of cells fired selectively for either scene or object between the two regions. In the PER and POR, response-selective neurons showed higher contrast for different responses than stimulus-selective cells did for stimuli. More cells fired selectively for specific choice response in the POR than in the PER. The differential firing patterns of the PER and POR were best explained when the stimulus and response components were considered together: Stimulus-selective cells were modulated more by the response in the POR than in the PER, whereas response-selective cells in the PER were modulated more by object information than by scenes. Our results suggest that in a goal-directed memory task, the information processing in the PER and POR may be dynamically modulated not only by input stimulus information but also by the associated choice behavior and stimulus&ndash;response interaction.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Drosophila Tet Is Required for Maintaining Glial Homeostasis in Developing and Adult Fly Brains</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins are crucial epigenetic regulators highly conserved in multicellular organisms. TETs&rsquo; enzymatic function in demethylating 5-methyl cytosine in DNA is required for proper development and TETs are frequently mutated in cancer. Recently, <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I> Tet (dTet) was shown to be highly expressed in developing fly brains and discovered to play an important role in brain and muscle development as well as fly behavior. Furthermore, dTet was shown to have different substrate specificity compared with mammals. However, the exact role dTet plays in glial cells and how ectopic TET expression in glial cells contributes to tumorigenesis and glioma is still not clear. Here, we report a novel role for dTet specifically in glial cell organization and number. We show that loss of dTet affects the organization of a specific glia population in the optic lobe, the "optic chiasm" glia. Additionally, we find irregularities in axon patterns in the ventral nerve cord (VNC) both, in the midline and longitudinal axons. These morphologic glia and axonal defects were accompanied by locomotor defects in developing larvae escalating to immobility in adult flies. Furthermore, glia homeostasis was disturbed in dTet-deficient brains manifesting in gain of glial cell numbers and increased proliferation. Finally, we establish a <I>Drosophila</I> model to understand the impact of human TET3 in glia and find that ectopic expression of hTET3 in dTet-expressing cells causes glia expansion in larval brains and affects sleep/rest behavior and the circadian clock in adult flies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Characterization of Hypothalamic MCH Neuron Development in a 3D Differentiation System of Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Hypothalamic melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons are important regulators of multiple physiological processes, such as sleep, feeding, and memory. Despite the increasing interest in their neuronal functions, the molecular mechanism underlying MCH neuron development remains poorly understood. We report that a three-dimensional culture of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) can generate hypothalamic-like tissues containing MCH-positive neurons, which reproduce morphologic maturation, neuronal connectivity, and neuropeptide/neurotransmitter phenotype of native MCH neurons. Using this <I>in vitro</I> system, we demonstrate that Hedgehog (Hh) signaling serves to produce major neurochemical subtypes of MCH neurons characterized by the presence or absence of cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART). Without exogenous Hh signals, mESCs initially differentiated into dorsal hypothalamic/prethalamic progenitors and finally into MCH<sup>+</sup>CART<sup>+</sup> neurons through a specific intermediate progenitor state. Conversely, activation of the Hh pathway specified ventral hypothalamic progenitors that generate both MCH<sup>+</sup>CART<sup>&ndash;</sup> and MCH<sup>+</sup>CART<sup>+</sup> neurons. These results suggest that <I>in vivo</I> MCH neurons may originate from multiple cell lineages that arise through early dorsoventral patterning of the hypothalamus. Additionally, we found that Hh signaling supports the differentiation of mESCs into orexin/hypocretin neurons, a well-defined cell group intermingled with MCH neurons in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA). The present study highlights and improves the utility of mESC culture in the analysis of the developmental programs of specific hypothalamic cell types.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">More Prominent Nonlinear Mixed Selectivity in the Dorsolateral Prefrontal than Posterior Parietal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Neurons in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) are activated by different cognitive tasks and respond differently to the same stimuli depending on task. The conjunctive representations of multiple tasks in nonlinear fashion in single neuron activity, is known as nonlinear mixed selectivity (NMS). Here, we compared NMS in a working memory task in areas 8a and 46 of the dlPFC and 7a and lateral intraparietal cortex (LIP) of the PPC in macaque monkeys. NMS neurons were more frequent in dlPFC than in PPC and this was attributed to more cells gaining selectivity in the course of a trial. Additionally, in our task, the subjects&rsquo; behavioral performance improved within a behavioral session as they learned the session-specific statistics of the task. The magnitude of NMS in the dlPFC also increased as a function of time within a single session. On the other hand, we observed minimal rotation of population responses and no appreciable differences in NMS between correct and error trials in either area. Our results provide direct evidence demonstrating a specialization in NMS between dlPFC and PPC and reveal mechanisms of neural selectivity in areas recruited in working memory tasks.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Menopause status moderates sex differences in tau burden: a Framingham PET Study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Women have a higher lifetime risk of AD than men. Among cognitively normal (CN) older adults, women exhibit elevated tau positron emission tomography (PET) signal compared with men. We explored whether menopause exacerbates sex differences in tau deposition in middle-aged adults.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>328 CN participants from the Framingham Study (mean age=57yrs(±10yrs), 161 women, of whom, 104 were post-menopausal) underwent tau and β-amyloid (Aβ)-PET neuroimaging. We examined global Aβ-PET, and tau-PET signal in five regions identified <i>a priori</i> as demonstrating significant sex differences in older adults (in temporal, inferior parietal, middle frontal, and lateral occipital regions). We examined sex and menopause status-related differences in each region-of-interest, using linear regressions, as well as interactions with Aβ and APOEε4 genotype.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Women exhibited higher tau-PET signal (<i>p</i>&lt;0.002), and global Aβ-PET (<i>p</i>=0.010), than men in inferior parietal, rostral middle frontal, and lateral occipital regions. Compared with age-matched men, post-menopausal women showed significantly higher tau-PET signal in parieto-occipital regions (<i>p</i>&lt;0.0001). By contrast, no differences in tau-PET signal existed between pre-menopausal women and men. Aβ-PET was not associated with menopausal status or age. Neither Aβ-PET nor APOEε4 status moderated sex or menopause associations with tau-PET.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Clear divergence in tauopathy between the sexes are apparent approximately 20 years earlier than previously reported. Menopause status moderated sex differences in Aβ and tau-PET burden, with tau first appearing post-menopause. Sex and menopause differences consistently appeared in middle frontal and parieto-occipital regions but were not moderated by Aβ burden or APOEε4, suggesting that menopause-related tau vulnerability may be independent of AD-related pathways.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Biallelic variants in the ectonucleotidase ENTPD1 cause a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with intellectual disability, distinct white matter abnormalities, and spastic paraplegia</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Human genomics established that pathogenic variation in diverse genes can underlie a single disorder. For example, hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is associated with over 80 genes with frequently only few affected individuals described for each gene. Herein, we characterize a large cohort of individuals with biallelic variation in <i>ENTPD1</i>, a gene previously linked to spastic paraplegia 64 (MIM# 615683).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Individuals with biallelic <i>ENTPD1</i> variants were recruited worldwide. Deep phenotyping and molecular characterizations were performed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 27 individuals from 17 unrelated families were studied; additional phenotypic information was collected from published cases. Twelve novel pathogenic <i>ENTPD1</i> variants are described: c.398_399delinsAA; p.(Gly133Glu), c.540del; p.(Thr181Leufs<sup>*</sup>18), c.640del; p.(Gly216Glufs<sup>*</sup>75), c.185T&gt;G; p.(Leu62*), c.1531T&gt;C; p.(*511Glnext<sup>*</sup>100), c.967C&gt;T; p.(Gln323*), c.414-2_414-1del, and c.146 A&gt;G; p.(Tyr49Cys) including four recurrent variants c.1109T&gt;A; p.(Leu370<sup>*</sup>), c.574-6_574-3del, c.770_771del; p.(Gly257Glufs*18), and c.1041del; p.(Ile348Phefs*19). Shared disease traits include: childhood-onset, progressive spastic paraplegia, intellectual disability (ID), dysarthria, and white matter abnormalities. <i>In vitro</i> assays demonstrate that <i>ENTPD1</i> expression and function are impaired and that c.574-6_574-3del causes exon skipping. Global metabolomics demonstrates ENTPD1 deficiency leads to impaired nucleotide, lipid, and energy metabolism.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The <i>ENTPD1</i> locus trait consists of childhood disease-onset, ID, progressive spastic paraparesis, dysarthria, dysmorphisms, and white matter abnormalities with some individuals showing neurocognitive regression. Investigation of an allelic series of <i>ENTPD1</i>: i) expands previously described features of <i>ENTPD1</i>-related neurological disease, ii) highlights the importance of genotype-driven deep phenotyping, iii) documents the need for global collaborative efforts to characterize rare AR disease traits, and iv) provides insights into the disease trait neurobiology.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Multi-targeting of K-Ras domains and mutations by peptide and small molecule inhibitors</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mansour Poorebrahim, Mohammad Foad Abazari, Leila Moradi, Behzad Shahbazi, Reza Mahmoudi, Hourieh Kalhor, Hassan Askari, Ladan Teimoori-Toolabi</p>

K-Ras activating mutations are significantly associated with tumor progression and aggressive metastatic behavior in various human cancers including pancreatic cancer. So far, despite a large number of concerted efforts, targeting of mutant-type K-Ras has not been successful. In this regard, we aimed to target this oncogene by a combinational approach consisting of small peptide and small molecule inhibitors. Based on a comprehensive analysis of structural and physicochemical properties of predominantly K-Ras mutants, an anti-cancer peptide library and a small molecule library were screened to simultaneously target oncogenic mutations and functional domains of mutant-type K-Ras located in the P-loop, switch I, and switch II regions. The selected peptide and small molecule showed notable binding affinities to their corresponding binding sites, and hindered the growth of tumor cells carrying K-Ras<sup>G12D</sup> and K-Ras<sup>G12C</sup> mutations. Of note, the expression of K-Ras downstream genes (i.e., CTNNB1, CCND1) was diminished in the treated Kras-positive cells. In conclusion, our combinational platform signifies a new potential for blockade of oncogenic K-Ras and thereby prevention of tumor progression and metastasis. However, further validations are still required regarding the <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> efficacy and safety of this approach.

<p>Rosy bitterling brain at 165 hours postfertilization. Tissue boundaries, periventricular proliferation zones, and ventricular spaces are all detectable by microCT in this very early stage. Three-dimensional visualization with microCT scanning protocols is extremely useful for the study of the rosy bitterling and provides an updating of imaging modalities for morphological and anatomical analyses in this nonmodel organism.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Bitterlings are carp-like teleost fish (Cypriniformes: Acheilanathidae) known for their specialized brood parasitic lifestyle. Bitterling embryos, in fact, develop inside the gill chamber of their freshwater mussel hosts. However, little is known about how their parasitic lifestyle affects brain development in comparison to nonparasitic species. Here, we document the development of the brain of the rosy bitterling, <i>Rhodeus ocellatus</i>, at four embryonic stages of 165, 185, 210, 235 hours postfertilization (hpf) using micro-computed tomography (microCT). Focusing on developmental regionalization and brain ventricular organization, we relate the development of the brain divisions to those described for zebrafish using the prosomeric model as a reference paradigm. Segmentation and three-dimensional visualization of the ventricular system allowed us to identify changes in the longitudinal brain axis as a result of cephalic flexure during development. The results show that during early embryonic and larval development, histological differentiation, tissue boundaries, periventricular proliferation zones, and ventricular spaces are all detectable by microCT. The results of this study visualized with differential CT profiles are broadly consistent with comparable histological studies, and with the genoarchitecture of teleosts like the zebrafish. Compared to the zebrafish, our study identifies distinct developmental heterochronies in the rosy bitterling, such as a precocious development of the inferior lobe.</p>

                The cerebral cortex is spontaneously active. Miller et al. find that spontaneous cortical activity increases after a visual habituation, a simple form of learning. Furthermore, boosting spontaneous activity with optogenetics is sufficient to accelerate visual habituation.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">High-throughput single-molecule experiments reveal heterogeneity, state switching, and three interconnected pause states in transcription</a></h4>

              
                Combining single-molecule experimentation with computational modeling, Janissen et al. capture Escherichia coli RNAp-pausing dynamics on timescales from milliseconds to hours. They identify two long-lived pause states that compete with elongation and recover via nascent RNA cleavage. The authors provide a consensus mechanistic model unifying biochemical and single-molecule observations.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">circMbl functions in cis and in trans to regulate gene expression and physiology in a tissue-specific fashion</a></h4>

              
                Pamudurti et al. show that splicing factor mbl is expressed and promotes circularization of its own locus in a cell-type-specific manner in vivo. In photoreceptors, circMbl2-4 regulates in trans MBL-O/P, while in the brain, circMbl regulates MBL-C. Moreover, circMbl has functions in trans related to locomotor behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">piRNA-guided intron removal from pre-mRNAs regulates density-dependent reproductive strategy</a></h4>

              
                He et al. find that Piwi/piRNAs recruit splicing factors to remove introns harboring repetitive elements from pre-mRNAs of reproduction-related genes in early developmental germ cells of insects and mice. This piRNA-guided splicing promotes germ cell maturation, regulating the plasticity of locust fecundity.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Critical contribution of 3′ non-seed base pairing to the in vivo function of the evolutionarily conserved let-7a microRNA</a></h4>

              
                Duan et al. find that microRNA-target pairing at g11–g16 is critical for the function of evolutionarily conserved microRNA let-7a; 3′ pairing is required for both perfect and imperfect seed in regulating multiple targets. These findings provide evidence that base pairing of specific microRNA non-seed nucleotides can critically contribute to target regulation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cohesin-dependence of neuronal gene expression relates to chromatin loop length</a></h4>

              
                Cohesin and CTCF are major drivers of 3D genome organization, but their role in neurons is still emerging. Here we show a prominent role for cohesin in the expression of genes that facilitate neuronal maturation and homeostasis. Unexpectedly, we observed two major classes of activity-regulated genes with distinct reliance on cohesin in mouse primary cortical neurons. Immediate early genes remained fully inducible by KCl and BDNF, and short-range enhancer-promoter contacts at the Immediate early gene <i>Fos</i> formed robustly in the absence of cohesin. In contrast, cohesin was required for full expression of a subset of secondary response genes characterised by long-range chromatin contacts. Cohesin-dependence of constitutive neuronal genes with key functions in synaptic transmission and neurotransmitter signaling also scaled with chromatin loop length. Our data demonstrate that key genes required for the maturation and activation of primary cortical neurons depend on cohesin for their full expression, and that the degree to which these genes rely on cohesin scales with the genomic distance traversed by their chromatin contacts.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Microtubule assembly by soluble tau impairs vesicle endocytosis and excitatory neurotransmission via dynamin sequestration in Alzheimer's disease mice synapse model</a></h4>

              
                Elevation of soluble wild-type (WT) tau occurs in synaptic compartments in Alzheimer's disease. We addressed whether tau elevation affects synaptic transmission at the calyx of Held in slices from mice brainstem. Whole-cell loading of WT human tau (h-tau) in presynaptic terminals at 10-20 µM caused microtubule (MT) assembly and activity-dependent rundown of excitatory neurotransmission. Capacitance measurements revealed that the primary target of WT h-tau is vesicle endocytosis. Blocking MT assembly using nocodazole prevented tau-induced impairments of endocytosis and neurotransmission. Immunofluorescence imaging analyses revealed that MT assembly by WT h-tau loading was associated with an increased MT-bound fraction of the endocytic protein dynamin. A synthetic dodecapeptide corresponding to dynamin-1-pleckstrin-homology domain inhibited MT-dynamin interaction and rescued tau-induced impairments of endocytosis and neurotransmission. We conclude that elevation of presynaptic WT tau induces <i>de novo</i> assembly of MTs, thereby sequestering free dynamins. As a result, endocytosis and subsequent vesicle replenishment are impaired, causing activity-dependent rundown of neurotransmission.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Neutrophil extracellular traps arm DC vaccination against NPM-mutant myeloproliferation</a></h4>

              
                Neutrophil extracellular traps (NET) are web-like chromatin structures composed by dsDNA and histones, decorated with anti-microbial proteins. Their interaction with dendritic cells (DC) allows DC activation and maturation toward presentation of NET-associated antigens. Differently from other types of cell death that imply protein denaturation, NETosis preserves the proteins localized onto the DNA threads for proper enzymatic activity and conformational status, including immunogenic epitopes. Besides neutrophils, leukemic cells can release extracellular traps displaying leukemia-associated antigens, prototypically mutant nucleophosmin (NPMc+) that upon mutation translocates from nucleolus to the cytoplasm localizing onto NET threads. We tested NPMc+ immunogenicity through a NET/DC vaccine to treat NPMc-driven myeloproliferation in transgenic and transplantable models. Vaccination with DC loaded with NPMc+ NET (NPMc+ NET/DC) reduced myeloproliferation in transgenic mice, favoring the development of antibodies to mutant NPMc and and the induction of a CD8+ T cell response. The efficacy of this vaccine was also tested in mixed NPMc/WT bone marrow chimeras in a competitive bone marrow transplantation setting, where the NPMc+ NET/DC vaccination impaired the expansion of NPMc+ in favor of WT myeloid compartment. NPMc+ NET/DC vaccination also achieved control of an aggressive leukemia transduced with mutant NPMc, effectively inducing an anti-leukemia CD8 T cell memory response.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Opioid analgesia alters corticospinal coupling along the descending pain system in healthy participants</a></h4>

              
                Opioids are potent analgesic drugs with widespread cortical, subcortical, and spinal targets. In particular, the central pain system comprising ascending and descending pain pathways has high opioid receptor densities and is thus crucial for opioid analgesia. Here, we investigated the effects of the opioid remifentanil in a large sample (n = 78) of healthy male participants using combined corticospinal functional MRI. This approach offers the possibility to measure BOLD responses simultaneously in the brain and spinal cord, allowing us to investigate the role of corticospinal coupling in opioid analgesia. Our data show that opioids altered activity in regions involved in pain processing such as somatosensory regions, including the spinal cord and pain modulation such as prefrontal regions. Moreover, coupling strength along the descending pain system, that is, between the anterior cingulate cortex, periaqueductal gray, and spinal cord, was stronger in participants who reported stronger analgesia during opioid treatment while participants that received saline showed reduced coupling when experiencing less pain. These results indicate that coupling along the descending pain pathway is a potential mechanism of opioid analgesia and can differentiate between opioid analgesia and unspecific reductions in pain such as habituation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A transcriptomic atlas of Aedes aegypti reveals detailed functional organization of major body parts and gut regional specializations in sugar-fed and blood-fed adult females</a></h4>

              
                Mosquito vectors transmit numerous pathogens, but large gaps remain in our understanding of their physiology. To facilitate future explorations of mosquito biology, with specific attention to the major vector <i>Aedes aegypti</i>, we have created Aegypti-Atlas (http://aegyptiatlas.buchonlab.com/), an online resource hosting RNAseq profiles of <i>Ae. aegypti</i> body parts (head, thorax, abdomen, gut, Malpighian tubules, and ovaries), gut regions (crop, proventriculus, anterior and posterior midgut, and hindgut), and a time course of blood meal digestion in the gut. Using Aegypti-Atlas, we provide new insights into the regionalization of gut function, blood feeding response, and immune defenses. We find that the anterior and posterior regions of the mosquito midgut possess clearly delineated digestive specializations which are preserved in the blood-fed state. Blood feeding initiates the sequential transcriptional induction and repression/depletion of multiple cohorts of peptidases throughout blood meal digestion. With respect to defense, immune signaling components, but not recognition or effector molecules, show enrichment in ovaries. Basal expression of antimicrobial peptides is dominated by two genes, holotricin and gambicin, that are expressed in the carcass and the digestive tissues, respectively, in a near mutually exclusive manner. In the midgut, gambicin and other immune effector genes are almost exclusively expressed in the anterior regions, while the posterior midgut exhibits the hallmarks of immune tolerance. Finally, in a cross-species comparison between the midguts of <i>Ae. aegypti</i> and <i>Anopheles gambiae</i> (<i>s.l.</i>), we observe that regional digestive and immune specializations are closely conserved, indicating that our data may yield inferences that are broadly relevant to multiple mosquito vector species. We further demonstrate that the expression of orthologous genes is highly correlated, with the exception of a ‘species signature’ comprising a small number of highly/disparately expressed genes. With this work, we show the potential of Aegypti-Atlas to unlock a more complete understanding of mosquito biology.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Reorganization of postmitotic neuronal chromatin accessibility for maturation of serotonergic identity</a></h4>

              
                Assembly of transcriptomes encoding unique neuronal identities requires selective accessibility of transcription factors to cis-regulatory sequences in nucleosome-embedded postmitotic chromatin. Yet, the mechanisms controlling postmitotic neuronal chromatin accessibility are poorly understood. Here, we show that unique distal enhancers define the <i>Pet1</i> neuron lineage that generates serotonin (5-HT) neurons in mice. Heterogeneous single cell chromatin landscapes are established early in postmitotic <i>Pet1 </i>neurons and reveal the putative regulatory programs driving Pet1 neuron subtype identities. Distal enhancer accessibility is highly dynamic as <i>Pet1</i> neurons mature, suggesting the existence of regulatory factors that reorganize postmitotic neuronal chromatin. We find that Pet1 and Lmx1b control chromatin accessibility to select <i>Pet1</i>-lineage specific enhancers for 5-HT neurotransmission. Additionally, these factors are required to maintain chromatin accessibility during early maturation suggesting that postmitotic neuronal open chromatin is unstable and requires continuous regulatory input. Together our findings reveal postmitotic transcription factors that reorganize accessible chromatin for neuron specialization.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Inhibitory proteins block substrate access by occupying the active site cleft of Bacillus subtilis intramembrane protease SpoIVFB</a></h4>

              
                Intramembrane proteases (IPs) function in numerous signaling pathways that impact health, but elucidating the regulation of membrane-embedded proteases is challenging. We examined inhibition of intramembrane metalloprotease SpoIVFB by proteins BofA and SpoIVFA. We found that SpoIVFB inhibition requires BofA residues in and near a predicted transmembrane segment (TMS). This segment of BofA occupies the SpoIVFB active site cleft based on cross-linking experiments. SpoIVFB inhibition also requires SpoIVFA. The inhibitory proteins block access of the substrate N-terminal region to the membrane-embedded SpoIVFB active site, based on additional cross-linking experiments; however, the inhibitory proteins did not prevent interaction between the substrate C-terminal region and the SpoIVFB soluble domain. We built a structural model of SpoIVFB in complex with BofA and parts of SpoIVFA and substrate, using partial homology and constraints from cross-linking and co-evolutionary analyses. The model predicts that conserved BofA residues interact to stabilize a TMS and a membrane-embedded C-terminal region. The model also predicts that SpoIVFA bridges the BofA C-terminal region and SpoIVFB, forming a membrane-embedded inhibition complex. Our results reveal a novel mechanism of IP inhibition with clear implications for relief from inhibition in vivo and design of inhibitors as potential therapeutics.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A bidirectional switch in the Shank3 phosphorylation state biases synapses toward up or down scaling</a></h4>

              
                Homeostatic synaptic plasticity requires widespread remodeling of synaptic signaling and scaffolding networks, but the role of posttranslational modifications in this process has not been systematically studied. Using deepscale quantitative analysis of the phosphoproteome in mouse neocortical neurons, we found wide-spread and temporally complex changes during synaptic scaling up and down. We observed 424 bidirectionally modulated phosphosites that were strongly enriched for synapse-associated proteins, including S1539 in the ASD-associated synaptic scaffold protein Shank3. Using a parallel proteomic analysis performed on Shank3 isolated from rat neocortical neurons by immunoaffinity, we identified two sites that were persistently hypo-phosphorylated during scaling up and transiently hyper-phosphorylated during scaling down: one (rat S1615) that corresponded to S1539 in mouse, and a second highly conserved site, rat S1586. The phosphorylation status of these sites modified the synaptic localization of Shank3 during scaling protocols, and dephosphorylation of these sites via PP2A activity was essential for the maintenance of synaptic scaling up. Finally, phosphomimetic mutations at these sites prevented scaling up but not down, while phosphodeficient mutations prevented scaling down but not up. These mutations did not impact baseline synaptic strength, indicating that they gate, rather than drive, the induction of synaptic scaling. Thus an activity-dependent switch between hypo- and hyperphosphorylation at S1586 and S1615 of Shank3 enables scaling up or down, respectively. Collectively our data show that activity-dependent phosphoproteome dynamics are important for the functional reconfiguration of synaptic scaffolds, and can bias synapses toward upward or downward homeostatic plasticity.

                The influence of genetic variation on the aging process, including the incidence and severity of age-related diseases, is complex. Here we define the evolutionarily conserved mitochondrial enzyme ALH-6/ALDH4A1 as a predictive biomarker for age-related changes in muscle health by combining <i>C. elegans</i> genetics and a gene-wide association scanning (GeneWAS) from older human participants of the US Health and Retirement Study (HRS). In a screen for mutations that activate oxidative stress responses, specifically in the muscle of <i>C. elegans</i>, we identified 96 independent genetic mutants harboring loss-of-function alleles of <i>alh-6</i>, exclusively. Each of these genetic mutations mapped to the ALH-6 polypeptide and led to the age-dependent loss of muscle health. Intriguingly, genetic variants in <i>ALDH4A1</i> show associations with age-related muscle-related function in humans. Taken together, our work uncovers mitochondrial <i>alh-6/ALDH4A1</i> as a critical component to impact normal muscle aging across species and a predictive biomarker for muscle health over the lifespan.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">p75NTR prevents the onset of cerebellar granule cell migration via RhoA activation</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal migration is one of the fundamental processes during brain development. Several neurodevelopmental disorders can be traced back to dysregulated migration. Although substantial efforts have been placed in identifying molecular signals that stimulate migration, little is known about potential mechanisms that restrict migration. These restrictive mechanisms are essential for proper development since it helps coordinate the timing for each neuronal population to arrive and establish proper connections. Moreover, preventing migration away from a proliferative niche is necessary to maintain a pool of proliferating cells until the proper number of neuronal progenitors is attained. Here, we identify an anti-migratory role for the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) in cerebellar development. Our results show that granule cell precursors robustly express p75NTR in the external granule layer (EGL) when they are proliferating during postnatal development, however, they do not express p75NTR when they migrate either from the rhombic lip during embryonic development or from the EGL during postnatal development. We show that p75NTR prevented GCP migration by maintaining elevated levels of active RhoA. The expression of p75NTR was sufficient to prevent the migration of the granule cells even in the presence of BDNF, a well-established chemotactic signal for this cell population. Our findings suggest that the expression of p75NTR might be a critical signal that stops and maintains the GCPs in the proliferative niche of the EGL, promoting the clonal expansion of cerebellar granule neurons.

                The mammalian retina is considered an autonomous circuit, yet work dating back to Ramon y Cajal indicates that it receives inputs from the brain. How such inputs affect retinal processing has remained unknown. We identified brain-to-retina projections of histaminergic neurons from the mouse hypothalamus, which densely innervated the dorsal retina. Histamine application, or chemogenetic activation of histaminergic axons, altered spontaneous and light-evoked activity of various retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), including direction-selective RGCs. These cells exhibited broader directional tuning and gained responses to high motion velocities. Such changes could improve vision when objects move fast across the visual field (e.g. while running), which fits with the known increased activity of histaminergic neurons during arousal. In humans, an antihistamine drug non-uniformly modulated visual sensitivity across the visual field, indicating an evolutionary conserved function of the histaminergic system. Our findings expose a previously unappreciated role for brain-to-retina projections in modulating retinal function.

                Butterflies have evolved an immense diversity in eye organization to support a range of vision-based behaviors including courtship, oviposition, and foraging. This diversity has been surveyed extensively across the butterfly phylogeny, and here we take a complementary approach to characterize the eye within a group of closely related Heliconius butterflies. Using a combination of immunostaining for different opsins and eyeshine for determining the distribution of light-filtering screening pigments, we identified several sexually dimorphic features of eye organization where male eyes varied and female eyes did not. Ultraviolet (UV) sensitive photoreceptors varied in which of two UV opsins were expressed, including co-expression of both within single photoreceptors, and these differences were consistent with a role in courtship and conspecific identification. Additional differences across species and sex included the distribution of three ommatidial types defined by the expression pattern of UV and blue opsins, the distribution of a red screening pigment, and which ommatidial types expressed the red screening pigment. We hypothesize that female eyes are optimized for a dimorphic behavior such as oviposition, while male eyes adapt to other selective pressures such as the local light environment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">High precision magnetoencephalography reveals increased right-inferior frontal gyrus beta power during response conflict</a></h4>

              
                Flexibility of behavior and the ability to rapidly switch actions is critical for adaptive living in humans. It is well established that the right-inferior frontal gyrus (R-IFG) is recruited during outright action-stopping, relating to increased beta (12-30 Hz) power. Additionally, pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) is plausibly recruited during response conflict/switching, relating to increased theta (4-8 Hz) power. It has been posited that inhibiting incorrect response tendencies is central to motor flexibility. However, it is not known if the commonly reported R-IFG beta signature of response inhibition in action-stopping is also recruited during response conflict, which would suggest overlapping networks for stopping and switching. In the current study, we analyzed high precision magnetoencephalography (hpMEG) data recorded with very high trial numbers (total n > 10,000) from 8 subjects during different levels of response conflict. We hypothesized that a R-IFG-triggered network for response inhibition is domain general and also involved in mediating response conflict. We therefore tested whether R-IFG showed increased beta power dependent on the level of response conflict. We also hypothesized that pre-SMA is an important node in response conflict processing, and tested whether pre-SMA theta power increased for response conflict trials. Using event-related spectral perturbations and linear mixed modeling, we found that both R-IFG beta and pre-SMA theta increased for response conflict trials, with the R-IFG beta increase specific to trials with strong response conflict. This result supports a more generalized role for R-IFG beta in response inhibition, beyond simple stopping behavior towards response switching.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spatially-enhanced clusterwise inference for testing and localizing intermodal correspondence</a></h4>

              
                With the increasing availability of neuroimaging data from multiple modalities-each providing a different lens through which to study brain structure or function-new techniques for comparing, integrating, and interpreting information within and across modalities have emerged. Recent developments include hypothesis tests of associations between neuroimaging modalities, which can be used to determine the statistical significance of intermodal associations either throughout the entire brain or within anatomical subregions or functional networks. While these methods provide a crucial foundation for inference on intermodal relationships, they cannot be used to answer questions about where in the brain these associations are most pronounced. In this paper, we introduce a new method, called CLEAN-R, that can be used both to test intermodal correspondence throughout the brain and also to localize this correspondence. Our method involves first adjusting for the underlying spatial autocorrelation structure within each modality before aggregating information within small clusters to construct a map of spatially enhanced test statistics. Using structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging data from a subsample of children and adolescents from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, we conduct simulations and data analyses where we illustrate the high statistical power and nominal type I error levels of our method. By constructing an interpretable map of group-level correspondence using spatially-enhanced test statistics, our method offers insights beyond those provided by earlier methods.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">In vitro longitudinal lumbar spinal cord preparations to study sensory and recurrent motor microcircuits of juvenile mice</a></h4>

              
                In vitro spinal cord preparations have been extensively used to study microcircuits involved in the control of movement. By allowing precise control of experimental conditions coupled with state-of-the-art genetics, imaging and electrophysiological techniques, isolated spinal cords from mice have been an essential tool in detailing the identity, connectivity and function of spinal networks. The majority of the research has arisen from in vitro spinal cords of neonatal mice, which are still undergoing important postnatal maturation. Studies from adults have been attempted in transverse slices, however, these have been quite challenging due to the poor motoneuron accessibility and viability, as well as to the extensive damage to the motoneuron dendritic trees. In this work, we describe two types of coronal spinal cord preparations with either the ventral or the dorsal horn ablated, obtained from mice of different postnatal ages, spanning from pre-weaned to one month old. These semi-intact preparations allow recordings of sensory-afferent and motor-efferent responses from lumbar motoneurons using whole cell patch-clamp electrophysiology. We provide details of the slicing procedure and discuss the feasibility of whole-cell recordings. The in vitro dorsal and ventral horn-ablated spinal cord preparations described here are an useful tool to study spinal motor circuits in young mice that have reached the adult stages of locomotor development.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transfer of weight information depends differently on used hand and handedness for perception and action</a></h4>

              
                When lifting an object sequentially with the two hands, information about object weight can be transferred from one hand to the other. This information can be used to predictively scale fingertip forces and to form a perceptual estimation about the object's weight. This study investigated how weight information can be transferred between the two hands and how this depends on the used hand and handedness of the participant. Right- and left-handed participants lifted light and heavy objects with the right or left hand in a pseudorandomized order and estimated the object's weight. Results showed that predictive force scaling depended on the previously lifted object, with higher forces rates if a previous object was heavy. This known effect of sensorimotor memory was mostly independent of the used hand and handedness, indicating that weight information could be transferred for fingertip force scaling. Furthermore, a perceptual bias depending on the previous lifted object was found, with lower weight estimations when the previous object was heavy compared to light. In contrast to the results on force scaling, a transfer of this perceptual bias was only found in left-handed participants. In addition, right-handers only showed a bias when they used their dominant hand. These findings indicate that the transfer of weight information depends differently on the used hand and handedness for perceptual estimations and predictive force scaling.

                Dysfunctions of network activity and functional connectivity (FC) represent early events in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Astrocytes regulate neuronal activity in the healthy brain, but their involvement in early network hyperactivity in AD is unknown. We show increased FC in the human cingulate cortex, several years before amyloid deposition. We found the same early cingulate FC disruption and neuronal hyperactivity in AppNL-F mice. Crucially, these network disruptions are accompanied by decreased astrocyte calcium signaling. Recovery of astroglial calcium activity normalizes neuronal hyperactivity and FC, as well as seizure susceptibility and day/night behavioral hyperactivity. In conclusion, we show for the first time that astrocytes mediate initial features of AD and drive clinically relevant phenotypes.

                The idea that objects can be represented within multi-dimensional 'cognitive spaces' remains popular within psychology and neuroscience, and yet the restrictive topology of such spaces is seldom considered. Here, we show that it is possible, even within a simple set of items, to break such models by imposing neighbourhood relations that are incompatible with a purely spatial representation. These results highlight the fundamentally limits of cognitive space as a representational format for complex cognition.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Localization of chemical synapses and modulatory release sites in the cardiac ganglion of the crab, Cancer borealis</a></h4>

              
                The crustacean cardiac ganglion (CG) comprises nine neurons that provide rhythmic drive to the heart. The CG is the direct target of multiple modulators. Synapsin-like immunoreactivity was found clustered around the somata of the large cells (LC) and in a neuropil at the anterior branch of the CG trunk. This implicates the soma as a key site of synaptic integration, an unusual configuration in invertebrates. Proctolin is an excitatory neuromodulator of the CG and proctolin-like immunoreactivity exhibited partial overlap with putative chemical synapses near the LCs and at the neuropil. A proctolin-like projection was also found in a pair of excitatory nerves entering the CG. GABA-like immunoreactivity was nearly completely colocalized with chemical synapses near the LCs but absent at the anterior branch neuropil. GABA-like projections were found in a pair of inhibitory nerves entering the CG. Cancer borealis Allatostatin B1 (CbAST-B1), red pigment concentrating hormone (RPCH) and FLMRFamide-like immunoreactivity each had a unique pattern of staining and co-localization with putative chemical synapses. These results provide morphological evidence that synaptic input is integrated at LC somata in the CG. Our findings provide a topographical organization for some of the multiple inhibitory and excitatory modulators that alter the rhythmic output of this semi-autonomous motor circuit.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Alters the Waveform Shape of Cortical Gamma Oscillations</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal oscillations in different frequency bands have been linked to a wide variety of cognitive functions, and may even be a fundamental mechanism of inter-regional communication. For this reason, manipulation of oscillatory activity via brain stimulation is a central goal in neuroscience research. However, the vast majority of studies characterise oscillatory activity solely in terms of amplitude and frequency. Oscillations can also be characterised by their waveform shape; the degree to which they resemble or deviate from sinusoids. Here we exploit Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), a novel method that allows quantification of oscillatory waveform shape. We show for the first time that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) alters the waveform shape of gamma oscillatory activity in the visual cortex. Notably, changes in waveform shape were limited to one half of the phase cycle; anodal stimulation led to a relatively slower, and cathodal to a relatively faster, descending half-wave. tDCS is generally believed to affect cortical excitability via alteration of resting membrane potential. Interestingly, simulations of altered cortical excitability in a gamma-generating neuronal population indicated the waveform shape changes observed experimentally likely stem from stimulation of pyramidal neurons. These findings have implications for understanding the neural consequences of tDCS at the level of neuronal population phenomena such as cortical oscillations and underscore the importance of waveform shape as an important feature of neuronal oscillations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">From retina to motoneurons: a substrate for visuomotor transformation in salamanders</a></h4>

              
                The transformation of visual input into motor output is essential to approach a target or avoid a predator. In salamanders, visually-guided orientation behaviors have been extensively studied during prey capture. However, the neural circuitry involved is not resolved. Using salamander brain preparations, calcium imaging and tracing experiments, we describe a neural substrate through which retinal input is transformed into spinal motor output. We found that retina stimulation evoked responses in reticulospinal neurons of the middle reticular nucleus, known to control steering movements in salamanders. Microinjection of glutamatergic antagonists in the optic tectum (superior colliculus in mammals) decreased the reticulospinal responses. Using tracing we found that retina projected to the dorsal layers of the contralateral tectum, where the dendrites of neurons projecting to the middle reticular nucleus were located. In slices, stimulation of the tectal dorsal layers evoked glutamatergic responses in deep tectal neurons retrogradely labelled from the middle reticular nucleus. We then examined how tectum activation translated into spinal motor output. Tectum stimulation evoked motoneuronal responses, which were decreased by microinjections of glutamatergic antagonists in the contralateral middle reticular nucleus. Reticulospinal fibers anterogradely labelled from tracer injection in the middle reticular nucleus were preferentially distributed in proximity with the dendrites of ipsilateral motoneurons. Our work establishes a neural substrate linking visual and motor centers in salamanders. This retino-tecto-reticulo-spinal circuitry is well positioned to control orienting behaviors. Our study bridges the gap between the behavioral studies and the neural mechanisms involved in the transformation of visual input into motor output in salamanders.

                Striatal cell-type-specific vulnerability in Huntington's disease (HD) preferentially affects dopamine D2R-expressing projection neurons (SPNs), compatible with manifest motor symptomatology in HD. Transcriptional studies of striatal striosome-matrix compartmentalization in HD are, however, limited, despite pathologic evidence for striosome vulnerability aligning with early mood symptomatology. We used single-nucleus RNA-sequencing on striatal samples from two murine models, and rare Grade 1 HD patient tissues, to examine striosome and matrix sub-clusters within parent D1 and D2 SPN clusters. In human HD, striosomal SPNs were the most depleted SPN population. Surprisingly, for both mouse models, transcriptomic distinctiveness was diminished more for striosome-matrix SPNs than for D1-D2 SPNs. Compartmental markers were dysregulated so as to cancel endogenous identities as striosomal or matrix SPNs, but markers for D1-D2 exhibited less identity obscuring. The canonical striosome-matrix as well as D1-D2 organizations of the striatum thus are both strongly, but differentially, compromised in HD and are targets for therapeutics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Preterm infants voice processing is mediated by voice familiarity</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how prematurity and language or voice familiarity impact on language perception at birth becomes crucial to determine which brain regions support language processing at this age, and how an atypical early sensory experience affects language-related brain areas. However, the time-frequency correlates of maternal voice processing remain to date unknown. Ten preterm and ten full-term newborns underwent EEG recordings during the presentation of their mother's or a stranger's speech. The speech could be naturalistic (presented in the forward order) or non-naturalistic (in the backward order). Time-frequency decomposition was performed and task-related responses were analyzed following a topographical data driven clustering using General Linear Mixed model approaches. Differential responses were observed in left and right temporal areas. In the left-temporal areas, a specific processing of the naturalistic mother compared to stranger speech was observed in low-frequency bands (theta and alpha bands), but taking antagonistic forms in the two groups i.e. a power increase for full-term and a power decrease (theta) or maintenance (alpha) in preterm babies. Left-temporal low-beta activity presents, in full-term babies, in the forward condition, a power increase for the maternal voice and a power decrease for the stranger voice, which were not observed in preterm babies. In the right-temporal scalp area, we observed in the low-beta and low-gamma bands a mother forward specific power-decrease in the preterm population specifically, with higher values for the mother backward, while terms were mostly activated by the most unfamiliar stimulus, the stranger backward voice. The current study shows, through complex time-frequency patterns, that the naturalistic mother voice elicits expected brain responses in the full-term newborns, which were different from the preterm's ones, both in the left and right temporal areas.

                People show vast variability in skill learning. What determines a person's individual learning ability? In this study we explored the possibility to predict participants' future learning, based on their behavior during initial skill acquisition. We recruited a large online multi-session sample of participants performing a sequential tapping skill learning task. We trained machine learning models to predict future skill learning from raw data acquired during initial skill acquisition, and from engineered features calculated from the raw data. While the models did not explain learning, strong correlations were observed between initial and final performance. In addition, the results suggest that in correspondence with other empirical fields testing human behavior, canonical experimental tasks developed and selected to detect average effects may constrain insights regarding individual variability, relevant for real-life scenarios. Overall, implementing machine learning tools on large-scale data sets may provide a powerful approach towards revealing what differentiates between high and low innate learning abilities, paving the way for learning optimization techniques which may generalize beyond motor skill learning to broad learning abilities.

                Animal and human postmortem studies provide evidence for changes in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate in prefrontal cortex (PFC) during adolescence, suggesting shifts in excitation and inhibition balance consistent with critical period plasticity. However, how GABA and glutamate change through adolescence and how the balance of these inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters changes is not well understood in vivo in humans. High field (7 Tesla) Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging was used to investigate age-related changes in the balance of GABA/creatine (Cr) and glutamate/Cr in multiple developmentally-relevant regions of PFC in 144 10 to 30-year-olds. Results indicated a homogenous pattern of age-related Glu/Cr decreases across PFC regions, while age-related changes in GABA/Cr were heterogenous, with a mix of stable and decreasing age effects. Importantly, balance between glutamate/Cr and GABA/Cr in areas of prefrontal cortex increased through adolescence, suggesting the presence of critical period plasticity in PFC at this significant time of development when adult trajectories are established.

	<p>The current study was conducted to examine the percentages of cognitive skills deficits among Chinese children with developmental dyslexia. Via a systematic review, we collated twenty-two available studies on the proportion of cognitive skills deficits, including phonological awareness, rapid automatized naming, morphological awareness, orthographic knowledge, short-term memory and working memory, and visual and motor skills deficits, among Chinese children with developmental dyslexia. The results of a meta-analysis showed that the rapid automatized naming deficits are the core deficit of developmental dyslexia among Chinese children, with a pooled percentage of 44%. This is followed by orthographic knowledge deficits (43%), phonological awareness deficits (41%), morphological awareness deficits (40%), visual and motor skills deficits (33%), and short-term memory and working memory deficits (25%). At the same time, we compared the proportions of different locations, ages, standards and control groups.</p>

	<p>Working memory (WM) plays an important role in cognitive activity. The WM system is used to temporarily store information in learning and decision-making. WM always functions in many aspects of daily life, such as the short-term memory of words, cell phone verification codes, and cell phone numbers. In young adults, studies have shown that a central memory store is limited to three to five meaningful items. Little is known about how WM functions at the microscopic neural level, but appropriate neural network computational models can help us gain a better understanding of it. In this study, we attempt to design a microscopic neural network model to explain the internal mechanism of WM. The performance of existing positive feedback models depends on the parameters of a synapse. We use a negative-derivative feedback mechanism to counteract the drift in persistent activity, making the hybrid positive and negative-derivative feedback (HPNF) model more robust to common disturbances. To fulfill the mechanism of WM at the neural circuit level, we construct two main neural networks based on the HPNF model: a memory-storage sub-network (the memory-storage sub-network is composed of several sets of neurons, so we call it &amp;amp;ldquo;SET network&amp;amp;rdquo;, or &amp;amp;ldquo;SET&amp;amp;rdquo; for short) with positive feedback and negative-derivative feedback and a storage distribution network (SDN) designed by combining SET for memory item storage and memory updating. The SET network is a neural information self-sustaining mechanism, which is robust to common disturbances; the SDN constructs a storage distribution network at the neural circuit level; the experimental results show that our network can fulfill the storage, association, updating, and forgetting of information at the level of neural circuits, and it can work in different individuals with little change in parameters.</p>

	<p>Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) is a novel non-invasive treatment option for different diseases and symptoms, such as epilepsy or depression. Its mechanism of action, however, is still not fully understood. We investigated short-term taVNS-induced changes of local and global properties of EEG-derived, evolving functional brain networks from eighteen subjects who underwent two 1 h stimulation phases (morning and afternoon) during continuous EEG-recording. In the majority of subjects, taVNS induced measurable modifications of network properties. Network alterations induced by stimulation in the afternoon were clearly more pronounced than those induced by stimulation in the morning. Alterations mostly affected the networks&amp;amp;rsquo; topology and stability properties. On the local network scale, no clear-cut spatial stimulation-related patterns could be discerned. Our findings indicate that the possible impact of diurnal influences on taVNS-induced network modifications would need to be considered for future research and clinical studies of this non-pharmaceutical intervention approach.</p>

	<p>Hypnotizability is a cognitive trait associated with differences in the brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation of individuals with high hypnotizability (highs) and low hypnotizability scores (lows). The study investigated possible hypnotizability-related cerebrovascular differences. Among 24 healthy volunteers, the Stanford Hypnotic Susceptibility Scale Form A identified 13 medium-to-lows (med-lows), 11 medium-to-highs (med-highs), and 1 medium hypnotizable. Hypnotizability did not influence the significant changes produced by the trail making task (TMT), mental arithmetic task (MAT), hyperventilation (HVT), and rebreathing (RBT) on heart rate (HR), arterial blood pressure (ABP), and partial pressure of end-tidal CO2 (PETCO2), but moderated the correlations between the changes occurring during tasks with respect to basal conditions (&amp;amp;Delta;) in ABP and PETCO2 with middle cerebral artery flow velocity (MCAv). In HVT, med-lows exhibited a significant correlation between &amp;amp;Delta;MCAv and &amp;amp;Delta;PETCO2, and med-highs showed a significant correlation between &amp;amp;Delta;ABP and &amp;amp;Delta;MCAv. Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) and conductance (&amp;amp;Delta;CVCi) were significantly correlated with &amp;amp;Delta;MCAv only in med-lows during HVT and RBT. For the first time, cerebrovascular reactivity related to hypnotizability was investigated, evidencing different correlations among hemodynamic variables in med-highs and med-lows.</p>

	<p>With the significant rise in the prevalence of diabetes worldwide, diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) remains the most common complication among type 1 and 2 diabetics. The adverse sequelae of DPN, which include neuropathic pain, diabetic foot ulcers and lower-limb amputations, significantly impact quality of life and are major contributors to the biopsychosocial and economic burden of diabetes at the individual, societal and health system levels. Because DPN is often diagnosed in the late stages of disease progression by electromyography (EMG), and neuropathic pain as a result of DPN is difficult to treat, the need for earlier detection is crucial to better ascertain and manage the condition. Among the various modalities available to aid in the early detection of DPN, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a practical tool in DPN imaging due to its noninvasive radiation-free nature and its ability to relate real-time functional changes reflecting the local oxygen consumption of regions of the CNS due to external stimuli. This review aims to summarize the current body of knowledge regarding the utility of fMRI in detecting DPN by observing central nervous system (CNS) activity changes among individuals with DPN when compared to controls. The evidence to date points toward a tendency for increased activity in various central neuroanatomical structures that can be detected by fMRI and positively correlates with diabetic neuropathic pain.</p>

	<p>Mortality of acute coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is higher in men than in women. On the contrary, women experience more long-term consequences of the disease, such as fatigue. In this perspective article, we proposed a model of the potential factors that might contribute to the higher incidence of post-COVID-19 fatigue in women. Specifically, psycho-physiological factors are features that might increase central factors (e.g., inflammation) and result in greater perceptions of fatigue. Furthermore, pre-existing conditions likely play a prominent role. This model offers a framework for researchers and clinicians, and future research is required to validate our proposed model and elucidate all mechanisms of the increased incidence and prevalence of post-COVID-19 fatigue in women.</p>

	<p>Background: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor. The extent of resection (EOR) has been claimed as one of the most important prognostic factors. Fluorescent dyes aid surgeons in detecting a tumor&amp;amp;rsquo;s borders. 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) and sodium fluorescein (SF) are the most used. Only a few studies have directly compared these two fluorophores. Methods: A single center retrospective analysis of patients treated for GBM in the period between January 2018 and January 2021 was built to find any differences in terms of EOR, Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), and overall survival (OS) on the use of 5-ALA, SF, or both. Results: Overall, 99 patients affected by isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild-type Glioblastoma were included. 5-ALA was administered to 40 patients, SF to 44, and both to 15. No statistically significant associations were identified between the fluorophore and EOR (p = 0.783) or postoperative KPS (p = 0.270). Survival analyses did not show a selective advantage for the use of a given fluorophore (p = 0.184), although there appears to be an advantageous trend associated with the concomitant use of both dyes, particularly after stratification by MGMT (p = 0.071). Conclusions: 5-Ala and SF are equally useful in achieving gross total resection of the enhancing tumor volume. The combination of both fluorophores could lead to an OS advantage.</p>

	<p>In this paper, we describe the multimodal MRI findings in a patient with Wilson disease and a seizure disorder, characterized by an electroclinical picture resembling juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. The brain structural MRI showed a deposition of ferromagnetic materials in the basal ganglia, with marked hypointensities in T2-weighted images of globus pallidus internus bilaterally. A resting-state fMRI study revealed increased functional connectivity in the patient, compared to control subjects, in the following networks: (1) between the primary motor cortex and several cortical regions, including the secondary somatosensory cortex and (2) between the globus pallidus and the thalamo-frontal network. These findings suggest that globus pallidus alterations, due to metal accumulation, can lead to a reduction in the normal globus pallidus inhibitory tone on the thalamo-(motor)-cortical pathway. This, in turn, can result in hyperconnectivity in the motor cortex circuitry, leading to myoclonus and tonic-clonic seizures. We suppose that, in this patient, Wilson disease generated a &amp;amp;lsquo;lesion model&amp;amp;rsquo; of myoclonic epilepsy.</p>

	<p>The leading factors of post-stroke disability are motor disorders and cognitive dysfunctions. The aim of the study was to identify and provide a rationale for the variable early cognitive dysfunction in right and left hemispheric damage in patients with acute stroke. The study included 80 patients diagnosed with ischemic stroke. All patients were assessed for cognitive status, depression, fatigue and anxiety. For objectification, the method of evoked potentials (P300) and neuroimaging were used. Our findings revealed distinguishing features of cognitive dysfunction and identified a combination of the most informative markers characteristic of right and left hemispheric damage in patients with acute ischemic stroke. In patients with damage to the left hemisphere, a predominance of dysregulation syndrome (decrease in executive function and attention) was revealed, accompanied by various disorders such as severe anxiety and fatigue. The causes of this cognitive dysfunction may be directly related to stroke (damage to subcortical structures), as well as to a preexisting reduction in higher mental functions associated with age and vascular conditions. Cognitive impairments in patients with lesions of the right hemisphere were characterized by polymorphism and observed in the mental praxis, speech (with predominant semantic component) and abstract thinking domains. They are closely linked to each other and are more related to the lateralization of the lesion and preexisting neurodegeneration than to the localization of the ischemic lesion. The study of P300-evoked potentials is a good tool for confirming cognitive dysfunction. The latent period of the P300 wave is more sensitive to neurodegeneration, while the amplitude factor characterizes vascular pathology to a greater extent. The results of the study provide a rationale for a comprehensive assessment of lateralization, stroke localization, underlying diseases, neurophysiological parameters and identified cognitive impairments when developing a plan of rehabilitation and neuropsychological measures aimed at cognitive and emotional recovery of patients both in the acute phase of ischemic stroke and when selecting further personalized rehabilitation programs.</p>

	<p>Science is starting to unravel the neural basis of romantic love. The goal of this literature review was to identify and interpret the electrophysiological correlates of romantic love. Electroencephalography (EEG) and event-related potential (ERP) studies with a design that elicits romantic love feelings were included. The methods of previous EEG studies are too heterogeneous to draw conclusions. Multiple ERP studies, however, have shown that beloved stimuli elicit an enhanced late positive potential (LPP/P3/P300), which is not due to familiarity, positive valence, or objective beauty. This effect occurs in Western and Eastern cultures and for pictorial and verbal information, and results from bottom-up rather than top-down factors. Studies have also shown that beloved stimuli elicit an early posterior negativity (EPN), which also does not seem to be due to familiarity or positive valence. Data on earlier ERP components (P1, N1, P2, N170/VPP, N2) is scarce and mixed. Of course, the enhanced LPP and EPN are not specific to romantic love. Instead, they suggest that the beloved captures early attention, within 200&amp;amp;ndash;300 ms after stimulus onset that is relatively resource-independent, and subsequently receives sustained motivated attention. Future research would benefit from employing cognitive tasks and testing participants who are in love regardless of relationship status.</p>

	<p>Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder and the leading cause of death among older individuals. Available treatment strategies only temporarily mitigate symptoms without modifying disease progression. Recent studies revealed the multifaceted neurobiology of AD and shifted the target of drug development. Established animal models of AD are mostly tailored to yield a subset of disease phenotypes, which do not recapitulate the complexity of sporadic late-onset AD, the most common form of the disease. The use of human induced pluripotent stem cells (HiPSCs) offers unique opportunities to fill these gaps. Emerging technology allows the development of disease models that recapitulate a brain-like microenvironment using patient-derived cells. These models retain the individual&amp;amp;rsquo;s unraveled genetic background, yielding clinically relevant disease phenotypes and enabling cost-effective, high-throughput studies for drug discovery. Here, we review the development of various HiPSC-based models to study AD mechanisms and their application in drug discovery.</p>

	<p>Previous work has shown relations between domain-general processes, domain-specific processes, and mathematical ability. However, the underlying neurophysiological effects of mathematical ability are less clear. Recent evidence highlighted the potential role of beta oscillations in mathematical ability. Here we investigate whether domain-general (working memory) and domain-specific (number sense) processes mediate the relation between resting-state beta oscillations and mathematical ability, and how this may differ as a function of development (children vs. adults). We compared a traditional analysis method normally used in EEG studies with a more recently developed parameterization method that separates periodic from aperiodic activity. Regardless of methods chosen, we found no support for mediation of working memory and number sense, neither for children nor for adults. However, we found subtle differences between the methods. Additionally, we showed that the traditional EEG analysis method conflates periodic activity with aperiodic activity; in addition, the latter is strongly related to mathematical ability and this relation differs between children and adults. At the cognitive level, our findings do not support previous suggestions of a mediation of working memory and number sense. At the neurophysiological level our findings suggest that aperiodic, rather than periodic, activity is linked to mathematical ability as a function of development.</p>

	<p>The ability to accurately repeat meaningless nonwords or lists of spoken digits in correct order have been associated with vocabulary acquisition in both first and second language. Individual differences in these tasks are thought to depend on the phonological loop component of working memory. However, phonological working memory may itself depend on more elementary processes. We asked whether auditory non-verbal short-term memory (STM) for patterns in time supports immediate recall of speech-based sequences. Participants tapped temporal sequences consisting of short and long beeps and repeated nonsense sentences sounding like their native language or an unfamiliar language. As a language learning task, they also memorized familiar-word&amp;amp;ndash;foreign-word pairs. Word learning was directly predicted by nonsense sentence repetition accuracy. It was also predicted by temporal pattern STM. However, this association was mediated by performance on the repetition measure. We propose that STM for temporal patterns may reflect a component skill that provides the context signal necessary to encode order in phonological STM. It would be needed to support representation of the prosodic profile of language material, which allows syllables in words and words in sentences to be ordered and temporally grouped for short-term representation and long-term learning.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Transcriptomically-Guided Pharmacological Experiments in Neocortical and Hippocampal NPY-Positive GABAergic Interneurons</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Cortical GABAergic interneurons have been shown to fulfil important roles by inhibiting excitatory principal neurons. Recent transcriptomic studies have confirmed seminal discoveries that used anatomic and electrophysiological methods highlighting the existence of multiple different classes of GABAergic interneurons. Although some of these studies have emphasized that inter-regional differences may exist for a given class, the extent of such differences remains unknown. To address this problem, we used single-cell Patch-RNAseq to characterize neuropeptide Y (NPY)-positive GABAergic interneurons in superficial layers of the primary auditory cortex (AC) and in distal layers of area CA3 in mice. We found that more than 300 genes are differentially expressed in NPY-positive neurons between these two brain regions. For example, the AMPA receptor (AMPAR) auxiliary subunit Shisa9/CKAMP44 and the 5HT2a receptor (5HT2aR) are significantly higher expressed in auditory NPY-positive neurons. These findings guided us to perform pharmacological experiments that revealed a role for 5HT2aRs in auditory NPY-positive neurons. Specifically, although the application of 5HT led to a depolarization of both auditory and CA3 NPY-positive neurons, the 5HT2aR antagonist ketanserin only reversed membrane potential changes in auditory NPY-positive neurons. Our study demonstrates the potential of single-cell transcriptomic studies in guiding directed pharmacological experiments.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is a wave of pronounced depolarization of brain tissue accompanied by substantial shifts in ionic concentrations and cellular swelling. Here, we validate a computational framework for modeling electrical potentials, ionic movement, and cellular swelling in brain tissue during CSD. We consider different model variations representing wild-type (WT) or knock-out/knock-down mice and systematically compare the numerical results with reports from a selection of experimental studies. We find that the data for several CSD hallmarks obtained computationally, including wave propagation speed, direct current shift duration, peak in extracellular K<sup>+</sup> concentration as well as a pronounced shrinkage of extracellular space (ECS) are well in line with what has previously been observed experimentally. Further, we assess how key model parameters including cellular diffusivity, structural ratios, membrane water and/or K<sup>+</sup> permeabilities affect the set of CSD characteristics.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Calcium modeling of spine apparatus-containing human dendritic spines demonstrates an “all-or-nothing” communication switch between the spine head and dendrite</a></h4>

              
                <p>by James Rosado, Viet Duc Bui, Carola A. Haas, Jürgen Beck, Gillian Queisser, Andreas Vlachos</p>

Dendritic spines are highly dynamic neuronal compartments that control the synaptic transmission between neurons. Spines form ultrastructural units, coupling synaptic contact sites to the dendritic shaft and often harbor a spine apparatus organelle, composed of smooth endoplasmic reticulum, which is responsible for calcium sequestration and release into the spine head and neck. The spine apparatus has recently been linked to synaptic plasticity in adult human cortical neurons. While the morphological heterogeneity of spines and their intracellular organization has been extensively demonstrated in animal models, the influence of spine apparatus organelles on critical signaling pathways, such as calcium-mediated dynamics, is less well known in human dendritic spines. In this study we used serial transmission electron microscopy to anatomically reconstruct nine human cortical spines in detail as a basis for modeling and simulation of the calcium dynamics between spine and dendrite. The anatomical study of reconstructed human dendritic spines revealed that the size of the postsynaptic density correlates with spine head volume and that the spine apparatus volume is proportional to the spine volume. Using a newly developed simulation pipeline, we have linked these findings to spine-to-dendrite calcium communication. While the absence of a spine apparatus, or the presence of a purely passive spine apparatus did not enable any of the reconstructed spines to relay a calcium signal to the dendritic shaft, the calcium-induced calcium release from this intracellular organelle allowed for finely tuned “all-or-nothing” spine-to-dendrite calcium coupling; controlled by spine morphology, neck plasticity, and ryanodine receptors. Our results suggest that spine apparatus organelles are strategically positioned in the neck of human dendritic spines and demonstrate their potential relevance to the maintenance and regulation of spine-to-dendrite calcium communication.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Multiple nutrient transporters enable cells to mitigate a rate-affinity tradeoff</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Luis Fernando Montaño-Gutierrez, Kevin Correia, Peter S. Swain</p>

Eukaryotic genomes often encode multiple transporters for the same nutrient. For example, budding yeast has 17 hexose transporters (HXTs), all of which potentially transport glucose. Using mathematical modelling, we show that transporters that use either facilitated diffusion or symport can have a rate-affinity tradeoff, where an increase in the maximal rate of transport decreases the transporter’s apparent affinity. These changes affect the import flux non-monotonically, and for a given concentration of extracellular nutrient there is one transporter, characterised by its affinity, that has a higher import flux than any other. Through encoding multiple transporters, cells can therefore mitigate the tradeoff by expressing those transporters with higher affinities in lower concentrations of nutrients. We verify our predictions using fluorescent tagging of seven HXT genes in budding yeast and follow their expression over time in batch culture. Using the known affinities of the corresponding transporters, we show that their regulation in glucose is broadly consistent with a rate-affinity tradeoff: as glucose falls, the levels of the different transporters peak in an order that mostly follows their affinity for glucose. More generally, evolution is constrained by tradeoffs. Our findings indicate that one such tradeoff often occurs in the cellular transport of nutrients.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Antithetic effect of interferon-α on cell-free and cell-to-cell HIV-1 infection</a></h4>

In HIV-1-infected individuals, transmitted/founder (TF) virus contributes to establish new infection and expands during the acute phase of infection, while chronic control (CC) virus emerges during the chronic phase of infection. TF viruses are more resistant to interferon-alpha (IFN-α)-mediated antiviral effects than CC virus, however, its virological relevance in infected individuals remains unclear. Here we perform an experimental-mathematical investigation and reveal that IFN-α strongly inhibits cell-to-cell infection by CC virus but only weakly affects that by TF virus. Surprisingly, IFN-α enhances cell-free infection of HIV-1, particularly that of CC virus, in a virus-cell density-dependent manner. We further demonstrate that LY6E, an IFN-stimulated gene, can contribute to the density-dependent enhancement of cell-free HIV-1 infection. Altogether, our findings suggest that the major difference between TF and CC viruses can be explained by their resistance to IFN-α-mediated inhibition of cell-to-cell infection and their sensitivity to IFN-α-mediated enhancement of cell-free infection.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Distinguishing excess mutations and increased cell death based on variant allele frequencies</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Gergely Tibély, Dominik Schrempf, Imre Derényi, Gergely J. Szöllősi</p>

Tumors often harbor orders of magnitude more mutations than healthy tissues. The increased number of mutations may be due to an elevated mutation rate or frequent cell death and correspondingly rapid cell turnover, or a combination of the two. It is difficult to disentangle these two mechanisms based on widely available bulk sequencing data, where sequences from individual cells are intermixed and, thus, the cell lineage tree of the tumor cannot be resolved. Here we present a method that can simultaneously estimate the cell turnover rate and the rate of mutations from bulk sequencing data. Our method works by simulating tumor growth and finding the parameters with which the observed data can be reproduced with maximum likelihood. Applying this method to a real tumor sample, we find that both the mutation rate and the frequency of death may be high.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Micro-dissection and integration of long and short reads to create a robust catalog of kidney compartment-specific isoforms</a></h4>

Studying isoform expression at the microscopic level has always been a challenging task. A classical example is kidney, where glomerular and tubulo-interstitial compartments carry out drastically different physiological functions and thus presumably their isoform expression also differs. We aim at developing an experimental and computational pipeline for identifying isoforms at microscopic structure-level. We microdissected glomerular and tubulo-interstitial compartments from healthy human kidney tissues from two cohorts. The two compartments were separately sequenced with the PacBio RS II platform. These transcripts were then validated using transcripts of the same samples by the traditional Illumina RNA-Seq protocol, distinct Illumina RNA-Seq short reads from European Renal cDNA Bank (ERCB) samples, and annotated GENCODE transcript list, thus identifying novel transcripts. We identified 14,739 and 14,259 annotated transcripts, and 17,268 and 13,118 potentially novel transcripts in the glomerular and tubulo-interstitial compartments, respectively. Of note, relying solely on either short or long reads would have resulted in many erroneous identifications. We identified distinct pathways involved in glomerular and tubulo-interstitial compartments at the isoform level, creating an important experimental and computational resource for the kidney research community.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Bioactivity assessment of natural compounds using machine learning models trained on target similarity between drugs</a></h4>

Natural compounds constitute a rich resource of potential small molecule therapeutics. While experimental access to this resource is limited due to its vast diversity and difficulties in systematic purification, computational assessment of structural similarity with known therapeutic molecules offers a scalable approach. Here, we assessed functional similarity between natural compounds and approved drugs by combining multiple chemical similarity metrics and physicochemical properties using a machine-learning approach. We computed pairwise similarities between 1410 drugs for training classification models and used the drugs shared protein targets as class labels. The best performing models were random forest which gave an average area under the ROC of 0.9, Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.35, and F1 score of 0.33, suggesting that it captured the structure-activity relation well. The models were then used to predict protein targets of circa 11k natural compounds by comparing them with the drugs. This revealed therapeutic potential of several natural compounds, including those with support from previously published sources as well as those hitherto unexplored. We experimentally validated one of the predicted pair’s activities, viz., Cox-1 inhibition by 5-methoxysalicylic acid, a molecule commonly found in tea, herbs and spices. In contrast, another natural compound, 4-isopropylbenzoic acid, with the highest similarity score when considering most weighted similarity metric but not picked by our models, did not inhibit Cox-1. Our results demonstrate the utility of a machine-learning approach combining multiple chemical features for uncovering protein binding potential of natural compounds.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Phylogenetic analysis of migration, differentiation, and class switching in B cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kenneth B. Hoehn, Oliver G. Pybus, Steven H. Kleinstein</p>

B cells undergo rapid mutation and selection for antibody binding affinity when producing antibodies capable of neutralizing pathogens. This evolutionary process can be intermixed with migration between tissues, differentiation between cellular subsets, and switching between functional isotypes. B cell receptor (BCR) sequence data has the potential to elucidate important information about these processes. However, there is currently no robust, generalizable framework for making such inferences from BCR sequence data. To address this, we develop three parsimony-based summary statistics to characterize migration, differentiation, and isotype switching along B cell phylogenetic trees. We use simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. We then use this framework to infer patterns of cellular differentiation and isotype switching from high throughput BCR sequence datasets obtained from patients in a study of HIV infection and a study of food allergy. These methods are implemented in the R package <i>dowser</i>, available at https://dowser.readthedocs.io.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Erebosis, a new cell death mechanism during homeostatic turnover of gut enterocytes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hanna M. Ciesielski, Hiroshi Nishida, Tomomi Takano, Aya Fukuhara, Tetsuhisa Otani, Yuko Ikegawa, Morihiro Okada, Takashi Nishimura, Mikio Furuse, Sa Kan Yoo</p>

Many adult tissues are composed of differentiated cells and stem cells, each working in a coordinated manner to maintain tissue homeostasis during physiological cell turnover. Old differentiated cells are believed to typically die by apoptosis. Here, we discovered a previously uncharacterized, new phenomenon, which we name erebosis based on the ancient Greek word erebos (“complete darkness”), in the gut enterocytes of adult <i>Drosophila</i>. Cells that undergo erebosis lose cytoskeleton, cell adhesion, organelles and fluorescent proteins, but accumulate Angiotensin-converting enzyme (Ance). Their nuclei become flat and occasionally difficult to detect. Erebotic cells do not have characteristic features of apoptosis, necrosis, or autophagic cell death. Inhibition of apoptosis prevents neither the gut cell turnover nor erebosis. We hypothesize that erebosis is a cell death mechanism for the enterocyte flux to mediate tissue homeostasis in the gut.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Infantile spasms is associated with a wide variety of clinical conditions, including perinatal brain injuries. We have created a model in which prolonged infusion of tetrodotoxin (TTX) into the neocortex, beginning in infancy, produces a localized lesion and reproduces the behavioral spasms, EEG abnormalities, and drug responsiveness seen clinically. Here, we undertook experiments to explore the possibility that the growth factor IGF-1 plays a role in generating epileptic spasms.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We combined long-term video EEG recordings with quantitative immunohistochemical and biochemical analyses to unravel IGF-1’s role in spasm generation. Immunohistochemistry was undertaken in surgically resected tissue from infantile spasms patients. We used viral injections in neonatal conditional IGF-1R knock-out mice to show that an IGF-1-derived tripeptide, (1-3)IGF-1, acts through the IGF-1 receptor to abolish spasms.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Immunohistochemical methods revealed widespread loss of IGF-1 from cortical neurons, but an increase in IGF-1 in the reactive astrocytes in the TTX-induced lesion. Very similar changes were observed in neocortex from spasm patients. In animals, we observed reduced signaling through the IGF-1 growth pathways in areas remote from the lesion. To show the reduction in IGF-1 expression plays a role in spasm generation, epileptic rats were treated with (1-3)IGF-1. We provide three lines of evidence that (1-3)IGF-1 activates the IGF-1 signaling pathway by acting through the receptor for IGF-1. Treatment with (1-3)IGF-1 abolished spasms and hypsarrhythmia-like activity in the majority of animals.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Results implicate IGF-1 in the pathogenesis of infantile spasms and IGF-1 analogues as potential novel therapies for this neurodevelopmental disorder.</p>

                <p>Ophelia syndrome or encephalitis with antibodies against the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) manifests with behavioral changes, memory deficits, and anxiety. To study the antibody pathogenicity, mice received continuous cerebroventricular infusion of patients' or controls' immunoglobulin G (IgG) for 14 days, followed by a 15-day washout. The effects on hippocampal mGluR5 clusters were determined by confocal microscopy. Animals infused with patients' IgG, but not controls' IgG, showed memory impairment, increased anxiety, and decreased neuronal surface mGluR5 clusters. After antibody clearance, both behavioral and molecular changes reversed to baseline conditions. These findings support the pathogenicity of these antibodies in anti-mGluR5 encephalitis.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">ZSCAN1 autoantibodies are associated with pediatric paraneoplastic ROHHAD</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Rapid-onset Obesity with Hypothalamic Dysfunction, Hypoventilation and Autonomic Dysregulation (ROHHAD), is a severe pediatric disorder of uncertain etiology resulting in hypothalamic dysfunction and frequent sudden death. Frequent co-occurrence of neuroblastic tumors have fueled suspicion of an autoimmune paraneoplastic neurological syndrome (PNS); however, specific anti-neural autoantibodies, a hallmark of PNS, have not been identified. Our objective is to determine if an autoimmune paraneoplastic etiology underlies ROHHAD.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Immunoglobulin G (IgG) from pediatric ROHHAD patients (n = 9), non-inflammatory individuals (n = 100) and relevant pediatric controls (n = 25) was screened using a programmable phage display of the human peptidome (PhIP-Seq). Putative ROHHAD-specific autoantibodies were orthogonally validated using radioactive ligand binding and cell-based assays. Expression of autoantibody targets in ROHHAD tumor and healthy brain tissue was assessed with immunohistochemistry and mass spectrometry, respectively.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Autoantibodies to ZSCAN1 were detected in ROHHAD patients by PhIP-Seq and orthogonally validated in 7/9 ROHHAD patients and 0/125 controls using radioactive ligand binding and cell-based assays. Expression of ZSCAN1 in ROHHAD tumor and healthy human brain tissue was confirmed.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results support the notion that tumor-associated ROHHAD syndrome is a pediatric PNS, potentially initiated by an immune response to peripheral neuroblastic tumor. ZSCAN1 autoantibodies may aid in earlier, accurate diagnosis of ROHHAD syndrome, thus providing a means toward early detection and treatment. This work warrants follow-up studies to test sensitivity and specificity of a novel diagnostic test. Lastly, given the absence of the ZSCAN1 gene in rodents, our study highlights the value of human-based approaches for detecting novel PNS subtypes.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Retinoic acid-induced protein 14 controls dendritic spine dynamics associated with depressive-like behaviors</a></h4>

              
                Dendritic spines are the central postsynaptic machinery that determines synaptic function. The F-actin within dendritic spines regulates their dynamic formation and elimination. Rai14 is an F‑actin-regulating protein with a membrane‑shaping function. Here, we identified the roles of Rai14 for the regulation of dendritic spine dynamics associated with stress-induced depressive-like behaviors. Rai14-deficient neurons exhibit reduced dendritic spine density in the <i>Rai14</i><sup>+/-</sup> mouse brain, resulting in impaired functional synaptic activity. Rai14 was protected from degradation by complex formation with Tara, and accumulated in the dendritic spine neck, thereby enhancing spine maintenance. Concurrently, Rai14 deficiency in mice altered gene expression profile relevant to depressive conditions and increased depressive-like behaviors. Moreover, Rai14 expression was reduced in the prefrontal cortex of the mouse stress model, which was blocked by antidepressant treatment. Thus, we propose that Rai14-dependent regulation of dendritic spines may underlie the plastic changes of neuronal connections relevant to depressive-like behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Distinct representations of body and head motion are dynamically encoded by Purkinje cell populations in the macaque cerebellum</a></h4>

              
                The ability to accurately control our posture and perceive spatial orientation during self-motion requires knowledge of the motion of both the head and body. However, whereas the vestibular sensors and nuclei directly encode head motion, no sensors directly encode body motion. Instead, the integration of vestibular and neck proprioceptive inputs is necessary to transform vestibular information into the body-centric reference frame required for postural control. The anterior vermis of the cerebellum is thought to play a key role in this transformation, yet how its Purkinje cells integrate these inputs or what information they dynamically encode during self-motion remains unknown. Here we recorded the activity of individual anterior vermis Purkinje cells in alert monkeys during passively applied whole-body, body-under-head, and head-on-body rotations. Most neurons dynamically encoded an intermediate representation of self-motion between head and body motion. Notably, these neurons responded to both vestibular and neck proprioceptive stimulation and showed considerable heterogeneity in their response dynamics. Furthermore, their vestibular responses demonstrated tuning in response to changes in head-on-body position. In contrast, a small remaining percentage of neurons sensitive only to vestibular stimulation unambiguously encoded head-in-space motion across conditions. Using a simple population model, we establish that combining responses from ~40-50 Purkinje cells can explain the responses of their target neurons in deep cerebellar nuclei across all self-motion conditions. We propose that the observed heterogeneity in Purkinje cells underlies the cerebellum's capacity to compute the dynamic representation of body motion required to ensure accurate postural control and perceptual stability in our daily lives.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Zebrafish airinemes optimize their shape between ballistic and diffusive search</a></h4>

              
                In addition to diffusive signals, cells in tissue also communicate via long, thin cellular protrusions, such as airinemes in zebrafish. Before establishing communication, cellular protrusions must find their target cell. Here we demonstrate that the shapes of airinemes in zebrafish are consistent with a finite persistent random walk model. The probability of contacting the target cell is maximized for a balance between ballistic search (straight) and diffusive search (highly curved, random). We find that the curvature of airinemes in zebrafish, extracted from live cell microscopy, is approximately the same value as the optimum in the simple persistent random walk model. We also explore the ability of the target cell to infer direction of the airineme's source, finding that there is a theoretical trade-off between search optimality and directional information. This provides a framework to characterize the shape, and performance objectives, of non-canonical cellular protrusions in general.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">OXPHOS deficiencies affect peroxisome proliferation by downregulating genes controlled by the SNF1 signaling pathway</a></h4>

              
                How environmental cues influence peroxisome proliferation, particularly through organelles, remains largely unknown. Yeast peroxisomes metabolize fatty acids (FA), and methylotrophic yeasts also metabolize methanol. NADH and acetyl-CoA, produced by these pathways enter mitochondria for ATP production and for anabolic reactions. During the metabolism of FA and/or methanol, the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathway accepts NADH for ATP production and maintains cellular redox balance. Remarkably, peroxisome proliferation in <i>Pichia pastoris</i> was abolished in NADH shuttling- and OXPHOS mutants affecting complex I or III, or by the mitochondrial uncoupler, 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), indicating ATP depletion causes the phenotype. We show that mitochondrial OXPHOS deficiency inhibits expression of several peroxisomal proteins implicated in FA and methanol metabolism, as well as in peroxisome division and proliferation. These genes are regulated by the Snf1 complex (SNF1), a pathway generally activated by a high AMP/ATP ratio. In OXPHOS mutants, Snf1 is activated by phosphorylation, but Gal83, its interacting subunit, fails to translocate to the nucleus. Phenotypic defects in peroxisome proliferation observed in the OXPHOS mutants, and phenocopied by the D<i>gal83</i> mutant, were rescued by deletion of three transcriptional repressor genes (<i>MIG1</i>, <i>MIG2</i> and <i>NRG1</i>) controlled by SNF1 signaling. Our results are interpreted in terms of a mechanism by which peroxisomal and mitochondrial proteins and/or metabolites influence redox and energy metabolism, while also influencing peroxisome biogenesis and proliferation, thereby exemplifying interorganellar communication and interplay involving peroxisomes, mitochondria, cytosol and the nucleus. We discuss the physiological relevance of this work in the context of human OXPHOS deficiencies.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Natural-gradient learning for spiking neurons</a></h4>

              
                In many normative theories of synaptic plasticity, weight updates implicitly depend on the chosen parametrization of the weights. This problem relates, for example, to neuronal morphology: synapses which are functionally equivalent in terms of their impact on somatic firing can differ substantially in spine size due to their different positions along the dendritic tree. Classical theories based on Euclidean-gradient descent can easily lead to inconsistencies due to such parametrization dependence. The issues are solved in the framework of Riemannian geometry, in which we propose that plasticity instead follows natural-gradient descent. Under this hypothesis, we derive a synaptic learning rule for spiking neurons that couples functional efficiency with the explanation of several well-documented biological phenomena such as dendritic democracy, multiplicative scaling, and heterosynaptic plasticity. We therefore suggest that in its search for functional synaptic plasticity, evolution might have come up with its own version of natural-gradient descent.

                RAS GTPases are highly conserved proteins involved in the regulation of mitogenic signaling. We have previously described a novel Cullin 3 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex formed by the substrate adaptor protein LZTR1 that binds, ubiquitinates, and promotes proteasomal degradation of the RAS GTPase RIT1. In addition, others have described that this complex is also responsible for the ubiquitination of classical RAS GTPases. Here, we have analyzed the phenotypes of <i>Lztr1</i> loss-of-function mutants in both fruit flies and mice and have demonstrated a biochemical preference for their RIT1 orthologs. Moreover, we show that <i>Lztr1</i> is haplosufficient in mice and that embryonic lethality of the homozygous null allele can be rescued by deletion of <i>Rit1</i>. Overall, our results indicate that, in model organisms, RIT1 orthologs are the preferred substrates of LZTR1.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Activation of the EGFR/MAPK pathway drives transdifferentiation of quiescent niche cells to stem cells in the Drosophila testis niche</a></h4>

              
                Adult stem cells are maintained in niches, specialized microenvironments that regulate their self-renewal and differentiation. In the adult <i>Drosophila</i> testis stem cell niche, somatic hub cells produce signals that regulate adjacent germline stem cells (GSCs) and somatic cyst stem cells (CySCs). Hub cells are normally quiescent, but after complete genetic ablation of CySCs, they can proliferate and transdifferentiate into new CySCs. Here we find that Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling is upregulated in hub cells after CySC ablation and that the ability of testes to recover from ablation is inhibited by reduced EGFR signaling. In addition, activation of the EGFR pathway in hub cells is sufficient to induce their proliferation and transdifferentiation into CySCs. We propose that EGFR signaling, which is normally required in adult cyst cells, is actively inhibited in adult hub cells to maintain their fate but is repurposed to drive stem cell regeneration after CySC ablation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Flexible use of memory by food-caching birds</a></h4>

              
                Animals use memory-guided and memory-independent strategies to make navigational decisions. Disentangling the contribution of these strategies to navigation is critical for understanding how memory influences behavioral output. To address this issue, we studied spatial behaviors of the chickadee, a food-caching bird. Chickadees hide food in concealed, scattered locations and retrieve their caches later in time. We designed an apparatus that allows birds to cache and retrieve food at many sites while navigating in a laboratory arena. This apparatus enabled automated tracking of behavioral variables – including caches, retrievals, and investigations of different sites. We built probabilistic models to fit these behavioral data using a combination of mnemonic and non-mnemonic factors. We found that chickadees use some navigational strategies that are independent of cache memories, including opportunistic foraging and spatial biases. They combine these strategies with spatially precise memories of which sites contain caches and which sites they have previously checked. A single memory of site contents is used in a context-dependent manner: during caching chickadees avoid sites that contain food, while during retrieval they instead preferentially access occupied sites. Our approach is a powerful way to investigate navigational decisions in a natural behavior, including flexible contributions of memory to these decisions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The organic cation Transporter 2 regulates dopamine D1 receptor signaling at the Golgi apparatus</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine is a key catecholamine in the brain and the kidney, where it is involved in a number of physiological functions such as locomotion, cognition, emotion, endocrine regulation and renal function. As a membrane impermeant hormone and neurotransmitter, dopamine is thought to signal by binding and activating dopamine receptors, members of the G protein couple receptor (GPCR) family, only on the plasma membrane. Here, using novel nanobody-based biosensors, we demonstrate for the first time that the dopamine D1 receptor (D1DR), the primary mediator of dopaminergic signaling in the brain and kidney, not only functions on the plasma membrane but becomes activated at the Golgi apparatus in the presence of its ligand. We present evidence that activation of the Golgi pool of D1DR is dependent on Organic Cation Transporter 2 (OCT2), a dopamine transporter, providing an explanation for how the membrane impermeant dopamine accesses subcellular pools of D1DR. We further demonstrate that dopamine activates Golgi-D1DR in murine striatal medium spiny neurons (MSN) and this activity depends on OCT2 function.  We also introduce a new approach to selectively interrogate compartmentalized D1DR signaling by inhibiting Gas coupling, using a nanobody-based chemical recruitment system.  Using this strategy, we show that Golgi-localized D1DRs regulate cAMP production and mediate local protein kinase A activation. Together, our data suggest that spatially compartmentalized signaling hubs are previously unappreciated regulatory aspects of D1DR signaling. Our data provide further evidence for the role of transporters in regulating subcellular GPCR activity.

                Rett syndrome is characterized by an early period of typical development and then, regression of learned motor and speech skills in girls. The underlying mechanisms from normalcy to regression are unclear. Due to random X-chromosome inactivation, female patients of Rett syndrome, and female mouse models of Rett syndrome (Mecp2Heterozygous, Het) express a functional copy of wild-type MECP2 protein in half of all mature cells in brain and body. By analyzing wild-type MECP2 expression in the context of whisker tactile sensory perception, here we report compensatory increase in MECP2 protein expression in 6-week-old adolescent Het mice, which display normal levels of perineuronal net expression, mild tactile sensory perception deficit and efficient pup retrieval behavior. Comparatively, 12-week-old adult Het mice display decreased MECP2 expression and significant tactile sensory perception deficits. Thus, we have identified a period of normalcy and regression in this female mouse model, which coincide with variable wild-type expression of MECP2. We speculate that compensatory increases in MECP2 expression in Het brains allows for normal functioning, while the inability to maintain these expression level changes leads to behavioral deficits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Memory loss at sleep onset</a></h4>

              
                Every night, we pass through a transitory zone at the borderland between wakefulness and sleep, named the first stage of non-rapid eye movement sleep (N1). N1 sleep is associated with an increased hippocampal activity and dreamlike experiences that incorporate recent wake materials, suggesting that it may be associated with memory processing. Here, we investigated the specific contribution of N1 sleep in the processing of memory traces. Participants were asked to learn the precise locations of 48 objects on a grid and were then tested on their memory for these items before and after a 30-minute rest during which participants either stayed fully awake, transitioned toward N1 or deeper (N2) sleep. We showed that memory recall was lower (10% forgetting) after a resting period including only N1 sleep compared to N2 sleep. Furthermore, the ratio of alpha/theta power (an EEG marker of the transition towards sleep) correlated negatively with the forgetting rate when taking into account all sleepers (N1 and N2 groups combined), suggesting a physiological index for memory loss that transcends sleep stages. Our findings suggest that interrupting sleep onset at N1 may alter sleep-dependent memory consolidation and promote forgetting.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The association between working memory precision and the nonlinear dynamics of frontal and parieto-occipital EEG activity.</a></h4>

              
                Electrophysiological working memory (WM) research has shown that distinct brain areas communicate through macroscopic oscillatory activities across multiple frequency bands. Such cross-frequency interactions generate nonlinear amplitude modulations (AM) in the observed signal. Traditionally, the AM of a signal is expressed as coupling strength between the signal and a pre-specified modulator at a lower frequency. Therefore, the idea of AM and coupling cannot be separately studied. This EEG study shows that the AM of parieto-occipital alpha/beta power and the coupling between frontal theta phase and parieto-occipital alpha/beta AM provide different information on WM processing. Thirty-three participants completed a color recall task with simultaneous EEG recording. The results showed that individual differences in WM precision are associated with frontal theta power enhancement and parieto-occipital alpha/beta power suppression. Furthermore, the AM of parieto-occipital alpha/beta power predicted WM precision after presenting a target-defining probe array. The phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) between frontal theta phase and parieto-occipital alpha/beta AM increased with WM load during the processing of incoming stimuli, but they did not predict the subsequent recall performance. These results indicate that the frontoparietal PAC reflects the executive control for selecting relevant WM representations, but whether the memorized information can be retrieved depends on the subsequent amplitude variation of parieto-occipital alpha/beta power. In conclusion, individuals with higher working memory precision are associated with enhanced frontal theta power and parieto-occipital alpha/beta power suppression.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Decoding reward-curiosity conflict in decision-making from irrational behaviors</a></h4>

              
                Humans and animals are not always rational. They not only rationally exploit rewards but also explore an environment, even if reward is less expected, owing to their curiosity. However, the mechanism of such curiosity-driven irrational behavior is largely unknown. Here, we developed a novel decision-making model for a two-choice task based on the free energy principle, which is a theory integrating recognition and action selection. The model successfully described irrational behaviors depending on the curiosity level. We then proposed a machine learning method to decode temporal curiosity from behavioral data, which enables us to quantitatively compare estimated curiosity and neural activities. By applying it to rat behavioral data, we found that the irrational choices sticking to one option was reflected to the negative curiosity level. Our decoding approach can be a fundamental tool for identifying the neural basis for reward-curiosity conflicts. Specifically, it could be effective in diagnosing mental disorders.

                Multimodal digital data registered with wearable biosensors has emerged as highly complementary of clinical pencil-and-paper criteria, offering new insights in ways to detect and diagnose various aspects of Parkinson's disease. A pressing question is how to combine both the clinical knowledge of PD and the new technology to create interpretable digital biomarkers easily obtainable with off-the-shelf technology. Several challenges concerning disparity in biophysical units, anatomical differences across participants, sensor positioning, and sampling resolution are addressed in this work, along with identification of optimal parameters to automatically differentiate patients with PD from controls. We combine data from a multitude of biosensors registering signals from the central (EEG) and peripheral (magnetometry, kinematics) nervous systems, inclusive of the autonomic nervous system (EKG), as the participants perform natural tasks requiring different levels of intentional planning and automatic control. We find that magnetometer data during walking, across a variety of amplitude and timing signals provide optimal separation of PD from neurotypical controls. We conclude that considering multimodal signals, while differentiating across levels of intent in natural actions can be revealing of important features of PD that otherwise escape the naked eye. Further we add that clinical criteria combined with such optimal digital parameter spaces offer a far more complete picture of PD than using either one of these pieces of data alone.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The language network reliably 'tracks' naturalistic meaningful non-verbal stimuli</a></h4>

              
                The language network, comprised of brain regions in the left frontal and temporal cortex, responds robustly and reliably during language comprehension but shows little or no response during many non-linguistic cognitive tasks (e.g., Fedorenko & Blank, 2020). However, one domain whose relationship with language remains debated is semantics--our conceptual knowledge of the world. Given that the language network responds strongly to meaningful linguistic stimuli, could some of this response be driven by the presence of rich conceptual representations encoded in linguistic inputs? In this study, we used a naturalistic cognition paradigm to test whether the cognitive and neural resources that are responsible for language processing are also recruited for processing semantically rich non-verbal stimuli. To do so, we measured BOLD responses to a set of [~]5-minute-long video and audio clips that consisted of meaningful event sequences but did not contain any linguistic content. We then used the inter-subject correlation (ISC) approach (Hasson et al., 2004) to examine the extent to which the language network  tracks these stimuli. Across all the regions of the language network, non-verbal meaningful stimuli elicited reliable ISCs. These ISCs were higher than the ISCs elicited by non-verbal stimuli without semantic content (e.g., a music clip), but substantially lower than the ISCs elicited by linguistic stimuli. Our results complement earlier findings from controlled experiments (e.g., Ivanova et al., 2021) in providing further evidence that the language network responds to meaningful content in non-verbal stimuli.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Precise temporal control of GEVI conformations enables the visualization of charge migration in a fluorescent protein resulting in an improved optical response</a></h4>

              
                Electrodynamic pathways through the fluorescent protein domain enable the genetically encoded voltage indicator (GEVI) ArcLight and its derivatives to optically report conformational changes induced by membrane potential transients. These electrical pathways through the fluorescent protein domain of Super Ecliptic pHluorin exhibit remarkable precision as demonstrated by the divergent optical behavior of Gln versus Asn mutations. At position D147 on the external surface of the fluorescent protein domain, Gln exhibits a voltage-dependent behavior like other negatively charged acidic amino acids at that location while the Asn mutant exhibits a response similar to the charged positive amino acids at that position. Replacement of Thr with Gln at the 203 position with the amino acid side chain in close proximity to the internal chromophore does not affect the speed of the voltage-dependent optical signal, but replacement with Asn slows the voltage-dependent optical signal implicating a twisting of the chromophore in response to transient charge interactions on the exterior of the {beta}-can being altered during the voltage-induced conformational change. In addition to polar amino acids affecting these electrodynamic pathways, hydrophobic residues play a noticeable role in the migration of charge from the exterior of the fluorescent protein to the chromophore potentially by shielding/creating inducible dipoles on the surface of the fluorescent protein. Using these novel insights, a new GEVI that gets significantly brighter upon depolarization of the plasma membrane was developed enabling voltage imaging of population signals with low light levels at a frame rate of 5 kHz in acute brain slice as well as the reporting of neuronal activity in vivo.

                Hippocampal neurons in tissue-culture were exposed to the trivalent cation lanthanum for short periods (15 to 30 minutes) and prepared for electron microscopy (EM), to evaluate the stimulatory effects of this cation on synaptic ultrastructure. Not only were characteristic ultrastructural changes of exaggerated synaptic vesicle turnover seen within the presynapses of these cultures - - including synaptic vesicle depletion and proliferation of vesicle-recycling structures - - but the overall architecture of a large proportion of the synapses in the cultures was dramatically altered, due to large postsynaptic  bulges or herniations into the presynapses. Moreover, in most cases these postsynaptic herniations or protrusions produced by lanthanum were seen by EM to distort or break or  perforate the so-called postsynaptic densities (PSDs) that harbor receptors and recognition-molecules essential for synaptic function. These dramatic EM-observations lead us to postulate that such PSD-breakages or  perforations could very possibly create essential substrates or  tags for synaptic growth, simply by creating fragmented free-edges around the PSDs, into which new receptors and recognition-molecules could be recruited more easily, and thus they could represent the physical substrate for the important synaptic-growth process known as "long-term potentiation" (LTP). All of this was created simply in hippocampal tissue-cultures, and simply by pushing synaptic vesicle recycling way beyond its normal limits with the trivalent cation lanthanum; but we argue in this report that such fundamental changes in synaptic architecture - - given that they can occur at all - - could also occur at the extremes of normal neuronal activity, which are presumed to lead to learning and memory.

                An important open question in computational neuroscience is how various spatially tuned neurons, such as place cells, are used to support the learning of reward-seeking behavior of an animal. Existing computational models either lack biological plausibility or fall short of behavioral flexibility when environments change. In this paper, we propose a computational theory that achieves behavioral flexibility with better biological plausibility. We first train a mixture of Gaussian distributions to model the ensemble of firing fields of place cells. Then we propose a Hebbian-like rule to learn the synaptic strength matrix among place cells. This matrix is interpreted as the transition rate matrix of a continuous time Markov chain to generate the sequential replay of place cells. During replay, the synaptic strengths from place cells to medium spiny neurons (MSN) are learned by a temporal-difference like rule to store place-reward associations. After replay, the activation of MSN will ramp up when an animal approaches the rewarding place, so the animal can move along the direction where the MSN activation is increasing to find the rewarding place. We implement our theory into a high-fidelity virtual rat in the MuJoCo physics simulator. In a complex maze, the rat shows significantly better learning efficiency and behavioral flexibility than a rat that implements a neuroscience-inspired reinforcement learning algorithm, deep Q-network.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Altered basal ganglia output during self-restraint</a></h4>

              
                Suppressing actions is essential for flexible behavior. Multiple neural circuits involved in behavioral inhibition converge upon a key basal ganglia output nucleus, the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). To examine how changes in basal ganglia output contribute to self restraint, we recorded SNr neurons during a proactive behavioral inhibition task. Rats responded to Go! cues with rapid leftward or rightward movements, but also prepared to cancel one of these movement directions as a Stop! cue might occur. This action restraint-visible as direction-selective slowing of reaction times-altered both rates and patterns of SNr spiking. Overall firing rate was elevated before the Go! cue, and this effect was driven by a subpopulation of direction-selective SNr neurons. In neural state space, this corresponded to a shift away from the restrained movement. Furthermore, SNr activity showed an increase in spike variability during proactive inhibition, similar to that reported with movement slowing in Parkinson's Disease. Increased spike variability corresponded to variable state-space trajectories, slowing reaction times via reduced preparation to move. These findings open new perspectives on basal ganglia mechanisms for movement preparation and cognitive control, in both healthy states and brain disorders.

                In flying insects, head stabilization is an important reflex which helps to reduce motion blur during fast aerial maneuvers. This reflex is multimodal and requires the integration of visual and antennal mechanosensory feedback, each operating as a negative-feedback control loop. As in any negative-feedback system, the head stabilization system possesses inherent oscillatory dynamics that depends on the rates and latencies of the sensorimotor components constituting the reflex. Consistent with this expectation, we observed small amplitude oscillations in the head motion (or head wobble) of the Oleander hawkmoth Daphnis nerii. We show here that these oscillations emerge from the inherent dynamics of the multimodal reflex that underlies gaze stabilization, and the amplitude of the head wobble is a function of both the visual feedback and antennal mechanosensory feedback from the Johnstons organs. The head wobble is thus an outcome of a multimodal, dynamically-stabilized head positioning reflex.

	<p>The standard of care for isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-wildtype glioblastoma (GBM) is maximal resection followed by chemotherapy and radiation. Studies investigating the resection of GBM have primarily focused on the contrast enhancing portion of the tumor on magnetic resonance imaging. Histopathological studies, however, have demonstrated tumor infiltration within peri-tumoral fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) abnormalities, which is often not resected. The histopathology of FLAIR and local recurrence patterns of GBM have prompted interest in the resection of peri-tumoral FLAIR, or FLAIRectomy. To this point, recent studies have suggested a significant survival benefit associated with safe peri-tumoral FLAIR resection. In this review, we discuss the evidence surrounding the composition of peri-tumoral FLAIR, outcomes associated with FLAIRectomy, future directions of the field, and potential implications for patients.</p>

	<p>Suicide, a deliberate act of self-harm with the intention to die, is an emerging health concern but, unfortunately, the most under-researched subject in Pakistan, especially in Khyber Pukhtunkhwa (KPK). In this study, we aimed to identify risk factors that can be associated with suicidal behavior (SB) and to evaluate the prevailing treatment practices for therapeutic efficacy and drug-related problems (DRPs) in psychotic patients among the local population of KPK. A prospective, multicenter study was conducted for suicidal cases admitted to the study centers by randomized sampling. Socio-demographics and data on suicidal behavior were assessed using the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), socioeconomic condition by Kuppuswamy socioeconomic scale (KSES) and treatment adherence by Morisky Medication-Taking Adherence Scale (MMAS-4). Drug-related problems and the therapeutic efficacy of prevailing treatment practices were assessed at baseline and follow-up after 3 months of treatment provided. Regarding suicidality (N = 128), females reported more ideations (63.1%), while males witnessed more suicidal behavior (66.6%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Suicide attempters were mostly married (55.6%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.002); highly educated (53.9%, p = 0.004); dissatisfied with their life and had a previous history (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.5) of suicide attempt (SA) (20.6%), self-injurious behavior (SIB) (39.7%) and interrupted (IA) or aborted attempts (AA) (22.2%). A greater improvement was observed in patients receiving combination therapy (p = 0.001) than pharmacotherapy (p = 0.006) or psychotherapy (p = 0.183), alone. DRPs were also detected, including drug-selection problems (17.88%), dose-related problems (20.64%), potential drug&amp;amp;ndash;drug interactions (24.31%), adverse drug reactions (11.46%) and other problems like inadequate education and counseling (21.55%). Furthermore, it was also found that psychotic patients with suicidal ideations (SI) were significantly (p = 0.01) more adherent to the treatment as compared to those with suicidal attempts. We concluded that suicide attempters differed significantly from patients with suicidal ideations in psychotic patients and presented with peculiar characteristics regarding socio-demographic factors. A combination of therapies and adherence to the treatment provided better outcomes, and targeted interventions are warranted to address drug-related problems.</p>

	<p>Objective: The treatment efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for negative symptoms amongst patients with schizophrenia remains unclear. In this study, we aim to examine the effects of ECT on negative symptoms in schizophrenia and their association with other clinical outcomes, including cognition and function. Methods: This is a retrospective data analysis of patients with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder treated with ECT at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), Singapore, between January 2016 and December 2019. Clinical outcomes were assessed by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Global Assessment of Function (GAF). Changes in scores were compared with repeated measures analysis of variance. Sequential structural modelling was utilized to examine the pathway relationships between changes in negative symptoms, global functioning, and cognition functioning after ECT. Results: A total of 340 patients were analysed. Hence, 196 (57.6%), 53 (15.5%), and 91 (26.7%) showed improvements, no change, and deterioration in negative symptoms, respectively. ECT-induced improvement of negative symptoms was significantly associated with improvement of global functioning (direct effect correlation coefficient (r): &amp;amp;minus;0.496; se: 0.152; p = 0.001) and cognition function (indirect effect r: &amp;amp;minus;0.077; se: 0.037; p = 0.035). Moreover, having capacity to consent, more severe baseline negative symptoms, lithium prescription, and an indirect effect of voluntary admission status via consent capacity predicted ECT associated negative symptoms improvement. Conclusion: ECT is generally associated with improvements of negative symptoms in people with schizophrenia, which correlate with improvements of overall function. Possible novel clinical predictors of negative symptom improvement have been identified and will require further research and validation.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Homogeneous inhibition is optimal for the phase precession of place cells in the CA1 field</a></h4>

              
                Place cells are hippocampal neurons encoding the position of an animal in space. Studies of place cells are essential to understanding the processing and transmission of information by neural networks of the brain. An important characteristic of place cell spike trains is phase precession. When an animal is running through the place field, the discharges of the place cells shift from the ascending phase of the theta rhythm through the minimum to the descending phase. The role of excitatory inputs to CA1 pyramidal neurons along the Schaffer collaterals and the perforant pathway in phase precession is described, but the role of inputs from local interneurons to CA1 pyramidal cell is poorly understood. We have set the goal the contribution of field CA1 interneurons to the phase precession of place cells using mathematical methods. The CA1 field was chosen because it provides the largest set of experimental data required to build and verify the model. We have solved the optimization problem and found the parameters of the excitatory and inhibitory inputs to the pyramidal neuron of the CA1 field so that the neuron generates a spike train with the effect of phase precession. We have discovered that the uniform inhibition of field CA1 pyramidal neurons best explains the effect of phase precession. Among interneurons, axo-axonal neurons make the greatest contribution to the inhibition of pyramidal cells.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mechanisms and functions of respiration-driven gamma oscillations in the piriform cortex</a></h4>

              
                Gamma oscillations are believed to underlie cognitive processes by shaping the formation of transient neuronal partnerships on a millisecond scale. These oscillations are coupled to the phase of breathing cycles in several brain areas, possibly reflecting local computations driven by sensory inputs sampled at each breath. Here, we investigated the mechanisms and functions of gamma oscillations in the piriform (olfactory) cortex of awake mice to understand their dependence on breathing and how they relate to local spiking activity. Mechanistically, we find that respiration drives gamma oscillations in the piriform cortex, which are inhibitory and result from recurrent connections between local excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations. Moreover, respiration-driven inhibitory gamma oscillations are triggered by the activation of mitral/tufted cells in the olfactory bulb and are abolished during anesthesia. Functionally, we demonstrate that they locally segregate neuronal assemblies through a winner-take-all computation leading to sparse odor coding during each breathing cycle. Our results shed new light on the mechanisms of gamma oscillations, bridging computation, cognition and physiology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Immune activation state modulates retrieval of infant engrams</a></h4>

              
                Infantile amnesia is possibly the most ubiquitous form of memory loss in mammals. Despite its widespread relevance, little is known about the biological conditions for infantile amnesia to occur and its effect on the engram cells that encode a memory. We investigated how memories are stored in the brain throughout development by integrating engram labeling technology with mouse models of infantile amnesia. We discovered a sex-specific phenomenon in which male offspring in maternal immune activation models of autism spectrum disorder do not experience infantile amnesia. We rescued the same apparently forgotten infantile memories in mice by optogenetically reactivating dentate gyrus engram cells that were labeled during complex experiences in infant development. Further, we were able to permanently reinstate lost infantile memories by artificially updating the memory engram, demonstrating that infantile amnesia is a reversible process. Our findings suggest that immune activation during development modulates innate, and reversible, forgetting switches that determine whether infantile amnesia will occur.

	<p>Motor recovery is related to the corticospinal tract (CST) lesion in post-stroke patients. The CST originating from the supplementary motor area (SMA) affects the recovery of impaired motor function. We confirmed the effects of transcranial direct current electrical stimulation (tDCS) over the SMA combined with walk training on CST excitability. This study involved a stroke patient with severe sensorimotor deficits and a retrospective AB design. Walk training was conducted only in phase A. Phase B consisted of anodal tDCS (1.5 mA) combined with walk training. Walking speed, stride time variability (STV; reflecting gait stability), and beta-band intramuscular coherence&amp;amp;mdash;derived from the paired tibialis anterior on the paretic side (reflecting CST excitability)&amp;amp;mdash;were measured. STV quantified the coefficient of variation in stride time using accelerometers. Intramuscular coherence during the early stance phase noticeably increased in phase B compared with phase A. Intramuscular coherence in both the stance and swing phases was reduced at follow-up. Walking speed showed no change, while STV was noticeably decreased in phase B compared with phase A. These results suggest that tDCS over the SMA during walking improves gait stability by enhancing CST excitability in the early stance phase.</p>

	<p>The study is focused on applying ex-Gaussian parameters of eye-tracking and cognitive measures in the classification process of cognitive workload level. A computerised version of the digit symbol substitution test has been developed in order to perform the case study. The dataset applied in the study is a collection of variables related to eye-tracking: saccades, fixations and blinks, as well as test-related variables including response time and correct response number. The application of ex-Gaussian modelling to all collected data was beneficial in the context of detection of dissimilarity in groups. An independent classification approach has been applied in the study. Several classical classification methods have been invoked in the process. The overall classification accuracy reached almost 96%. Furthermore, the interpretable machine learning model based on logistic regression was adapted in order to calculate the ranking of the most valuable features, which allowed us to examine their importance.</p>

	<p>Endurance, which is dependent at least partly upon the activation of the brain cortex, is important for performance in rowing. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has shown benefits for endurance, but its effects on the endurance performance of elite rowing athletes are unknown, and are examined in this study. Eight elite female rowers completed 5 km of rowing on an ergometer following stimulation of the tDCS and sham over motor cortices. Each session lasted 20 min and the current was set at 2.2 mA. Time, 500 m/split, power, time corresponding to 500 m (TC500) and power corresponding to 500 m (PC500) were recorded continuously throughout the tests. No significant differences in time, 500 m/split and power were observed between baseline, tDCS and sham. Compared to the sham, tDCS induced a percentage reduction in TC500 from baseline to 2500 m and 4000 m, and a percentage increase in PC500 from baseline to 500 m, 1000 m, 1500 m, 2000 m, 2500 m, 4000 m, 4500 m and 5000 m. One-session tDCS did not have significant benefits for rowing endurance performance in elite professional rowers, and had only marginally greater efficacy compared to sham. These findings offer knowledge helpful to the design of future studies exploring the effects of tDCS on the endurance performance of elite rowers.</p>

	<p>Cerebral palsy describes a group of permanent disorders of movement, motor function and posture that occur due to non-progressive insults to the developing brain. Most of the information concerning the early diagnosis of cerebral palsy originates from studies conducted in high-income countries. In this scoping review, we aimed to explore the tools used in low- and middle-income countries for the early diagnosis of cerebral palsy. A systematic search was conducted using OVID Medline and PubMed databases. &amp;amp;ldquo;Early diagnosis&amp;amp;rdquo; was defined as diagnosis prior to 12 months of age, and low- and middle-income countries were classified according to the World Bank classification system. We identified nine studies on the early diagnosis of cerebral palsy from low- and middle-income countries. The tools featured (n = number of studies) were: General Movement Assessment (6), neonatal magnetic resonance imaging (3), Hammersmith Neonatal Neurological Examination (2), Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (1) and cranial ultrasound (1). We found a paucity of published literature on the early diagnosis of cerebral palsy from low- and middle-income countries. Further research is needed to determine the tools that are accurate and feasible for use in low-resource settings, particularly since cerebral palsy is more prevalent in these areas.</p>

	<p>There is joint agreement among professionals internationally on the importance of diagnosing autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in the early stages of the emergence of symptoms. Criteria changes for the diagnosis of ASD need updated versions of the scale to make the diagnosis feasible. This study aimed to evaluate the level of overlap between two different versions of the Gilliam Autism Rating Scale (GARS-2 and GARS-3), which have been updated based on changes in DSM-IV and DSM-5 on a Kurdish sample of individuals at risk of having ASD and Intellectual Disability, referred to the Bahoz center in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. A group of 148 cases with ASD and developmental disabilities (DD) was evaluated using the 2nd and 3rd versions of the GARS scale to understand the level of cases that confirm an ASD diagnosis in both scales. Ninety-six individuals (65%) scored about the cut-off score for being diagnosed with ASD based on the GARS-2, and 137 individuals (93%) scored above the cut-off score based on the GARS-3. Moreover, keeping updated and meeting the changing demand of standardization and cultural suitability of the updating scales is a challenge. This challenge is due to the shortage of infrastructure sources and lack of established professionals in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Findings indicated that GARS-3, updated based on the DSM-5, tends to diagnose children with accompanying diagnoses and different levels of symptoms severity of ASD at different age levels. Further studies are needed to help professionals and policymakers in low- and middle-income countries understand the updated versions of the available scales and depend on the older version, which must be considered cautiously.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Cell type-specific mechanisms of information transfer in data-driven biophysical models of hippocampal CA3 principal neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Daniele Linaro, Matthew J. Levy, David L. Hunt</p>

The transformation of synaptic input into action potential output is a fundamental single-cell computation resulting from the complex interaction of distinct cellular morphology and the unique expression profile of ion channels that define the cellular phenotype. Experimental studies aimed at uncovering the mechanisms of the transfer function have led to important insights, yet are limited in scope by technical feasibility, making biophysical simulations an attractive complementary approach to push the boundaries in our understanding of cellular computation. Here we take a data-driven approach by utilizing high-resolution morphological reconstructions and patch-clamp electrophysiology data together with a multi-objective optimization algorithm to build two populations of biophysically detailed models of murine hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons based on the two principal cell types that comprise this region. We evaluated the performance of these models and find that our approach quantitatively matches the cell type-specific firing phenotypes and recapitulate the intrinsic population-level variability in the data. Moreover, we confirm that the conductance values found by the optimization algorithm are consistent with differentially expressed ion channel genes in single-cell transcriptomic data for the two cell types. We then use these models to investigate the cell type-specific biophysical properties involved in the generation of complex-spiking output driven by synaptic input through an information-theoretic treatment of their respective transfer functions. Our simulations identify a host of cell type-specific biophysical mechanisms that define the morpho-functional phenotype to shape the cellular transfer function and place these findings in the context of a role for bursting in CA3 recurrent network synchronization dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Updating age-specific contact structures to match evolving demography in a dynamic mathematical model of tuberculosis vaccination</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Chathika Krishan Weerasuriya, Rebecca Claire Harris, Christopher Finn McQuaid, Gabriela B. Gomez, Richard G. White</p>

We investigated the effects of updating age-specific social contact matrices to match evolving demography on vaccine impact estimates. We used a dynamic transmission model of tuberculosis in India as a case study. We modelled four incremental methods to update contact matrices over time, where each method incorporated its predecessor: fixed contact matrix (M0), preserved contact reciprocity (M1), preserved contact assortativity (M2), and preserved average contacts per individual (M3). We updated the contact matrices of a deterministic compartmental model of tuberculosis transmission, calibrated to epidemiologic data between 2000 and 2019 derived from India. We additionally calibrated the M0, M2, and M3 models to the 2050 TB incidence rate projected by the calibrated M1 model. We stratified age into three groups, children (<15y), adults (≥15y, <65y), and the elderly (≥65y), using World Population Prospects demographic data, between which we applied POLYMOD-derived social contact matrices. We simulated an M72-AS01<sub>E</sub>-like tuberculosis vaccine delivered from 2027 and estimated the per cent TB incidence rate reduction (IRR) in 2050 under each update method. We found that vaccine impact estimates in all age groups remained relatively stable between the M0–M3 models, irrespective of vaccine-targeting by age group. The maximum difference in impact, observed following adult-targeted vaccination, was 7% in the elderly, in whom we observed IRRs of 19% (uncertainty range 13–32), 20% (UR 13–31), 22% (UR 14–37), and 26% (UR 18–38) following M0, M1, M2 and M3 updates, respectively. We found that model-based TB vaccine impact estimates were relatively insensitive to demography-matched contact matrix updates in an India-like demographic and epidemiologic scenario. Current model-based TB vaccine impact estimates may be reasonably robust to the lack of contact matrix updates, but further research is needed to confirm and generalise this finding.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Allostery in the dynamic coactivator domain KIX occurs through minor conformational micro-states</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Amanda L. Peiffer, Julie M. Garlick, Stephen T. Joy, Anna K. Mapp, Charles L. Brooks III</p>

The coactivator KIX of CBP uses two binding surfaces to recognize multiple activators and exhibits allostery in ternary complex formation. Activator•coactivator interactions are central to transcriptional regulation, yet the microscopic origins of allostery in dynamic proteins like KIX are largely unknown. Here, we investigate the molecular recognition and allosteric manifestations involved in two KIX ternary systems c-Myb•KIX•MLL and pKID•KIX•MLL. Exploring the hypothesis that binary complex formation prepays an entropic cost for positive cooperativity, we utilize molecular dynamics simulations, side chain methyl order parameters, and differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) to explore conformational entropy changes in KIX. The protein’s configurational micro-states from structural clustering highlight the utility of protein plasticity in molecular recognition and allostery. We find that apo KIX occupies a wide distribution of lowly-populated configurational states. Each binding partner has its own suite of KIX states that it selects, building a model of molecular recognition fingerprints. Allostery is maximized with MLL pre-binding, which corresponds to the observation of a significant reduction in KIX micro-states observed when MLL binds. With all binding partners, the changes in KIX conformational entropy arise predominantly from changes in the most flexible loop. Likewise, we find that a small molecule and mutations allosterically inhibit/enhance activator binding by tuning loop dynamics, suggesting that loop-targeting chemical probes could be developed to alter KIX•activator interactions. Experimentally capturing KIX stabilization is challenging, particularly because of the disordered nature of particular activators. However, DSF melting curves allow for inference of relative entropic changes that occur across complexes, which we compare to our computed entropy changes using simulation methyl order parameters.
