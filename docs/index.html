                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Hippocampal subfields differentially develop and age, and they vary in vulnerability to neurodegenerative diseases. Innovation in high-resolution imaging has accelerated clinical research on human hippocampal subfields, but substantial differences in segmentation protocols impede comparisons of results across laboratories. The Hippocampal Subfields Group (HSG) is an international organization seeking to address this issue by developing a histologically valid, reliable, and freely available segmentation protocol for high-resolution <i>T</i>
<sub>2</sub>-weighted 3 T MRI (<a target="_blank"
   title="Link to external resource"
   href="http://www.hippocampalsubfields.com">http://www.hippocampalsubfields.com</a>). Here, we report the first portion of the protocol focused on subfields in the hippocampal body; protocols for the head and tail are in development. The body protocol includes definitions of the internal boundaries between subiculum, Cornu Ammonis (CA) 1–3 subfields, and dentate gyrus, in addition to the external boundaries of the hippocampus apart from surrounding white matter and cerebrospinal fluid. The segmentation protocol is based on a novel histological reference dataset labeled by multiple expert neuroanatomists. With broad participation of the research community, we voted on the segmentation protocol via an online survey, which included detailed protocol information, feasibility testing, demonstration videos, example segmentations, and labeled histology. All boundary definitions were rated as having high clarity and reached consensus agreement by Delphi procedure. The harmonized body protocol yielded high inter- and intra-rater reliability. In the present paper we report the procedures to develop and test the protocol, as well as the detailed procedures for manual segmentation using the harmonized protocol. The harmonized protocol will significantly facilitate cross-study comparisons and provide increased insight into the structure and function of hippocampal subfields across the lifespan and in neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03240">Estimating measures of information processing during cognitive tasks using functional magnetic resonance imaging</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2602.03240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cognition is increasingly framed in terms of information processing, yet most fMRI analyses focus on activation or functional connectivity rather than quantifying how information is stored and transferred. To remedy this problem, we propose a framework for estimating measures of information processing: active information storage (AIS), transfer entropy (TE), and net synergy from task-based fMRI. AIS measures information maintained within a region, TE captures directed information flow, and net synergy contrasts higher-order synergistic to redundant interactions. Crucially, to enable this framework we utilised a recently developed approach for calculating information-theoretic measures: the cross mutual information. This approach combines resting-state and task data to address the challenges of limited sample size, non-stationarity and context in task-based fMRI. We applied this framework to the working memory (N-back) task from the Human Connectome Project (470 participants). Results show that AIS increases in fronto-parietal regions with working memory load, TE reveals enhanced directed information flows across control pathways, and net synergy indicates a global shift to redundancy. This work establishes a novel methodology for quantifying information processing in task-based fMRI.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03269">Systematic review of self-supervised foundation models for brain network representation using electroencephalography</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2602.03269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) has recently undergone a paradigm shift. The introduction of transformer architectures and self-supervised pretraining (SSL) has led to the development of EEG foundation models. These models are pretrained on large amounts of unlabeled data and can be adapted to a range of downstream tasks. This systematic review summarizes recent SSL-trained EEG foundation models that learn whole-brain representations from multichannel EEG rather than representations derived from a single channel. We searched PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and arXiv through July 21, 2025. Nineteen preprints and peer-reviewed articles met inclusion criteria. We extracted information regarding pretraining datasets, model architectures, pretraining SSL objectives, and downstream task applications. While pretraining data heavily relied on the Temple University EEG corpus, there was significant heterogeneity in model architecture and training objectives across studies. Transformer architectures were identified as the predominant pretraining architecture with state-space models such as MAMBA and S4 as emerging alternatives. Concerning SSL objectives, masked auto-encoding was most common, and other studies incorporate contrastive learning. Downstream tasks varied widely and implemented diverse fine-tuning strategies, which made direct comparison challenging. Furthermore, most studies used single-task fine-tuning, and a generalizable EEG foundation model remains lacking. In conclusion, the field is advancing rapidly but still limited by limited dataset diversity and the absence of standardized benchmarks. Progress will likely depend on larger and more diverse pretraining datasets, standardized evaluation protocols, and multi-task validation. The development will advance EEG foundation models towards robust and general-purpose relevant to both basic and clinical applications.

                arXiv:2602.02562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The double empathy problem recasts the difficulty of forming empathy bonds in social interactions between autistic and neurotypical individuals as a bidirectional problem, rather than due to a deficit exclusive to the person on the spectrum. However, no explicit mechanism to explain such a phenomenon has been proposed. Here we build a feedback-loop mathematical model that would theoretically induce the empathy degradation observed during communication in neurotypical-autistic pairs solely due to differences in communication preferences between neurotypical and neurodivergent individuals. Numerical simulations of dyadic interactions show the model, whose mechanism is based solely on communication preferences, can illustrate the breakdown of empathic bonding observed clinically. Stability analysis of the model provides a way to predict the overall trajectory of the interaction in the empathy space. Furthermore, we suggest experimental designs to measure several parameters outlined here and discuss the future directions for testing the proposed model.

                arXiv:2602.02920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a reproducible, bias-resistant machine learning framework that integrates domain-informed feature engineering, nested cross-validation, and calibrated decision-threshold optimization for small-sample neuroimaging data. Conventional cross-validation frameworks that reuse the same folds for both model selection and performance estimation yield optimistically biased results, limiting reproducibility and generalization. Demonstrated on a high-dimensional structural MRI dataset of deep brain stimulation cognitive outcomes, the framework achieved a nested-CV balanced accuracy of 0.660\,$\pm$\,0.068 using a compact, interpretable subset selected via importance-guided ranking. By combining interpretability and unbiased evaluation, this work provides a generalizable computational blueprint for reliable machine learning in data-limited biomedical domains.

                arXiv:2602.03172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite decades of work, we still lack a robust, task-general theory of human behavior even in the simplest domains. In this paper we tackle the generality problem head-on, by aiming to develop a unified model for all tasks embedded in a task-space. In particular we consider the space of binary sequence prediction tasks where the observations are generated by the space parameterized by hidden Markov models (HMM). As the space of tasks is large, experimental exploration of the entire space is infeasible. To solve this problem we propose the adversarial construction approach, which helps identify tasks that are most likely to elicit a qualitatively novel behavior. Our results suggest that adversarial construction significantly outperforms random sampling of environments and therefore could be used as a proxy for optimal experimental design in high-dimensional task spaces.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03490">A Minimal Task Reveals Emergent Path Integration and Object-Location Binding in a Predictive Sequence Model</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2602.03490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive cognition requires structured internal models representing objects and their relations. Predictive neural networks are often proposed to form such "world models", yet their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. One hypothesis is that action-conditioned sequential prediction suffices for learning such world models. In this work, we investigate this possibility in a minimal in-silico setting. Sequentially sampling tokens from 2D continuous token scenes, a recurrent neural network is trained to predict the upcoming token from current input and a saccade-like displacement. On novel scenes, prediction accuracy improves across the sequence, indicating in-context learning. Decoding analyses reveal path integration and dynamic binding of token identity to position. Interventional analyses show that new bindings can be learned late in sequence and that out-of-distribution bindings can be learned. Together, these results demonstrate how structured representations that rely on flexible binding emerge to support prediction, offering a mechanistic account of sequential world modeling relevant to cognitive science.

                arXiv:2508.15784v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Drawing parallels between Deep Artificial Neural Networks (DNNs) and biological systems can aid in understanding complex biological mechanisms that are difficult to disentangle. Temporal processing, an extensively researched topic, is one such example that lacks a coherent understanding of its underlying mechanisms. In this study, we investigate temporal processing in a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent performing an interval timing task and explore potential biological counterparts to its emergent behavior. The agent was successfully trained to perform a duration production task, which involved marking successive occurrences of a target interval while viewing a video sequence. Analysis of the agent's internal states revealed oscillatory neural activations, a ubiquitous pattern in biological systems. Interestingly, the agent's actions were predominantly influenced by neurons exhibiting these oscillations with high amplitudes and frequencies corresponding to the target interval. Parallels are drawn between the agent's time-keeping strategy and the Striatal Beat Frequency (SBF) model, a biologically plausible model of interval timing. Furthermore, the agent maintained its oscillatory representations and task performance when tested on different video sequences (including a blank video). Thus, once learned, the agent internalized its time-keeping mechanism and showed minimal reliance on its environment to perform the timing task. A hypothesis about the resemblance between this emergent behavior and certain aspects of the evolution of biological processes like circadian rhythms, has been discussed. This study aims to contribute to recent research efforts of utilizing DNNs to understand biological systems, with a particular emphasis on temporal processing.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12387">Neural Thermodynamics: Entropic Forces in Deep and Universal Representation Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.12387v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid discovery of emergent phenomena in deep learning and large language models, understanding their cause has become an urgent need. Here, we propose a rigorous entropic-force theory for understanding the learning dynamics of neural networks trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants. Building on the theory of parameter symmetries and an entropic loss landscape, we show that representation learning is crucially governed by emergent entropic forces arising from stochasticity and discrete-time updates. These forces systematically break continuous parameter symmetries and preserve discrete ones, leading to a series of gradient balance phenomena that resemble the equipartition property of thermal systems. These phenomena, in turn, (a) explain the universal alignment of neural representations between AI models and lead to a proof of the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, and (b) reconcile the seemingly contradictory observations of sharpness- and flatness-seeking behavior of deep learning optimization. Our theory and experiments demonstrate that a combination of entropic forces and symmetry breaking is key to understanding emergent phenomena in deep learning.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04289">Relational reasoning and inductive bias in transformers and large language models</a></h4>

Abstract: Transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities, but the mechanisms underlying relational reasoning remain poorly understood. We investigate how transformers perform \textit{transitive inference}, a classic relational reasoning task which requires inference indirectly related items (e.g., if $A>B$ and $B>C$, then $A>C$), comparing in-weights learning (IWL) and in-context learning (ICL) strategies. We find that IWL naturally induces a generalization bias towards transitive inference despite training only on adjacent items, whereas ICL models develop induction circuits implementing match-and-copy strategies that fail to encode hierarchical relationships. However, when pre-trained on in-context linear regression tasks, transformers successfully exhibit in-context generalizable transitive inference, displaying both \textit{symbolic distance} and \textit{terminal item effects} characteristic of human and animal performance, without forming induction circuits. We extend these findings to large language models, demonstrating that prompting with linear geometric scaffolds improves transitive inference, while circular geometries (which violate transitivity by allowing wraparound) impair performance, particularly when models cannot rely on stored knowledge. Together, these results reveal that both the training regime and the geometric structure of induced representations critically determine transformers' capacity for transitive inference.

                arXiv:2506.04536v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterizing the cellular properties of neurons is fundamental to understanding their function in the brain. In this quest, the generation of bio-realistic models is central towards integrating multimodal cellular data sets and establishing causal relationships. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. The deterministic formalism of bio-realistic models currently precludes accounting for the natural variability observed experimentally. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on synthetic data generated from bio-realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE enables the efficient generation of synthetic neurons that closely resemble experimental data and exhibit trial-to-trial variability, offering a $4200\times$ speedup over the numerical solver. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework that validates its generalization with real experimental data. To this end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties in a unique and emergent manner that opens the door to a better understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.

Abstract: Metacognition is a critical component of intelligence, specifically regarding the awareness of one's own knowledge. While humans rely on shared internal memory for both answering questions and reporting their knowledge state, this dependency in LLMs remains underexplored. This study proposes a framework to measure metacognitive ability $d_{\rm{type2}}'$ using a dual-prompt method, followed by the introduction of Evolution Strategy for Metacognitive Alignment (ESMA) to bind a model's internal knowledge to its explicit behaviors. ESMA demonstrates robust generalization across diverse untrained settings, indicating a enhancement in the model's ability to reference its own knowledge. Furthermore, parameter analysis attributes these improvements to a sparse set of significant modifications.

                arXiv:2602.03766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human vision is foveated, with variable resolution peaking at the center of a large field of view; this reflects an efficient trade-off for active sensing, allowing eye-movements to bring different parts of the world into focus with other parts of the world in context. In contrast, most computer vision systems encode the visual world at a uniform resolution, raising challenges for processing full-field high-resolution images efficiently. We propose a foveated vision interface (FOVI) based on the human retina and primary visual cortex, that reformats a variable-resolution retina-like sensor array into a uniformly dense, V1-like sensor manifold. Receptive fields are defined as k-nearest-neighborhoods (kNNs) on the sensor manifold, enabling kNN-convolution via a novel kernel mapping technique. We demonstrate two use cases: (1) an end-to-end kNN-convolutional architecture, and (2) a foveated adaptation of the foundational DINOv3 ViT model, leveraging low-rank adaptation (LoRA). These models provide competitive performance at a fraction of the computational cost of non-foveated baselines, opening pathways for efficient and scalable active sensing for high-resolution egocentric vision. Code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/nblauch/fovi and https://huggingface.co/fovi-pytorch.

                arXiv:2602.02724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of black-box optimization algorithms depends on the availability of benchmark suites that are both diverse and representative of real-world problem landscapes. Widely used collections such as BBOB and CEC remain dominated by hand-crafted synthetic functions and provide limited coverage of the high-dimensional space of Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA) features, which in turn biases evaluation and hinders training of meta-black-box optimizers. We introduce Evolution of Test Functions (EoTF), a framework that automatically generates continuous optimization test functions whose landscapes match a specified target ELA feature vector. EoTF adapts LLM-driven evolutionary search, originally proposed for heuristic discovery, to evolve interpretable, self-contained numpy implementations of objective functions by minimizing the distance between sampled ELA features of generated candidates and a target profile. In experiments on 24 noiseless BBOB functions and a contamination-mitigating suite of 24 MA-BBOB hybrid functions, EoTF reliably produces non-trivial functions with closely matching ELA characteristics and preserves optimizer performance rankings under fixed evaluation budgets, supporting their validity as surrogate benchmarks. While a baseline neural-network-based generator achieves higher accuracy in 2D, EoTF substantially outperforms it in 3D and exhibits stable solution quality as dimensionality increases, highlighting favorable scalability. Overall, EoTF offers a practical route to scalable, portable, and interpretable benchmark generation targeted to desired landscape properties.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03840">Investigating Quantum Circuit Designs Using Neuro-Evolution</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2602.03840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing effective quantum circuits remains a central challenge in quantum computing, as circuit structure strongly influences expressivity, trainability, and hardware feasibility. Current approaches, whether using manually designed circuit templates, fixed heuristics, or automated rules, face limitations in scalability, flexibility, and adaptability, often producing circuits that are poorly matched to the specific problem or quantum hardware. In this work, we propose the Evolutionary eXploration of Augmenting Quantum Circuits (EXAQC), an evolutionary approach to the automated design and training of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) which leverages and extends on strategies from neuroevolution and genetic programming. The proposed method jointly searches over gate types, qubit connectivity, parameterization, and circuit depth while respecting hardware and noise constraints. The method supports both Qiskit and Pennylane libraries, allowing the user to configure every aspect. This work highlights evolutionary search as a critical tool for advancing quantum machine learning and variational quantum algorithms, providing a principled pathway toward scalable, problem-aware, and hardware-efficient quantum circuit design. Preliminary results demonstrate that circuits evolved on classification tasks are able to achieve over 90% accuracy on most of the benchmark datasets with a limited computational budget, and are able to emulate target circuit quantum states with high fidelity scores.

                arXiv:2602.02925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting rare and diverse anomalies in highly imbalanced datasets-such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) in cybersecurity-remains a fundamental challenge for machine learning systems. Active learning offers a promising direction by strategically querying an oracle to minimize labeling effort, yet conventional approaches often fail to exploit the intrinsic geometric structure of the feature space for model refinement. In this paper, we introduce SDA2E, a Sparse Dual Adversarial Attention-based AutoEncoder designed to learn compact and discriminative latent representations from imbalanced, high-dimensional data. We further propose a similarity-guided active learning framework that integrates three novel strategies to refine decision boundaries efficiently: mormal-like expansion, which enriches the training set with points similar to labeled normals to improve reconstruction fidelity; anomaly-like prioritization, which boosts ranking accuracy by focusing on points resembling known anomalies; and a hybrid strategy that combines both for balanced model refinement and ranking. A key component of our framework is a new similarity measure, Normalized Matching 1s (SIM_NM1), tailored for sparse binary embeddings. We evaluate SDA2E extensively across 52 imbalanced datasets, including multiple DARPA Transparent Computing scenarios, and benchmark it against 15 state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods. Results demonstrate that SDA2E consistently achieves superior ranking performance (nDCG up to 1.0 in several cases) while reducing the required labeled data by up to 80% compared to passive training. Statistical tests confirm the significance of these improvements. Our work establishes a robust, efficient, and statistically validated framework for anomaly detection that is particularly suited to cybersecurity applications such as APT detection.

                arXiv:2602.02929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are sophisticated, long-term cyberattacks that are difficult to detect because they operate stealthily and often blend into normal system behavior. This paper presents a neuro-symbolic anomaly detection framework that combines a Graph Autoencoder (GAE) with rare pattern mining to identify APT-like activities in system-level provenance data. Our approach first constructs a process behavioral graph using k-Nearest Neighbors based on feature similarity, then learns normal relational structure using a Graph Autoencoder. Anomaly candidates are identified through deviations between observed and reconstructed graph structure. To further improve detection, we integrate an rare pattern mining module that discovers infrequent behavioral co-occurrences and uses them to boost anomaly scores for processes exhibiting rare signatures. We evaluate the proposed method on the DARPA Transparent Computing datasets and show that rare-pattern boosting yields substantial gains in anomaly ranking quality over the baseline GAE. Compared with existing unsupervised approaches on the same benchmark, our single unified model consistently outperforms individual context-based detectors and achieves performance competitive with ensemble aggregation methods that require multiple separate detectors. These results highlight the value of coupling graph-based representation learning with classical pattern mining to improve both effectiveness and interpretability in provenance-based security anomaly detection.

                arXiv:2602.03132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language Model (LLM)-assisted algorithm discovery is an iterative, black-box optimization process over programs to approximatively solve a target task, where an LLM proposes candidate programs and an external evaluator provides task feedback. Despite intense recent research on the topic and promising results, how can the LLM internal representation of the space of possible programs be maximally exploited to improve performance is an open question. Here, we introduce Contrastive Concept-Tree Search (CCTS), which extracts a hierarchical concept representation from the generated programs and learns a contrastive concept model that guides parent selection. By reweighting parents using a likelihood-ratio score between high- and low-performing solutions, CCTS biases search toward useful concept combinations and away from misleading ones, providing guidance through an explicit concept hierarchy rather than the algorithm lineage constructed by the LLM. We show that CCTS improves search efficiency over fitness-based baselines and produces interpretable, task-specific concept trees across a benchmark of open Erd\H{o}s-type combinatorics problems. Our analysis indicates that the gains are driven largely by learning which concepts to avoid. We further validate these findings in a controlled synthetic algorithm-discovery environment, which reproduces qualitatively the search dynamics observed with the LLMs.

                arXiv:2602.03670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a physics-inspired learning algorithm that uses stationary states of a dynamical system both for inference and learning. In its original formulation it is limited to conservative systems, $\textit{i.e.}$ to dynamics which derive from an energy function. Given their importance in applications, it is important to extend EP to nonconservative systems, $\textit{i.e.}$ systems with non-reciprocal interactions. Previous attempts to generalize EP to such systems failed to compute the exact gradient of the cost function. Here we propose a framework that extends EP to arbitrary nonconservative systems, including feedforward networks. We keep the key property of equilibrium propagation, namely the use of stationary states both for inference and learning. However, we modify the dynamics in the learning phase by a term proportional to the non-reciprocal part of the interaction so as to obtain the exact gradient of the cost function. This algorithm can also be derived using a variational formulation that generates the learning dynamics through an energy function defined over an augmented state space. Numerical experiments using the MNIST database show that this algorithm achieves better performance and learns faster than previous proposals.

                arXiv:2508.19548v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Routing, switching, and the interconnect fabric are essential components in implementing large-scale neuromorphic computing architectures. While this fabric plays only a supporting role in the process of computing, for large AI workloads, this fabric ultimately determines the overall system's performance, such as energy consumption and speed. In this paper, we offer a potential solution to address this bottleneck by addressing two fundamental questions: (a) What computing paradigms are inherent in existing routing, switching, and interconnect systems, and how can they be used to implement a Processing-in-Interconnect ($\pi^2$) computing paradigm? and (b) How to train $\pi^2$ network on standard AI benchmarks? To address the first question, we demonstrate that all operations required for typical AI workloads can be mapped onto delays, causality, time-outs, packet drops, and broadcast operations, all of which are already implemented in current packet-switching and packet-routing hardware. {We then show that existing buffering and traffic-shaping embedded algorithms can be minimally modified to implement $\pi^2$ neuron models and synaptic operations. To address the second question, we show how a knowledge distillation framework can be used to train and cross-map well-established neural network topologies onto $\pi^2$ architectures without any degradation in the generalization performance. Our analysis show that the effective energy utilization of a $\pi^2$ network is significantly higher than that of other neuromorphic computing platforms; as a result, we believe that the $\pi^2$ paradigm offers a more scalable architectural path toward achieving brain-scale AI inference.

Abstract: The introduction of large language models has significantly expanded global demand for computing; addressing this growing demand requires novel approaches that introduce new capabilities while addressing extant needs. Although inspiration from biological systems served as the foundation on which modern artificial intelligence (AI) was developed, many modern advances have been made without clear parallels to biological computing. As a result, the ability of techniques inspired by ``natural intelligence'' (NI) to inflect modern AI systems may be questioned. However, by analyzing remaining disparities between AI and NI, we argue that further biological inspiration can contribute towards expanding the capabilities of artificial systems, enabling them to succeed in real-world environments and adapt to niche applications. To elucidate which NI mechanisms can contribute toward this goal, we review and compare elements of biological and artificial computing systems, emphasizing areas of NI that have not yet been effectively captured by AI. We then suggest areas of opportunity for NI-inspired mechanisms that can inflect AI hardware and software.

Abstract: This survey paper presents a comprehensive examination of Spiking Neural Network (SNN) architecture search (SNNaS) from a unique hardware/software co-design perspective. SNNs, inspired by biological neurons, have emerged as a promising approach to neuromorphic computing. They offer significant advantages in terms of power efficiency and real-time resource-constrained processing, making them ideal for edge computing and IoT applications. However, designing optimal SNN architectures poses significant challenges, due to their inherent complexity (e.g., with respect to training) and the interplay between hardware constraints and SNN models. We begin by providing an overview of SNNs, emphasizing their operational principles and key distinctions from traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs). We then provide a brief overview of the state of the art in NAS for ANNs, highlighting the challenges of directly applying these approaches to SNNs. We then survey the state of the art in SNN-specific NAS approaches. Finally, we conclude with insights into future research directions for SNN research, emphasizing the potential of hardware/software co-design in unlocking the full capabilities of SNNs. This survey aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field, offering a holistic view of SNNaS and underscoring the importance of a co-design approach to harness the true potential of neuromorphic computing.

                arXiv:2602.02236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deploying pretrained policies in real-world applications presents substantial challenges that fundamentally limit the practical applicability of learning-based control systems. When autonomous systems encounter environmental changes in system dynamics, sensor drift, or task objectives, fixed policies rapidly degrade in performance. We show that employing Real-Time Recurrent Reinforcement Learning (RTRRL), a biologically plausible algorithm for online adaptation, can effectively fine-tune a pretrained policy to improve autonomous agents' performance on driving tasks. We further show that RTRRL synergizes with a recent biologically inspired recurrent network model, the Liquid-Resistance Liquid-Capacitance RNN. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this closed-loop approach in a simulated CarRacing environment and in a real-world line-following task with a RoboRacer car equipped with an event camera.

                Background This study explores how sensory experiences within hospital environments influence the emotional responses of pediatric cancer patients, particularly those undergoing palliative chemotherapy. Pediatric journeys through healthcare spaces are not solely defined by clinical interactions but are shaped by continuous sensory exposure. This research aims to examine how visual, auditory, tactile, and olfactory inputs during hospital stays affect emotional regulation, stress, and readiness for treatment among children. Methods A qualitative, exploratory design was used, applying an interpretive approach to capture nuanced emotional experiences. Data collection involved semi-structured interviews with pediatric patients and caregivers, direct environmental observation, and multisensory journey mapping. Emotional responses were coded and interpreted using thematic analysis, supported by the Pleasure-Arousal-Dominance (PAD) emotional framework to identify patterns of engagement and disengagement across different sensory touchpoints. Result Findings show that children exposed to coherent multisensory environments—those with soft lighting, comforting textures, and calming sounds—demonstrated reduced anxiety and enhanced emotional coping. In contrast, fragmented environments with clinical noises, sterile visuals, and abrupt transitions intensified emotional distress, confusion, and behavioral withdrawal. Key friction points were not associated with medical procedures alone but often emerged from sensory overload or absence of meaningful sensory stimuli during waiting or transitional phases. Conclusion Hospital environments in pediatric oncology settings significantly contribute to the emotional quality of care. Sensory design that integrates adaptable, trauma-informed, and child-centered features can reduce stress and foster emotional resilience. This study suggests the need for multisensory design frameworks that move beyond aesthetics to support children’s agency and well-being throughout their treatment journey.

                Background Chronic migraine is frequently refractory to available preventive therapies. Image-guided cryoneurolysis of the greater occipital nerve (CryoGON) may provide longer-lasting relief than conventional greater occipital nerve (GON) blocks. This Stage 1 Registered Report describes a prospective, exploratory study evaluating whether response to a conventional GON block predicts subsequent response to CryoGON, and assesses open-label safety, tolerability, feasibility and efficacy of CryoGON. Methods The study is planned as a single-site, investigator-initiated, open-label clinical investigation. Adults with chronic migraine will complete a ≥28-day electronic baseline diary before receiving bilateral conventional GON blocks, followed by a ≥28-day observation. Eligible participants then undergo navigation-guided CryoGON with 12-week follow-up. The primary endpoint is the association between change in moderate-to-severe headache days after GON block (weeks 1–4) and after CryoGON (weeks 9–12). Key secondary endpoints estimate the diagnostic performance of GON-block response applying a ≥30% reduction threshold for treatment effect to identify CryoGON responders, including sensitivity, specificity and predictive values. Additional endpoints include change in migraine days, patient-reported global impression of change, Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire v2.1, procedure tolerability, technical success, and safety (treatment-emergent adverse events and adverse device effects). Women of childbearing potential, including pregnant and breastfeeding participants, are eligible for participation. Discussion This study will provide the first systematic evaluation of whether a simple, widely available GON block can guide patient selection for CryoGON and will generate foundational open-label data on its clinical performance and safety. Findings will inform the design and justification of a subsequent sham-controlled trial. Trial registration and approvals The study will preregister at ClinicalTrials.gov. and obtain all necessary ethical approvals before study initiation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-186/v1?src=rss">Transmedia Storytelling Research Trends: A Bibliometric Analysis (2020–2025) [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Transmedia storytelling has emerged as an essential strategy for connecting content across multiple formats, languages, and platforms, particularly in educational, cultural, and social domains. Despite growing interest, there is still a lack of comprehensive bibliometric syntheses that map global research trends and the intellectual structure of the field. Methods A descriptive and retrospective bibliometric study was conducted using the Scopus database to identify scientific production on transmedia storytelling between 2020 and 2025. The study followed the PRISMA methodology under a mixed post-positivist and constructivist approach and applied the ARA framework (Authors, Journals, Contributions) as the main analytical model. Thirty Scopus-indexed journal articles were selected after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria. VOSviewer (2025) was used to generate co-occurrence maps and identify conceptual clusters. Results The analysis revealed a predominance of qualitative studies, with strong contributions from Spain, Brazil, Ecuador, Colombia, and Portugal. Spanish and Brazilian authors accounted for more than 60% of the output, confirming an Ibero-American dominance. Thematic analysis identified five major domains: education, cultural heritage, social activism, media innovation, and psychosocial health. Ten main conceptual categories were detected, including transmedia storytelling, adaptation, transmediality, interactive narrative, convergence, higher education, and media convergence. Articles were mainly published in Q1–Q2 Scopus journals in communication, digital education, and cultural studies. Conclusions Although still a relatively young field, transmedia storytelling research shows clear interdisciplinary expansion and diversification. The findings highlight the growing academic and social relevance of transmedia storytelling as a driver of social transformation, meaningful learning, and critical participation. Future studies should deepen methodological diversification, promote international collaboration, and strengthen the empirical assessment of social impact, particularly in underrepresented regions of the Global South.

">ASCL1 and OLIG2 Expression Dynamics Control Glial Cell Fate and Regional Diversity in the Dorsal Forebrain</a></h4>

              
                Gliogenesis is a multistep process that begins with the specification of glial progenitors (GPs) into migrating and proliferating precursor cells, which later differentiate into mature astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. How these developmental processes are coordinated to generate the diverse glial lineages in gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) in the brain remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor ASCL1 serves as a direct mechanistic link between glial cell fate specification, migration, proliferation, and differentiation in the dorsal forebrain. Notably, ASCL1 is dynamically expressed in GPs, initiating in the ventricular zone (VZ), peaking in the intermediate zone (IZ), but is downregulated once GPs enter the cortical plate. Lineage tracing of ASCL1+ GPs demonstrates that they subsequently co-express OLIG2 to generate both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in an outside-in pattern starting from the upper cortex inward to the corpus callosum, the opposite pattern of neurogenesis. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments further reveal that a sustained ASCL1 expression is essential for inducing sufficient levels of OLIG2 required to specify oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) fate. Interestingly, a persistent ASCL1 expression also maintains OPCs into postnatal stages by promoting their self-renewal while suppressing their differentiation into postmitotic oligodendrocytes. Together, these findings establish ASCL1 as a key regulator of the spatiotemporal order of glial lineage diversity in cortical GM and callosal WM and implicate ASCL1 dysregulation as an underlying mechanism in the pathogenesis of gliomas.

                <p>Nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep is characterized by the interaction of multiple oscillations essential for memory consolidation, alongside a dynamic arrhythmic 1/<I>f</I> scale-free background that may also contribute to its functions. Recent spectral parametrization methods, such as fitting oscillation and one-and-over-F and irregular resampling auto-spectral analysis, enable the dissociation of rhythmic and arrhythmic components in the spectral domain; however, they do not resolve these processes in the time domain. Instantaneous measures of frequency, amplitude, and phase&ndash;amplitude coupling (PAC) are thus still confounded by fluctuations in arrhythmic activity. This limitation represents a pitfall for studies of NREM sleep relying on instantaneous estimates to investigate oscillatory coupling. To address this limitation, we introduce "Rhythms and Background" (RnB), a novel wavelet-based methodology designed to dynamically denoise time series data of arrhythmic interference. This enables the extraction of purely rhythmic time series, suitable for enhanced time-domain analyses of sleep rhythms. We first validate RnB through simulations, demonstrating it accurately estimates the spectral profiles of individual and multiple oscillations across a range of arrhythmic conditions. We then apply RnB to publicly available intracranial electroencephalogram sleep recordings, showing that it provides an improved spectral and time-domain representation of hallmark NREM rhythms. Finally, we demonstrate that RnB significantly enhances the assessment of PAC between cardinal NREM oscillations, outperforming traditional methods that conflate rhythmic and arrhythmic components. This methodological advance offers a substantial improvement in the analysis of sleep oscillations, providing greater precision in the study of rhythmic activity critical to NREM sleep functions.</p>

                <p>Spastin is a conserved microtubule-severing enzyme mutated in hereditary spastic paraplegia. The role that spastin plays in the cell biology of axon regeneration and degeneration has recently been investigated in <I>Drosophila</I>. We show that the <I>C. elegans</I> spastin ortholog, <I>spas-1</I>, is expressed in GABA motor neurons, in addition to the known expression in touch receptor neurons (TRNs) and that it is required for axon regeneration in the GABA motor neurons after in vivo laser axotomy. We identified no neuronal developmental defects in the GABA motor neurons and only minor branching variations in the TRNs. However, we show that <I>spas-1</I> is required for the long-term maintenance of TRN axons in <I>C. elegans</I>, as older <I>spas-1</I> null <I>C. elegans</I> show a significant increase in specific axonal morphological defects compared with the wild type as identified by confocal microscopy in aged animals. Together, our results suggest that spastin is required for regrowth and maintenance of axons in <I>C. elegans</I>, consistent with previous reports in <I>Drosophila</I>.</p>

                <p>There are a wide variety of commercially available antibodies for labeling microglial cells based on different protein targets, as well as antibodies for the same protein target made in different species. While this array of targets and hosts allows for flexibility in immunohistochemical experiments, it is important to validate that different antibodies provide comparable and accurate immunodetection prior to experimental data collection. We found that a commercially available anti-Iba1 antibody, made in goat, produces irregular staining patterns in specific regions of the mouse brain in both sexes, prompting a further investigation into the phenomenon. This Iba1-goat antibody displayed increased numbers of labeled cells when compared with expression of a CX3CR1-GFP reporter and IHC detection of P2RY12, two common microglial markers. Furthermore, immunodetection by other common anti-Iba1 antibodies made in rabbit and chicken did not display the excessive cell labeling when compared with the CX3CR1-GFP reporter. Upon further investigation, this Iba1-goat antibody was observed to highly colocalize with vasopressin neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) and the supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus (SON), the two main sites of vasopressin production in the brain. Other anti-Iba1 antibodies made in other species did not show this same colocalization with vasopressin. Finally, this effect was species-specific, as Wistar rats did not display erroneous cell labeling by the Iba1-goat antibody. In sum, the present study employs both qualitative and quantitative data to highlight the importance of validating antibody efficacy and specificity in a region- and species-specific manner.</p>

Cell migration <i>in vivo</i> is often guided by chemical signaling, i.e., chemotaxis. For immune cells performing chemotaxis in the organism, this process is influenced by the complex geometry of the tissue environment. In this study, we use a theoretical model of branched cell migration on a network to explore the cellular response to chemical gradients. The model predicts the response of a branched cell to a chemical gradient: how the cell reorients its internal polarity and how it navigates through a complex environment up a chemical gradient. We then compare the model’s predictions with experimental observations of neutrophils migrating to the site of a laser-inflicted wound in a zebrafish larva fin, and neutrophils migrating <i>in vitro</i> inside a regular lattice of pillars. We find that the model captures the details of the subcellular response to the chemokine gradient, as well as qualitative characteristics of the large-scale migration, suggesting that the neutrophils behave as fast cells, which explains the functionality of these immune cells.

                <p>by Yin Guo, Izaskun Mallona, Mark D. Robinson, Limin Li</p>

The integration of single-cell multi-omics data provides a powerful approach for understanding the complex interplay between different molecular modalities, such as RNA expression, chromatin accessibility and protein abundance, measured through assays like scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq and CITE-seq, at single-cell resolution. However, most existing single-cell technologies focus on individual modalities, limiting a comprehensive understanding of their interconnections. Integrating such diverse and often unpaired datasets remains a challenging task due to unknown cell correspondences across distinct feature spaces and limited insights into cell-type-specific activities in non-scRNA-seq modalities. In this work, we propose BiCLUM, a Bilateral Contrastive Learning approach for Unpaired single-cell Multi-omics integration, which simultaneously enforces cell-level and feature-level alignment across modalities. BiCLUM first transforms one modality, such as scATAC-seq, into the data space of another modality, such as scRNA-seq, using prior genomic knowledge. It then learns cell and gene embeddings simultaneously through a bilateral contrastive learning framework, incorporating both cell-level and feature-level contrastive losses. Across multiple RNA+ATAC and RNA+protein datasets, BiCLUM consistently outperforms or matches existing integration methods in both visualization and quantitative benchmarks. Importantly, BiCLUM embeddings preserve biologically meaningful regulatory relationships between chromatin accessibility and gene expression, as evidenced by significantly higher gene–peak correlations than random controls. Downstream analyses further demonstrate that BiCLUM-derived embeddings facilitate transcription factor activity inference, identification of cell-type-specific marker genes, functional enrichment, and cell–cell interaction mapping. Comprehensive hyperparameter sensitivity and ablation analyses further establish BiCLUM as a robust and interpretable framework that not only achieves effective cross-modal alignment but also retains the underlying regulatory and functional landscape across single-cell modalities.

                <p>by Tsukushi Kamiya, Mircea T. Sofonea, Michael France, Nicolas Tessandier, Ignacio G Bravo, Carmen Lia Murall, Jacques Ravel, Samuel Alizon</p>

The vaginal microbiota is associated with the health of women and newborns alike. Despite its comparatively simple composition relative to other human microbiota systems, the mechanisms underpinning the dynamics and stability of vaginal microbial communities remain elusive. A crucial, yet so far underexplored, aspect of vaginal microbiota ecology is the role played by nutritional resources. Glycogen and its derivatives, produced by vaginal epithelia, are accessible to all bacterial constituents of the microbiota. Concurrently, free sialic acid and fucose offer supplementary nutritional resources to bacterial strains capable of cleaving them from glycans, which are structurally integral to mucus. Notably, bacteria adept at sialic acid exploitation are often correlated with adverse clinical outcomes and are frequently implicated in bacterial vaginosis (BV). In this study, we introduce a novel mathematical model tailored to human vaginal microbiota dynamics to explore the interactions between bacteria and their respective nutritional landscape. Our resource-based model examines the impact of the relative availability of glycogen derivatives (accessible to all bacterial species) and sialic acid (exclusive to some BV-associated bacteria) on the composition of the vaginal microbiota. Our findings elucidate that the success of BV-associated bacteria is intricately linked to their exclusive access to specific nutritional resources. This private access fortifies communities dominated by BV-associated bacteria, rendering them resilient to compositional transitions. We empirically corroborate our model prediction with longitudinal clinical data on microbiota composition and previously unpublished metabolomic profiles obtained from a North American cohort. The insights gleaned from this study shed light on potential pathways for BV prevention and treatment.

                Background Using herbal medicine and supplements in treatment of pediatric diarrhea is used by around 80% of people worldwide. Sagwa is popularly used mainly in rural areas in Iraq. Potential toxicity may include neurotoxic, hepatotoxic, nephrotoxic and cardiotoxic effects. Aim This study was carried out to determine the morbidity and mortality linked to Sagwa use in acute gastroenteritis in infants with contributing factors. Patients and Methods A prospective case-control study in Al-Fallujah, Iraq from July 1st, 2022, to Jan 1st, 2023. The participants were infants with acute diarrhea who were admitted to pediatric wards and emergency departments. The cases were those infants with diarrhea who have been given Sagwa. Controls were age- and sex-matched who had acute diarrhea without use of Sagwa. The data of patients included: the number of times of having Sagwa, the duration between exposure and hospital admission, duration of hospital stay, the grandmother responsibility, the severity of dehydration, the presence of renal failure, the need for dialysis, convulsion, coma and death. Results The study included 50 cases and 50 controls. No significant differences in age and sex were observed but there was a significant association with rural residence, not educated mothers, grandma responsibility, severe dehydration, convulsions, and death. No significant differences were observed considering renal failure, dialysis and coma. A highly significant association was observed between oral & scalp administration routes and convulsions and renal failure. Conclusion Sagwa use in infants with diarrhea is dangerous and contributes to morbidity and mortality which are preventable. Cultural education against its use should target mothers and grandmothers in rural areas.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-183/v1?src=rss">Mechanisms of Neuroimmune Interactions in Stress Physiology, Health Implications, and Emerging Therapeutic Targets. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Chronic stress provokes maladaptive neuroimmune responses that disrupt the balance between the central nervous system and immune regulation. Dysregulation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis, sympathetic adrenal medullary (SAM) system, and peripheral immune circuits sustains microglial activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine release. The process is responsible for driving persistent neuroinflammation. These changes impair synaptic plasticity, compromise blood-brain barrier integrity, and predispose individuals to psychiatric illness, cognitive dysfunction, and systemic comorbidities. Recent advances reveal key molecular mechanisms, including glucocorticoid receptor resistance, epigenetic reprogramming, and cytokine-neurotransmitter cross-talk that explain how stress reshapes brain-immune communication. This review critically examines the evidence linking chronic stress to neuroimmune dysfunction, emphasizing both translational challenges and therapeutic opportunities. Emerging interventions such as cytokine blockade, microglial modulation, specialized pro-resolving mediators, neurosteroids, and microbiome-based strategies highlight the potential of mechanism-based treatments. However, clinical translation is hampered by heterogeneity in inflammatory phenotypes, limited biomarker validation, and insufficient longitudinal data. Future research must prioritize precision medicine approaches that integrate multi-omics profiling, sex- and hormone-specific analyses, and digital biosensing tools. By bridging neuroscience, immunology, and systems biology, targeted strategies can be developed to prevent and treat stress-related disorders more effectively.

                Background Epigenetic alteration through promoter DNA methylation is associated with gastric carcinogenesis. This study assessed the association between Helicobacter pylori infection, specifically cagA-positive strains, and MGMT promoter hypermethylation within the gastroduodenal disease spectrum in an Iraqi cohort. Methods The study conducted a case control study of 120 participants (40 endoscopy confirmed controls without gastroduodenal disease and 80 patients with gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, lymphoma, or gastric adenocarcinoma). Standard OGD biopsies were collected. H. pylori status was determined by rapid urease testing, selective culture on blood agar with biochemical identification, and PCR confirmation; cagA was detected by conventional PCR using validated primers and cycling conditions. Genomic DNA was separated and bisulfite treatment converted. MGMT promoter methylation was measured by methylation specific PCR primers and bisulfate treatment. Statistical analyses used chi-square or chi-square and reported odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Results The results showed a significantly greater incidence of H. pylori than controls (72.5% vs. 0%; χ2=56.129, p<0.001; OR=210.60, 95% CI 12.42–3572.22). CagA was found in 56.3% of patients and 0% of controls (χ2=36.000, p<0.001; OR=103.82, 95% CI 6.17–1747.38). MGMT promoter hypermethylation was observed in 66.3% of patients, whereas none of the controls exhibited this condition (χ2=47.463, p<0.001; OR=157.58, 95% CI 9.33–2661.18). Methylation varied across disease categories (χ2(15)=66.433, p<0.001), exhibiting heightened hypermethylation in gastritis (acute/chronic), peptic ulcer disease, gastric lymphoma, and gastric adenocarcinoma, whereas controls remained uniformly unmethylated. In the complete cohort, H. pylori positivity exhibited a significant correlation with hypermethylation (43/58 vs 10/62; χ2=40.892, p<0.001; OR=14.91, 95% CI 6.09–36.60), while cagA positivity demonstrated an even more pronounced association (41/45 vs 12/75; χ2=64.345, p<0.001; OR=53.81, 95% CI 16.24–178.31). There was a link between smoking and hypermethylation (χ2(2)=15.218, p<0.001), but sex, residence, chronic disease, and therapy were not significant (all p>0.10). Conclusions MGMT promoter hypermethylation is prevalent in gastroduodenal diseases in Iraqi cases, with H. pylori infection strongly correlated with MGMT hypermethylation, suggesting MGMT methylation as a biomarker for risk stratification.

                Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is still working on making a multilingual model that incorporates the Hungarian language. We introduce a hybrid Hungarian and English model, one of the biggest challenges is to recognize handwritten text. We are going to investigate a set of models in this research, such as TrOCR large-handwritten, leveraging PULI-BERT, and Roberta-base with Diet models. The digitization of documents, and the preservation of cultural heritage specifically, has long been a research problem related to text recognition. We use an extensive text on the recognition approach using pre-trained visual and language transformer models. We pre-train the TrOCR proposed by Microsoft researchers for both large and base models at the first phase and then fine-tune them on human data at the second stage. Then, leverage new pre-trained transformers models such as Roberta-base, and PULI-BERT, as decoders and Diet, Vit, and Beit as encoder models at the pre-training phase on generated synthetic data and then fine-tune them on a small amount of human-annotated data provided by (DH-Lab) researchers with augmentation and without augmentation. Developed using tiny-scale Synthetic data of around three-million-line text open-source corpus, and subsequently refined using tiny person-labeled datasets. Experiments showed that the best CER is 3.681 in the TrOCR large handwritten, and the best WER is 16.091 by leveraging the PULI-BERT with the Deit model. These fine-tuned models outperform the currently existing state-of-the-art TrOCR models on historical Hungarian handwriting, according to the benchmark results on the János Arany dataset.

                Background The contemporary world is undergoing rapid changes due to digitization and globalization, requiring institutions, especially in the financial sector, to adapt to complex multicultural and technological environments. Many organizations, particularly in the Iraqi financial sector, struggle to achieve effective smart governance and fully realize digital transformation due to limited integration of institutional cultural intelligence in their administrative and digital practices. Objective This study aims to examine the role of institutional cultural intelligence in enhancing digital transformation and smart governance at the Central Bank of Iraq, focusing on its cognitive, metacognitive, motivational, and behavioral dimensions. Methods A quantitative field study was conducted using structured questionnaires distributed to 120 employees from senior and middle management at the Central Bank of Iraq. A total of 114 valid responses were analyzed. The study employed a descriptive-analytical approach to examine the relationships between institutional cultural intelligence, digital transformation, and smart governance. Results Institutional cultural intelligence was found to significantly contribute to digital transformation, explaining 62.9% of the variance, and had a moderate effect on smart governance, accounting for 26.5% of the variance. Behavioral intelligence emerged as the most influential dimension. Conclusions The findings indicate that fostering cultural and technical development programs is essential to strengthen digital integration, improve governance performance, and support strategic organizational outcomes. This study underscores the practical and managerial implications of leveraging institutional cultural intelligence to enhance both digital and governance capacities in financial institutions.

                Background Sepsis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children, predominantly among critically ill patients admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Early diagnosis has been shown to improve patient prognosis. The objective of this study was to understand the role of systemic inflammatory indices as predictors of sepsis in children admitted to the PICU. Methods A prospective observational study was conducted to compare systemic inflammatory indices between two groups: one with sepsis and another without sepsis. Of the 138 PICU patients, 69 had sepsis and 69 were grouped under non-sepsis. Systemic inflammatory indices were calculated for NLR, PLR, MLR, SII, SIRI, and PIV in both groups and compared. ROC analysis was conducted to measure the predictive value. Results NLR, PLR, MLR, SII, SIRI, and PIV were significant predictors of sepsis among PICU patients. NLR was the best predictor, with an AUC of 1.000 at a cut-off of 1.957, with 100% sensitivity and specificity. SIRI and SII had predictive powers, with AUCs of 0.950 and 0.944, respectively. With a sensitivity of 92.8% and specificity of 89.9%, the optimal cut-off for the SII was found to be 571727.208. Conclusion Systemic inflammatory indices are accurate predictors of sepsis in patients in The PICU, enabling them to diagnose and intervene at an early stage. Their use may reduce pediatric sepsis-related morbidity and mortality by enabling bedside diagnoses.

                Background Gastric cancer is associated with a high mortality and morbidity rate. Patients often experience anxiety and depression, which are associated with a poor health-related quality of life. Furthermore, anxiety and depression have been associated with worse survival in patients with cancer. Therefore, this systematic review aims to identify the risk factors and prognostic impacts of anxiety and depression in gastric cancer. Methods We searched for relevant literature published up to April 7, 2025 from the MEDLINE, EBSCOhost, and ProQuest databases. We included studies that evaluated the risk factors and prognostic impact of anxiety and depression in gastric cancer. Studies that also included other types of cancers or only analyzed risk factors of psychological distress were excluded. Quality of studies was analyzed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Meta-analysis was performed if the adjusted odds ratio for a specific risk factor was evaluated in ≥ 3 studies. Otherwise, only qualitative analysis was performed. Results Fourteen studies were included in the review with a total number of 31,660 patients. From the included studies, we identified various risk factors that were significantly associated with anxiety or depression. We classified those risk factors based on Engel’s biopsychosocial model. Meta-analysis for eligible risk factors showed that female sex (adjusted OR = 3.04; 95% CI 2.04–4.54) and diabetes mellitus (adjusted OR = 4.78; 95% CI 2.46–9.28) were independently associated with higher odds of depression in gastric cancer. Furthermore, most studies showed that anxiety or depression was associated with worse survival in patients with gastric cancer. Conclusions We identified various risk factors for anxiety and depression in gastric cancer based on the available literature. It is important to screen for anxiety and depression in gastric cancer because of their negative prognostic impact on the patients.

                Over the past decade, the statistical and reliability literature has seen an enormous rise in the number of various probability distributions. Many of them are designed to integrate, enhance, or add to traditional models. This rise shows that people are becoming more aware of empirical integrity, flexibility, and adaptability, especially when it comes to modeling income distributions, dependability difficulties, and longevity statistics. In this paper, more general and flexible distributions are provided by employing a technique that generates the T−R {Y} family distributions as well as a brief overview for this kind of family. This technique may be applied to agree with certain data distribution types, including very left, right, thin or heavy tailed distribution, or to develop new distributions that are very applicable and flexible. In this context, produces a distinct member of a new sub-family called the IDNAI distribution, which is referred to the Lomax–Rayleigh {Exponential} distribution. The most important statistical and mathematical characteristics of the new family distribution are discussed. In order to estimate the parameters of the new class distribution, two estimation techniques will be additionally presented: the maximum likelihood method (MLE) and the least square method (LS). In order to analyze the effectiveness of suggested estimation techniques, simulation tools have been constructed. The results of the comparison indicated that the maximum likelihood method performed better than the least squares approach in terms of bias and mean squared error criteria. However, the application of a real dataset showed that, depending on several kinds of information criteria, the new class distribution fit the data more effectively than the specific classical and moderate distributions.

                Objective To evaluate the association between Fusobacterium nucleatum and c-Myc expression in Oral Potentially Malignant Disorders (OPMDs) and Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) and to explore its potential role in oral carcinogenesis. Materials and Methods A total of 32 histopathologically confirmed cases (18 OPMDs and 14 OSCC) were analyzed. Anaerobic cultures and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used to detect F. nucleatum. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to assess c-Myc expression. Statistical analysis was conducted using Mann-Whitney and Chi-square tests, with p < 0.05 considered significant. Results F. nucleatum was detected in eight OSCC and two OPMD cases, with higher colony counts in OSCC. All samples were positive for c-Myc, but their expression levels varied. In OPMDs, positivity was mainly observed in the basal and suprabasal epithelial layers, whereas OSCC showed both peripheral and central tumor cell localization. F. nucleatum–positive OSCC cases demonstrated strong nuclear c-Myc staining (50–75% positive cells). Tobacco habits, particularly combined smoking and smokeless use, were more common in F. nucleatum–positive OSCC cases. Conclusion F. nucleatum colonization correlates with increased c-Myc expression in OPMDs and OSCC, supporting its possible role in microbially driven oral carcinogenesis. These findings suggest its potential as a prognostic biomarker and a therapeutic target.

Results The results of the study show that differences in school background are not the main factor in strengthening environmental awareness, but rather based on character and science learning habits. Based on the highest average EA, the Senior high schools (SMA) Village 2 Group (SMA-V2) of 85.0068, and the lowest group is SMA village 3 (SMA-V3) of 75.5648. Based on the ANOVA test, there are significant differences and influences between each SMA category. R Squared The multiple determination value of all high school groups with EA shows an R Squared value of 0.60, meaning that the size of the independent variable can influence EA by 60%. Conclusions The Javanese Ethno-SSI Cultural Model contributes to EA through learning designs that emphasize concern for respecting, being responsive, and preserving traditions and culture. The Ethno-SSI model is able to contribute to preserving traditions and culture by providing students with the opportunity to respond and find solutions to environmental problems.

                Background Data on Canalis Sinuosus (CS) morphology in South Asian populations remain limited, despite frequent anterior maxillary implant placements. This study aimed to evaluate the occurrence, positional characteristics, and morphometric features of the CS in Indian adults using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) and to assess sex-related differences. Methods A cross-sectional analysis was conducted on 245 CBCT scans with intact maxillary incisors and canines. Multiplanar reconstructions were used to identify the CS and document its laterality, tooth relationship, and orientation. Measurements included canal diameter at the alveolar crest and distances to the alveolar crest, buccal cortical plate, and nasal floor. Inter-observer agreement was assessed using Cohen’s κ. Sex differences were analyzed using χ2 and independent-samples t-tests (α = 0.05). Results CS was detected in 67.3% of individuals, with bilateral presentation in 55.9% and unilateral in 11.4%. Detection rates were similar between sides (left: 62.4%, right: 60.8%). The canal was most frequently adjacent to the lateral incisor (44.7% left, 50.3% right), and approximately half of the canals showed palatal orientation. The mean canal diameter was 0.8 mm. Mean distances to the alveolar crest, buccal cortical plate, and nasal floor were 9.2 mm, 7.0 mm, and 11.5 mm, respectively. Males showed significantly larger canal diameters on the left side (p = 0.008), greater buccal cortical distances bilaterally (p < 0.001), and larger right nasal floor distances (p = 0.011). Conclusions The CS is a frequently observed, typically bilateral anatomical structure in the anterior maxilla of Indian adults, mostly located palatal adjacent the lateral incisor. The morphometric and sex-specific data obtained provide valuable reference parameters for implant planning and minimizing surgical complications.

                Objective Physiologic gingival pigmentation may negatively impact smile esthetics, particularly in individuals with high smile lines. This randomized clinical trial aimed to compare the clinical effectiveness of three minimally invasive depigmentation techniques: microneedling with Triphala Curna, microneedling with vitamin C, and 445-nm diode laser ablation. Materials and Methods Eighteen systemically healthy patients with physiologic gingival pigmentation were enrolled and allocated into three groups (n = 6 each) via block randomization. Group 1 received microneedling followed by topical Triphala Curna application; Group 2 received microneedling with vitamin C; and Group 3 underwent diode laser depigmentation at a wavelength of 445 nm. In Groups 1 and 2, the procedure was repeated after two weeks. Clinical assessments were performed at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months for gingival pigmentation (Peeran Index), gingival thickness, and patient satisfaction (VAS scores). Statistical analysis included paired and independent t tests, chi-square tests, and descriptive statistics, with significance set at p < 0.05. Results All the groups showed progressive clinical improvement. Complete depigmentation (grade 0) at 6 months was observed in 66.7% of patients in the Triphala group, 50.0% in the vitamin C group, and 33.3% in the laser group. Gingival thickness increased significantly in all groups, with the greatest increase observed in the Triphala group (from 1.10 ± 0.36 mm to 1.95 ± 0.41 mm, p < 0.001). Patient satisfaction also improved across all groups, with Triphala receiving the highest mean VAS score. No adverse events or pigmentation relapses were reported during study period. Conclusion Microneedling-assisted gingival depigmentation using Triphala Curna demonstrated the most favourable clinical and esthetic outcomes among the tested modalities. Results of vitamin C treatment were comparable to those of diode laser therapy, suggesting that herbal therapies combined with microneedling can serve as viable, biologically compatible alternatives to conventional laser techniques.

                This article analyzes the determinants of consumers’ purchase and consumption of geographical indication (GI) agricultural products through a ten-year systematic review. There exist growing concerns about food safety, quality, and health, increasing consumer attention to origin labelled foods. GI agricultural products have gained a stable position in global food markets. This study pursues two objectives. First, it identifies and classifies the key determinants of GI agricultural product consumption reported in the literature. Second, it compares insights from five existing review studies on closely related themes to clarify what is already established and what remains contested. Following the PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a transparent and reproducible systematic literature review, including structured searching, screening, and data extraction procedures. The results summarize how consumers respond to GI cues and identify factors associated with heterogeneous responses across contexts. By integrating fragmented evidence, this review clarifies consumption relevant mechanisms and offers implications for GI governance and marketing, helping firms better understand consumer decision making and supporting value capture for farmers, producers, and regional stakeholders.

                Background Recent advances in computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) have ushered in a new era of restorative dentistry, facilitating the utilization of innovative materials such as polyether ether ketone (PEEK) in lieu of conventional metal alloys for removable partial dentures (RPDs). Methods This study aimed to scrutinize the retentive efficacy of RPD clasps fabricated from PEEK and cobalt-chromium (Co-Cr) alloy through Finite Element Analysis (FEA). Employing in vitro experimentation on Maxillary Kennedy Class I cases, two distinct experimental models were devised, each representing varying degrees of retentive undercuts to simulate diverse clinical scenarios. Employing the Rest Proximal Aker (RPA) clasp design for both materials, this investigation integrates a comprehensive consideration of material properties, FEA modelling, and meticulous data analysis to evaluate the mechanical performance of PEEK clasps within a simulated oral environment. These models were systematically refined using optimization algorithms to enhance the design of PEEK clasps. Results Extensive stress analysis, strain distribution mapping, and deformation profiling were performed under diverse loading conditions. The FEA outcomes reveal that both PEEK and Co-Cr alloys are suitable as materials for RPD clasps, each presenting distinct advantages; however, PEEK demonstrates a more promising prospect as a superior alternative to the Co-Cr alloy. Conclusions Material selection should be tailored to individual patient-specific considerations and clinician expertise. The analysis of the stress distribution, strain patterns, and deformation tendencies aids in pinpointing potential weak areas or failure zones, thereby guiding future design enhancements and clinical applications.

                Abstract* Background Indonesia faces a growing double burden of non-communicable diseases, particularly cancer. The latest data from the Global Cancer Observatory (Globocan) indicates over 408,661 new cases and 242,099 cancer-related deaths in 2022, with a projected 63% increase in the case burden between 2025 and 2040 without strategic intervention. Although a new legal framework through Health Law No. 17 of 2023 and the Minister of Health Decree (KMK) No. HK.01.07/MENKES/2180/2023 has mandated palliative care as an integral component of health services, its implementation still faces significant systemic barriers. Policy and Implications This policy brief analyzes the disconnection between the policy mandate and on-the-ground reality, identifying critical gaps in accessibility, healthcare workforce capacity particularly among nursesand financing mechanisms through the National Health Insurance (JKN) program. The failure to effectively integrate palliative care not only causes unnecessary suffering for millions of patients but also burdens the health system with inefficient costs and suboptimal end-of-life care, reflected in the high “financial toxicity” experienced by patients. Recommendations We recommend a four-pillar strategy: (1) Formalize and standardize palliative services within the JKN benefits package with a clear financing model to address regulatory ambiguity; (2) Develop a national competency-based palliative education and training strategy for all health workers, with a focus on empowering nurses in primary care; (3) Implement a decentralized and tiered palliative care delivery model centered on Community Health Centers (Puskesmas) to ensure equitable access; and (4) Launch a national public education campaign to destigmatize palliative care and increase awareness. Conclusion The integration of palliative care is not merely an option but a strategic and ethical imperative for achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in Indonesia. It is a cost-effective investment to improve patients’ quality of life, support families, and ensure the sustainability of the national health system in facing future non-communicable disease challenges.

                Dopamine suppresses GABA release from striatal terminals in the substantia nigra pars reticulata. Molinari et al. recently demonstrated that this suppression is frequency-dependent—instituting a high-pass filter on striatal ‘direct pathway’ transmission—and does not require dopamine receptors. Rather, dopamine upregulates serotonin, activating presynaptic 5HT1B receptors to exert its effects.

                The diversification and expansion of distinct progenitor cell subtypes during embryogenesis are essential to form the sophisticated brain structures present in vertebrates. In particular, the emergence of highly proliferative basal progenitors contributed to the evolutionary enlargement of the mammalian neocortex. Basal progenitors are at the center of indirect neurogenesis and can be divided into two main subtypes: the classical TBR2-positive intermediate progenitor cells and the outer radial glial cells, which are especially abundant in gyrencephalic species. While the function of some transcriptomic regulators is conserved across the mammalian clade, recent studies have identified human-specific genes and enhancers that uniquely affect progenitor biology, possibly driving the increased neocortical complexity and disease-susceptibility of the human brain. Here, we review the evolution of basal progenitors, highlighting species-specific traits, molecular drivers of proliferation, and how imbalances in neurogenesis contribute to human brain disorders.

                Neurons are specialized cells designed to process information and transmit it, often across long distances. In many neurons, the axonal volume far exceeds the somato-dendritic volume, creating a need for long-range transport and local polarization mechanisms. In addition, action potential firing and restoration of ionic gradients, as well as dynamic changes in synaptic plasticity, further increase the energetic demands of neurons. In this review, we highlight the roles mitochondria play in vertebrate neuronal biology and how mitochondrial functionality is tuned to support the unique demands of neurons. We cover the influence of mitochondrial positioning, ATP generation and Ca2+ buffering on neuronal function, and explore the role of mitochondria in neurotransmitter metabolism and local protein translation.

                Flight maneuvers in the fruit fly Drosophila have long served as a model for studying principles underlying visual information processing. Advances in genetic targeting of individual types of neurons for manipulation and recording, as well as the publication of the complete connectome, have greatly expanded our knowledge of how behavior is controlled by the fly’s nervous system. In this review, I summarize recent findings on how visual information relevant to flight is transformed into a behavioral output, ranging from fast stabilizing reflex-like responses to longer-lasting goal-directed behaviors. I argue that flexibility in the processing of visual information and a hierarchical recruitment of different behavioral modules enable the control of this complex behavior with a comparatively small number of neurons.

                Using mouse models, Zheng et al. show that social engagement promotes both innate and experience-dependent exploration. Dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) encode risk assessment and exploratory motivation through firing pattern-biased DA transmission, thereby shaping exploration decisions via competing VTADA pathways that converge onto basolateral amygdala neurons.

                Xu et al. map the first global profiling of protein lysine lactylation in bladder cancer. Delactylation of ARHGDIB, a classical tumor suppressor, drives metastasis and chemoresistance of bladder cancer via attenuating its binding affinity to Rac1. Therapeutic targeting of ARHGDIB delactylation presents a promising strategy for the sensitization of chemotherapy.

                Dev et al. find that ATP7B is enriched in myeloid progenitors that maintain Cu in distinct vesicles, which switch to Cu utilization as ATP7B decreases and other transporters (ATP7A, SLC31A2) and cuproenzymes LOXL2 rise. Loss of myeloid Atp7b in mice impairs neutrophil maturation, revealing a Cu-transport network role during neutrophil differentiation.

                Herrera et al. show that in larval zebrafish, heart rate and engagement in the optomotor response are inversely related following threat. This synchronization emerges via parallel central mechanisms. Directly optopacing the heart also reduces visuomotor engagement but through alternative mechanisms related to reducing blood flow.

                Xu et al. reveal that co-infection of nematodes and pathogens is a global phenomenon. Root-knot nematodes reprogram rhizosphere metabolism, reducing defensive tomatidine while increasing sugars that reshape rhizosphere microbiome. These changes suppress antagonistic microbes and promote pathogen proliferation, which enhances nematode survival and gall formation, leading to complex co-infection dynamics.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105759">The Drosophila EGF domain protein uninflatable sets the switch between wrapping glia growth and axon wrapping instructed by Notch</a></h4>

              
                In the peripheral nervous system, sensory and motor axons are generally covered by wrapping glial cell processes. This neuron-glia interaction requires an intricate coordination of glial growth and differentiation. How this is controlled molecularly remains largely unknown. At the example of <i>Drosophila</i> larval nerves, we show that glial growth, which occurs without any cell division, is initially triggered by the FGF-receptor tyrosine kinase Heartless (Htl). In a screen for genes acting downstream of activated FGF-receptor, we identified the large membrane protein Uninflatable (Uif), which supports the growth of excessive plasma membrane domains but does not support glial axon wrapping. Uif is also known to inhibit Notch. Surprisingly, we find that Notch signaling is required in postmitotic wrapping glia. While compromised <i>Notch</i> signaling results in a reduced wrapping efficiency, gain of <i>Notch</i> activity in wrapping glia leads to a hyperwrapping phenotype. Thus, Notch signaling is both necessary and sufficient for glial wrapping in <i>Drosophila</i> larvae. In addition, <i>Notch</i> suppresses both <i>uif</i> and <i>htl</i> function and thus stabilizes the switch between glial growth and glial axon wrapping. Given the general conservation of signaling mechanisms controlling glia development in mice and flies, similar mechanisms may act in the mammalian nervous system to control final glial differentiation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101671">Automatic learning mechanisms for flexible human locomotion</a></h4>

              
                Movement flexibility and automaticity are necessary to successfully navigate different environments. When encountering difficult terrains such as a muddy trail, we can change how we step almost immediately so that we can continue walking. This flexibility comes at a cost since we initially must pay deliberate attention to how we are moving. Gradually, after a few minutes on the trail, stepping becomes automatic so that we do not need to think about our movements. Canonical theory indicates that different adaptive motor learning mechanisms confer these essential properties to movement: explicit control confers rapid flexibility, while forward model recalibration confers automaticity. Here, we uncover a distinct mechanism of treadmill walking adaptation – an automatic stimulus-response mapping – that confers both properties to movement. The mechanism is flexible as it learns stepping patterns that can be rapidly changed to suit a range of treadmill configurations. It is also automatic as it can operate without deliberate control or explicit awareness by the participants. Our findings reveal a tandem architecture of forward model recalibration and automatic stimulus-response mapping mechanisms for walking, reconciling different findings of motor adaptation and perceptual realignment.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/109280">The chromatin remodeller CHD4 regulates transcription factor binding to both prevent activation of silent enhancers and maintain active regulatory elements</a></h4>

              
                Chromatin organisation and transcriptional regulation are tightly coordinated processes that are essential for maintaining cellular identity and function. ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling proteins play critical roles in control of genome structure and in regulating transcription across eukaryotes. Their essential nature, however, has made it difficult to define exactly how these functions are mediated. The chromatin remodeller CHD4 has been shown to be capable of sliding nucleosomes in vitro, and to regulate chromatin accessibility and gene expression in vivo. Using an inducible depletion system, here we identify a second mechanism of action for CHD4 in actively restricting the residence time of transcription factors (TFs) on chromatin. Together, these activities result in distinct, context-dependent outcomes: at highly accessible regulatory elements, CHD4 limits TF binding to maintain regulatory function, while at low-accessibility euchromatic regions, it prevents TF engagement and sustains chromatin compaction, thereby silencing cryptic enhancers. Collectively, these mechanisms enable CHD4 to reduce transcriptional noise while preserving the responsiveness of active regulatory networks.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99225">Repression of PRMT activities sensitize human homologous recombination-proficient ovarian and breast cancer cells to PARP inhibitor treatment</a></h4>

              
                Therapeutic epigenetic modulation is currently being evaluated in the clinic to sensitize homologous recombination (HR)-proficient tumors to PARP inhibitors. To broaden its clinical applicability and identify more effective combination strategies, we conducted a drug screen combining PARP inhibitors with 74 well-characterized epigenetic modulators targeting five major classes of epigenetic enzymes. Notably, both type I PRMT inhibitors and PRMT5 inhibitors scored highly in combination efficacy and clinical prioritization. PRMT inhibition significantly enhanced PARP inhibitor-induced DNA damage in human HR-proficient ovarian and breast cancer cells. Mechanistically, PRMT suppression downregulates DNA damage repair genes and BRCAness-associated pathways, while also modulating intrinsic innate immune responses within cancer cells. Integrative analysis of large-scale genomic and functional datasets from TCGA and DepMap further supports PRMT1, PRMT4, and PRMT5 as promising therapeutic targets in oncology. Importantly, dual inhibition of PRMT1 and PRMT5 synergistically sensitizes tumors to PARP inhibitors. Collectively, our findings provide strong rationale for the clinical development of PRMT and PARP inhibitor combinations in HR-proficient ovarian and breast cancers.

">Alternative strategies of orthographic processing: the case of skilled deaf readers</a></h4>

              
                The cognitive factors that enable us to be proficient readers can greatly vary across individuals. The case of skilled deaf readers is emblematic as it shows that high reading performances can be achieved even when lifelong acoustic experience is absent or minimal. Here we present a set of experiments investigating how alternative strategies of orthographic processing can lead to high levels of reading proficiency. Four EEG studies compared behavioral and brain correlates of orthographic processing in skilled deaf readers and matched hearing controls. Using single word recognition and priming paradigms, we investigated two pillars of orthographic processing: letter identity and letter position. Our findings show that, although both groups had similarly accurate reading performance, skilled deaf readers were faster, and they consistently differ from hearing controls in the way they process letter identity. This group difference was observed in both lexical and sublexical tasks and was specifically related to the identity of orthographic representations, regardless of the visual form of the written stimuli (such as character visual similarity and letter case). These findings uncover alternative strategies that make possible high reading performance, even in the absence of acoustic experience.

">Cell-specific effects of acute sleep deprivation on transcriptomic signatures of non-neuronal cells in the mouse hippocampus and prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Sleep is essential for maintaining cognitive, emotional, metabolic, and immune functions. Although research on sleep homeostasis is traditionally neuron-centric, increasing evidence indicates non-neuronal cells also play critical roles. In this study, we performed transcriptomic analyses of non-neuronal nuclei from the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of mice subjected to acute sleep deprivation (SD). We found that acute SD induces robust, cell-type- and region-specific transcriptional reprogramming in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. The most pronounced changes occurred in astrocytes, including downregulation of cholesterol biosynthesis genes in both brain regions, accompanied by region-specific and opposing regulation of genes involved in mitochondrial function and neurodegeneration-related pathways. Notably, genes associated with primary cilia were selectively induced in cortical astrocytes. In oligodendrocytes, acute SD led to downregulation of genes encoding cell-adhesion molecules. Together, these findings provide molecular evidence that non-neuronal cells actively contribute to sleep regulation and suggest novel potential mechanisms that broaden our understanding of sleep homeostasis.

">How Visual Experience Shapes Face Processing: Divergent Representational Strategies Emerge from Specialized and Diverse Visual Diets in Artificial Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                Face perception in humans is supported by specialized neural mechanisms, yet the developmental origins of these mechanisms remain debated. We trained two artificial neural networks (ANNs) on identical orientation-classification tasks but with distinct visual diets: one exposed exclusively to adult faces (Face-ANN) and the other to diverse object categories (Object-ANN). Face-ANN acquired human-like face-processing signatures, including robust performance on Mooney faces, infant faces, and minimal three-dot patterns, and a reliance on low-frequency global structure. However, it failed to recognize face-like objects or most animal faces (except for monkeys), indicating limited overgeneralization. Object-ANN showed the opposite profile, excelling at face-like objects and animal faces but failing on abstract faces. These dissociations demonstrate that domain-specific visual experience alone can give rise to core properties of human face perception, while broad visual experience supports flexible generalization and face pareidolia. Our findings highlight how distinct visual diets shape representational strategies and offer a computational framework for probing the evolutionary origins of face-selective systems.

">Body-segment coordination as a new predictor of freezing of gait in people with Parkinson disease</a></h4>

              
                Freezing of gait (FOG) in Parkinson's disease (PD) involves impaired integration of posture and locomotion with altered body-segment coordination. We measured coordination using gait kinematics during walking in 16 PD patients with FOG, preoperatively with and without dopaminergic medication (OFF/ON-DOPA), and postoperatively with and without subthalamic deep brain stimulation (OFF/ON-DBS). Body-segment coordination was modeled from acceleration-based intersegmental correlations across trunk, pelvis, and limbs. We tested whether coordination metrics predict individual postoperative FOG severity using LASSO regression with nested cross-validation, including preoperative demographics, clinical scores, gait and coordination metrics. Preoperatively, DOPA decreased trunk-pelvis-upper-limb coordination but increased crossed upper-lower-limbs coupling; while STN-DBS selectively increased inter-upper-limb coordination, with DOPA- and STN-DBS-induced changes being correlated. Whole-body coordination predicted individual postoperative FOG severity, with the most important couplings being the trunk-pelvis and pelvis-lower-limb. Body-segment coordination captures clinically relevant gait metrics in PD, highlighting coordination as a potential biomarker for patient stratification and treatment response.

">Domain Adaptation Enables Cross-site Classification of First-episode Schizophrenia from Multimodal Neuroimaging Data</a></h4>

              
                Identifying robust neuroimaging markers associated with schizophrenia is essential for advancing research and informing clinical understanding. However, a major obstacle to clinical translation is the limited ability of neuroimaging-based classification models to generalise across scanning sites. In this study, we first establish best performing within-site models, and then systematically investigate cross-site generalisation in first-episode schizophrenia (FES) classification and evaluate strategies for mitigating site-related distribution shifts. Using data from two acquisition sites (n=389 in total), we perform train-on-site/test-on-site experiments to analyze performance degradation under domain shift and examine the effectiveness of ComBat, optimal transport, and adversarial adaptation strategies. Across functional, structural, and diffusion-based features, both traditional machine learning and neural network models achieve comparable performance in within-site classification, with resting state fMRI functional connectivity providing the most robust unimodal features. When models are transferred across sites, performance degrades substantially across all approaches, highlighting the impact of site-related variability. Distribution-alignment methods partially mitigate this degradation, with ComBat and optimal transport yielding more consistent cross-site improvements than adversarial adaptation. Increasing model complexity alone does not result in systematic performance gains, and simple models combined with effective alignment strategies often perform comparably to more complex neural architectures, while multimodal feature fusion does not consistently outperform functional connectivity alone. Overall, our findings indicate that controlling for site effects is more critical than model complexity for achieving generalisable classification in FES, underscoring the importance of rigorous evaluation designs and explicit distribution-alignment strategies for neuroimaging-based predictive models with potential clinical utility.

">Connectome analysis reveals brain-wide processing of visual features in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Sensory processing relies on an intricate interplay between specialized sensory circuits and the broader brain. Leveraging the whole-brain Drosophila melanogaster connectome, we analyzed long-range projections linking the optic lobe (OL)--the principal visual center--reciprocally with the central brain and the contralateral OL to determine how visual features are computed by a brainwide network. By quantifying synaptic polarity and connectivity, we classified the projection neurons into feedforward, feedback, and bilateral groups. Feedforward neurons form an information bottleneck, consolidating diverse visual features from the OL and distributing them through modular pathways for higher-order processing. Feedback neurons densely innervate OL structures, conveying contextual signals in the central brain via precise recurrent loops. Bilateral neurons link local visual circuits across the two OLs, providing a substrate for inter-ocular processing. These findings reveal how early visual pathways interface with brainwide circuits to support diverse brain functions and enable context-dependent flexibility in sensory computation.

">Connectomes across temporal scales with simultaneous wide-field optical imaging and resting-state functional MRI</a></h4>

              
                Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is a cornerstone of human brain research, yet its interpretation is complicated by its sensitivity to the slow hemodynamic response that obscures the organization of neural activity across faster time scales. Here we use simultaneous wide-field optical imaging (WOI) and rs-fMRI to directly examine the relationship between neural and hemodynamic functional connectomes across time scales. We show that much of the large-scale spatial structure is preserved across modalities, across time scales, and across frequencies. Although rs-fMRI robustly captures time-averaged neural activity, time-resolved rs-fMRI estimates of functional connectivity exhibit significantly greater variability, which partially reflects sensitivity limitations. Hemodynamic WOI signals maintain greater similarity to neural activity than rs-fMRI, although their fidelity is reduced at high frequencies. Together, our findings demonstrate that the time-averaged spatial structure of neural activity is faithfully represented in hemodynamics and rs-fMRI; provide insight into the reliability of time-resolved rs-fMRI across temporal scales; and establish a multimodal framework for validating features of dynamic brain activity.

">Biophysical Modeling of Thalamocortical Circuit Dynamics: Species-Specific Insights into Neural Synchrony, Sleep Spindles, and Mechanisms of Neuropsychiatric Disorders</a></h4>

              
                Thalamocortical circuits play a fundamental role in cognitive functions, and neural synchronization, with disruptions implicated in disorders. Here, we investigated the neural dynamics of thalamocortical connectivity using computational modeling of rodent and primate thalamocortical loops. We incorporated distinct projections and varying network configurations and examined their impact on circuit synchrony, spiking patterns, and sleep spindle generation. Circuits included distinct core and matrix thalamocortical projections, with core pathways providing focal, driving input to middle cortical layers, while matrix pathways mediate widespread, modulatory signaling across superficial layers, and the presence of thalamic interneurons, which are scarce in rodents but comprise up to a third of the thalamic neurons in primates. In our simulations, these distinctions produced clear species-and loop architecture-dependent effects: rodent circuits were markedly more sensitive to parameter changes in core and matrix thalamocortical connectivity strength, while primate circuits maintained relatively stable spatiotemporal patterns across parameter variations, exhibiting greater stability and synchrony. Sleep spindle analysis likewise revealed species differences. Overall, across all thalamocortical configurations, rodent simulations produced spindles with greater spatiotemporal variability, showing irregular event structure and timing. In contrast, primate spindles were more uniform and coherent, with clearer and more consistent organization across neurons and time. These findings provide insights into species-specific differences in thalamocortical dynamics and have implications for modeling sensory and cognitive disruptions in disorders such as autism and schizophrenia. By incorporating distinct configurations, and interspecies differences, our model contributes to understanding how thalamocortical dysregulation may differentially impact spindle generation, network synchrony, and information processing across species.

">Compression Efficiency and Structural Learning as a Computational Model of DLN Cognitive Stages</a></h4>

              
                We propose a computational instantiation of three cognitive stages from the Dot-Linear-Network (DLN) framework, grounded in a compression-efficiency thesis. DLN stages are characterized as representational topologies at the level of an agent's belief-dependency structure: Dot as no persistent belief graph (reactive policies with negligible state), Linear as a null graph over option beliefs (K independent option estimates with no information sharing), and Network as shared latent structure (a bipartite factor graph in which F latent factors connect to K options), augmented by a temporal exposure state and an explicit structural learning cycle (hypothesis to test to update/expand). In this mapping, Linear cognition learns and evaluates K options independently (O(K) cognitive cost), while Network cognition represents shared structure once (O(F) cognitive cost for F shared factors) and incorporates an explicit structural learning cycle: structural hypothesis to predictive test to update/expansion when the hypothesis fails. We distinguish two compression targets: Option-factor structure (shared structure in expected outcomes) and Stakes-factor structure (shared structure in consequence-bearing exposures). Their intersection yields jointly efficient actions that improve expected outcomes while simultaneously improving marginal stakes impact. In a bandit-like simulation with factor-structured options and factor-structured stakes (100 seeds, K in {20, 50, 100, 200}, F=5, T=80), Network policies dominate Linear policies in cost-adjusted utility once the option set is sufficiently large (for example, at K=200 with stakes off, Network-Full achieves cost-adjusted utility 80.53 vs. Linear 64.46). With stakes active, Linear policies incur large exposure penalties because they ignore covariance-induced cross-terms from cumulative exposure, while Network policies learn factor-level exposures and track cumulative exposure, maintaining positive utility (for example, at K=200 with stakes on, mean utility 66.78 for Network vs. -929.11 for Linear). These results evaluate internal consistency of a DLN-to-computation mapping under explicit assumptions; they do not validate a developmental theory in humans.

">Closed-loop imitation learning reveals muscle-centric and latent-goal codes in primate sensorimotor cortex</a></h4>

              
                Dexterous grasping requires the seamless integration of proprioceptive feedback with predictive motor commands. Yet, how cortical circuits combine afferent feedback with efference copies to support skilled hand control remains poorly understood. Here we develop a closed-loop, muscle-level model of primate grasping that integrates biomechanics, imitation learning, and neural recordings. A neural network policy trained on a 39-muscle musculoskeletal hand reproduces naturalistic pre-contact shaping and develops internal states that quantitatively explain single-neuron activity in primary motor (M1) and somatosensory (S1) cortices. Three principles emerged. First, muscle-based controllers generate representations that align more closely with cortical dynamics than joint-based controllers, despite lower kinematic accuracy. Second, recurrent architectures with temporal memory, especially LSTMs, provide an inductive bias that enhances neural predictability. Third, model-to-brain alignment peaked at the layer integrating proprioceptive and goal signals. Finally, by decoding the model's latent trajectory representation from M1, we demonstrated direct neural control of the policy: with activity from only tens of neurons, the brain-driven controller generated coherent grasp trajectories and showed markedly greater robustness to noise than joint-angle decoding. These findings reveal that S1 and M1 embed integrated, temporally structured, muscle-centric states and establish a stimulus-computable mechanistic framework for modeling sensorimotor control, while opening a novel route for creating brain-body models.

">Glucose hypometabolism and hyperphosphorylated Tau synergistically drive neuronal necroptosis</a></h4>

              
                The combination of brain glucose hypometabolism and hyperphosphorylated Tau (p-Tau) pathology is the strongest known clinical predictor of imminent cognitive decline, yet how these factors cooperate to drive dementia remains unknown. Here, we show that glucose hypometabolism synergizes with p-Tau to trigger neuronal loss through necroptosis. Under low-glucose conditions, accumulated p-Tau forms a molecular scaffold that directly recruits the necroptotic kinase RIPK1, while concomitant loss of the necroptosis checkpoint protein A20 removes a critical brake on this death pathway. This dual mechanism thereby precipitates neuronal necroptosis independent of classical TNF/TNFR1 signaling paradigm. Restoring A20 expression with acetyl-L-carnitine as a dietary supplement or preventing the p-Tau RIPK1 interaction using a RIPK1 derived competitive peptide alleviates neuronal necroptosis and brain atrophy in a Tau transgenic mouse model. Collectively, our findings uncover a previously unrecognized metabolism-driven necroptotic signaling cascade initiated by a p-Tau RIPK1 hub, providing mechanical insight into how glucose hypometabolism synergizes with p-Tau to drive neurodegeneration.

                How memories are shaped by repeated experiences remains unclear. Reorganization of memory engram could underlie memory transformation. Here, by combining c-Fos-based engram cell tagging with optogenetics, spine imaging, and reactivation analyses in the dentate gyrus (DG) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), we discovered a distinct system-wide engram reorganization following repeated learning; that is, a reshuffling of engram cells in the DG, as well as the rapid maturation of mPFC engram cells, forming a dual engram distributed within the hippocampal-mPFC network. These mPFC engram cells were crucial for relearning-dependent enhancement of memory precision. In addition, we found that reactivation of DG engram cells during retraining is critical for engram reorganization-dependent memory strengthening. These findings establish a causal link between engram reorganization and memory transformation by relearning.

">Deep-learning-based fMRI decoding of real-world size for hand-held objects</a></h4>

              
                Real-world object size is a fundamental dimension of visual cognition, supporting effective interaction with the environment and object manipulation. However, neural mechanisms encoding size have largely been inferred from extreme size comparisons, leaving the neural representation of subtle size differences within a manipulable, "hand-scale" range poorly understood. Here, we applied a three-dimensional deep neural network (3D DNN) to decode real-world size from whole-brain fMRI data (N = 50) using objects that all fall within a graspable range. The 3D DNN successfully decoded subtle size differences, achieving higher accuracy than multivariate pattern analysis. Crucially, Guided Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Guided Grad-CAM) revealed that discriminative size information was not confined to the ventral visual and temporal cortex but extended to a distributed network. Notably, these regions spatially overlap with the specific brain areas implicated in size-perception distortions following brain damage. Our findings suggest that the brain represents subtle variations in object size through a non-linear, distributed network that transcends the traditional visual hierarchy. Specifically, this system likely orchestrates the integration of visual properties with semantic scaling and the multimodal convergence of vision, space, and memory.

                Background: Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), or Spinocerebellar Ataxia type 3 (SCA3), is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expansion of the CAG repeat in the MJD1/ATXN3 gene, which encodes for a polyglutamine-expansion in Ataxin-3. Similar to what occurs in other neurodegenerative disorders, the cerebrovascular system, particularly the blood-brain barrier (BBB), is impaired in MJD. BBB is an important cellular barrier that controls homeostasis of the central nervous system, and its disruption compromises neuronal function. To date, there is no disease-modifying therapy for MJD. Our group previously demonstrated that MSC administration can ameliorate the phenotype of MJD transgenic mice. However, the effect of MSC on the neurovascular unit and BBB integrity remains unexplored in the context of MJD. In the present work, we aimed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of MSC in mitigating vascular abnormalities and BBB disruption in MJD. Methods: Eight-month-old MJD transgenic mice were treated with two consecutive bone marrow-MSC intravenous injections (1 week apart). Behavioral tests to assess motor coordination were conducted before and after treatment. Vascular structure, function, and BBB disruption were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and western blot. Results: MSC administration partially restored vascular impairment in MJD transgenic mice. Treated mice exhibited improved gait and motor performance footprint and beam walking tests) and concurrently attenuated vascular dysfunction. Specifically, MSC-treated mice exhibited a decrease in collagen IV surface area and stabilized cerebellar blood supply. Additionally, MSC treatment diminished BBB permeability to the Evans blue (EB) dye in MJD mice and restored the levels of important adherent and tight junction-associated proteins in the cellular membrane, including vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin), claudin-5, and occludin, in a sex-specific manner. Conclusions: our results highlight significant cerebrovascular dysregulations in MJD, which are sex-dependent and progress with the disease stage. Moreover, our findings suggest that MSC administration partially reverted vascular impairments, providing valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic potential of MSC in MJD.

">Efficient task generalization and humanlike face perception in models that learn to discriminate face geometry</a></h4>

              
                Artificial deep neural networks (DNNs) can excel at face recognition from 2D photographs where both shape and appearance cues abound; however, DNNs have rarely been challenged to recognize faces strictly based on face geometry. Here, we show that DNNs, even those fine-tuned on face photographs, had almost no generalization performance to a new geometry-based face task, while in the opposite direction, networks fine-tuned only on geometrically defined, textureless faces readily generalized to textured faces. To learn geometry in a more practical setting with colored and textured faces, we trained discrimination on face emotion in addition to face identity, which resulted in less texture bias and generalized well across face tasks. Learning in this way from just four individuals and their expressions generalized to unseen individuals, even exceeding standard models which are trained on classifying hundreds of face identities. Compared to standard models, emotion and identity trained models developed more humanlike errors in the identities or emotions that they confused. This novel method learns in a humanlike manner using only a few individuals but enriched with expressions that widely vary face geometry -- similar to early human experience during child-parent interactions. Thus, this bioinspired work has broad implications for how moving toward humanlike learning of geometry in artificial vision can be both highly sample efficient and highly performing.

">Symmetric Fusion of fMRI and EEG for Spectrally Resolved Functional Neuroimaging</a></h4>

              
                Simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and functional MRI (fMRI) offers complementary sensitivity to fast electrophysiological dynamics of EEG and spatially resolved hemodynamics of fMRI, yet previous joint-analysis approaches are confined to fixed task paradigms and struggle with continuous or naturalistic brain states. We FSINC (Fusing Source Imaging based on a Neurovascular Coupling) model, a unified EEG-fMRI source imaging framework that reconstructs cortical activity to simultaneously explain both modalities. FSINC integrates frequency-resolved EEG source activity with fMRI via a data-driven neurovascular coupling model that estimates band-specific coupling coefficients ({beta}) and accommodates a tunable spatial-temporal trade-off through hyperparameters ({lambda}2, {lambda}3). In realistic simulations, FSINC outperformed conventional methods (wMNE, LORETA) in both spatial and temporal accuracy across EEG SNRs (-10 to 10 dB) and numbers of concurrent sources (up to five), with optimal performance at {lambda}2=100 and {lambda}3=1 (e.g., LE: 0.51 {+/-} 0.24mm; SDI: 0.03 {+/-} 0.37mm; temporal accuracy: 0.95 {+/-} 0.05). Applied to simultaneous EEG-fMRI during contrast-reversing visual stimulation (5.95Hz), FSINC revealed stimulus-locked responses localized to early visual cortex and stimulus-induced modulation of intrinsic alpha oscillations extending into visual and attention networks, patterns that conventional methods failed to capture. Estimated {beta}-weights were broadly consistent with prior reports of negative (theta/alpha) and positive (gamma) BOLD-electrophysiology associations. These findings demonstrate that FSINC enables high-spatiotemporal-resolution source imaging from EEG-fMRI recordings via data-driven hemodynamic modelling, and is expected to be well-suited for continuous and naturalistic brain states (e.g., resting state, natural moving-watching, and narrative listening) that are difficult to interrogate with either modality alone.

">Geometric Fragility in Alzheimer's Disease: Probing the Loss of Hippocampal Hierarchical Abstraction via Contrastive Point Cloud Modeling</a></h4>

              
                While human spatial cognition relies on hierarchical abstraction to integrate local features, Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology is often reduced to local volumetric atrophy. We propose geometric fragility as a distinct failure of global topological integrity within the hippocampus rather than a mere accumulation of local errors. Using a texture-invariant point cloud framework, we contrasted local feature aggregation with global hierarchical attention as computational probes for structural perception. The global paradigm demonstrated enhanced diagnostic sensitivity and exhibited cognitive resilience under simulated neuronal sparsity by maintaining structural recognition where local models suffered pattern collapse. Global modeling effectively unfolded the pathological manifold, revealing a linear trajectory of geometric degradation consistently correlated with clinical cognitive decline. These findings indicate that AD progression may be characterized as a systemic topological dissolution and suggest that effective biomarkers should prioritize hierarchical shape abstraction to accurately map the continuous transition from healthy cognition to dementia.

">Visual Strategies During a Cooperative Mechanically Coupled Bilateral Task</a></h4>

              
                A subset of bilateral tasks requires one arm to perform a stabilizing role while the other completes a movement, such as slicing a loaf of bread. Visual attention during bilateral tasks has previously been examined with bilateral reaching tasks, demonstrating that visual attention switches between the two target locations. The goal of this study was to characterize visual attention during a cooperative mechanically coupled bilateral stabilizing and reach task to determine how visual attention is divided between the two limbs when one limb plays a stabilizing role. Twenty-six healthy young adults completed a robotic task in which the hands were coupled with a haptic spring. Participants were instructed to keep one hand stationary in a target while they reached for a target with the other hand, thus stretching the spring and applying a force to both arms. We found that individuals primarily fixated their gaze on the reaching target, only fixating on the stabilizing target for approximately 10% of the reaching time. Longer fixations on the reaching target were associated with faster reaching times, while longer fixations on the stabilizing target were associated with slower reaching times. While the performance of the stabilizing hand differed between the dominant and non-dominant limbs, visual strategies did not vary based on which hand was stabilizing. These results demonstrate that unlike bilateral reaching tasks in which the eyes frequently saccade between the two targets, visual guidance is primarily used for the reaching hand while minimal overt visual attention is directed to the stabilizing hand.

">Assessing whole-cortex excitability from electromagnetic brain signals</a></h4>

              
                Cortical excitability, the propensity of neural circuits to respond to internal or external perturbations, is a fundamental property of brain functioning, shaped by local microcircuitry, large-scale networks, and neurochemical architecture. In humans, excitability is inferred from multiple indirect metrics derived from spontaneous and stimulus-driven electromagnetic activity, yet it remains unclear whether these measures reflect a common underlying construct or distinct physiological processes. Here, we systematically compared ten previously validated excitability metrics using whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) recorded at rest and during 40 Hz auditory stimulation in a large sample of healthy adults. The measures spanned stimulus-driven synchronization, spectral power, 1/f activity (hereafter defined as aperiodic), signal complexity, long-range temporal correlations, and phase-gamma synchronization. Hierarchical clustering revealed six separable excitability dimensions with limited redundancy, demonstrating that cortical excitability is inherently multidimensional. Aperiodic and alpha-band measures showed the strongest mutual coupling and the furthest spatial correspondence to stimulus-related responses, whereas temporal, complexity, and synchronization-based metrics were largely independent. The similarity between measures varied across cortical regions and functional networks, with maximal cluster separability in integrative and internally driven regions. These regions included orbitofrontal, temporal, anterior cingulate, and default mode areas, as well as visual and somatomotor networks. Finally, excitability dimensions showed distinct relationships with cortical morphology and neurotransmitter receptor density, implicating heterogeneous neurobiological substrates. Together, these findings provide a unified framework for interpreting excitability metrics and highlight the need for multimodal approaches when probing cortical excitability in health and disease

">Integrating Functional Transdiagnostic Dimensions of Psychopathology with Cortical Organization</a></h4>

              
                Childhood and adolescence represent a critical period in which neurodevelopmental psychiatric conditions emerge; traditional case-control approaches often underestimate the complexity and co-occurrence of psychiatric conditions, calling for a transdiagnostic approach as a complementary measure. Open-access data sharing initiatives provide an opportunity to decipher structural- and functional-based organisational constraints on the relationship between brain connectivity and psychopathology. Using a highly heterogenous and comorbid neurodevelopmental sample of children and adolescents aged between 6 and 17 years old at-risk of neurodevelopmental conditions (N = 174, 114 males, mean age 10.72 +/- 2.21 years), and age-matched neurotypical controls (N = 27, 12 males, mean age 10.65 +/- 2.07 years), we identified a multivariate association, or latent variable, between resting-state functional connectivity and psychopathology. We extensively benchmarked this latent construct to develop a more parsimonious account of childhood psychopathology though an analytical framework spanning biological maps, brain connectivity, and behaviour. Participant-level expression of this latent brain-behaviour association differed by diagnostic burden and symptomatology, and pre-empted longitudinal psychopathology. Whilst diagnostic status was useful for interpretation, the latent construct transcended traditional diagnostic borders, revealing a neurotypical-neurodivergent continuum. The relationship between functional connectivity and neurodevelopmental psychopathology was circumscribed by functional connectivity networks (visual, fronto-parietal, and dorsal attention) and cytoarchitectonic class (primary/secondary sensory and primary sensory cortices). The latent variable aligned with magnetoencephalography-defined electrophysiological alpha, high-gamma, and theta frequency bands, and was enriched across cortical distributions of astrocytes and excitatory neurones. The connectivity signature was significantly aligned with the archetypal sensorimotor-to-association axis and validated in an independent sample of pre-adolescents (N = 3504), with the strongest alignment with the principal component of gene expression and myelination and were relatively less enriched in cortical regions related to language, indicating a protective effect, and more positively enriched in regions related to executive functioning, conferring greater risk of psychopathology. Together, our findings suggest that the predictive link between functional connectivity and common symptoms of neurodevelopmental psychopathology are circumscribed by underlying macroscale anatomical, functional, and cognitive-related hierarchies.

">Structure-guided design of a targeted autoantibody degrader for neurologic disease</a></h4>

              
                Despite rapid progress in the diagnosis of autoantibody-mediated neurologic diseases, standard-of-care therapeutic options remain limited to nonspecific immunosuppression. Here, we report an alternative therapeutic strategy using targeted protein degradation to eliminate pathogenic autoantibodies while leaving the rest of the immune system intact. We previously discovered autoimmune vitamin B12 central deficiency (ABCD), a neurologic condition in which autoantibodies targeting the transcobalamin receptor (CD320) impair the transport of cobalamin (B12) from the blood into the central nervous system (CNS). Combining scanning alanine mutagenesis by phage display, cryo-electron microscopy, and computational modeling, we elucidated a highly conserved anti-CD320 epitope and defined the structural determinants of antigen-autoantibody binding. Next, we synthesized a lysosome-targeting chimera (LYTAC) comprising the lysosome targeting glycan, triGalNAc, fused to the antigenic epitope of CD320 as autoantibody bait. In vitro, this LYTAC promoted the specific lysosomal internalization and extracellular clearance of anti-CD320, restoring homeostatic cellular uptake of B12. In a passive transfer mouse model of ABCD, LYTAC treatment rapidly cleared anti-CD320 from circulation and prevented penetration of anti-CD320 into the CNS. These findings uncover the mechanism of autoantibody-antigen binding in ABCD and demonstrate targeted autoantibody degradation as a therapeutic strategy that may be generalizable to other autoimmune neurologic diseases.

">Two-brain states during collaborative drawing reflect leader-follower dynamics in intergenerational dyads</a></h4>

              
                Engaging with others in social scenarios can result in the alignment of brain activity between individuals. Dyadic (i.e., hyperscanning) studies typically estimate average region-specific levels of connectivity between brains (as opposed to within brains) across a given task to quantify brain activity alignment. This approach assumes symmetric interactions with equal and mutual adaptation from both dyad members, excluding asymmetric (e.g., leader-follower) contexts. Such approaches also obscure spatial dynamics (i.e., relationship between different brain regions) and temporal dynamics during unfolding interactions. To overcome these challenges, we took a data-driven approach to quantify within- and between-brain connectivity during collaborative drawing among dyads. Specifically, we used sliding windows and Riemannian-geometry-based k-means clustering to identify recurrent two-brain states while 61 dyads drew alone and together at 6 weekly timepoints. Thirty dyads comprised young adults only (same generation) and 31 dyads comprised one older and one younger individual (intergenerational). We identified 7 two-brain states, 3 of which were specific to real (not pseudo) dyads. One two-brain state showed convincing evidence of sensitivity to collaboration context: During collaborative drawing, low-to-medium between-brain connectivity and prominent within-brain connectivity in bilateral IFG in a single dyad member arose for longer periods in intergenerational than same generation dyads. No two-brain state showed evidence of longitudinal changes across sessions. These findings inform recent accounts of neural dynamics that emphasise the complementary roles of within-brain and between-brain connectivity. Furthermore, they suggest that state-based analyses can inform neural dynamics in a way not captured by traditional analysis techniques.

">Distinct neural modes carry information about grasp force and phase in the sensorimotor cortex</a></h4>

              
                Humans perform a variety of complex hand movements to manipulate objects, requiring precise control of changing forces. Understanding the role of sensorimotor cortex and the cortical dynamics underlying these actions is crucial for developing interventions that restore dexterous hand function after injury or disease. In this study, two individuals with tetraplegia resulting from cervical spinal cord injury attempted a series of isometric grasps. Neural activity was recorded from the motor and somatosensory cortices using intracortical microelectrode arrays while participants attempted to exert a static force or to ramp force up and down. Despite their inability to execute movement, and with limited afferent input, the spiking activity in motor and somatosensory cortex was modulated with the task. Within the neural response we identified independent neural modes - distinct patterns of population-level neural activity - that were informative about both the timing and magnitude of the force. Moreover, distinct neural modes were observed during static and dynamic grasping conditions, suggesting independent control schemes for maintaining and changing forces. These modes were related to phases of the task, including the onset, offset, holding periods, as well as phases of increasing and decreasing force. These results will inform the design of intracortical brain-computer interface (iBCI) systems that can leverage these naturally occurring patterns of grasp and force control to restore dexterous hand function.

">Astrocytes mediate a positive feedback loop for oxytocin</a></h4>

              
                Social interactions are critical for well-being and survival. Oxytocin neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus help regulate social behaviors in many species, and respond to social stimuli to promote pro-social interactions. Here, we show that chronic social isolation reduced production of oxytocin peptide, and led to a delay in the onset of huddling behavior upon resocialization in male mice. Exogenous oxytocin treatment prevented both the behavioral and molecular effects of social deprivation. Using conditional knockouts, we found that oxytocin-induced oxytocin expression was mediated by local hypothalamic astrocytes. Oxytocin signaling in astrocytes upregulated the expression of a retinoic acid-synthesizing enzyme Aldh1a1, and retinoic acid increased oxytocin expression. These findings reveal a mechanism in which astrocytes can sense and control neuropeptide levels to influence social behaviors.

">Neural subspace reorganization reflects value-based decision making</a></h4>

              
                Value-based decision making requires maintaining and comparing multiple option representations associated with different values. Then, the chosen option must be communicated to downstream regions to drive behavior. The neural circuits involved in value-based decisions are increasingly well understood, but less understood is how decisions shape option representations. We recorded from lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), a central hub for transforming options into actions, while non-human primates (NHPs) held two sequentially presented option-value pairs (spatial targets and abstract reward cues) in working memory, then chose the option with the higher value. This revealed how decisions dynamically reorganize option representations in LPFC. We found that, once decisions could be made, representations of chosen and unchosen options rotated into orthogonal subspaces and the chosen option representation was expanded. Before decisions, the first- and second-presented options were maintained separately. After decisions, the chosen option was rotated into a subspace with a consistent representation of the prescribed action, regardless of its presentation order. This suggests a mechanism for value-based decisions where the decision drives a neural subspace reorganization that facilitates selective and efficient readout of the chosen action.

                Throughout this paper our study focuses on transformation semigroups. These kinds of semigroups are the corner stone of semigroup theory. This is because every semigroup is isomorphic to transformation semigroup. The (total) transformation monoid T X n on a finite set X n = { 1 , 2 , … , n } where n ≥ 0 , n ∈ Z , is a semigroup of mapping that takes a set X n into itself, under the operation of composition of mapping with identity I X n . In this paper, we use an algebraic method for considering the monoid T ( Fl ) n ( G ) , where an independence algebra ( Fl ) n ( G ) is a disjointed union of sets of the form G x i for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n . Firstly, particular attention is paid to find the isomorphism between T ( Fl ) n ( G ) and the endomorphism monoid End ( F ℓ ) n ( G ) . Secondly, the embeddedness of T ( Fl ) n ( G ) in (full) wreath product of T n by G n has been found. Finally, the description of Green’s relation of T ( Fl ) n ( G ) has been provided.

                <p>There is a critical need for robust and reliable preclinical models for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to better understand pathophysiological mechanisms and support the development of novel treatments. The single prolonged stress (SPS) model has been previously utilized to investigate various acute behavioral effects and stress hormone changes in rodents. This study paired anxiety-like and social behavioral evaluations with corticosterone assessment as a complementary physiological biomarker to determine the presence of robust and intervenable phenotypes following SPS. Sprague Dawley rats (<I>N</I> = 36, 30 male and 6 female) received SPS model induction (e.g., restraint with odorant, forced-swim, diethyl ether exposure, and isolation) or control handling. Serum corticosterone and behavioral assessments, including the open field test (OFT) and a social motivation test (SMT), were investigated at 1 and 2 weeks following SPS induction. This SPS model did not induce anxiety-like or locomotive differences assessed in the OFT (<I>p</I>'s &gt; 0.05). Similarly, SPS did not appear to alter social preference or avoidance in the SMT (<I>p</I>'s &gt; 0.05), as groups had similar novel social and novel object interaction levels. SPS-paired cue re-exposure did not unmask group differences in these behaviors. Corticosterone levels were also unaltered between groups in the weeks following SPS (<I>p</I> = 0.178). In the absence of other stressors or modifications, the null behavioral and corticosterone findings in the weeks following SPS suggest that this SPS protocol may not reliably produce adequately robust or intervenable phenotypes.</p>

                Background Generation Alpha (born after 2010) requires pedagogical approaches aligned with their digital-native characteristics and Society 5.0 demands. Although digital integration advances in curriculum, many Indonesian vocational schools persist with teacher-centered methods that prioritize technical skills while neglecting essential soft skills teamwork, creativity, and adaptability. This study developed and validated the Alpha Generation Learning Style Scale (ALSS), the first instrument measuring Generation Alpha’s integrated learning preferences in digital vocational settings. Grounded in social constructivism, connectivism, heutagogy, and cybergogy, ALSS comprises four interconnected dimensions: Visual-Digital Learning (VDL), Collaborative Learning (CL), Self-Directed Learning (SDL), and Gamified Learning (GL). Methods Using Cantabrana et al.’s (2019) four-phase framework, the study executed expert validation (n=5), pre-testing (n=35), and empirical testing with 285 stratified vocational students using Classical Test Theory and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). Results ALSS demonstrated excellent content validity (S-CVI/Ave = 0.981; Aiken’s V > 0.85) and high internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.96). CFA confirmed a strong second-order factor structure (CFI = 0.996; TLI = 0.996; RMSEA = 0.020; SRMR = 0.030), with all dimensions significantly loading onto ALSS (λ = 0.59–0.65, p < 0.001). Self-Directed Learning showed the strongest influence (0.645), followed by Collaborative Learning (0.640) and Visual-Digital Learning (0.627), explaining 35–42% of variance per dimension. Convergent validity (AVE = 0.821–0.864), discriminant validity, and composite reliability (CR > 0.96) were confirmed. Conclusions ALSS is a valid, reliable instrument capturing Generation Alpha’s technology-mediated learning identity. It provides an evidence-based diagnostic framework for personalizing Cooperative Project-Based Learning (Co-PjBL) and transforming Indonesian vocational education toward adaptive, student-centered methods. Integration with computational thinking skills including algorithmic thinking, decomposition, pattern recognition, and abstraction strengthens pedagogical effectiveness. This approach aligns TVET with Society 5.0 demands, enhancing preparation of digitally proficient, computationally literate, collaborative, and autonomous learners.

                Background Behavioral expression rarely depends on a single determinant; instead, it emerges from the convergence of neural architecture, neurohumoral state, and contextual input. The lordosis reflex in female rats is a well-characterized model requiring intact hypothalamic circuitry, ovarian steroid signaling, and somatosensory stimulation. Despite decades of empirical study, these dependencies have largely been described qualitatively, without a formal specification of how multiple necessary factors combine to permit or suppress behavioral execution. Methods We apply the ARCH × Φ framework to lordosis, modeling behavioral expression as Φ × (A × D × C), a multiplicative interaction among neural archetype (A), neurohumoral drive (D), and contextual sensory input (C), scaled by a threshold field (Φ) reflecting arousal, neuromodulatory tone, stress, and developmental state. Drawing on lesion, hormone-manipulation, and sensory-deprivation studies, we examine three canonical necessity tests: disruption of the ventromedial hypothalamus (A), ovariectomy without neurohumoral replacement (D), and removal of somatosensory context (C). We additionally perform a quantitative reanalysis of published lordosis quotient data from 10, contrasting additive, threshold-linear, and multiplicative threshold models. Results Across necessity tests, lordosis fails when any single component is reduced below threshold, even when remaining components are intact, supporting conjunctive necessity rather than additive sufficiency. Quantitative fits to classic dose–response data reveal sharp threshold transitions in expression probability that are poorly captured by additive models but well described by multiplicative formulations. Notably, probability of expression saturates rapidly once threshold is crossed, whereas magnitude measures such as lordosis duration continue to increase with hormone dose, demonstrating a dissociation between execution probability and response robustness. Progesterone selectively shifts expression probability more than magnitude, consistent with threshold modulation. Conclusions Lordosis provides a canonical testbed for conjunctive, threshold-governed behavioral control. ARCH × Φ formalizes behavioral convergence, yields falsifiable predictions, and establishes a quantitative framework for statistical model comparison.

                This study investigates the key factors influencing the strengthening empowerment within environmental volunteer networks, with a focus on Thailand’s sustainability context. Environmental volunteer groups, such as Trash Hero Thailand, play an increasingly critical role in addressing ecological challenges, yet their effectiveness is shaped by complex interactions among external factors, individual and community needs, and achievements. A quantitative methods design employed a structured questionnaire distributed among 199 participants from Trash Hero Thailand followers and local volunteer groups in Rayong and Chonburi Provinces, Thailand. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used to analyze relationships among variables. Findings reveal that external factors, including political, economic, social, technological, environmental, and legal dimensions, significantly impact strenthening empowerment both directly and indirectly through achievement. Achievement was confirmed as a strong mediator, highlighting stratab;tegy, organizational structure, and communication style as critical success dimensions. Interestingly, needs negatively influenced strengthening empowerment, suggesting that unmet or excessive needs may undermine self-sufficiency unless translated into concrete achievements. The study concludes that sustainable empowerment requires a balance of external support, organizational achievement, and capacity building. Recommendations include achievement-driven empowerment strategies, graduated support models to reduce dependency, and adaptive monitoring systems. These insights contribute to advancing resilient, self-sustaining environmental volunteer networks aligned with national sustainability goals.

                Background Electronic payment methods have experienced tremendous global growth in recent years, facilitating numerous commercial transactions and making them more convenient and efficient, thereby saving time and money. This is particularly true for commercial banks, which can improve their financial and operational performance and reduce risks if used correctly. Aim The objective of this study was to examine the effect of electronic payment systems on reducing liquidity risk in Iraqi commercial banks. To achieve this objective and test its hypotheses, a descriptive-analytical approach was used. The theoretical frameworks related to electronic payment methods and banking liquidity risk were reviewed. Methods The effect of electronic payment methods on the liquidity of Iraqi banks was measured by applying the ARDL model using Eviews 10 software. Results Evidence from econometric analysis suggests a direct relationship between the total number of electronic cards and the bank liquidity risk index, which contradicts theoretical frameworks and empirical studies. The analysis also showed an inverse relationship between the number of electronic wallets and the liquidity risk index, which aligns with economic theory. Conclusion Despite the spread of electronic payment methods in the world, their role in the Iraqi economy is still limited, which necessitates working to enhance customer confidence in the banking sector and providing financial and banking awareness programs to educate them about banking services and how to use them, as well as reducing withdrawals and renewals of personal accounts, which helps banks to provide the necessary liquidity to sustain their operations.

                Background Flooding in rural areas, particularly during the northeast monsoon in Malaysia, is common; however, urban flooding, especially in densely populated areas, is unexpected. The 2021 Taman Sri Muda flood was unusual, due to an eruption of heavy rainfall from a tropical depression and the inadequacy of the drainage infrastructure to manage the water influx, further aggravated by upstream development. This challenge has severe impact on the disaster response specifically humanitarian logistics operations. Since this is the worst after 1995 flood, where the population of this area has been greater after 7 years, this study attempts to explores why the logistics issues were reported as slow and uncoordinated and to explores the critical success factors affecting disaster relief logistics. Methods This study has conducted a semi-structured interview with the Social Welfare Department officers involved directly in the distribution of aid relief during the flood disaster. NVivo software was used to analyse the data thematically. Results Five important factors were found to have an impact on logistics performance during the flood response which is the 5M consist of man (personnel), material (humanitarian aid), mechanism (coordination), machinery (asset) and monetary. To provide an organized explanation of their impact, the findings were later linked with the 5M framework. Conclusions By applying the 5M framework to an actual flood disaster, this study provides new insights which assist Malaysia plan for disaster logistics more effectively.

                Background As lung cancer treatment has progressed, there has been an increase in awareness of the short- and long-term adverse effects of targeted cancer therapies of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, particularly cardiovascular toxicities. Methods The current study assessed the potential drug-drug interactions using interaction checkers (IBM Micromedex and Drugs.com). Molecular docking was employed to further investigate the involvement of human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) proteins to elucidate their potential interactions and their underlying mechanisms. Results A total of 74 pharmacokinetic and 105 pharmacodynamic interactions were detected between tyrosine kinase inhibitors and cardiovascular drugs, along with a report on the severity and level of documentation. A considerable fraction of molecular modelling outcomes concurred with information from drug-drug interaction checkers. The binding energies of tyrosine kinase inhibitors with hERG and PXR were high, indicating significant interactions. The cardiovascular drug class encompasses calcium channel blockers, antiarrhythmic medicines, and statins, which were observed to exhibit synergistic interactions. The identification of these potential drug-drug interactions involving CYP3A4, P-gp, and hERG proteins can be utilized in therapy optimization in clinical settings. Conclusion This study will aid clinicians in designing safe dosage regimens for patients with lung cancer. In cases where patients have multiple comorbidities, it is essential to study the clinical aspects to design efficient chemotherapy and manage adverse effects and toxicities.

                Background Dysregulation of the HPG axis in PCOS causes increased frequency and amplitude of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) pulsatility in the hypothalamus. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the KISS1 gene may be associated with altered neuroendocrine signaling in PCOS. The present study aims to evaluate the association between two KISS1 polymorphisms (rs4889 and rs5780218), their haplotypes, and the odds of PCOS in Indonesian women. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted at Yasmin Clinic, dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital, Indonesia, involving 60 women with PCOS and 60 healthy controls. Hormonal levels were assessed using ELISA, and genomic DNA was analyzed by Sanger sequencing. Demographic data were compared using independent t-tests, and chi-square tests were used for genotype and allele frequency analysis. Results The genotypic distribution of rs4889 was significantly different between the PCOS and control groups (p<0.05), where the distribution of mutant genotype GG was higher in PCOS than in control (18.3% and 1.7%, respectively). The allele distribution of rs4889 and rs5782018 KISS1 SNPs were significantly different between both groups (p<0.01 and p<0.05, respectively). The rs4889 polymorphism was significantly different between the PCOS and control groups for the codominant and recessive models (p<0.01). Moreover, the rs5780218 polymorphism was significantly different between the PCOS and control groups for the codominant and dominant models (p<0.05). From the haplotype analysis, the G-CT haplotype was significantly different, with an OR value of 2.57 (1.33–4.96, p=0.0057). Conclusions KISS1 rs4889 and rs5780218 polymorphisms, as well as the G–CT haplotype, are associated with increased odds of PCOS in Indonesian women. These findings support a potential role of upstream neuroendocrine genetic variation in PCOS susceptibility; however, causal inferences cannot be drawn from this cross-sectional study.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1379/v2?src=rss">Capturing Material Thermal Responses under RF-Induced Hyperthermia: An Experimental Imaging Database [version 2; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background thermography is widely used to quantify surface temperature distributions during radiofrequency heating in biomedical, material, and industrial contexts. However, reproducible datasets capturing thermal responses of biological and inert materials under controlled RF excitation are scarce. This limitation hinders the validation of electromagnetic–thermal models, the benchmarking of image-based temperature estimation techniques, and the development of super-resolution and reconstruction algorithms. To address this gap, we generated a curated thermal image dataset that documents how different materials absorb and dissipate RF energy within an ISM band. Methods We constructed a controlled RF heating system consisting of a signal generator, a 6 W power amplifier, a circulator with matched load, and a unidirectional applicator antenna operating near 2.5 GHz. Biological tissues (pork, beef, chicken) and inert materials (foam, wood, phantom) were exposed to continuous-wave RF excitation while surface temperature was monitored using three infrared cameras with low, medium, and high resolution. Thermal images were acquired under systematically varied conditions, including RF power (0–5.5 dBm, extended to 6.5 dBm for low-loss materials), camera-to-sample distance (20–30 cm), and observation angle (0°, 30°, 60°). Each recording was captured after stabilization periods to ensure repeatability, and all images were exported as calibrated per-pixel temperature maps. Metadata documenting material type, acquisition geometry, and temperature range were embedded following a standardized naming structure. A complementary data-augmentation pipeline generated resolution-specific synthetic variations, yielding additional controlled perturbations for algorithm development. Conclusions The dataset comprises 3,600 original and 600 augmented thermal images spanning nine material categories and three spatial resolutions. Its standardized acquisition protocol and comprehensive metadata enable reproducible studies on RF–material interactions, temperature-field reconstruction, geometric correction, and super-resolution enhancement. This resource is expected to support research in computer vision, hyperthermia modelling, and the development of machine learning methods for thermal imaging under controlled RF exposure.

Biomedical systems span multiple spatial scales, encompassing tiny functional units to entire organs. Interpreting these systems through image segmentation requires the effective propagation and integration of information across different scales. However, most existing segmentation methods are optimised for single-scale imaging modalities, limiting their ability to capture and analyse small functional units throughout complete human organs. To facilitate multiscale biomedical image segmentation, we utilised Hierarchical Phase-Contrast Tomography (HiP-CT), an advanced imaging modality that can generate 3D multiscale datasets from high-resolution volumes of interest (VOIs) at ca. 1 μm/voxel to whole-organ scans at ca. 20 μm/voxel. Building on these hierarchical multiscale datasets, we developed a deep learning-based segmentation pipeline that is initially trained on manually annotated high-resolution HiP-CT data and then extended to lower-resolution whole-organ scans using pseudo-labels generated from high-resolution predictions and multiscale image registration. As a case study, we focused on glomeruli in human kidneys, benchmarking four 3D deep learning models for biomedical image segmentation on a manually annotated high-resolution dataset extracted from VOIs, at 2.58 to ca. 5 μm/voxel, of four human kidneys. Among them, nnUNet demonstrated the best performance, achieving an average test Dice score of 0.906, and was subsequently used as the baseline model for multiscale segmentation in the pipeline. Applying this pipeline to two low-resolution full-organ data at ca. 25 μm/voxel, the model identified 1,019,890 and 231,179 glomeruli in a 62-year-old donor without kidney diseases and a 94-year-old hypertensive donor, enabling comprehensive morphological analyses, including cortical spatial statistics and glomerular distributions, which aligned well with previous anatomical studies. Our results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed pipeline for segmenting small functional units in multiscale bioimaging datasets and suggest its broader applicability to other organ systems.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013918">Cluster dispersal shapes microbial diversity during community assembly</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Loïc Marrec, Sonja Lehtinen</p>

Identifying the drivers of diversity remains a central challenge in microbial ecology. In microbiota, within-community diversity is often linked to host health, which makes it all the more important to understand. Since many communities assemble de novo, microbial dispersal plays a critical role in shaping community structure during the early stages of assembly. While theoretical models typically assume microbes disperse individually, this overlooks cases where microbes disperse in clusters, such as, for example, during host feeding. Here, we investigate how cluster dispersal impacts species richness, between-community dissimilarity, and species abundance in the initial steps of microbial community assembly. We developed a model in which microbes disperse from a pool into communities as clusters and then replicate locally. Using both analytical and numerical approaches, we show that cluster dispersal promotes community homogenization by increasing within-community richness and reducing dissimilarity across communities, even at low dispersal rates. Moreover, it modulates the influence of local selection on microbial community assembly and, consequently, on species abundance. Our results demonstrate that cluster dispersal has distinct effects from simply increasing the dispersal rate. This work reveals new evidence for the role of cluster dispersal in the early dynamics of microbial community assembly.

                <p>by Anna Shafer-Skelton, Timothy F. Brady, John T. Serences</p>

Understanding 3D representations of spatial information, particularly in naturalistic scenes, remains a significant challenge in vision science. This is largely because of conceptual difficulties in disentangling higher-level 3D information from co-occurring features and cues (e.g., the 3D shape of a scene image is necessarily defined by “low-level” spatial frequency and orientation information). Recent work has employed newer models and analysis techniques that attempt to mitigate these difficulties within a model-comparison framework. For example, one such study reported 3D-surface features were uniquely present in areas OPA, PPA, and MPA/RSC (areas typically referred to as ‘scene-selective’), above and beyond a Gabor-wavelet baseline model. Here, we tested whether these findings generalized to a new stimulus set that, on average, dissociated static Gabor-wavelet baseline features from 3D scene-surface features. Surprisingly, we found evidence that a Gabor-wavelet baseline model—commonly thought of as a “low-level” or “2D” model—better fit voxel responses in areas OPA, PPA and MPA/RSC compared to a model with 3D-surface information. We highlight that this difference in results could be due to differences in the baseline conditions used across studies. These findings emphasize that much of the information in “scene-selective” regions—potentially even information about 3D surfaces—may be in the form of spatial frequency and orientation information often considered 2D or low-level. Disentangling lower-level and higher-level visual information is a continuing fundamental challenge for model-comparison approaches in visual cognition, and it motivates future work investigating which visual features could cue higher-level properties in our real-world visual experience—both within and beyond current model comparison frameworks.

                <p>by Sean R. Maulhardt, Alec Solway, Caroline J. Charpentier</p>

When receiving a reward after a sequence of multiple events, how do we determine which event caused the reward? This problem, known as temporal credit assignment, can be difficult for humans to solve given the temporal uncertainty in the environment. Research to date has attempted to isolate dimensions of delay and reward during decision-making, but algorithmic solutions to temporal learning problems and the effect of uncertainty on learning remain underexplored. To further our understanding, we adapted a reward learning task that creates a temporal credit assignment problem by combining sequentially delayed rewards, intervening events, and varying uncertainty via the amount of information presented during feedback. Using computational modeling, two learning strategies were developed: an eligibility trace, whereby previously selected actions are updated as a function of the temporal sequence, and a tabular update, whereby only systematically related past actions (rather than unrelated intervening events) are updated. We hypothesized that reduced information uncertainty would correlate with increased use of the tabular strategy, given the model’s capacity to incorporate additional feedback information. Both models effectively learned the task, and predicted choices made by participants (N = 142) as well as specific behavioral signatures of credit assignment. Consistent with our hypothesis, the tabular model outperformed the eligibility model under low information uncertainty, as evidenced by more accurate predictions of participants’ behavior and an increase in tabular weight. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms implemented by humans to solve temporal credit assignment and adapt their strategy in varying environments.

                <p>by Emily Liu, Jiaqi Zhang, Caroline Uhler</p>

Advances in sequencing technologies have enhanced the understanding of gene regulation in cells. In particular, Perturb-seq has enabled high-resolution profiling of the transcriptomic response to genetic perturbations at the single-cell level. This understanding has implications in functional genomics and potentially for identifying therapeutic targets. Various computational models have been developed to predict perturbational effects. While deep learning models excel at interpolating observed perturbational data, they tend to overfit in the lack of enough data and may not generalize well to unseen perturbations. In contrast, mechanistic models, such as linear causal models based on gene regulatory networks, hold greater potential for extrapolation, as they encapsulate regulatory information that can predict responses to unseen perturbations. However, their application has been limited to small studies due to overly simplistic assumptions, making them less effective in handling noisy, large-scale single-cell data. We propose a hybrid approach that combines a mechanistic causal model with variational deep learning, termed Single Cell Causal Variational Autoencoder (SCCVAE). The mechanistic model employs a learned regulatory network to represent perturbational changes as shift interventions that propagate through the learned network. SCCVAE integrates this mechanistic causal model into a variational autoencoder, generating rich, comprehensive transcriptomic responses. Our results indicate that SCCVAE exhibits superior performance over current state-of-the-art baselines for extrapolating to predict unseen perturbational responses. Additionally, for the observed perturbations, the latent space learned by SCCVAE allows for the identification of functional perturbation modules and simulation of single-gene knockdown experiments of varying penetrance, presenting a robust tool for interpreting and interpolating perturbational responses at the single-cell level.

                <p>by Xin Zhou, Audrey Hilk, Norma V. Solis, Nancy Scott, Christopher Zajac, Scott G. Filler, Anna Selmecki</p>

Drug resistance is a critical challenge in treating life-threatening fungal infections. Here, we uncover a mechanism of acquired azole resistance in <i>Candida albicans</i> through mutations in <i>CAP1</i>, encoding a conserved fungal transcription factor that mediates the oxidative stress response. We analyzed 300 clinical isolates and identified 25 distinct <i>CAP1</i> missense or nonsense mutations, with many occurring within the DNA-binding domain. We identified two nearly identical <i>CAP1</i> heterozygous nonsense mutations, one in an isolate obtained from a bloodstream infection and one in a population of cells undergoing adaptation to fluconazole in vitro. Both <i>CAP1</i> nonsense mutations resulted in loss of the C-terminal nuclear export signal, leading to nuclear retention of Cap1 and subsequent activation of genes associated with the oxidative stress response and drug transport. The <i>CAP1</i> C-terminal truncations conferred significant fitness advantages in the presence of fluconazole, both in vitro and in a murine model of candidiasis. Strikingly, we discovered a therapeutic vulnerability: azole concentrations above the minimal inhibitory concentration were fungicidal to mutants with the <i>CAP1</i> C-terminal truncation. The fungicidal effect was attributed to both elevated azole-induced reactive oxygen species and a compromised oxidative stress response in Cap1-truncated cells. Our results provide novel characterization of de novo <i>CAP1</i> point mutations emerging in both laboratory and clinical contexts, elucidate the mechanisms underlying Cap1-regulated stress responses, and reveal a potential therapeutic target for overcoming drug resistance in <i>C. albicans</i> infections.

Hijacking of host DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways to facilitate virus replication is broadly conserved amongst diverse viral families. It has been well established that the HIV-1 accessory protein Vpr induces constitutive DDR signaling and G2/M cell cycle arrest, but the virologic function of this activity remains unclear. Here, we use a combination of functional, pharmacologic, biochemical, and genetic approaches to establish that virion-associated and de novo Vpr proteins induce DDR responses that trigger global epigenetic remodeling and activation of transcription programs to enhance HIV-1 promoter activity during acute infection and reactivation from latency. Functional, genetic, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation experiments reveal that Vpr segregates into two functionally discrete pools—a multimeric pool in the nucleus associated with chromatin and a monomeric pool in the cytoplasm associated with a host E3-ubiquitin ligase. Vpr-induced DDR and epigenetic remodeling activities are present in common HIV-1 subtypes circulating globally and in patient-derived isolates.

                <p>by Morgan E. McNellis, Gonzalo González-Del Pino, Juan A. Serrano-Jiménez, Emily R. Forster, A. Ioana Stoica, Ekaterina E. Heldwein, Aimee Shen</p>

The clinically significant pathogen <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> lacks the transmembrane nutrient germinant receptors conserved in almost all spore-forming bacteria. Instead, <i>C. difficile</i> initiates spore germination using a unique mechanism that requires two signals: a bile acid germinant and a co-germinant, which can be either an amino acid or a divalent cation. While two soluble pseudoproteases, CspC and CspA, were initially identified as the germinant and co-germinant receptors, respectively, in <i>C. difficile</i>, we previously identified residues in an unstructured region of CspC that regulate the sensitivity of <i>C. difficile</i> spores to both signals. However, the mechanism by which CspC transduces these signals remained unclear. Here, we demonstrate that CspC forms a stable complex with CspA and determine the crystal structure of the CspC:CspA heterodimer. The structure reveals extensive interactions along the binding interface, including direct interactions between the unstructured region of CspC and CspA. Using structure-function analyses, we identify CspC:CspA interactions that regulate the sensitivity of <i>C. difficile</i> spores to germinant signals and show that CspA regulates the response of <i>C. difficile</i> to not only co-germinant but also germinant signals. While we show that CspA can form a homodimer and determine its crystal structure, CspA homodimerization appears unimportant for <i>C. difficile</i> spore germination. Collectively, our analyses establish the CspC:CspA heterodimer, rather than its individual constituents, as a critical signaling node for sensing both germinant and co-germinant signals. They also suggest a new mechanistic model for how <i>C. difficile</i> transduces germinant signals, which could guide the development of therapeutics against this important pathogen.

Oviposition holds crucial significance for insect reproduction. Nevertheless, the research on the neural conduction mechanism of oviposition is still rather limited in most agricultural pests. Here, we demonstrate that the conserved Kainate receptors (KARs) expressed in the glutamatergic neurons (GNs) and the ovipositor neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) regulate the oviposition behavior in <i>Bactrocera dorsalis</i>. We identified two KARs (Grik2b and Grik2c), which control the oviposition behavior by influencing both oviposition preference and egg-laying quantity. Protein-ligand interaction indicated that glutamate serves as the neurotransmitter of Grik2b and Grik2c. Knockdown glutamate-coding genes adversely impacted oviposition preference and egg-laying quantity. Specific knockdown Grik2b (or Grik2c) in the GNs and NMJs could respectively influence oviposition preference and egg-laying quantity. Finally, inhibitors of KARs were screened for their ability to inhibit oviposition. Our study provides strong supporting evidence that a novel neural conduction mechanism for oviposition by uncovering the diverse roles of KARs and provides potential molecular target controlling insect oviposition.

                <p>by Ye-Eun Son, Carlos Pérez-Arques, Joseph Heitman</p>

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health threat emerging through microbe adaptation, driven by genetic variation, genome plasticity or epigenetic processes. In this study, we investigated how the <i>Mucor circinelloides</i> species complex adapts to the antifungal natural product FK506, which binds to FKBP12 and inhibits calcineurin-dependent hyphal growth. In <i>Mucor bainieri</i>, most FK506-resistant isolates (90%) were found to be unstable and transient, readily reverting to being drug sensitive when passaged without drug, and with no associated DNA mutations. In half of the isolates (50%), FK506-resistance was conferred by RNAi-dependent epimutation in which small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) silenced the <i>fkbA</i> encoding FKBP12 post-transcriptionally. In contrast, most of the remaining FK506-resistant isolates (40%) were found to have undergone heterochromatin-mediated silencing via H3K9 dimethylation, transcriptionally repressing <i>fkbA</i> and neighboring genes. In these heterochromatic epimutants, only minimal enrichment of siRNA to the <i>fkbA</i> locus was observed, but in three of the four examples, siRNA was significantly enriched at a locus distant from <i>fkbA</i>. A similar mechanism operates in <i>Mucor atramentarius</i>, where FK506 resistance was mediated by ectopic heterochromatin silencing of <i>fkbA</i> and associated genes with siRNA spreading across the region. Heterochromatin-mediated <i>fkbA</i> epimutants exhibited stability during in vivo infection, suggesting epimutation could impact pathogenesis. These findings reveal that antifungal resistance arising through distinct, transient epimutation pathways involving RNAi or heterochromatin, highlighting adaptive AMR strategies employed by ubiquitous eukaryotic microbes.

                <p>by Katie L. Flanagan, Sabra L. Klein</p>

Differences in immunity in males and females throughout the life span manifest as differences in susceptibility to chronic diseases, infections, cancer, and responses to therapeutic interventions such as immunomodulatory drugs and vaccines. Sex steroids and sex chromosome-linked immune response genes have major roles in driving these differences, but the cells and signaling pathways governing these are disease-specific and often not known. Such knowledge is required to better understand sex differences in disease incidence and clinical course, and to provide treatments tailored to sex-divergent pathways underlying specific diseases. This Essay explores the major areas where further research is required to determine sex-differential mechanisms.

<p>Chronic trigeminal neuropathic pain shows greater incidence and severity in females, yet most preclinical studies use males.

Males exhibited greater neuronal adaptation, suggesting sex-specific mechanisms in pain processing.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Chronic trigeminal neuropathic pain is caused by a lesion, damage, or trauma to the trigeminal sensory system. The pain affects female individuals with higher incidence and greater severity compared with males. Despite a strong sex bias in this clinical condition, the majority of preclinical experimental studies of trigeminal neuropathic pain have been conducted in males. This study investigated sex differences in the number of ΔFosB and FosB immunoreactive cells, as markers of neuronal adaptation following infraorbital nerve chronic constriction injury (ION-CCI). Sex differences in ΔFosB and FosB expression were identified in infra-orbital recipient regions of laminae I-II of the medullary dorsal horn during the post-injury period. Three phases of altered expression were identified following ION-CCI: (1) an early phase 2 days after injury, (2) a transitional phase (7–14 days), and (3) a late phase (28+ days). Nerve-injured female rats had consistently lower levels of ΔFosB immunoreactive cells when compared with males and showed increased FosB expression during the early phase. In contrast, in males, the number of ΔFosB immunoreactive cells decreased significantly from the early phase to the transitional phase post-injury. However, by the late phase, ΔFosB expression in the superficial laminae of the medullary dorsal horn was significantly higher than in females. These data suggest that cellular adaptation in neurons in laminae I-II of the medullary dorsal horn in males is much greater than that in females, revealing one location at which the sex differences seen in the incidence and severity of trigeminal neuropathic pain might be mediated.</p>

                Sewage sludge (SS) management has evolved from conventional disposal practices toward resource-oriented and environmentally conscious solutions. This study investigates the thematic structure of global SS research, with a focus on green technological pathways for resource recovery and the environmental risks associated with SS utilisation. A systematic bibliometric approach was adopted using the Web of Science Core Collection, targeting publications from 2015 to 2024 that included the terms “sludge” AND (“recycl*” OR “reuse” OR “treatment” OR “reduc*” OR “management”) within their titles, abstracts, or keywords. The final dataset consisted of 12,666 eligible articles that met all screening criteria. VOSviewer (version 1.6.20) was used for science mapping, including keyword co-occurrence and cluster analysis. Six thematic clusters were identified, representing dominant research trajectories: (i) microbial processes for nutrient recovery, (ii) biological conversion to bioenergy, (iii) thermochemical transformation and material reuse, (iv) heavy metal bioavailability and ecological risk, (v) emerging contaminant (EC) fate and mitigation, and (vi) dye removal mechanisms. Results indicate a shift toward circular-economy-aligned SS management, emphasising bioconversion, hydrothermal technologies, and biochar valorisation. Research gaps relate to large-scale deployment, EC remediation, and commercialization constraints. The findings provide a structured knowledge base for guiding future research, policy formulation, and investment in sustainable sludge-to-resource systems.

                Background Classical fuzzy sets have been generalized to better model uncertainty, leading to developments such as intuitionistic, pythagorean, and fermatean fuzzy sets. fermatean fuzzy sets (ffss), characterized by the cube sum constraint on membership and non-membership degrees, provide a more flexible framework for handling complex uncertainty. bn-algebras are important algebraic structures with applications in logic and information theory. Methods This study integrates fermatean fuzzy sets with bn-algebras by introducing the notions of fermatean fuzzy subalgebras and fermatean fuzzy ideals. level cuts of fermatean fuzzy sets are defined and analyzed, and algebraic techniques are employed to investigate their structural properties. Results It is shown that fermatean fuzzy level subalgebras and fermatean fuzzy level ideals correspond to classical subalgebras and ideals of bn-algebras. several characterizations and closure properties are established, supported by illustrative examples and rigorous proofs. Conclusions The results demonstrate that fermatean fuzzy sets significantly enrich the theory of bn-algebras by accommodating higher degrees of uncertainty. this framework provides a solid theoretical foundation for further studies and potential applications in algebraic logic and uncertainty-based systems.

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Goniomonads are heterotrophic members of a major group of eukaryotes called Cryptista and branch sister to the photosynthetic Cryptophyta. Goniomonads are poorly investigated and have recently been reclassified, dividing a single genus into ten new genera. In single-gene phylogenies, all three freshwater genera branch in a monophyletic group distinct from marine goniomonads, suggesting that a single event led to goniomonads transitioning from marine to freshwater environments. Here, we use light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and single cell genomics to describe and determine the molecular phylogenetic placement of a new freshwater genus of goniomonad. Methods Light and scanning electron microscopy were used to validate the morphological characteristics of a new goniomonad. We used whole genome amplification to generate a goniomonad single-cell amplified genome. We reconstructed the phylogenetic placement of this goniomonad using single-gene and multi-gene analyses. Results We characterized and established a new genus of goniomonad, named Naiadagoniomonas ponderosa n. gen. n. sp. In single-gene phylogenetic analyses, N. ponderosa branches within the freshwater clade that forms the sister to Limnogoniomonas. In multi-gene phylogenetic analyses, N. ponderosa branches with the only other representative of goniomonads available. We recovered a fragmented but high-quality single-amplified genome including a complete circular-mapping mitochondrial genome. Conclusions We conclude that diverse goniomonads are likely present in freshwater environments and single-cell genomics is an excellent tool for probing their phylogenomic diversity and mitochondrial gene content.

                This study aims to develop, validate, and test the reliability of a social competency assessment instrument for proficient teachers in Indonesia. The development method adopts the ADDIE (Analyze, Design, Develop, Implement, and Evaluate) stages. Based on the analysis of teacher competency model documents, seven statement items were formulated using three social competency indicators representing the core abilities of proficient teachers. These items were validated by six experts and pilot-tested on teachers from various educational levels. Content validity results showed that all items were valid with Aiken-V values between 0.78 and 1.00. Intraclass correlation (ICC) analysis revealed an increase in inter-rater consistency from the validation stage to the revalidation stage, indicating high rater reliability (0.870). In the construct testing using CB-SEM, all items met the validity and reliability criteria, with loading factors of 0.765-0.930, Cronbach’s alpha of 0.798-0.895, composite reliability of 0.796-0.898, and AVE of 0.670-0.779. Discriminant validity was achieved (0.818-0.883), and the goodness-of-fit test showed a reasonable to very good model (SRMR = 0.032; NFI = 0.960; TLI = 0.934; CFI = 0.965). The Mann-Whitney U test showed no significant differences based on gender (p> 0.05). Thus, this instrument has been demonstrated to be valid, reliable, and inclusive, making it suitable for use in evaluating the social competence of proficient teachers in Indonesia.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Genomic sequencing leaves &gt;50% of dystonia-affected individuals without a diagnosis. Where DNA-oriented approaches remain insufficient, integrating multiomics is essential to advance genome interpretation. Herein, we incorporated RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from 167 patients with dystonia across a range of ages and presentations.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We leveraged an RNA-seq analysis pipeline, focused on the identification of expression and splicing aberrations, on RNA-seq from skin biopsies. The recruited patients had early-onset dystonia in 85.0%, non-focal dystonia in 92.2%, and coexisting features in 76.0%. Thirty-six patient samples with pre-identified variants (36/167, 21.6%) and 131 samples with no previously prioritized diagnostic candidates from genomic sequencing (131/167, 78.4%) were evaluated.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found that &gt;80% of dystonia-associated genes were detected by fibroblast RNA-seq. Expression and splicing aberration analyses produced a manageable number of significant RNA defects affecting dystonia-associated genes. The approach was especially successful in validating pathogenic effects of loss-of-function variants, with disease-relevant RNA-underexpression detected for 66.7% (10/15). Studying aberrant expression and splicing in the context of other pre-identified variant types yielded relevant results in 28.6% (6/21 samples). We obtained a 6.9% (9/131) diagnostic uplift for patients without prior candidates, all of whom exhibited combined dystonia with autosomal recessive inheritance. The new diagnoses from RNA-seq and genomic reanalysis were based on previously neglected splice-region (3/9) and deep(er) intronic (6/9) variants. For the observed events, integration of new machine-learning scores predicted corresponding aberrant gene expression in the brain.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Fibroblast-based RNA-seq in our selected cohort improved variant interpretation and offered a modest yield in patients without prior candidate variants. ANN NEUROL 2026</p>

                Roederer et al. analyzed serum neutralization breadth after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and infection. While most broadly neutralizing activity was associated with RBD-specific antibodies, natural infection and vaccine breakthrough were linked to the elicitation of additional fusion-peptide-specific antibodies, which were enriched among the most potent broad neutralizers.

                Dai et al. show that MS therapeutics paradoxically worsen NMOSD-like pathology via astrocytic injury, whereas agents promoting astrocytic activation confer protection. This work bridges fundamental mechanisms to clinical strategy by establishing a framework for astrocyte-centered drug screening for NMOSD.

Using brain imaging and deep neural networks, we found that in 2-month-old infants the visual system represented not only how things looked but also what category they belonged to. This showed that features sufficient for object recognition are already important in early life.

                Polymorphisms in genes in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II region comprise the most important inherited risk factors for many autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes (T1D) and celiac disease (CD): both diseases are positively associated with the HLA-DR3 haplotype (<i>DRB1*03:01-DQA1*05:01-DQB1*02:01</i>). Studies of two different populations have recently documented that T1D susceptibility in HLA-DR3 homozygous individuals is stratified by a haplotype consisting of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (‘tri-SNP’) in intron 1 of the <i>HLA-DRA</i> gene. In this study, we use a large cohort from the longitudinal ‘The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young’ (TEDDY) study to further refine the tri-SNP association with T1D and with autoantibody-defined T1D endotypes. We found that the tri-SNP association is primarily in subjects whose first-appearing T1D autoantibody is to insulin. In addition, we discovered that the tri-SNP is also associated with CD, and that the particular tri-SNP haplotype (‘101’) that is negatively associated with T1D risk is positively associated with risk for CD. The opposite effect of the tri-SNP haplotype on two DR3-associated diseases can enhance and refine current models of disease prediction based on genetic risk. Finally, we investigated possible functional differences between the individuals carrying high and low-risk tri-SNP haplotypes and found that differences in complement system genes C4A and C4B may underlie the observed divergence in disease risk.

                Tendons and ligaments are crucial connective tissues linking bones and muscles, yet achieving full functional recovery after injury remains challenging. We investigated the characteristics of tendon stem/progenitor cells (TSPCs) by focusing on the declining tendon repair capacity with growth. Using single-cell RNA sequencing on Achilles tendon cells from 2- and 6-week-old mice, we identified <i>Cd55</i> and <i>Cd248</i> as novel surface antigen markers for TSPCs. Combining single-cell RNA sequencing with single-nucleus RNA and ATAC sequencing analyses revealed that <i>Cd55-</i> and <i>Cd248</i>-positive fractions in tendon tissue represent TSPCs, as confirmed by their expression of established TSPC markers, with this population decreasing at 6 weeks. We also identified candidate upstream transcription factors regulating these fractions. Functional analyses of isolated CD55/CD248-positive cells demonstrated high clonogenic potential and tendon differentiation capacity, forming functional tendon-like tissue in vitro. This study establishes CD55 and CD248 as novel TSPC surface antigens, potentially advancing tendon regenerative medicine and contributing to the development of new treatment strategies for tendon and ligament injuries.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102999">Mixture discrimination training induces durable and generalizable olfactory learning independent of odorant structure and concentration</a></h4>

              
                Previously, we showed that adult human olfaction retains plasticity in the unilateral processing of molecular chirality (Feng and Zhou, 2019). Using a similar unilateral discrimination protocol across three experiments with human adults (n = 96; 1,295 sessions), we now reveal distinct patterns of specificity, generalization, and persistence in olfactory learning, independent of adaptation or task difficulty. Training with binary odor mixtures at varying ratios consistently produced durable gains that transferred across nostrils and generalized to novel mixtures differing in both structure and perceptual quality. Conversely, training with odor enantiomers or concentration differences yielded neither transfer nor generalization, and concentration discrimination learning was short-lived. These results indicate that mixture configural quality is a distinct olfactory attribute from chirality or relative concentration, and that discrimination learning engages plasticity at different stages of olfactory processing depending on the task-relevant attribute. Moreover, they identify mixture discrimination training as a promising strategy for rehabilitating smell loss and cultivating olfactory expertise.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102155">Information, certainty, and learning</a></h4>

              
                More than four decades ago, Gibbon and Balsam (1981) showed that the acquisition of Pavlovian conditioning in pigeons is directly related to the informativeness of the conditioning stimulus (CS) about the unconditioned stimulus (US), where informativeness is defined as the ratio of the US-US interval (<i>C</i>) to the CS-US interval (<i>T</i>). However, the evidence for this relationship in other species has been equivocal. Here, we describe an experiment that measured the acquisition of appetitive Pavlovian conditioning in 14 groups of rats trained with different <i>C</i>/<i>T</i> ratios (ranging from 1.5 to 300) to establish how learning is related to informativeness. We show that the number of trials required for rats to start responding to the CS is determined by the <i>C</i>/<i>T</i> ratio, and the specific scalar relationship between the rate of learning and informativeness is similar to that previously obtained with pigeons. We also found that the response rate after extended conditioning is strongly related to <i>T</i>, with the terminal CS response rate being a scalar function of the CS reinforcement rate (1 <i>/T</i>). Moreover, this same scalar relationship extended to the rats’ response rates during the inter-trial interval, which was directly proportional to the overall rate of reinforcement in the context (1 <i>/C</i>). The findings establish that animals encode rates of reinforcement, and that conditioning is directly related to how much information the CS provides about the US. The consistency of these observations across species, captured by a simple regression function, suggests a universal model of conditioning.

                Self-reflection is central to human cognition and has been proposed as one of the key drivers of our progress as a species, yet the development of self-reflective capacities is unknown. Using a novel gaze-contingent match-to-sample paradigm with concurrent eye-tracking and EEG recordings, we find evidence of self-reflective capacities in 12-month-old infants: they exhibit a neural response signature of error-tracking (the error-related negativity, ERN) when they make incorrect as opposed to correct choices and before receiving any feedback. Remarkably, the magnitude of the ERN at 12 months developmentally predicted the emergence of conceptual self-representation (mirror-self-recognition) in the same infants six months later. This relationship was specific to internal error-monitoring and not to external feedback processing, and could not be explained by infants' age or general cognitive development. Moreover, infants did not simply detect their errors: the group of infants who passed the mirror test at 18 months (S) also adapted their behaviour post-error at 12 months. Following mistakes, S infants slowed their decisions and increased their visual exploration, demonstrating not only rudimentary metacognitive monitoring but also metacognitive control at 1 year of age. These findings provide the first empirical evidence that self-awareness may be rooted in earlier self-monitoring abilities, and reveal how a self-reflective mind can emerge from implicit cognitive monitoring mechanisms within the first years of life.

">Modularity-dependent storage of dynamic spiking patterns: bridging micro- and mesoscopic representations</a></h4>

              
                Biological systems rely on asynchronous and temporally overlapping dynamics, allowing for the concurrent activation of multiple processes. This principle is particularly evident in brain function, where cognitive tasks engage distributed, interacting regions rather than sequentially isolated ones. To investigate the mechanisms enabling such coordination, we study a modular spiking neural network composed of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons and governed by spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). Our model stores modular spatiotemporal patterns both at the mesoscopic level (sequences of modules) and at the microscopic level (precise spike timings) and includes a parameter, , which regulates the degree of temporal overlap between modules' activations. By tuning , the network transitions from sequential to overlapping regimes, ranging from synfire chain-like dynamics to fully co-activated modules. We investigate how the temporal structure influences the network's capacity to encode and selectively retrieve multiple dynamical patterns while considering biological constraints such as the cost of long-range connectivity. Our results offer insight into how spatiotemporal coding and network organisation support robust, large-scale memory storage and replay.

">Developmental dysregulation of chandelier cell excitability in a mouse model of Dravet Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Chandelier cells (ChCs) are a rare and highly specialized subtype of inhibitory neuron in the cerebral cortex that specifically and exclusively form synapses onto the axon initial segment of excitatory neurons and thereby exert powerful control of excitability. We applied a newly developed, cell type-specific enhancer element to label ChCs and assess their electrophysiological and morphological properties across development in Dravet Syndrome (Scn1a+/- mice), a prominent neurodevelopmental disorder defined by epilepsy and features of autism spectrum disorder. Dravet Syndrome is known to predominantly impact GABAergic interneurons. We found that ChCs from juvenile Scn1a+/- mice (postnatal day, P18-21) exhibit impaired excitability, and that deficits largely persist in young adulthood (P35-56). These findings are distinct from prior observations in the more common subtype of parvalbumin-positive interneurons, basket cells. We found no differences in the axonal or dendritic morphology of ChCs at either time point. Our results suggest a role for ChCs in the pathogenesis of Dravet Syndrome and constitute the first targeted study of ChC function in a specific genetically-defined neurodevelopmental disorder.

">Tracking bilingual brain processing at high spatiotemporal resolution reveals where and when second language slows down</a></h4>

              
                A central question in bilingualism research is whether challenges in a second language (L2) reflect a fundamentally different processing route from the first language (L1), or slower processing at particular stages. Although functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) revealed substantial cortical overlap between L1 and L2, different processing mechanisms may interleave within the overlap. Conventional fMRI methods lack the combined spatial and temporal resolution needed to determine precisely where and when L1 and L2 dissociations occur. Here, we used rapid phase-encoded fMRI to track L1 and L2 processing within overlapping cortical regions. Thirty-one Chinese-English bilinguals completed sentence-level reading, listening, reading-aloud, and shadowing tasks in both Chinese (L1) and English (L2). By analyzing hemodynamic traveling waves along sample paths through the visual, auditory, and motor systems, we identified temporal dissociations between L1 and L2 processing. Compared with L1, L2 exhibited significant and consistent delays along dorsal and ventral visual streams during reading and reading aloud. Along auditory streams, L2 delays differed between externally presented speech (listening) and self-generated speech (reading aloud). In the frontal cortex, reading aloud and shadowing exhibited similar progression patterns, but with different temporal offsets between L1 and L2 in the dorsal and ventral motor streams. These findings reveal task- and modality-dependent differences between L1 and L2 processing, and pinpoint the exact locations for delayed L2 processing across multimodal streams. This study suggests that L2 disadvantage is often a matter of timing and efficiency within largely shared brain networks, rather than due to the use of different brain regions.

<p>Our findings demonstrate that the human nodose ganglion expresses <i>Glp1r</i> mRNA and reveal species similarities and differences in <i>Glp1r</i> expression between humans and mice.

<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Given the rapidly expanding clinical use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R) agonists—well-known for their antidiabetic and antiobesity effects—it is increasingly important to understand the precise distribution of GLP1R expression in the human body, as this knowledge is crucial for elucidating both their therapeutic effects and side effects. In this study, we investigated <i>Glp1r</i> mRNA expression in the human nodose ganglion, a key sensory relay between the periphery and the brain. We analyzed postmortem paraffin-embedded nodose ganglia sections from 10 human donors, using RNAscope analysis. We found that optimal tissue required fixation times under 48 h and postmortem intervals of approximately 10 h or less. Ultimately, nine nodose ganglia from six donors met quality standards for analysis. Using multiplex RNAscope, we detected moderate to high levels of <i>Glp1r</i> expression in approximately 7% of all nodose neurons, with no clear differences between sides, sex, or age. The proportion of neurons with low <i>Glp1r</i> expression rose to nearly 28%. Notably, <i>Glp1r</i> expression was also observed in nonneuronal cells within the perineurium, epineurium, and fascicles of the human vagus nerve. As a point of comparison, we also examined <i>Glp1r</i> expression in mice, where 17.9%–29.1% of nodose neurons were positive, with slightly higher expression on the right side. In mice, <i>Glp1r</i> expression was strictly neuronal. Overall, our findings demonstrate that the human nodose ganglion is a potential target for GLP1R-based therapeutics and reveal species similarities and differences in <i>Glp1r</i> expression between humans and mice.</p>

<p>Axons expressing the adrenaline-synthesizing enzyme, phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT), project widely throughout the spinal cord. Many of these axons are from C1 neurons of the rostral ventrolateral medulla. We confirm that dense arrays of PNMT-expressing, C1-derived axons surround thoracolumbar sympathetic preganglionic neurons, many of which are putative vasomotor neurons. The C1/PNMT axons are also more widespread, innervating sacral preganglionic neurons activated by the micturition reflex and, very sparsely, somatic motor neurons in the ventral horn.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>We examined the distribution of axons throughout the spinal cord of the rat that were either immunoreactive for the adrenaline-synthesizing enzyme, phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT), or derived from medullary C1 neurons, one of the three groups of neurons in the brain that synthesize PNMT. We observed that PMNT-immunoreactive axons, as well as C1 axons labelled with GFP from viral transduction, innervate most, but not all, sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the thoracolumbar spinal cord. GFP-positive C1 axons provided innervation to sympathetic preganglionic neurons that expressed cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript, an accepted marker of sympathetic vasomotor neurons. In addition, we observed axons from PNMT-containing and C1 neurons caudal to the distribution of sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the sacral spinal cord where they closely apposed parasympathetic preganglionic neurons retrogradely labelled from the major pelvic ganglion. We also found close appositions from PNMT-immunoreactive or GFP-labelled C1 axons on choline acetyltransferase-stained parasympathetic preganglionic neurons activated by the micturition reflex, thus providing clear evidence of a non-cardiovascular target for RVLM C1 neurons. Furthermore, we observed a few PNMT-positive and GFP-positive C1 axons making close appositions with somatic motor neurons in Onuf's nucleus in the sacral cord and in the ventral horn at more rostral levels. These data provide a comprehensive map of the distribution of adrenergic inputs to the spinal cord and identify parasympathetic preganglionic neurons, including those involved in the micturition reflex, as well as sympathetic preganglionic neurons as the major targets for these inputs.</p>

                Background Sensorineural hearing loss in children, when associated with specific risk factors, can negatively affect language development, which in turn impacts their quality of life as well as their family and social environment. Objective To determine the association between risk factors for severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss and auditory performance in post–cochlear implant patients at Instituto Nacional de Salud del Niño, San Borja, during the period from 2021 to 2024. Methods An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted. Data collection was performed through a review of medical records; information was obtained from children treated between 2021 and 2024, including sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of post–cochlear implant patients. Auditory performance was assessed using the PEACH test. Results Medical records from 100 children who underwent cochlear implant surgery were reviewed. Preterm children showed poorer auditory performance (52.8%) compared with those born at term (70.5%). Children with low birth weight recorded a PEACH score of 51.4%, whereas those with normal birth weight reached higher values (71.8%). Additionally, children implanted before their first year of life presented a lower rate of suboptimal performance (40%), while those implanted after the age of three reached 56.5% performance. Analysis of risk factors associated with auditory outcomes revealed that prematurity, low birth weight, severe asphyxia, and hydrocephalus were significantly associated with poorer auditory performance. Conclusions There is a significant association between risk factors and reduced auditory performance in children with sensorineural hearing loss who underwent cochlear implant surgery, particularly among those born prematurely, with low birth weight, severe asphyxia, or hydrocephalus.

                Background The Ichu River serves as the primary water source for urban consumption, agricultural irrigation, and several local industrial operations in the Huancavelica region; however, increasing anthropogenic pressures including untreated municipal wastewater, mining effluents, agricultural runoff, and expanding urbanization have significantly deteriorated its water quality. These combined stressors highlight the need for an integrated assessment to understand the extent of contamination and associated human health risks. Methods The investigation measured water quality and health-related risks by analyzing physicochemical parameters, heavy metals, and microbial pollutants at eight sampling points, site 1 (S1) through (S8). Results The research data showed that water quality worsened progressively from upstream to downstream locations such as turbidity, TDS, conductivity, and BOD levels increased. Oil pollution and oxygen depletion arose from a reduction in dissolved oxygen from 6.3 to 4.5 mg/L at the different sampling sites (S1 to S8). Heavy metals (As, Pb, Cd, and Cr) in the samples exceeded the standards established by the World Health Organization (WHO) established standards because of mining and industrial wastewater and local wastewater discharge. The presence of excessive Escherichia coli (E. coli) and total coliforms in microbial tests proved that the water was severely contaminated by fecal matter. Principal Component Analysis showed that heavy metals exist with microbial pollution and organic load as the main sources of water quality decline, and pollution indicators were found to establish powerful relationships with depleted oxygen levels. Conclusion The severe contamination risks found in this study justify immediate pollution control measures, wastewater treatment enforcement, and sustainable watershed management practices. Urgent action is necessary because vital parameters surpass the standards set by the WHO and (United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) to avoid enduring environmental damage and health problems. This research demonstrates the value of continuing water quality assessments while enforcing policies and raising public awareness to improve the water quality of the Ichu River.

The negative consequences of childhood neglect are not just limited to childhood but are found to be related to minor to major emotional issues during adulthood. Methods The study employs a cross-sectional research design to explore the effects of childhood neglect on difficulties in emotional regulation and a preference for solitude among young adults, using path analysis. Using the purposive sampling method, 209 young adults aged 19 to 30 years were selected. The Multidimensional Neglectful Behaviour Scale Form A, which measures neglect of physical needs (PN), supervisory needs (SN), cognitive needs (CN), and emotional needs (EN), as well as the Preference for Solitude scale and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale-Short Form I, were utilised for data collection. Result Path analysis revealed a significant direct effect of experiencing childhood emotional and supervisory neglect on difficulties in emotional regulation among young adults. A preference for solitude was not significantly predicted by childhood neglect or difficulties in emotional regulation. Conclusion The study signifies that the experience of various forms of childhood neglect does not occur in isolation and is not limited to troubled childhood, but can echo into adulthood, resulting in deprived emotional capacities.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-157/v1?src=rss">The Role of Digital Maturity in Achieving the Quality of E-Services: An Analytical Study at Al-Rafidain Bank – Fallujah Branch [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Objective The study aims to explore how the features and components of digital maturity influence the enhancement of e-service quality at Al-Rafidain Bank – Fallujah Branch. Design/Methodology The study employed a descriptive-analytical methodology, utilizing a questionnaire as the primary tool to measure the relationships between variables. Theoretical/Framework This study investigates the impact of digital maturity on e-service quality (reliability, trust, security, responsiveness, ease of invective, data confidentiality, etc.) to find out if Al-Rafidain Bank will be able to serve its customers more efficiently and effectively in the coming years Findings The findings showed a strong correlation and a significant impact of digital maturity on the quality of e-services offered. It was also established that digital maturity explained between 53% and 56% of the service quality variance. The strongest drivers in this regard included technological culture, organizational structures, and visions and perceptions, while the impact of technological tools was weak in the absence of effective implementation. These findings suggest that to achieve superior quality in e-services, having technology available is a prerequisite. However, having technology is not enough; it should be combined with organizational elements, staff empowerment, and a predominant digital vision. Thus, digital maturity is an essential determinant for performance improvement and institutional digital transformation. Conclusions The results showed that Al-Rafidain Bank – Fallujah Branch, Al-Rafidain Bank in the Fallujah branch, maintains a high level of digital maturity, which is a result of advanced technology coupled with quality e-services. The technological culture organization, and digital vision framework uniquely enhance service quality, demonstrating the need to provide all the digital components in order to attain a tangible transformation that is viable and efficient.

                Background Immune dysregulation—particularly involving cytokines and chemokines—contributes to breast cancer progression and metastasis. To compare circulating levels of interleukin-17 (IL-17), interleukin-34 (IL-34), and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) between premenopausal and postmenopausal women with breast cancer and age-matched healthy controls. Methods In this case–control study, 130 women were enrolled: 90 patients with breast cancer (45 premenopausal; 45 postmenopausal) and 40 healthy controls (20 premenopausal; 20 postmenopausal). Serum IL-17, IL-34, and CXCL12 concentrations were quantified by ELISA. Group differences were assessed using independent-samples t-tests. Results Mean serum levels of IL-17, IL-34, and CXCL12 were significantly higher in patients than in controls across both menopausal strata (all p < 0.001). The pattern of elevation was consistent in premenopausal and postmenopausal subgroups, indicating that the observed immune perturbations are not restricted by menopausal status. Conclusions IL-17, IL-34, and CXCL12 are markedly elevated in women with breast cancer irrespective of menopausal state and may serve as accessible immune biomarkers for disease detection and monitoring. Validation in larger, longitudinal cohorts is warranted to evaluate diagnostic performance and potential therapeutic relevance.

                Background Myocardial ischemia is a dynamic, complex process characterized by hyperkalemia, acidosis, and ATP depletion. While these three conditions alter cardiomyocyte electrophysiology, it is difficult to discern how much each one individually contributes to the resulting changes in action potential (AP). In this study, we test whether machine learning can deconvolute these distinct ischemic patterns within a single AP. Methods We developed a multi-target regression model trained on data generated by the Luo-Rudy (1991) computational model of a ventricular cardiomyocyte, simulating a wide range of ischemic conditions. The model was designed to predict two continuous variables: extracellular potassium concentration ([K+]o) and intracellular pH (pHi). Results The model achieved high accuracy on a held-out test set, with mean squared errors (MSE) below 0.25 for [K+]o and below 0.01 for pHi. To further generalize this model, we applied this trained model to a structurally distinct model, the Ten Tusscher (2006) framework. We were able to accurately predict [K+]o and pHi from APs, demonstrating that the learned principles are robust. A feature importance analysis revealed that resting membrane potential (RMP) was the strongest predictor for [K+]o, while action potential duration (APD) is most important for predicting pHi, underscoring these distinct cardiomyocyte electrophysiological patterns Conclusions Our approach can distinguish distinct ischemic drivers and has potential for in silico drug screening and mechanistic analysis.
