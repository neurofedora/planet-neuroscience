              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Opposite polarity programs regulate asymmetric subsidiary cell divisions in grasses</a></h4>

              
                Grass stomata recruit lateral subsidiary cells (SCs), which are key to the unique stomatal morphology and the efficient plant-atmosphere gas exchange in grasses. Subsidiary mother cells (SMCs) strongly polarise before an asymmetric division forms a SC. Yet apart from a proximal polarity module that includes PANGLOSS1 (PAN1) and guides nuclear migration, little is known regarding the developmental processes that form SCs. Here, we used comparative transcriptomics of developing wild-type and SC-less <i>bdmute</i> leaves in the genetic model grass <i>Brachypodium distachyon</i> to identify novel factors involved in SC formation. This approach revealed BdPOLAR, which forms a novel, distal polarity domain in SMCs that is opposite to the proximal PAN1 domain. Both polarity domains are required for the formative SC division yet exhibit various roles in guiding pre-mitotic nuclear migration and SMC division plane orientation, respectively. Nonetheless, the domains are linked as the proximal domain controls polarisation of the distal domain. In summary, we identified two opposing polarity domains that coordinate the SC division, a process crucial for grass stomatal physiology.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cross-talk between red blood cells and plasma influences blood flow and omics phenotypes in severe COVID-19</a></h4>

              
                Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and can affect multiple organs, among which is the circulatory system. Inflammation and mortality risk markers were previously detected in COVID-19 plasma and red blood cells (RBCs) metabolic and proteomic profiles. Additionally, biophysical properties, such as deformability, were found to be changed during the infection. Based on such data, we aim to better characterize RBC functions in COVID-19. We evaluate the flow properties of RBCs in severe COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit by using microfluidic techniques and automated methods, including artificial neural networks, for an unbiased RBC analysis. We find strong flow and RBC shape impairment in COVID-19 samples and demonstrate that such changes are reversible upon suspension of COVID-19 RBCs in healthy plasma. Vice versa, healthy RBCs resemble COVID-19 RBCs when suspended in COVID-19 plasma. Proteomics and metabolomics analyses allow us to detect the effect of plasma exchanges on both plasma and RBCs and demonstrate a new role of RBCs in maintaining plasma equilibria at the expense of their flow properties. Our findings provide a framework for further investigations of clinical relevance for therapies against COVID-19 and possibly other infectious diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Neurovascular anatomy of dwarf dinosaur implies precociality in sauropods</a></h4>

              
                Macronaria, a group of mostly colossal sauropod dinosaurs, comprised the largest terrestrial vertebrates of Earth’s history. However, some of the smallest sauropods belong to this group as well. The Late Jurassic macronarian island dwarf <i>Europasaurus holgeri</i> is one of the most peculiar and best-studied sauropods worldwide. So far, the braincase material of this taxon from Germany pended greater attention. With the aid of micro-computed tomography (microCT), we report on the neuroanatomy of the nearly complete braincase of an adult individual, as well as the inner ears (endosseous labyrinths) of one other adult and several juveniles (the latter also containing novel vascular cavities). The presence of large and morphologically adult inner ears in juvenile material suggests precociality. Our findings add to the diversity of neurovascular anatomy in sauropod braincases and buttress the perception of sauropods as fast-growing and autonomous giants with manifold facets of reproductive and social behaviour. This suggests that – apart from sheer size – little separated <i>Europasaurus</i> from its large-bodied relatives.

                Disorders of Sex Development (DSD) are a group of congenital medical conditions defined as atypical development of chromosomal, gonadal, and anatomical sex. Psychiatric, behavioral, and gender-associated problems could arise in both male and female adult with DSD. Structured assessments for each variable are needed to properly measure psychiatric and sexual issues and overall quality of life in adults with DSD. This study aims to review structured questionnaire instruments that had been used to assess psychiatric, behavioral, sexual problems, and quality of life in adults with DSD. For psychiatric or behavioral problems, adults with DSD can be assessed with GHQ-28, Brief Symptoms Inventory, Achenbach and Rescorla’s Adult Behavior Checklist, Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale, Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview plus, Hospital anxiety and depression scale, Body image scale, Adult ADHD self-report scale screener, Short Autism Spectrum Quotient, and coping with DSD questionnaire. For quality of life, assessment could be done with WHOQOL and Short Form-36. Gender role assessment in adults with DSD can be done using Core Gender Identity, Sexual Orientation, and Gender Role Behavior and Utrecht Gender Dysphoria Scale. Both of the apparent male and female DSD patients can be assessed using the instruments available. Recommendations are made based on its function, compliance, validity, reliability, and avaibility of an Indonesian version of the questionnaire. There are a plethora of structured questionnaire tools that have been used to measure psychiatric or behavioral problems, quality of life, and gender roles in adult with DSD, each with its own advantages and disadvantages

                Background: Asiatic acid (AA) is a naturally occurring triterpenoid derivative of Centella asiatica (CA) with neuroprotective effect. The study aimed to design an ideal oral drug delivery system to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD) and develop chitosan-embedded liposomes comprising an extract of CA (CLCAE) and compare them with the chitosan-coated liposomes of asiatic acid (CLAA) for oral delivery to treat the initial phases of AD.  Methods: The solvent evaporation technique was used to develop CLCAE and CLAA, optimised with the experiment's design, and was further evaluated. Results: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies confirmed coating with chitosan. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) indicated the successful formation of CLCAE and CLAA. Differential scanning colorimetry (DSC) confirmed the drug-phospholipid complex. Furthermore, the rate of in vitro release of CLCAE and CLAA was found to be 69.43±0.3 % and 85.3±0.3 %, respectively, in 24 h. Ex vivo permeation of CLCAE and CLAA was found to be 48±0.3 % and 78±0.3 %, respectively. In the Alcl3-induced AD model in rats, disease progression was confirmed by Y-maze, the preliminary histopathology evaluation showed significantly higher efficacy of the prepared liposomes (CLCAE and CLAA) compared to the Centella asiatica extract (CAE) and they were found to have equivalent efficacy to the standard drug (rivastigmine tartrate). The considerable increase in pharmacodynamic parameters in terms of neuronal count in the CLAA group indicated the protective role against Alcl3 toxicity and was also confirmed by assessing acetylcholine (Ach) levels. The pharmacokinetic study, such as Cmax, Tmax, and area under curve (AUC) parameters, proved an increase in AA bioavailability in the form of CLAA compared to the pure AA and CLCAE forms. Conclusion: The preclinical study suggested that CLAA was found to have better stability and an ideal oral drug delivery system to treat AD.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Mathematical modeling of HIV-HCV co-infection model: Impact of parameters on reproduction number [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) are both classified as blood-borne viruses since they are transmitted through contact with contaminated blood. Approximately 1.3 million of the 2.75 million global HIV/HCV carriers are people who inject drugs (PWID). HIV co-infection has a harmful effect on the progression of HCV, resulting in greater rates of HCV persistence after acute infection, higher viral levels, and accelerated progression of liver fibrosis and end-stage liver disease. In this study, we developed and investigated a mathematical model for the dynamical behavior of HIV/AIDS and HCV co-infection, which includes therapy for both diseases, vertical transmission in HIV cases, unawareness and awareness of HIV infection, inefficient HIV treatment follow-up, and efficient condom use. Methods: Positivity and boundedness of the model under investigation were established using well-known theorems. The equilibria were demonstrated by bringing all differential equations to zero. The associative reproduction numbers for mono-infected and dual-infected models were calculated using the next-generation matrix approach. The local and global stabilities of the models were validated using the linearization and comparison theorem and the negative criterion techniques of bendixson and dulac, respectively. Results: The growing prevalence of HIV treatment dropout in each compartment of the HIV model led to a reduction in HIV on treatment compartments while other compartments exhibited an increase in populations. In dually infected patients, treating HCV first reduces co-infection reproduction number Rech, which reduces liver cancer risk. Conclusions: From the model's results, we infer various steps (such as: campaigns to warn individuals about the consequences of having multiple sexual partners; distributing more condoms to individuals; continuing treatment for chronic HCV and AIDS) that policymakers could take to reduce the number of mono-infected and co-infected individuals.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Interictal Gamma Event Connectivity Differentiates the Seizure Network and Outcome in Patients after Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Surgery</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Studies of interictal EEG functional connectivity in the epileptic brain seek to identify abnormal interactions between brain regions involved in generating seizures, which clinically often is defined by the seizure onset zone (SOZ). However, there is evidence for abnormal connectivity outside the SOZ (NSOZ), and removal of the SOZ does not always result in seizure control, suggesting, in some cases, that the extent of abnormal connectivity indicates a larger seizure network than the SOZ. To better understand the potential differences in interictal functional connectivity in relation to the seizure network and outcome, we computed event connectivity in the theta (4&ndash;8 Hz, ThEC), low-gamma (30&ndash;55 Hz, LGEC), and high-gamma (65&ndash;95 Hz, HGEC) bands from interictal depth EEG recorded in surgical patients with medication-resistant seizures suspected to begin in the temporal lobe. Analysis finds stronger LGEC and HGEC in SOZ than NSOZ of seizure-free (SF) patients (<I>p</I> = 1.10e-9, 0.0217), but no difference in not seizure-free (NSF) patients. There were stronger LGEC and HGEC between mesial and lateral temporal SOZ of SF than NSF patients (<I>p</I> = 0.00114, 0.00205), and stronger LGEC and ThEC in NSOZ of NSF than SF patients (<I>p</I> = 0.0089, 0.0111). These results show that event connectivity is sensitive to differences in the interactions between regions in SOZ and NSOZ and SF and NSF patients. Patients with differential strengths in event connectivity could represent a well-localized seizure network, whereas an absence of differences could indicate a larger seizure network than the one localized by the SOZ and higher likelihood for seizure recurrence.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">The Neural Correlates of Spatial Disorientation in Head Direction Cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>While the brain has evolved robust mechanisms to counter spatial disorientation, their neural underpinnings remain unknown. To explore these underpinnings, we monitored the activity of anterodorsal thalamic head direction (HD) cells in rats while they underwent unidirectional or bidirectional rotation at different speeds and under different conditions (light vs dark, freely-moving vs head-fixed). Under conditions that promoted disorientation, HD cells did not become quiescent but continued to fire, although their firing was no longer direction specific. Peak firing rates, burst frequency, and directionality all decreased linearly with rotation speed, consistent with previous experiments where rats were inverted or climbed walls/ceilings in zero gravity. However, access to visual landmarks spared the stability of preferred firing directions (PFDs), indicating that visual landmarks provide a stabilizing signal to the HD system while vestibular input likely maintains direction-specific firing. In addition, we found evidence that the HD system underestimated angular velocity at the beginning of head-fixed rotations, consistent with the finding that humans often underestimate rotations. When head-fixed rotations in the dark were terminated HD cells fired in bursts that matched the frequency of rotation. This postrotational bursting shared several striking similarities with postrotational "nystagmus" in the vestibulo-ocular system, consistent with the interpretation that the HD system receives input from a vestibular velocity storage mechanism that works to reduce spatial disorientation following rotation. Thus, the brain overcomes spatial disorientation through multisensory integration of different motor-sensory inputs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Driving event recognition using machine learning and smartphones [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The lack of real-time monitoring is one of the reasons for the lack of awareness among drivers of their dangerous driving behavior. This work aims to develop a driver profiling system where a smartphone’s built-in sensors are used alongside machine learning algorithms to classify different driving behaviors. Methods: We attempt to determine the optimal combination of smartphone sensors such as accelerometer, gyroscope, and GPS in order to develop an accurate machine learning algorithm capable of identifying different driving events (e.g. turning, accelerating, or braking). Results: In our preliminary studies, we encountered some difficulties in obtaining consistent driving events, which had the potential to add “noise” to the observations, thus reducing the accuracy of the classification. However, after some pre-processing, which included manual elimination of extraneous and erroneous events, and with the use of the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), we have been able to distinguish different driving events with an accuracy of about 95%. Conclusions: Based on the results of preliminary studies, we have determined that the proposed approach is effective in classifying different driving events, which in turn will allow us to determine driver’s driving behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A review of existing neonatal hyperbilirubinemia guidelines in Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is one of the most common conditions for neonate inpatients. Indonesia faces a major challenge in which different guidelines regarding the management of this condition were present. This study aimed to compare the existing guidelines regarding prevention, diagnosis, treatment and monitoring in order to create the best recommendation for a new hyperbilirubinemia guideline in Indonesia. Methods:  Through an earlier survey regarding adherence to the neonatal hyperbilirubinemia guideline, we identified that three main guidelines are being used in Indonesia. These were developed by the Indonesian Pediatric Society (IPS), the Ministry of Health (MoH), and  World Health Organization (WHO). In this study, we compared factors such as prevention, monitoring, methods for identifying, risk factors in the development of neonatal jaundice, risk factors that increase brain damage, and intervention treatment threshold in the existing guidelines to determine the best recommendations for a new guideline. Results: The MoH and WHO guidelines allow screening and treatment of hyperbilirubinemia based on visual examination (VE) only. Compared with the MoH and WHO guidelines, risk assessment is comprehensively discussed in the IPS guideline. The MoH guideline recommends further examination of an icteric baby to ensure that the mother has enough milk without measuring the bilirubin level. The MoH guideline recommends referring the baby when it looks yellow on the soles and palms. The WHO and IPS guidelines recommend combining VE with an objective measurement of transcutaneous or serum bilirubin. The threshold to begin phototherapy in the WHO guideline is lower than the IPS guideline while the exchange transfusion threshold in both guidelines are comparably equal. Conclusions: The MoH guideline is outdated. MoH and IPS guidelines are causing differences in approaches to the management hyperbilirubinemia. A new, uniform guideline is required.

                Background: The elicitation of inconsistent health-state utility values (HSUVs) is a prevalent problem. There are two approaches to address this problem: (1) intervention during the elicitation process to ensure that patients estimate consistent HSUVs; (2) no intervention during the elicitation process and inconsistent HSUVs are adjusted after the fact. This paper studies three models recently proposed for adjusting inconsistent HSUVs and consistent HSUVs that some may consider unrealistic. Analysis: The three models are analyzed using a sound theoretical framework: the mathematical equivalence of HSUVs elicited using the standard gamble and probabilities, the Fréchet bounds, and preference theory. It is proven that none of these models accounts for the Fréchet lower bound and health conditions that are preference substitutes. Results: A clinical vignette proves these models may recommend treatments that result in premature death over treatments that cause acceptable adverse effects. Conclusions: The three models are incorrect and may mislead patients and physicians to poor medical decisions. In the spirit of shared decision making, patients should be given the opportunity to reassess inconsistent HSUVs and confirm that the revised HSUVs reflect their preferences.

                Background: Advanced materials are most likely to bring future economic, environmental and social benefits. At the same time, they may pose challenges regarding their safety and sustainability along the entire lifecycle. This needs to be timely addressed by the stakeholders (industry, research, policy, funding and regulatory bodies). As part of a larger foresight project, this study aimed to identify areas of scientific research and technological development related to advanced materials, in particular advanced nanomaterials and the sub-group of smart nanomaterials. The study identified and collected data to build relevant research and innovation indicators and analyse trends, impact and other implications. Methods: This study consisted of an iterative process including a documentation phase followed by the identification, description and development of a set of core research and innovation indicators regarding scientific publications, EU projects and patents. The data was extracted mainly from SCOPUS, CORDIS and PATSTAT databases using a predefined search string that included representative keywords. The trends, distributions and other aspects reflected in the final version of the indicators were analysed, e.g. the number of items in a period of time, geographical distribution, organisations involved, categories of journals, funding programmes, costs and technology areas. Results: Generally, for smart nanomaterials the data used represent around 3.5% of the advanced nanomaterials data, while for each field analysed, they represent 4.4% for publications, 13% for projects and 1.1% for patents. The study shows current trends for advanced nanomaterials at a top-level information that can be further extended with sub-indicators. Generally, the results indicated a significant growth in research into advanced nanomaterials, including smart nanomaterials, in the last decade, leading to an increased availability of information. Conclusion: These indicators identify trends regarding scientific and technological achievements and represent an important element when examining possible impacts on society and policy implications associated to these areas.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Elder abuse in Saudi Arabia: A systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Elder abuse is a common global problem that is certainly preventable. The first step to tackling elder abuse is by researching its prevalence and acknowledging it as a prevailing problem. However, there is a lack of studies on elder abuse in Saudi Arabia. In this review, the socio-forensic problem of elder abuse in Saudi Arabia is addressed.  Methods: The PubMed database was systematically searched for articles on elder abuse in Saudi Arabia from inception to 1 July 2022. Search terms included “elder abuse”, “elderly abuse”, “geriatric abuse”, “aged abuse”, “senior abuse”, and “elder maltreatment”. In addition, to detect studies reported from Saudi Arabia, the following search terms were included: “Saudi Arabia”, “KSA”, and “Kingdom of Saudi Arabia”. The search results were screened for relevant articles. Studies from Saudi Arabia that addressed elder abuse were included in this review. Studies from other countries and studies that addressed abuse in other age groups were excluded.  Results: A very high percentage of the elderly in shelter homes were found to have experienced abuse, especially psychological, which resulted in an array of mental health implications such as anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders. A high level of awareness of elder abuse, in addition to a high sense of responsibility towards the elderly, was reported.  Conclusions: As the elderly represent a significant percentage of the population in Saudi Arabia, and with the community being heavily family-centered, it is recommended to increase dedicated efforts towards nationwide research on elder abuse and to formulate effective national programs to ensure its prevention in Saudi Arabia.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Concatenated 16S rRNA sequence analysis improves bacterial taxonomy [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Microscopic, biochemical, molecular, and computer-based approaches are extensively used to identify and classify bacterial populations. Advances in DNA sequencing and bioinformatics workflows have facilitated sophisticated genome-based methods for microbial taxonomy although sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene is widely employed to identify and classify the bacterial community as a cost-effective and single-gene approach. However, the 16S rRNA sequence-based species identification accuracy is limited by multiple copies of the gene and their higher sequence identity between closely related species. The availability of a large volume of bacterial whole-genome data provided an opportunity to develop comprehensive species-specific 16S rRNA reference libraries. Methods: The 16S rRNA copies were retrieved from the whole genomes in the complete stage at the Genome database. With defined rules, four 16S rRNA gene copy variants were concatenated to develop a species-specific reference library. The sequence similarity search was performed with a web-based BLAST program, and MEGA software was used to construct the phylogenetic tree. Results: Using this approach, species-specific 16S rRNA gene libraries were developed for four closely related Streptococcus species (S. gordonii, S. mitis, S. oralis, and S. pneumoniae). Sequence similarity and phylogenetic analysis using concatenated 16S rRNA copies yielded better resolution than single gene copy approaches. Conclusions: The approach is very effective in classifying genetically related species and may reduce misclassification of bacterial species and genome assemblies.

                Background: While deepfake technology is still relatively new, concerns are increasing as they are getting harder to spot. The first question we need to ask is how good humans are at recognizing deepfakes - realistic-looking videos or images that show people doing or saying things that they never actually did or said generated by an artificial intelligence-based technology. Research has shown that an individual’s self-efficacy correlates with their ability to detect deepfakes. Previous studies suggest that one of the most fundamental predictors of self-efficacy are personality traits. In this study, we ask the question: how can people’s personality traits influence their efficacy in recognizing deepfakes?  Methods: Predictive correlational design with a multiple linear regression data analysis technique was used in this study. The participants of this study were 200 Indonesian young adults. Results: The results showed that only traits of Honesty-humility and Agreeableness were able to predict the efficacy, in the negative and positive directions, respectively. Meanwhile, traits of Emotionality, Extraversion, Conscientiousness, and Openness cannot predict it. Conclusion: Self-efficacy in spotting deepfakes can be predicted by certain personality traits.

Results: The obtained results describe the changes in the problems experienced by clients of the Probation Service during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: Since we can expect further increase in the frequency of occurring personal and social problems experienced by court-appointed custodians’ wards, financial resources and energy of social institutions, cooperation with court guardianship should be focused on psycho-educational campaigns concentrating on providing information on symptoms of problems in the mental and emotional sphere. Preventing exclusion of groups at risk in the labour market and supporting families to prevent the escalation of psychopathology, development of addictions and domestic violence should be priority areas.

                <p>by Eloi Martinez-Rabert, Chiel van Amstel, Cindy Smith, William T. Sloan, Rebeca Gonzalez-Cabaleiro</p>

In microbial communities, the ecological interactions between species of different populations are responsible for the spatial distributions observed in aggregates (granules, biofilms or flocs). To explore the underlying mechanisms that control these processes, we have developed a mathematical modelling framework able to describe, label and quantify defined spatial structures that arise from microbial and environmental interactions in communities. An artificial system of three populations collaborating or competing in an aggregate is simulated using individual-based modelling under different environmental conditions. In this study, neutralism, competition, commensalism and concurrence of commensalism and competition have been considered. We were able to identify interspecific segregation of communities that appears in competitive environments (<i>columned stratification</i>), and a layered distribution of populations that emerges in commensal (<i>layered stratification</i>). When different ecological interactions were considered in the same aggregate, the resultant spatial distribution was identified as the one controlled by the most limiting substrate. A theoretical modulus was defined, with which we were able to quantify the effect of environmental conditions and ecological interactions to predict the most probable spatial distribution. The specific microbial patterns observed in our results allowed us to identify the optimal spatial organizations for bacteria to thrive when building a microbial community and how this permitted co-existence of populations at different growth rates. Our model reveals that although ecological relationships between different species dictate the distribution of bacteria, the environment controls the final spatial distribution of the community.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Model-based prioritization for acquiring protection</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sarah M. Tashjian, Toby Wise, Dean Mobbs</p>

Protection often involves the capacity to prospectively plan the actions needed to mitigate harm. The computational architecture of decisions involving protection remains unclear, as well as whether these decisions differ from other beneficial prospective actions such as reward acquisition. Here we compare protection acquisition to reward acquisition and punishment avoidance to examine overlapping and distinct features across the three action types. Protection acquisition is positively valenced similar to reward. For both protection and reward, the more the actor gains, the more benefit. However, reward and protection occur in different contexts, with protection existing in aversive contexts. Punishment avoidance also occurs in aversive contexts, but differs from protection because punishment is negatively valenced and motivates avoidance. Across three independent studies (Total <i>N</i> = 600) we applied computational modeling to examine model-based reinforcement learning for protection, reward, and punishment in humans. Decisions motivated by acquiring protection evoked a higher degree of model-based control than acquiring reward or avoiding punishment, with no significant differences in learning rate. The context-valence asymmetry characteristic of protection increased deployment of flexible decision strategies, suggesting model-based control depends on the context in which outcomes are encountered as well as the valence of the outcome.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">scDSSC: Deep Sparse Subspace Clustering for scRNA-seq Data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by HaiYun Wang, JianPing Zhao, ChunHou Zheng, YanSen Su</p>

Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables researchers to characterize transcriptomic profiles at the single-cell resolution with increasingly high throughput. Clustering is a crucial step in single cell analysis. Clustering analysis of transcriptome profiled by scRNA-seq can reveal the heterogeneity and diversity of cells. However, single cell study still remains great challenges due to its high noise and dimension. Subspace clustering aims at discovering the intrinsic structure of data in unsupervised fashion. In this paper, we propose a deep sparse subspace clustering method scDSSC combining noise reduction and dimensionality reduction for scRNA-seq data, which simultaneously learns feature representation and clustering via explicit modelling of scRNA-seq data generation. Experiments on a variety of scRNA-seq datasets from thousands to tens of thousands of cells have shown that scDSSC can significantly improve clustering performance and facilitate the interpretability of clustering and downstream analysis. Compared to some popular scRNA-deq analysis methods, scDSSC outperformed state-of-the-art methods under various clustering performance metrics.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Systematic comparison of differential expression networks in MTB mono-, HIV mono- and MTB/HIV co-infections for drug repurposing</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yao Jiang, Jia-Xuan Zhang, Rong Liu</p>

The synergy between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (MTB) could accelerate the deterioration of immunological functions. Previous studies have explored the pathogenic mechanisms of HIV mono-infection (HMI), MTB mono-infection (MMI) and MTB/HIV co-infection (MHCI), but their similarities and specificities remain to be profoundly investigated. We thus designed a computational framework named IDEN to identify gene pairs related to these states, which were then compared from different perspectives. MMI-related genes showed the highest enrichment level on a greater number of chromosomes. Genes shared by more states tended to be more evolutionarily conserved, posttranslationally modified and topologically important. At the expression level, HMI-specific gene pairs yielded higher correlations, while the overlapping pairs involved in MHCI had significantly lower correlations. The correlation changes of common gene pairs showed that MHCI shared more similarities with MMI. Moreover, MMI- and MHCI-related genes were enriched in more identical pathways and biological processes, further illustrating that MTB may play a dominant role in co-infection. Hub genes specific to each state could promote pathogen infections, while those shared by two states could enhance immune responses. Finally, we improved the network proximity measure for drug repurposing by considering the importance of gene pairs, and approximately ten drug candidates were identified for each disease state.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">tension: A Python package for FORCE learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lu Bin Liu, Attila Losonczy, Zhenrui Liao</p>

First-Order, Reduced and Controlled Error (FORCE) learning and its variants are widely used to train chaotic recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and outperform gradient methods on certain tasks. However, there is currently no standard software framework for FORCE learning. We present tension, an object-oriented, open-source Python package that implements a TensorFlow / Keras API for FORCE. We show how rate networks, spiking networks, and networks constrained by biological data can all be trained using a shared, easily extensible high-level API. With the same resources, our implementation outperforms a conventional RNN in loss and published FORCE implementations in runtime. Our work here makes FORCE training chaotic RNNs accessible and simple to iterate, and facilitates modeling of how behaviors of interest emerge from neural dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The structure of the human LACTB filament reveals the mechanisms of assembly and membrane binding</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jeremy A. Bennett, Lottie R. Steward, Johannes Rudolph, Adam P. Voss, Halil Aydin</p>

Mitochondria are complex organelles that play a central role in metabolism. Dynamic membrane-associated processes regulate mitochondrial morphology and bioenergetics in response to cellular demand. In tumor cells, metabolic reprogramming requires active mitochondrial metabolism for providing key metabolites and building blocks for tumor growth and rapid proliferation. To counter this, the mitochondrial serine beta-lactamase-like protein (LACTB) alters mitochondrial lipid metabolism and potently inhibits the proliferation of a variety of tumor cells. Mammalian LACTB is localized in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS), where it assembles into filaments to regulate the efficiency of essential metabolic processes. However, the structural basis of LACTB polymerization and regulation remains incompletely understood. Here, we describe how human LACTB self-assembles into micron-scale filaments that increase their catalytic activity. The electron cryo-microscopy (cryoEM) structure defines the mechanism of assembly and reveals how highly ordered filament bundles stabilize the active state of the enzyme. We identify and characterize residues that are located at the filament-forming interface and further show that mutations that disrupt filamentation reduce enzyme activity. Furthermore, our results provide evidence that LACTB filaments can bind lipid membranes. These data reveal the detailed molecular organization and polymerization-based regulation of human LACTB and provide new insights into the mechanism of mitochondrial membrane organization that modulates lipid metabolism.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structures of RecBCD in complex with phage-encoded inhibitor proteins reveal distinctive strategies for evasion of a bacterial immunity hub</a></h4>

              
                Following infection of bacterial cells, bacteriophage modulate double-stranded DNA break repair pathways to protect themselves from host immunity systems and prioritise their own recombinases. Here we present biochemical and structural analysis of two phage proteins, gp5.9 and Abc2, which target the DNA break resection complex RecBCD. These exemplify two contrasting mechanisms for control of DNA break repair in which the RecBCD complex is either inhibited or co-opted for the benefit of the invading phage. Gp5.9 completely inhibits RecBCD by preventing it from binding to DNA. The RecBCD-gp5.9 structure shows that gp5.9 acts by substrate mimicry, binding predominantly to the RecB arm domain and competing sterically for the DNA binding site. Gp5.9 adopts a parallel coiled-coil architecture that is unprecedented for a natural DNA mimic protein. In contrast, binding of Abc2 does not substantially affect the biochemical activities of isolated RecBCD. The RecBCD-Abc2 structure shows that Abc2 binds to the Chi-recognition domains of the RecC subunit in a position that might enable it to mediate the loading of phage recombinases onto its single-stranded DNA products.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Network instability dynamics drive a transient bursting period in the developing hippocampus in vivo</a></h4>

              
                Spontaneous correlated activity is a universal hallmark of immature neural circuits. However, the cellular dynamics and intrinsic mechanisms underlying network burstiness in the intact developing brain are largely unknown. Here, we use two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging to comprehensively map the developmental trajectories of spontaneous network activity in the hippocampal area CA1 of mice in vivo. We unexpectedly find that network burstiness peaks after the developmental emergence of effective synaptic inhibition in the second postnatal week. We demonstrate that the enhanced network burstiness reflects an increased functional coupling of individual neurons to local population activity. However, pairwise neuronal correlations are low, and network bursts (NBs) recruit CA1 pyramidal cells in a virtually random manner. Using a dynamic systems modeling approach, we reconcile these experimental findings and identify network bi-stability as a potential regime underlying network burstiness at this age. Our analyses reveal an important role of synaptic input characteristics and network instability dynamics for NB generation. Collectively, our data suggest a mechanism, whereby developing CA1 performs extensive input-discrimination learning prior to the onset of environmental exploration.

                Previously we showed that authentic peptide sequences could be obtained from 3.8-Ma-old ostrich eggshell (OES) from the site of Laetoli, Tanzania (Demarchi et al., 2016). Here we show that the same sequences survive in a &gt; 6.5 Ma OES recovered from a palaeosteppe setting in northwestern China. The eggshell is thicker than those observed in extant species and consistent with the Liushu <i>Struthio</i> sp. ootaxon. These findings push the preservation of ancient proteins back to the Miocene and highlight their potential for paleontology, paleoecology and evolutionary biology.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Aurora A and cortical flows promote polarization and cytokinesis by inducing asymmetric ECT-2 accumulation</a></h4>

              
                In the early <i>C. elegans</i> embryo, cell polarization and cytokinesis are interrelated yet distinct processes. Here, we sought to understand a poorly understood aspect of cleavage furrow positioning. Early <i>C. elegans</i> embryos deficient in the cytokinetic regulator centralspindlin form furrows, due to an inhibitory activity that depends on aster positioning relative to the polar cortices. Here, we show polar relaxation is associated with depletion of cortical ECT-2, a RhoGEF, specifically at the posterior cortex. Asymmetric ECT-2 accumulation requires intact centrosomes, Aurora A (AIR-1), and myosin-dependent cortical flows. Within a localization competent ECT-2 fragment, we identified three putative phospho-acceptor sites in the PH domain of ECT-2 that render ECT-2 responsive to inhibition by AIR-1. During both polarization and cytokinesis, our results suggest that centrosomal AIR-1 breaks symmetry via ECT-2 phosphorylation; this local inhibition of ECT-2 is amplified by myosin-driven flows that generate regional ECT-2 asymmetry. Together, these mechanisms cooperate to induce polarized assembly of cortical myosin, contributing to both embryo polarization and cytokinesis.

                The macroscale connectome is the network of physical, white-matter tracts between brain areas. The connections are generally weighted and their values interpreted as measures of communication efficacy. In most applications, weights are assigned based on diffusion parameters or inferred using a statistical model, although the model generally scales poorly limiting its applications to relatively small networks. In reality, the ground-truth weights are unknown, motivating the exploration of alternative edge weighted schemes. Here, we explore a simple regression-based, explanatory model that endows reconstructed fiber tracts with directed and signed weights. Benchmarking this method on Human Connectome Project data, we find that the model fits observed data well, outperforming a suite of null models. The estimated weights are subject-specific and highly reliable, even when fit using relatively few training samples. Next, we analyze the resulting network using graph-theoretic tools from network neuroscience, revealing bilaterally symmetric communities that span cerebral hemispheres. These communities exhibit a clear mapping onto known functional systems. We also study the shortest paths structure of this network, discovering that almost every edge participants in at least one shortest path. We also find evidence of asymmetric edge weights, that the network reconfigures in response to naturalistic stimuli, and that estimated edge weights differ with age. In summary, we offer a simple framework for weighting connectome data, demonstrating both its ease of implementation while benchmarking its utility for typical connectome analyses, including graph theoretic modeling and brain-behavior associations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Characterization of cardiac-induced noise in R2* maps of the brain</a></h4>

              
                Purpose Cardiac pulsation increases the noise level in brain maps of the MRI parameter R2*. Cardiac-induced noise is challenging to mitigate during the acquisition of R2* mapping data because the characteristics of this noise remain largely unknown. In this work, we characterize cardiac-induced noise in brain maps of the MRI parameter R2*. Methods We introduce a sampling strategy that enables the acquisition of multi-echo data in several intervals of the cardiac cycle. From this data, we estimate the variability of brain R2* maps due to cardiac-induced fluctuations and identify the most sensitive area of k-space. From these characteristics, we derive a novel sampling strategy that successfully mitigates cardiac-induced noise in R2* maps of the brain. Results In inferior brain regions, cardiac pulsation accounts for R2* variations of up to 3s-1 across the cardiac cycle, i.e. ~35% of the overall variability. Cardiac-induced fluctuations occur throughout the cardiac cycle and exhibit a reduced intensity during the first quarter of the cycle after the detection of the systole at the finger. 50-60% of the overall cardiac-induced noise is contained near the k-space centre (k < 0.074 mm-1), corresponding to 22% of voxels at 4mm resolution. The proposed cardiac noise mitigation strategy reduces the variability of R2* estimates across repetitions by 11% in the brainstem and 6% across the whole brain. Conclusion We provide characteristics of cardiac-induced noise in brain maps of the MRI parameter R2* that constitute a basis for the design of mitigation strategies during data acquisition.

                Dopamine neurons are characterized by their response to unexpected rewards, but they also fire during movement and aversive stimuli. Dopamine neuron diversity has been observed based on molecular expression profiles; however, whether different functions map onto such genetic subtypes remains unclear. Here, we establish that three genetic dopamine subtypes within the substantia nigra pars compacta each have a unique set of responses to rewards, aversive stimuli, accelerations and decelerations, and these signaling patterns are highly-correlated between somas and axons within subtypes. Remarkably, reward responses were not detected in one subtype, which instead displayed acceleration-correlated signaling. Our findings establish a connection between functional and genetic dopamine subtypes and demonstrate that molecular expression patterns can serve as a common framework to dissect dopaminergic functions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multi-modal and multi-model interrogation of large-scale functional brain networks</a></h4>

              
                Current whole-brain models are generally tailored to the modelling of a particular modality of data (e.g., fMRI or MEG/EEG). Although different imaging modalities reflect different aspects of neural activity, we hypothesise that this activity arises from common network dynamics. Building on the universal principles of self-organising delay-coupled nonlinear systems, we aim to link distinct electromagnetic and metabolic features of brain activity to the dynamics on the macroscopic structural connectome. To jointly predict dynamical and functional connectivity features of distinct signal modalities, we consider two large-scale models generating local short-lived 40 Hz oscillations with various degrees of realism - namely Stuart Landau (SL) and Wilson and Cowan (WC) models. To this end, we measure features of functional connectivity and metastable oscillatory modes (MOMs) in fMRI and MEG signals - and compare them against simulated data. We show that both models can represent MEG functional connectivity (FC) and functional connectivity dynamics (FCD) to a comparable degree, by varying global coupling and mean conduction time delay. For both models, the omission of delays dramatically decreased the performance. For fMRI, the SL model performed worse for FCD, highlighting the importance of balanced dynamics for the emergence of spatiotemporal patterns of ultra-slow dynamics. Notably, optimal working points varied across modalities and no model was able to achieve a correlation with empirical FC higher than 0.45 across modalities for the same set of parameters. Nonetheless, both displayed the emergence of FC patterns beyond the anatomical framework. Finally, we show that both models can generate MOMs with empirical-like properties. Our results demonstrate the emergence of static and dynamic properties of neural activity at different timescales from networks of delay-coupled oscillators at 40 Hz. Given the higher dependence of simulated FC on the underlying structural connectivity, we suggest that mesoscale heterogeneities in neural circuitry may be critical for the emergence of parallel cross-modal functional networks and should be accounted for in future modelling endeavours.

                During NREM sleep hippocampal Sharp-wave ripples (SWR) events are thought to stabilize memory traces for long-term storage in downstream neocortical structures. Within the neocortex, Default Mode Network (DMN) areas interact preferentially with the hippocampus purportedly to consolidate those traces. Transient bouts of slow oscillations and sleep spindles in DMN areas are often observed around SWRs, suggesting that these two activities are related and that their interplay possibly contributes to memory consolidation. To investigate how SWRs interact with the DMN and spindles, we combined cortical wide-field voltage imaging, ECoG, and hippocampal LFP recordings in anesthetized and sleeping mice. Here we show that, during SWR, ''up-states'' and spindles reliably co-occur in a cortical subnetwork centered around the Retrosplenial cortex. Furthermore, Retrosplenial transient activations and spindles predict Slow Gamma oscillations in CA1 during SWRs. Together, our results suggest that Retrosplenial-hippocampal interaction may be a central source of information exchange between cortex and hippocampus.

                Mixed findings have been reported for the nonconscious processing of fearful faces. Here, we used multivariate pattern analysis on electroencephalography data from three backward masking experiments to decode the conscious and nonconscious processing of fearful faces. Three groups of participants were shown pairs of faces that were presented either subliminally (16 ms) or supraliminally (266 ms) and were required to complete tasks where the face stimuli were either task-relevant (Experiment 1) or task-irrelevant (Experiments 2 and 3). We decoded the neural activity to examine the temporal dynamics of visual awareness, and to investigate whether the presence and location of a fearful face were processed when levels of awareness varied. The results reveal that the spatial location of fearful faces can be decoded from neural patterns only when they are consciously seen and relevant to participants' task. Nevertheless, the processing of the mere presence of fearful faces can occur in the absence of visual awareness, and the related neural patterns can be generalised to the conscious, non-spatial processing of fearful faces. Additionally, the flexibility of spatial attention seems to modulate the processing of fearful faces.

                Larvae of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster are a powerful study case for understanding the neural circuits underlying behavior. Indeed, the numerical simplicity of the larval brain has permitted the reconstruction of its synaptic connectome, and genetic tools for manipulating single, identified neurons allow neural circuit function to be investigated with relative ease and precision. We focus on one of the most complex neurons in the brain of the larva (of either sex), the GABAergic anterior paired lateral neuron (APL). Using behavioral and connectomic analyses, optogenetics, Ca2+ imaging and pharmacology, we study how APL affects associative olfactory memory. We first provide a detailed account of the structure, regional polarity, connectivity, and metamorphic development of APL, and further confirm that optogenetic activation of APL has an inhibiting effect on its main targets, the mushroom body Kenyon cells. All these findings are consistent with the previously identified function of APL in the sparsening of sensory representations. To our surprise, however, we found that optogenetically activating APL can also have a strong rewarding effect. Specifically, APL activation together with odor presentation establishes an odor-specific, appetitive, associative short-term memory, whereas naive olfactory behavior remains unaffected. An acute, systemic inhibition of dopamine synthesis as well as an ablation of the dopaminergic pPAM neurons impair reward learning through APL activation. Our findings provide a study case of complex circuit function in a numerically simple brain, and suggest a previously unrecognized capacity of central-brain GABAergic neurons to engage in dopaminergic reinforcement.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The neurophysiology of closed-loop auditory stimulation in sleep: a MEG study</a></h4>

              
                Closed-loop auditory stimulation (CLAS) is a brain modulation technique in which sounds are timed to enhance or disrupt endogenous neurophysiological events. CLAS of slow oscillation up-states in sleep is becoming a popular tool to study and potentially enhance sleep's functions, as it can increase slow oscillations, evoke sleep spindles, and enhance memory consolidation of certain tasks. However, few studies have examined the specific neurophysiological mechanisms involved in CLAS, in part because of practical limitations to commonly-used tools. To evaluate evidence for possible models of how sound stimulation during brain up-states might generate slow oscillations, we simultaneously recorded electro- and magnetoencephalography in human participants who received auditory stimulation across sleep stages and neural oscillation phases. The results suggest that auditory information reaches ventral frontal lobe areas via non-lemniscal pathways. From there, a slow oscillation is created and propagated. We demonstrate that while the state of excitability of tissue in auditory cortex and frontal ventral regions shows some synchrony with the EEG-recorded up-states that are commonly used for CLAS, it is the state of ventral frontal regions that is most critical for slow oscillation generation. Our findings advance models of how CLAS leads to enhancement of slow oscillations, sleep spindles, and associated cognitive benefits, and offer insight into how the effectiveness of brain stimulation techniques can be improved.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinct spatial maps and multiple object codes in the lateral entorhinal cortex</a></h4>

              
                The lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) is a major cortical input area to the hippocampus and it is crucial for associative object-place-context memories. An unresolved question is whether these associations are performed exclusively in the hippocampus or also upstream thereof. Anatomical evidence suggests that the LEC processes both object and spatial information. We here describe a gradient of spatial selectivity along the antero-posterior axis of the LEC. We demonstrate that the LEC generates distinct spatial maps for different contexts that are independent of object coding and vice versa, thus providing evidence for pure spatial and pure object codes upstream of the hippocampus. Whilst space and object coding occur by and large separately in the LEC, we identified neurons that encode for space and objects conjunctively. Together, these findings point to a scenario in which the LEC sustains both distinct space and object coding as well as associative space-object coding.

                Purpose This study aims to investigate Glioblastoma (GBM) cellular response to adhesion and metabolic inhibitors in the context of cell migration and cell-matrix adhesion properties. GBM is the most common incurable brain tumour. Decades of work into GBM chemical and molecular classification have identified mechanisms of drug resistance. Inhibitors targeting cancer cell migration and proliferation rarely take into consideration the heterogeneous migration property amongst cells, which may impact patients response to treatment. Methods Tissue samples were obtained from spatially distinct locations with different 5-aminolevulinic acid fluorescent intensities, strong strongly fluorescent tumour cores, a weak fluorescent tumour rim, and nonfluorescent tumour margins. Samples were previously shown to be associated with different motility and adhesion properties. We tested the cell response to adhesion and metabolic inhibitors using metabolic assays. Cell survival was also monitored using time-lapse microscopy, while cultured on low-modulus polydimethylsiloxane representative of the stiffness of brain tissue. Results Metabolic viability assays, MTT and Cell Titer, showed substantial heterogeneity in drug potency. Highly fluorescent tumour core cells were significantly more resistant to an F0F1 ATP synthase inhibitor (Gboxin), and a FAK inhibitor (GSK2256098), and cell proliferation ceased post-treatment in vitro. Cells derived from non-fluorescent tumour margins exhibited higher potency for the ATP synthase inhibitor (Gboxin). However, cell proliferation persisted post-treatment. Conclusion Our study suggests that the adhesive and migration properties of cells account for the sensitivity to therapeutics in different regions of the tumour in individual patients and between patients with GBM.

                PURPOSE: To evaluate the duration-dependent and synergetic impact of high-intensity light (HL) and optical refocus (RF) on lens-induced myopia (LIM) development in chickens. METHODS: Myopia was induced in one eye in chicks (10 groups, n=126) from day 1 post-hatching (D1) until D8 using -10D lenses. Fellow eyes remained uncovered as controls. Nine groups were exposed daily to continuous 2 hours (h), 4h, or 6h of either HL (15,000 lux); RF (removal of -10D lens); or both (HL+RF). One group served as the LIM group without any interventions. Ocular axial length (AL), refractive error, and choroidal thickness were measured on D1, D4, and D8. Outcome measures are expressed as inter-ocular difference (IOD= experimental - control eye) +/-SEM. RESULTS: By D8, LIM increased AL (0.36 +/- 0.04 mm), myopic refraction (-9.02 +/- 0.37D), and choroidal thinning (-90.27 +/- 16.44 micron) in the LIM group (all, P<0.001). Compared to the LIM group, exposure to 2h, 4h, or 6h of HL, RF, or HL+RF reduced myopic refraction in a duration-dependent manner, with RF being more effective than HL (P<0.05). Only 6h of HL+RF (not 2h or 4h) prevented LIM and was more effective than RF (P=0.004) or HL (P<0.001) in reducing myopic refraction, and more effective than HL (P<0.001) in reducing axial elongation. CONCLUSION: Daily exposure to 2h, 4h, or 6h of HL, RF, or HL+RF reduced lens-induced myopic refraction in a duration-dependent manner in chickens. Only 6h of HL+RF completely stopped LIM development. The synergetic effect of HL and RF is dependent on the duration of the interventions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Auditory cortical responses to speech are shaped by statistical learning of short-term speech input regularities</a></h4>

              
                Speech perception presents an exemplary model of how neurobiological systems flexibly adjust when input departs from the norm. Dialects, accents, and even head colds can negatively impact comprehension by shifting speech from listeners' expectations. Comprehension improves with exposure to shifted speech regularities, but there is no neurobiological model of this rapid learning. We used electroencephalography to examine human auditory cortical responses to utterances that varied only in fundamental frequency (F0, perceived as voice pitch) as we manipulated the statistical distributions of speech acoustics across listening contexts. Participants overtly categorized speech sampled across two acoustic dimensions that signal /b/ from /p/ (voice onset time [VOT] and F0) to model typical English speech regularities or an expectation-violating accent. These blocks were interleaved with passive exposure to two F0-distinguished test stimuli presented in an oddball ratio to elicit a cortical mismatch negativity (MMN) response. F0 robustly influenced speech categorization when short-term regularities aligned with English but F0 exerted no influence in the context of the accent. The short-term regularities modulated event-related potentials evoked by F0-distinguished test stimuli across both N1 and P3 temporal windows and, for P3 amplitude, there was a strong correlation with perceptual down-weighting of F0. The influence of the short-term regularities persisted to impact MMN in interleaved passive listening blocks when regularities mirrored English but were absent when regularities conveyed the accent. Thus, cortical response is modulated as a function of statistical regularities of the listening context, likely reflecting both early dimension encoding and later categorization.

                Lysosomal dysfunction is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD), and variants in several PD-associated genes, including LRRK2, perturb lysosomal homeostasis. Based on this, LRRK2 kinase inhibition is being explored as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of PD. LRRK2 inhibitors reduce levels of BMP, an endolysosomal lipid involved in glycosphingolipid (GSL) catabolism, in urine from preclinical models and clinical subjects, however, the mechanisms by which LRRK2 regulates BMP and the functional significance of this change to disease are undefined. We establish that LRRK2 regulates secretion of BMP- and GSL-containing vesicles from kidney into urine and modulates BMP and GSL levels in the brain. BMP accumulates within lysosomes as a secondary response to LRRK2's effects on the activity of glucocerebrosidase (GCase), a PD-linked enzyme involved in GSL catabolism. Alterations in BMP and GCase substrate turnover are observed in CSF from LRRK2-PD patients, highlighting the relevance of LRRK2-dependent lysosomal dysfunction in disease.

                Research on psychopathy has so far been largely limited to the investigation of high-level processes, such as emotion perception and regulation. In the present work, we investigate whether psychopathy has an effect on the estimation of fundamental physical parameters, which are computed in the brain during early stages of sensory processing. We employed a simple task in which participants had to estimate their interpersonal distance from a moving avatar and stop it at a given distance. The face expression of the avatars were positive, negative, or neutral. Participants carried out the task online on their home computers. We measured the psychopathy level via a self-report questionnaire. Regardless of the degree of psychopathy, the facial expression of the avatars showed no effect on distance estimation. Our results show that individuals with a high degree of psychopathy underestimate distance of approaching avatars significantly less (let the avatar approach them significantly closer) than did participants with a lesser degree of psychopathy. Moreover, participants who scored high in Self Centered Impulsivity underestimate the distance to approaching avatars significantly less (let the avatar approach closer) than participants with a low score. Distance estimation is considered an automatic process performed at early stages of visual processing. Therefore, our results imply that psychopathy affects basic early sensory processes, such as feature extraction, in the visual cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A single mild juvenile TBI in mice leads to regional brain tissue abnormalities at 12 months of age that correlate with cognitive impairment at the middle age in male mice</a></h4>

              
                Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has the highest incidence amongst the pediatric population and its mild severity represents the most frequent cases. Moderate and severe injuries as well as repetitive mild TBI result in lasting morbidity. However, whether a single mild TBI sustained during childhood can produce long-lasting modifications within the brain is still debated. We aimed to assess the consequences of a single juvenile mild TBI (jmTBI) at 12 months post-injury in a mouse model. Non-invasive diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) revealed significant microstructural alterations in the hippocampus and the in the substantia innominata/nucleus basalis (SI/NB), structures known to be involved in spatial learning and memory. DTI changes paralled neuronal loss, increased astrocytic AQP4 and microglial activation in the hippocampus. In contrast, decreased astrocytic AQP4 expression and microglia activation were observed in SI/NB. Spatial learning and memory were impaired and correlated with alterations in DTI-derived derived fractional ansiotropy (FA) and axial diffusivity (AD). This study found that a single juvenile mild TBI leads to significant region-specific DTI microstructural alterations, distant from the site of impact, that correlated with cognitive discriminative novel object testing and spatial memory impairments at 12 months after a single concussive injury. Our findings suggest that exposure to jmTBI leads to a chronic abnormality, which confirms the need for continued monitoring of symptoms and the development of long-term treatment strategies to intervene in children with concussions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Capturing the pathomechanisms of different disease severities in a human cerebral organoid model of LIS1-lissencephaly</a></h4>

              
                Lissencephaly is a developmental cortical malformation characterized by reduced to absent gyri and a disorganized cortex. Heterozygous mutations in the LIS1 gene, encoding a regulator of the microtubule-motor dynein, were identified to cause lissencephaly with different severities. While the clinical disease spectrum correlates with the degree of lissencephaly, location and type of mutation does not. Here we present forebrain-type organoids from LIS1 patients with mild, moderate or severe lissencephaly that reflect disease severity in the degree of alterations of cytoarchitecture and neurogenesis. ScRNAseq data point toward a severity related dysregulation of progenitor cell homeostasis. Furthermore, we show that severity dependent alteration in microtubule stabilization is critical for the development of the phenotype. In addition, we found alterations in niche-dependent WNT-signaling mainly in severe patient-derived organoids. Thus, our data identify for the first time a clear association between the clinical severity grade of the patients and the molecular phenotype in the organoid model, suggest linked disease-mechanisms and show the sensitivity of organoid-based systems to capture different disease severities in vitro.

                Evidence from previous studies supports the concept that spinal cord injury (SCI) induced neuropathic pain (NP) has its neural roots in the peripheral nervous system. There is uncertainty about how and to which degree nociceptors and mechanoreceptors contribute. Sensorimotor activation-based interventions (e.g. treadmill training) have been shown to reduce NP following experimental SCI, suggesting transmission of pain-alleviating signals through mechanoreceptors. At the same time, nociceptors have been shown to become hyperexcitable early after SCI and peptidergic axons sprout into deeper laminae of the below injury level dorsal horn. The aim of the present study is to comprehensively understand the relative contribution of each pathway in respect to NP presentation in a moderate mouse contusion SCI model. After genetic ablation of tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) expressing mechanoreceptors before SCI mechanical allodynia was reduced. The identical genetic ablation after SCI did not yield any change in pain behavior. CGRP sprouting into lamina III/IV below injury level as a consequence of SCI was not altered by either mechanoreceptor ablation. Moreover, detection of hyperexcitability in nociceptors, not in mechanoreceptors, in skin-nerve preparations from contusion SCI mice 7 days after injury makes a significant direct contribution of mechanoreceptors to NP maintenance unlikely. SNS reporter mice allowing specific visualization of the entire nociceptor population confirmed significant sprouting of respective neurons into laminae III/IV as early as 5 days post-injury. Genetic ablation of SNS-Cre mice severely affected their overall health condition, which precluded them to undergo experimental SCI and subsequent further analysis. Complementing animal data, quantitative sensory testing in human SCI subjects indicated reduced mechanical pain thresholds, whereas the mechanical detection threshold was not altered. Taken together, early mechanoreceptor ablation modulates pain behavior, most likely through indirect mechanisms. Hyperexcitable nociceptors with consecutive peptidergic fiber sprouting in the dorsal horn are confirmed as the likely main driver of SCI-induced NP. Future studies need to focus on injury-derived factors triggering early onset nociceptor hyperexcitability, which could serve as targets for more effective therapeutic interventions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Single-subject EEG measurement of interhemispheric transfer-time for the in-vivo estimation of axonal morphology</a></h4>

              
                Assessing axonal morphology in-vivo opens new avenues for the combined study of brain structure and function. A novel approach has recently been introduced to estimate the morphology of axonal fibers from the combination of MRI data and EEG measures of the interhemispheric transfer time (IHTT). In the original study, the IHTT measures were computed from EEG data averaged across a group, leading to bias of the axonal morphology estimates. Here, we seek to estimate axonal morphology from individual measures of IHTT, obtained from EEG data acquired in a visual evoked potential experiment. Subject-specific IHTTs are computed in a data-driven framework with minimal a priori constraints, based on the maximal peak of neural responses to visual stimuli within periods of statistically significant evoked activity in the inverse solution space. The subject-specific IHTT estimates ranged from 8 to 29 ms except for one participant and the between-session variability was comparable to the differences in IHTT between subjects. The scale parameter of the axonal radius distribution, computed from the IHTT estimates and the MRI data, ranged from 0 to 0.79 m. The change in axonal g-ratio with axonal radius ranged from 0.62 to 0.81 m-. The single-subject measurement of the IHTT yields estimates of axonal morphology that are consistent with histological values. However, improvement of the repeatability of the IHTT estimates is required to improve the specificity of the single-subject axonal morphology estimates.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Intermittent cocaine self-administration has sex-specific effects on addiction-like behaviors in rats</a></h4>

              
                Intermittent access (IntA) models of cocaine self-administration were developed to better model in rodents how cocaine is used by human drug users. Compared to traditional continuous access (ContA) models, IntA has been shown to enhance several pharmacological and behavioral effects of cocaine, but few studies have examined sex differences in IntA. Moreover, no one has examined the efficacy of cue extinction to reduce cocaine seeking in the IntA model, which has previously shown to be ineffective in other models that promote habit-like cocaine seeking. Therefore, rats were implanted with jugular vein catheters and dorsolateral striatum (DLS) cannulae and trained to self-administer cocaine paired with an audiovisual cue with ContA or IntA. In subsets of rats, we evaluated: the ability of Pavlovian cue extinction to reduce cue-induced drug seeking; motivation for cocaine using a progressive ratio procedure; compulsive cocaine taking by pairing cocaine infusions with footshocks; and dependence of drug-seeking on DLS dopamine (a measure of habit-like behavior) with the dopamine antagonist cis-flupenthixol. Overall, cue extinction reduced cue-induced drug seeking after ContA or IntA. Compared to ContA, IntA resulted in increased motivation for cocaine exclusively in females, but IntA facilitated more compulsive cocaine taking exclusively in males. After 10 days of IntA training, but not fewer, drug-seeking was dependent on DLS dopamine most notably in males. Our results suggest that IntA may be valuable for identifying sex differences in the early stages of drug use and provide a foundation for the investigation of the mechanisms involved.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inhibition stabilization and paradoxical effects in recurrent neural networks with short-term plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Inhibition stabilization is considered a ubiquitous property of cortical networks, whereby inhibition controls network activity in the presence of strong recurrent excitation. In networks with fixed connectivity, an identifying characteristic of inhibition stabilization is that increasing (decreasing) excitatory input to the inhibitory population leads to a decrease (increase) in inhibitory firing, known as the paradoxical effect. However, population responses to stimulation are highly nonlinear, and drastic changes in synaptic strengths induced by short-term plasticity (STP) can occur on the timescale of perception. How neuronal nonlinearities and STP affect inhibition stabilization and the paradoxical effect is unclear. Using analytical calculations, we demonstrate that in networks with STP the paradoxical effect implies inhibition stabilization, but inhibition stabilization does not imply the paradoxical effect. Interestingly, networks with neuronal nonlinearities and STP can transition non-monotonically between inhibition-stabilization and non-inhibition-stabilization, and between paradoxically- and non-paradoxically-responding regimes with increasing excitatory activity. In summary, our work reveals the relationship between inhibition stabilization and the paradoxical effect in the presence of neuronal nonlinearity and STP, yielding several testable predictions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Novel Mouse Model of Chronic Primary Pain Conditions that Integrates Clinically Relevant Genetic and Environmental Factors</a></h4>

              
                Chronic primary pain conditions (CPPCs) affect over 100 million people, predominantly women. Yet, they remain ineffectively treated due, in large part, to lack of valid animal models with translational relevance. Here, we characterized a novel mouse model of CPPCs that integrated clinically-relevant genetic (catechol-o-methyltransferase; COMT knockdown) and environmental (stress and minor injury) factors. Compared to wildtype mice, COMT+/- mice undergoing the repeated swim stress and molar extraction surgery intervention exhibited pronounced multi-site body pain and depressive-like behavior lasting more than 3 months. The COMT+/- mice undergoing the intervention also exhibited enhanced activity of primary afferent DRG nociceptors innervating hindpaw and back sites and increased plasma levels of norepinephrine and the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-17A. Notably, the pain and depressive-like behavior was of greater magnitude and longer duration (lasting at least 12 months) in females compared to males. Further, increases in anxiety-like behavior and IL-6 levels were female-specific. Intervention-induced body pain and nociception in COMT+/- mice was blocked by a beta-3 adrenergic antagonist, demonstrating predictive validity. Finally, the effect of COMT genotype x stress interactions on pain and IL-6 and IL-17A levels was observed in our clinical CPPC case-control cohort, demonstrating construct validity. Thus, our novel mouse model reliably recapitulates clinically- and biologically-relevant features of CPPCs and can be further implemented to test underlying mechanisms and discover new therapeutics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">SNARE protein tomosyn regulates dense core vesicle composition but not exocytosis in mammalian neurons</a></h4>

              
                Tomosyn is a large, non-canonical SNARE protein proposed to act as a competitive inhibitor of SNARE complex formation in vesicle exocytosis. In the brain, tomosyn inhibits fusion of synaptic vesicles (SVs), whereas its role in the fusion of neuropeptide-containing dense core vesicles (DCVs) is unknown. Here, we addressed this question using a new mouse model allowing conditional deletion of tomosyn (Stxbp5) and its paralogue tomosyn-2 (Stxbp5l), and an assay that detects DCV exocytosis with single vesicle resolution in primary hippocampal neurons. Surprisingly, loss of both tomosyns did not affect DCV exocytosis but resulted in a strong reduction of intracellular levels of many DCV cargos, most prominently brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), granin VGF and prohormone convertase PCSK1. Reduced levels of DCV cargos were paralleled by decreased DCV size and impaired mRNA expression of the corresponding genes. We conclude that tomosyns regulate neuropeptide and neurotrophin secretion via control of DCV cargo production, and not at the step of cargo release. Our findings suggest a differential effect of tomosyn on the two main secretory pathways in mammalian neurons and argues against a conserved role of tomosyn as competitive inhibitor of SNARE complex formation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Super-resolution STED imaging in the inner and outer whole-mount mouse retina</a></h4>

              
                Since its invention in 1994, super-resolution microscopy has become a popular tool for advanced imaging of biological structures, allowing visualisation of subcellular structures at a spatial scale below the diffraction limit. Thus, it is not surprising that recently, different super-resolution techniques are being applied in neuroscience, e.g. to resolve the clustering of neurotransmitter receptors and protein complex composition in presynaptic terminals. Still, the vast majority of these experiments were carried out either in cell cultures or very thin tissue sections, while there are only a few examples of super-resolution imaging in thick (> ~50 um) biological samples. In that context, the mammalian whole-mount retina has rarely been studied with super-resolution microscopy. Here, we aimed at establishing a stimulated-emission-depletion (STED) microscopy protocol for imaging whole-mount retina. To this end, we developed sample preparation including horizontal slicing of retinal tissue, an immunolabeling protocol with STED-compatible fluorophores and optimised the STED microscope's settings. We labelled subcellular structures in somata, dendrites, and axons of retinal ganglion cells in the inner mouse retina. Under optimal conditions, we achieved a mean lateral spatial resolution of ~120 nm (using the full width of half-maximum as a proxy) for the thinnest filamentous structures in our preparation and a resolution enhancement of two or higher compared to conventional confocal images. When combined with horizontal slicing of the retina, these settings allowed us visualisation of putative GABAergic horizontal cell synapses in the outer retina with a similar resolution. Taken together, we successfully established a STED protocol for reliable super-resolution imaging in the whole-mount mouse retina, which enables investigating, for instance, protein complex composition and cytoskeletal ultrastructure at retinal synapses in health and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain-based predictions of psychiatric illness-linked behaviors across the sexes</a></h4>

              
                Background: Individual differences in functional brain connectivity can be used to predict both the presence of psychiatric illness and variability in associated behaviors. However, despite evidence for sex differences in functional network connectivity and in the prevalence, presentation, and trajectory of psychiatric illnesses, the extent to which disorder-relevant aspects of network connectivity are shared or unique across the sexes remains to be determined. Methods: In this work, we used predictive modelling approaches to evaluate whether shared or unique functional connectivity correlates underlie the expression of psychiatric illness-linked behaviors in males and females in data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study (n=5260; 2571 females). Results: We demonstrate that functional connectivity profiles predict individual differences in externalizing behaviors in males and females, but only predict internalizing behaviors in females. Furthermore, models trained to predict externalizing behaviors in males generalize to predict internalizing behaviors in females, and models trained to predict internalizing behaviors in females generalize to predict externalizing behaviors in males. Finally, the neurobiological correlates of many behaviors are largely shared within and across sexes: functional connections within and between heteromodal association networks including default, limbic, control, and dorsal attention networks are associated with internalizing and externalizing behaviors as well as attentional deficits. Conclusions: Taken together, these findings suggest that shared neurobiological patterns may manifest as distinct behaviors across the sexes. These results highlight the need to consider factors beyond just neurobiology in the diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric illnesses.

	<p>Background: As the global population grows, there is an increasing demand for neurologic consultation that prompts new ways to reach more patients. Telemedicine can provide an accessible, cost-effective, and high-quality healthcare services. Objectives: In this article, we highlight recent developments, achievements, and challenges regarding outcomes, clinical care, tele-education, teletreatment, teleresearch, and cybersecurity for telemedicine applied to Parkinson&amp;amp;acute;s disease (PD) and other neurological conditions. Results: A growing body of evidence supports the feasibility and effectiveness of telemedicine tools for PD and other movement disorders. Outcome variables regarding satisfaction and efficacy in clinical care and specific issues about education, research, and treatment are reviewed. Additionally, a specific legal framework for teleconsultation has been developed in some centers worldwide. Yet, the implementation of telemedicine is conditioned by the limitations inherent to remote neurological examination, the variable computer usage literacy among patients, and the availability of a reliable internet connection. At present, telemedicine can be considered an additional tool in the clinical management of PD patients. Conclusions: There is an increasing use of remote clinical practice regarding the management of PD and other neurological conditions. Telemedicine is a new and promising tool aimed at special settings and subpopulations.</p>

	<p>High-density electroencephalography from visual and motor cortices in addition to kinematic hand and target movement recordings were used to investigate &amp;amp;tau;-coupling between brain activity patterns and physical movements in an interceptive timing task. Twelve adult participants were presented with a target car moving towards a destination at three constant accelerations, and an effector dot was available to intercept the car at the destination with a swift movement of the finger. A &amp;amp;tau;-coupling analysis was used to investigate involvement of perception and action variables at both the ecological scale of behavior and neural scale. By introducing the concept of resonance, the underlying dynamics of interceptive actions were investigated. A variety of one- and two-scale &amp;amp;tau;-coupling analyses showed significant differences in distinguishing between slow, medium, and fast target speed when car motion and finger movement, VEP and MRP brain activity, VEP and car motion, and MRP and finger movement were involved. These results suggested that the temporal structure present at the ecological scale is reflected at the neural scale. The results further showed a strong effect of target speed, indicating that &amp;amp;tau;-coupling constants k and kres increased with higher speeds of the moving target. It was concluded that &amp;amp;tau;-coupling can be considered a valuable tool when combining different types of variables at both the ecological and neural levels of analysis.</p>

	<p>High-altitude (HA) exposure affects cognitive functions, but studies have found inconsistent results. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effects of HA exposure on cognitive functions in healthy subjects. A structural overview of the applied neuropsychological tests was provided with a classification of superordinate cognitive domains. A literature search was performed using PubMed up to October 2021 according to PRISMA guidelines. Eligibility criteria included a healthy human cohort exposed to altitude in the field (at minimum 2440 m [8000 ft]) or in a hypoxic environment in a laboratory, and an assessment of cognitive domains. The literature search identified 52 studies (29 of these were field studies; altitude range: 2440 m&amp;amp;ndash;8848 m [8000&amp;amp;ndash;29,029 ft]). Researchers applied 112 different neuropsychological tests. Attentional capacity, concentration, and executive functions were the most frequently studied. In the laboratory, the ratio of altitude-induced impairments (64.7%) was twice as high compared to results showing no change or improved results (35.3%), but altitudes studied were similar in the chamber compared to field studies. In the field, the opposite results were found (66.4 % no change or improvements, 33.6% impairments). Since better acclimatization can be assumed in the field studies, the findings support the hypothesis that sufficient acclimatization has beneficial effects on cognitive functions at HA. However, it also becomes apparent that research in this area would benefit most if a consensus could be reached on a standardized framework of freely available neurocognitive tests.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Activation of β2-adrenergic receptors in microglia alleviates neuropathic hypersensitivity in mice</a></h4>

              
                Drugs enhancing the availability of noradrenaline are gaining prominence in the therapy of chronic neuropathic pain. However, underlying mechanisms are not well understood, and research has thus far focused on 2-adrenergic receptors and neuronal excitability. Adrenergic receptors are also expressed on glial cells, but their roles toward antinociception are not well deciphered. This study addresses the contribution of {beta}2-adrenergic receptors ({beta}2-ARs) to the therapeutic modulation of neuropathic pain in mice. We report that selective activation of {beta}2-ARs with Formoterol inhibits pro-inflammatory signaling in microglia ex-vivo and nerve injury-induced structural remodeling and functional activation of microglia in vivo. Systemic delivery of Formoterol inhibits behaviors related to neuropathic pain, such as mechanical hypersensitivity, cold allodynia and the aversive component of pain, and reverses chronically established neuropathic pain. Using conditional gene targeting for microglia-specific deletion of {beta}2-ARs, we demonstrate that the anti-allodynic effects of Formoterol are primarily mediated by microglia. Although Formoterol also reduces astrogliosis at late stages of neuropathic pain, these functions are unrelated to {beta}2-AR signaling in microglia. Our results underline the value of developing microglial {beta}2-AR agonists for relief from neuropathic pain and clarify mechanistic underpinnings.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Extracellular vesicles improve GABAergic transmission in Huntington's disease iPSC-derived neurons</a></h4>

              
                Extracellular vesicles (EVs) carry bioactive molecules associated with various biological processes, including miRNAs. In both Huntington's disease (HD) models and human samples, altered expression of miRNAs involved in synapse regulation were reported. Recently, the use of EV cargo to reverse phenotypic alterations in disease models with synaptopathy as the end-result of the pathophysiological cascade has become an interesting possibility. Here, we assessed the contribution of EVs to GABAergic synaptic alterations using a human HD model and studied the miRNA content of isolated EVs. After differentiating HD human induced-pluripotent stem cells into electrophysiologically active striatal-like GABAergic neurons, we found that HD-derived neurons displayed reduced density of inhibitory synapse markers and of GABA receptor-mediated ionotropic signaling. Treatment with EVs secreted by control (CTR) fibroblasts reversed the deficits in GABAergic synaptic transmission and increased the density of inhibitory synapses in HD-neuron cultures, while EVs from HD-derived fibroblasts had the opposite effects on CTR-neurons. Moreover, analysis of miRNAs from purified EVs identified a set of differentially expressed miRNAs between manifest HD, premanifest and CTR lines with predicted synaptic targets. The EVs-mediated reversal of the abnormal GABAergic phenotype in HD-derived neurons reinforces the potential role of EVs-miRNAs on synapse regulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Passive identification of subjective preferences towards individual items using eye-tracking in a virtual reality environment</a></h4>

              
                Usage of Virtual reality (VR) has been growing in many fields of research and therapy thanks to its immersive and gamified nature. Detection of the subjective experience of the users is thus essential for effective personalization of content. Eye-tracking (ET) data and specifically gaze, in two-dimensional tasks has been linked to value-based choices and emotional states. Therefore, here we aimed to develop a method for passive identification of subjective preferences based on ET data collected during a VR experience. For this purpose, we developed a naturalistic dynamic VR task where participants searched and looked at complex objects of pets and control shapes that appeared in pre-defined locations in random order. At the end of the task, participants ranked their preference, valence, and arousal of the items they saw during the task. ET data was recorded using a built-in binocular eye-tracker within the VR headset. We found that the median distance of gaze from the center of objects and the median gaze scan speed showed a significant interaction with object type (pets/shapes), as well as a significant positive relation to preference and valence rankings of pets. Our results suggest that ET could be used as a passive biomarker for detecting individual preferences and pleasantness, and in the future may enable successful personalization of VR content in real time for various applications.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Vocal learning-associated convergent evolution in mammalian proteins and regulatory elements</a></h4>

              
                Vocal learning, the ability to modify vocal behavior based on experience, is a convergently evolved trait in birds and mammals. To identify genomic elements associated with vocal learning, we integrated new experiments conducted in the brain of the Egyptian fruit bat with analyses of the genomes of 222 placental mammals. We first identified an anatomically specialized region of the bat motor cortex containing direct monosynaptic projections to laryngeal motoneurons. Using wireless neural recordings of this brain region in freely vocalizing bats, we verified that single neuron activity in this region relates to vocal production. We profiled the open chromatin of this vocal-motor region, which we used to train machine learning models to identify enhancers associated with vocal learning across mammals. We found 201 proteins and 45 candidate enhancers that display convergent evolution associated with vocal learning, many of which overlapped loci associated with human speech disability. One such locus contains the neurodevelopmental transcription factors TSHZ3 and ZNF536 and multiple candidate vocal learning-associated enhancers, suggesting the co-evolution of protein and regulatory sequences underlying vocal learning.

	<p>Objective: The aim of this paper is to provide a systematic review of research on physical exercise in real-world settings on executive function of typical children and adolescents. Methods: The CNKI, WOS, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and SPORTDiscus databases were searched by computer. Two researchers independently screened the literature, extracted data, and evaluated the risk of bias in the included literature. Statistical analysis was performed using frequency and percentage and the &amp;amp;chi;2 test. Results: A total of 49 articles was included. Acute (moderate intensity lasting 30&amp;amp;ndash;50 min) and long-term (interventions of moderate intensity of 30&amp;amp;ndash;50 min at least 3 times a week for 17 weeks or more) physical exercises in real-world settings have positive intervention effects on executive function. Furthermore, for acute interventions, closed skills are more efficient for inhibitory control, open skills are more efficient for working memory and cognitive flexibility, and open-continuous and closed-sequential skills are the most efficient; long-term interventions with open skills, sequential skills, and open-sequential skills are more effective. Conclusion: Physical exercise in real-world settings has a good promotion effect on typical children and adolescents, and motor skills with open and/or sequential attributes are more helpful in improving executive function.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Neurophysiological Modality Effect in Native and Second Language Processing: An ERP Study</a></h4>

              
                Experimental psychology has long discussed the modality effect, whereby the stimulus modality significantly affects retention of the information presented. In neurolinguistics, however, the effect of stimulus modality on language processing has gained little attention. We conducted a multi-modal event-related potential (ERP) experiment on both native and non-native Spanish speakers to investigate the possibility of a neurophysiological modality effect in language processing. Using morphosyntactically violated and orthographically/phonologically violated stimuli, we elicited a robust N400 and P600 in native speakers. We showed that the N400 has consistent features across modalities, while the P600 has modality-specific features. Specifically, the auditory evoked P600 was characterized by a more gradual slope and a later peak than the visual evoked P600. We discuss this in detail along with other modality effects observed post sensory perception. Among second language (L2) learner groups, those with higher proficiency exhibited more nativelike neurophysiological responses in both modalities when compared to those with lower proficiency. We additionally observed fewer modality-specific differences in low proficiency learners than in higher proficiency learners suggesting that modality-specific specialization in language processing comes with increased proficiency. We further discuss the question of modality-specific differences in the process of neurophysiological nativization, whereby L2 learners ERPs become increasingly on nativelike.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A data assimilation method to track time-varying changes in the excitation-inhibition balance using scalp EEG</a></h4>

              
                Recent neuroscience studies have suggested that control of the excitation and inhibition (E/I) balance is important to maintain normal brain function. However, an efficient method to evaluate the timevarying changes in E/I balance of the brain has yet to be established. To tackle this issue, we propose a new approach to estimate E/I balance changes, by applying the method of neural-mass model-based tracking of the brain state using the Ensemble Kalman Filter. In this method, the parameters regarding the synaptic E/I gains of the model are estimated from observed electroencephalography (EEG). Moreover, the index of E/I balance was defined by calculating the ratio between synaptic E/I gains based on estimated parameters. To validate this method, we applied it to numerical and human EEG data. As a result, we confirmed that our proposed method could estimate the E/I balance changes from observed human EEG.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A scalable and robust system for Audience EEG recordings</a></h4>

              
                The neural mechanisms that unfold when humans form a large group defined by an overarching context, such as audiences in theater or sports, are largely unknown and unexplored. This is mainly due to the lack of availability of a scalable system that can record the brain activity from a significantly large portion of such an audience simultaneously. Although the technology for such a system has been readily available for a long time, the high cost as well as the large overhead in human resources and logistic planning have prohibited the development of such a system. However, during the recent years reduction in technology costs and size have led to the emergence of low-cost, consumer-oriented EEG systems, developed primarily for recreational use. Here by combining such a low-cost EEG system with other off-the-shelve hardware and tailor-made software, we develop in the lab and test in a cinema such a scalable EEG hyper-scanning system. The system has a robust and stable performance and achieves accurate unambiguous alignment of the recorded data of the different EEG headsets. These characteristics combined with small preparation time and low-cost make it an ideal candidate for recording large portions of audiences.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuron secreted chemokine-like Orion is involved in the transformation of glial cells into phagocytes in different neuronal remodeling paradigms</a></h4>

              
                During animal development, neurons often form exuberant or incorrect axons and dendrites at early stages, followed by the refinement of neuronal circuits at late stages. Neural circuit refinement leads to the production of large amounts of neuronal debris in the form of neuronal cell corpses, fragmented axons and dendrites, and pruned synapses requiring disposal. In particular, the predominant phagocytes acting during the neuronal remodeling and degeneration are glial cells and critical signaling pathways between neurons and glia leading to phagocytosis are required. Chemokine-like mushroom body neuron secreted Orion ligand was shown to be essential to the astrocyte infiltration into the {gamma} axon bundle leading to {gamma} axon pruning and clearance of debris left from axon fragmentation. Here we show a role of orion also in debris engulfment and phagocytosis. Interestingly, we show that orion is also involved in the overall transformation of astrocytes into phagocytes. In addition, analysis of several neuronal paradigms demonstrates the role of orion in the elimination of both peptidergic vCrz+ and PDF-Tri neurons via additional phagocytic glial cells as cortex and/or ensheathing glia. Our results suggest that Orion is essential for phagocytic activation of three different types of glial cells: astrocytes, cortex and ensheathing glia and point to Orion as a trigger not only of glial infiltration but also engulfment and phagocytosis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Controlled delivery of ultrasound through the head for effective and safe therapies of the brain</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial focused ultrasound provides noninvasive and reversible approaches for precise and personalized manipulations of brain circuits, with the potential to transform our understanding of brain function and treatments of brain dysfunction. However, the effectiveness and safety of these approaches have been limited by the human head, which attenuates and distorts ultrasound strongly and unpredictably. To address this lingering barrier, we have developed a Relative Through-Transmit (RTT) approach that directly measures and compensates for the attenuation and distortion of a given skull and scalp. We have implemented RTT in hardware and demonstrated that it accurately restores the operator's intended intensities inside ex-vivo human skulls. Moreover, this functionality enabled effective and intensity-dependent transcranial modulation of nerves and effective release of defined doses of propofol inside the skull. RTT was essential for these new applications of transcranial ultrasound; when not applied, there were no significant differences from sham conditions. Moreover, RTT was safely applied in humans and accounted for all intervening obstacles including hair and ultrasound coupling. This method and hardware unlock the potential of ultrasound-based approaches to provide effective, safe, and reproducible precision therapies of the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Motion Impact Score for Detecting Spurious Brain-Behavior Associations</a></h4>

              
                Between-participant differences in head motion introduce systematic bias to resting state fMRI brain-wide association studies (BWAS) that is not completely removed by denoising algorithms. Researchers who study traits, or phenotypes associated with in-scanner head motion (e.g. psychiatric disorders) need to know if trait-functional connectivity (FC) correlations are biased by residual motion artifact in order to avoid reporting false positive results. We devised an adaptable method, Split Half Analysis of Motion Associated Networks (SHAMAN), to assign a motion impact score to specific trait-FC correlations. The SHAMAN approach distinguishes between motion artifact causing false positive vs false negative bias. SHAMAN was > 95% specific at sample sizes of n = 100 and above. SHAMAN was 95% sensitive to detection of false positive motion impact score at sample sizes of n = 3,000 but only 59% sensitive to detection of false negative motion impact score, making it most useful for large BWAS. We computed motion impact scores for trait-FC correlations with 45 demographic, biophysical, cognitive, and personality traits from n = 7,270 participants in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. After standard denoising with ABCD-BIDS and without motion censoring, 60% (27/45) of traits had significant (p < 0.05) false positive motion impact scores and 36% (16/45) of traits had false negative motion impact scores. Censoring at framewise displacement (FD) < 0.2 mm reduced the proportion of traits with significant false positive motion impact scores from 60% to 2% (1/45) but did not decrease the number of traits with significant false negative motion impact scores.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">LIQ HD (Lick Instance Quantifier Home cage Device): An open-source tool for recording undisturbed two-bottle drinking behavior in a home cage environment</a></h4>

              
                Investigation of rodent drinking behavior has provided insight into drivers of thirst, circadian rhythms, anhedonia, and drug and ethanol consumption. Traditional methods of recording fluid intake involve periodically weighing bottles, which is cumbersome and lacks temporal resolution. Several open-source devices have been designed to improve drink monitoring, particularly for two-bottle choice tasks. However, recent designs are limited by the use of infrared photobeam-break sensors and incompatibility with prolonged undisturbed use in ventilated home cages. Beam-break sensors lack accuracy for bout microstructure analysis and are prone to damage from rodents. To address these concerns, we designed LIQ HD (Lick Instance Quantifier Home cage Device) with the goal of utilizing capacitive sensors to increase accuracy and analyze lick microstructure, building a device compatible with ventilated vivarium home cages, increasing scale with prolonged undisturbed recordings, and creating a design that is easy to build and use with an intuitive touchscreen graphical user interface. The system tracks two-bottle choice licking behavior in up to 18 rodent home cages, or 36 single bottles, on a minute-to-minute timescale controlled by a single Arduino microcontroller. The data are logged to a single SD card, allowing for efficient downstream analysis. With sucrose, quinine, and ethanol two-bottle choice tasks, we validated that LIQ HD has superior accuracy compared to beam-break sensors. The system measures preference over time and changes in bout microstructure, with undisturbed recordings lasting up to 7 days. All designs and software are open-source to allow other researchers to build upon the system and adapt LIQ HD to their animal home cages.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Significantly reduced inflammatory foreign-body-response to neuroimplants and improved recording performance in young compared to adult rats</a></h4>

              
                The multicellular inflammatory encapsulation of implanted intracortical multielectrode arrays (MEA) is associated with severe deterioration of their field potentials' (FP) recording performance, which thus limits the use of brain implants in basic research and clinical applications. Therefore, extensive efforts have been made to identify the conditions in which the inflammatory foreign body response (FBR) is alleviated, or to develop methods to mitigate the formation of the inflammatory barrier. Here, for the first time, we show that (1) in young rats (74{+/-}8 gr, 4 weeks old at the onset of the experiments), cortical tissue recovery following MEA implantation proceeds with ameliorated inflammatory scar as compared to adult rats (242{+/-}18 gr, 9 weeks old at the experimental onset); (2) in contrast to adult rats in which the Colony Stimulating factor 1 Receptor (CSF1R) antagonist chow eliminated ~95% of the cortical microglia but not microglia adhering to the implant surfaces, in young rats the microglia adhering to the implant were eliminated along with the parenchymal microglia population. The removal of microglia adhering to the implant surfaces was correlated with improved recording performance by in-house fabricated Perforated Polyimide MEA Platforms (PPMP). These results support the hypothesis that microglia adhering to the surface of the electrodes, rather than the multicellular inflammatory scar, is the major underlying mechanism that deteriorates implant recording performance, and that young rats provide an advantageous model to study months-long, multisite electrophysiology in freely behaving rats.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The development of the relationship between auditory and visual neural sensitivity and autonomic arousal from 6m to 12m</a></h4>

              
                The differential sensitivity hypothesis argues that environmental sensitivity has the bivalent effect of predisposing individuals to both the risk-inducing and development-enhancing influences of early social environments. However, the hypothesis requires that this variation in environmental sensitivity be general across domains. In this study, we focused on neural sensitivity and autonomic arousal to test domain generality. Neural sensitivity can be assessed by correlating measures of perceptual sensitivity, as indexed by event-related potentials (ERP) in electrophysiology. The sensitivity of autonomic arousal can be tested via heart rate changes. Domain generality was tested by comparing associations in perceptual sensitivity across auditory and visual domains, and associations between sensitivity in sensory domains and heart rate We contrasted ERP components in auditory (P3) and visual (P1, N290 and P4) detection-of-difference tasks for N=68 infants longitudinally at 6 and 12 months of age. Domain generality should produce correlated individual differences in sensitivity across the two modalities, with higher levels of autonomic arousal associating with increased perceptual sensitivity. Having controlled for multiple comparisons, at 6 months of age, the difference in amplitude of the P3 component evoked in response to standard and deviant tones correlated with the difference in amplitude of the P1 N290 and P4 face-sensitive components evoked in response to fearful and neutral faces. However, this correlation was not found at 12 months of age. Similarly, autonomic arousal negatively correlated with neural sensitivity at 6 months but not at 12 months. The results suggest neural perceptual sensitivity is domain-general across auditory and visual domains, and is related to autonomic arousal at 6 months but not at 12 months of age. We interpret these findings within a neuroconstructivist framework and with respect to the concept of interactive specialisation. By 12 months of age, more experience of visual processing may have led to top-down endogenous attention mechanisms that process visual information in a way that no longer associates with auditory perceptual sensitivity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Having "multiple selves" helps learning agents explore and adapt in complex changing worlds</a></h4>

              
                Satisfying a variety of conflicting needs in a changing environment is a fundamental challenge for any adaptive agent. Here, we show that designing an agent in a modular fashion as a collection of sub-agents, each dedicated to a separate need, powerfully enhanced the agent's capacity to satisfy its overall needs. We used the formalism of deep reinforcement learning to investigate a biologically relevant multi-objective task: continually maintaining homeostasis of a set of physiologic variables. We then conducted simulations in a variety of environments and compared how modular agents performed relative to standard monolithic agents (i.e., agents that aimed to satisfy all needs in an integrated manner using a single aggregate measure of success). Simulations revealed that modular agents: a) exhibited a form of exploration that was intrinsic and emergent rather than extrinsically imposed; b) were robust to changes in non-stationary environments, and c) scaled gracefully in their ability to maintain homeostasis as the number of conflicting objectives increased. Supporting analysis suggested that the robustness to changing environments and increasing numbers of needs were due to intrinsic exploration and efficiency of representation afforded by the modular architecture. These results suggest that the normative principles by which agents have adapted to complex changing environments may also explain why humans have long been described as consisting of 'multiple selves'.

                Disruptions in capillary flow have the potential to drive pathology across numerous diseases. But our understanding of the temporal and spatial dynamics of these events are hindered by slow volumetric imaging rates and the reliance on laborious manual analysis to process data. To address the challenges of increasing volumetric imaging speed, we use a custom-built Bessel beam two-photon microscope for efficient volumetric imaging of the capillary network. We demonstrate its ability to continuously monitor roughly 200 capillaries for capillary flow stoppages (i.e. stalling events) at a frame rate of approximately 0.5 Hz and develop a semi-automated correlation-based approach for identifying these stalling events. We applied our system and algorithm in a photothrombotic model of stroke and show elevated levels of stalling 1-week post-stroke in regions both within and outside of the stroke region, demonstrating that stalling may have impacts on stroke recovery that extend past the acute stage.

                Postpartum depression (PPD) is a major psychiatric complication of childbirth, affecting up to 20% of mothers, yet remains understudied. Mitochondria, dynamic organelles crucial for cell homeostasis and energy production, share links with many of the proposed mechanisms underlying PPD pathology. Brain mitochondrial function is affected by stress, a major risk factor for development of PPD, and is linked to anxiety-like and social behaviors. Considering the importance of mitochondria in regulating brain function and behavior, we hypothesized that mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with behavioral alterations in a chronic stress-induced rat model of PPD. Using a validated and translationally relevant chronic mild unpredictable stress paradigm during late gestation, we induced PPD-relevant behaviors in adult postpartum Wistar rats. In the mid-postpartum, we measured mitochondrial function in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) using high-resolution respirometry. We then measured protein expression of mitochondrial complex proteins and 4-hydroxynonenal (a marker of oxidative stress), and Th1/Th2 cytokine levels in PFC and plasma. We report novel findings that gestational stress decreased mitochondrial function in the PFC, but not the NAc of postpartum dams. However, in groups controlling for the effects of either stress or parity alone, no differences in mitochondrial respiration measured in either brain regions were observed compared to nulliparous controls. This decrease in PFC mitochondrial function in stressed dams was accompanied by negative behavioral consequences in the postpartum, complex-I specific deficits in protein expression, and increased Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha cytokine levels in plasma and PFC. Overall, we report an association between PFC mitochondrial respiration, PPD-relevant behaviors, and inflammation following gestational stress, highlighting a potential role for mitochondrial function in postpartum health.

                Exposure to drugs of abuse causes long-lasting changes in connectivity to ventral tegmental area dopamine cells that contribute to drug-induced behavioral adaptations. However, it is not known which inputs are altered, largely due to technological limitations of previous methods. Here we used a rabies virus-based mapping strategy to quantify rabies-labeled inputs to ventral tegmental area cells after a single exposure to one of a variety of abused drugs, such as cocaine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, morphine, and nicotine, and compared the relative global input labeling across conditions using dimensionality reduction approaches. We observed that all tested drugs of abuse elicited input changes onto dopamine cells, in particular those projecting to the lateral shell of the nucleus accumbens and amygdala, and that these changes were common to all drugs tested. Interestingly, we also noticed that animals anesthetized with a ketamine/xylazine mixture exhibit a different brain-wide input pattern from those anesthetized with isoflurane, indicating that the method of anesthesia can influence rabies input labeling by inducing long-lasting changes in circuit connectivity. In addition, many input changes were common between animals anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and those anesthetized with isoflurane but also given a single dose of a drug of abuse, suggesting that the ketamine/xylazine mixture can induce these long-lasting input changes. We found that many of the brain regions that exhibited changes in rabies input labeling in drug- vs. saline-treated mice were preferentially interconnected, and that select communities of brain regions showed similar changes for both drugs of abuse and ketamine/xylazine anesthesia. Lastly, the basal expression patterns of several gene classes were highly correlated with the extent of both addictive drug- or ketamine/xylazine-induced input changes, especially calcium channels. These results indicate that the expression of calcium channels is related to whether these inputs to dopamine cells are altered by drug exposure. Furthermore, ketamine/xylazine anesthesia induces a similar but different set of long-lasting input changes onto midbrain dopamine cells, indicating that caution should be taken when using ketamine/xylazine-based anesthesia in rodents when assessing motivated behaviors.

	<p>Introduction: Fatigue is one of the most common and disabling symptoms of Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease (PD). The occurrence and clinical features of fatigue in patients with prodromal PD remain largely elusive. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and clinical characteristics of fatigue in patients with idiopathic/isolated REM sleep behavior disorders (iRBD). Methods: A total of 97 polysomnography-confirmed iRBD patients were enrolled in this study. A comprehensive neurological assessment (including motor and non-motor assessment) was performed. Fatigue was assessed using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). Motor and non-motor characteristics were compared between iRBD patients with and without fatigue. Logistic regression was used to identify the factors associated with fatigue. Results: The prevalence of fatigue was 35.05%. Compared to the non-fatigue patients, patients with fatigue had higher non-motor symptom scale (NMSS) score (p = 0.009), higher Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) score (p = 0.002), and a higher prevalence of orthostatic hypotension (p = 0.021). Multivariate regression analysis showed that depression (OR 4.17, 95% CI 1.13&amp;amp;ndash;15.49, p = 0.033) and orthostatic hypotension (OR 2.80, 95% CI 1.09&amp;amp;ndash;7.18, p = 0.032) were significantly associated with fatigue in iRBD patients. Additionally, both NMSS (rs = 0.310, p = 0.002) and HAMD (rs = 0.385, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) scores were mildly correlated with fatigue severity. Conclusion: Our study showed that fatigue is common in patients with iRBD. In addition, depression and orthostatic hypotension were independently associated with fatigue in iRBD patients.</p>

	<p>Sepsis-Associated Encephalopathy (SAE) is common in sepsis patients, with high mortality rates. It is believed that neuroinflammation is an important mechanism involved in SAE. High mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), as a late pro-inflammatory factor, is significantly increased during sepsis in different brain regions, including the hippocampus. HMGB1 causes neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment through direct binding to advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Electroacupuncture (EA) at Baihui (GV20) and Zusanli (ST36) is beneficial for neurological diseases and experimental sepsis. Our study used EA to treat SAE induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in male Sprague&amp;amp;ndash;Dawley rats. The Y maze test was performed to assess working memory. Immunofluorescence (IF) and Western blotting (WB) were used to determine neuroinflammation and the HMGB1 signaling pathway. Results showed that EA could improve working memory impairment in rats with SAE. EA alleviated neuroinflammation by downregulating the hippocampus&amp;amp;rsquo;s HMGB1/TLR4 and HMGB1/RAGE signaling, reducing the levels of pro-inflammatory factors, and relieving microglial and astrocyte activation. However, EA did not affect the tight junctions&amp;amp;rsquo; expression of the blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier (BBB) in the hippocampus.</p>

	<p>Background: Many neurological manifestations are part of COVID-19 infections, including movement disorders, but a clinical picture closely resembling stiff-person syndrome has not yet been described. Case presentation: We report a case of a stiff-person-like syndrome in the context of COVID-19 infection. A 79-year-old woman, with no prior history of diseases, presented global reversible stiffness associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We aim to shed light on several particularities regarding this clinical picture and its evolution in close relationship with the infectious disease progression, with full regression of symptoms and signs once the infectious process ceased. The impairment of speech and motility caused the wrong diagnosis of stroke in the Emergency Room. In addition, we would also like to emphasize the concomitant rhabdomyolysis, closely linked to the grade of muscle rigidity. Conclusions: We would like to raise awareness regarding this clinical setting and its association with SARS-COV-2 infection, to aid in its future recognition and management. To our knowledge, this is the first case of a stiff-person-like syndrome to be described in association with COVID-19 infection.</p>

	<p>Epilepsy is one of the most serious nervous system diseases; it can be diagnosed accurately by video electroencephalogram. In this study, we analyzed microstate epileptic electroencephalogram (EEG) to aid in the diagnosis and identification of epilepsy. We recruited patients with focal epilepsy and healthy participants from the Third Xiangya Hospital and recorded their resting EEG data. In this study, the EEG data were analyzed by microstate analysis, and the support vector machine (SVM) classifier was used for automatic epileptic EEG classification based on features of the EEG microstate series, including microstate parameters (duration, occurrence, and coverage), linear features (median, second quartile, mean, kurtosis, and skewness) and non-linear features (Petrosian fractal dimension, approximate entropy, sample entropy, fuzzy entropy, and Lempel&amp;amp;ndash;Ziv complexity). In the gamma sub-band, the microstate parameters as a model were the best for interictal epilepsy recognition, with an accuracy of 87.18%, recall of 70.59%, and an area under the curve of 94.52%. There was a recognition effect of interictal epilepsy through the features extracted from the EEG microstate, which varied within the 4~45 Hz band with an accuracy of 79.55%. Based on the SVM classifier, microstate parameters and EEG features can be effectively used to classify epileptic EEG, and microstate parameters can better classify epileptic EEG compared with EEG features.</p>

	<p>Background: Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) is effective for treating major depressive disorder (MDD). We aimed to explore the modulating effect of prolonged longitudinal taVNS on the striatal subregions&amp;amp;rsquo; functional connectivity (FC) in MDD patients. Methods: Sixteen MDD patients were enrolled and treated with taVNS for 8 weeks. Sixteen healthy control subjects (HCs) were recruited without intervention. The resting-state FC (rsFC) based on striatal subregion seed points and the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) were evaluated in the MDD patients and HCs at baseline and after 8 weeks. A two-way ANCOVA test was performed on each rsFC metric to obtain the (group-by-time) interactions. Results: The rsFC values between the left ventral caudate (vCa) and right ventral prefrontal cortex (vPFC), and between the right nucleus accumbens (NAc) and right dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) are lower in the MDD patients compared to the HCs at baseline, and increase following taVNS; the rsFC values between the left vCa and right, superior occipital gyrus (SOG), and between the left dorsal caudate (dCa) and right cuneus are higher in MDD patients and decrease following taVNS. Conclusions: Prolonged longitudinal taVNS can modulate the striatum rsFC with the prefrontal cortex, occipital cortex, temporal cortex, and intra-striatum, and these changes partly underlie any symptomatic improvements. The results indicate that prolonged longitudinal taVNS may produce beneficial treatment effects by modulating the cortical striatum circuitry in patients with MDD.</p>

	<p>The identification of reliable biomarkers in biological fluids is paramount to optimizing the diagnosis of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD). Measurement of A&amp;amp;beta;42, t-tau, and p-tau in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is the most accepted method to support the diagnosis of AD. However, lumbar puncture represents an invasive investigation, whereas saliva is one of the most accessible body fluids. The aim of our study was to investigate salivary concentrations in AD and evaluate the correlation between salivary and CSF A&amp;amp;beta;42 concentrations in AD patients, patients with non-AD dementias, and controls. We recruited 100 subjects: 18 AD patients, 64 patients with non-AD dementias, and 18 controls. The mean saliva A&amp;amp;beta;42 concentrations in AD patients were higher than in controls (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and to patients with non-AD dementias (p = 0.001). A significant negative correlation between salivary and CSF A&amp;amp;beta;42 concentrations was found in the overall group (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.562, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and in non-AD patients (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.443, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Salivary A&amp;amp;beta;42 concentrations positively correlated with CSF t-tau (r = 0.321, p = 0.001) and p-tau (r = 0.297, p = 0.001). Our study showed that in AD patients&amp;amp;rsquo; saliva, A&amp;amp;beta;42 concentrations are specifically increased, and we found an interesting negative correlation between CSF and salivary A&amp;amp;beta;42 concentrations that warrants further investigation.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Interacting active surfaces: A model for three-dimensional cell aggregates</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alejandro Torres-Sánchez, Max Kerr Winter, Guillaume Salbreux</p>

We introduce a modelling and simulation framework for cell aggregates in three dimensions based on interacting active surfaces. Cell mechanics is captured by a physical description of the acto-myosin cortex that includes cortical flows, viscous forces, active tensions, and bending moments. Cells interact with each other via short-range forces capturing the effect of adhesion molecules. We discretise the model equations using a finite element method, and provide a parallel implementation in C++. We discuss examples of application of this framework to small and medium-sized aggregates: we consider the shape and dynamics of a cell doublet, a planar cell sheet, and a growing cell aggregate. This framework opens the door to the systematic exploration of the cell to tissue-scale mechanics of cell aggregates, which plays a key role in the morphogenesis of embryos and organoids.

Are selection and control of action serial processes of separate neural modules? A new study in PLOS Biology argues against this and in favor of an integrated process distributed across multiple brain regions, each contributing in a distinct way.

Are selection and control of action serial processes of separate neural modules? This Primer explores a study in PLOS Biology which argues against this and in favor of an integrated process distributed over multiple brain regions, each contributing in a distinct way.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Generating colorblind-friendly scatter plots for single-cell data</a></h4>

              
                Reduced-dimension or spatial <i>in situ</i> scatter plots are widely employed in bioinformatics papers analyzing single-cell data to present phenomena or cell-conditions of interest in cell groups. When displaying these cell groups, color is frequently the only graphical cue used to differentiate them. However, as the complexity of the information presented in these visualizations increases, the usefulness of color as the only visual cue declines, especially for the sizable readership with color-vision deficiencies (CVDs). In this paper, we present scatterHatch, an R package that creates easily interpretable scatter plots by redundant coding of cell groups using colors as well as patterns. We give examples to demonstrate how the scatterHatch plots are more accessible than simple scatter plots when simulated for various types of CVDs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Clonal transcriptomics identifies mechanisms of chemoresistance and empowers rational design of combination therapies</a></h4>

              
                Tumour heterogeneity is thought to be a major barrier to successful cancer treatment due to the presence of drug resistant clonal lineages. However, identifying the characteristics of such lineages that underpin resistance to therapy has remained challenging. Here, we utilise clonal transcriptomics with WILD-seq; <b>W</b>holistic <b>I</b>nterrogation of <b>L</b>ineage <b>D</b>ynamics by <b>seq</b>uencing, in mouse models of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) to understand response and resistance to therapy, including BET bromodomain inhibition and taxane-based chemotherapy. These analyses revealed oxidative stress protection by NRF2 as a major mechanism of taxane resistance and led to the discovery that our tumour models are collaterally sensitive to asparagine deprivation therapy using the clinical stage drug L-asparaginase after frontline treatment with docetaxel. In summary, clonal transcriptomics with WILD-seq identifies mechanisms of resistance to chemotherapy that are also operative in patients and pin points asparagine bioavailability as a druggable vulnerability of taxane-resistant lineages.

                Learning from a limited number of experiences requires suitable inductive biases. To identify how inductive biases are implemented in and shaped by neural codes, we analyze sample-efficient learning of arbitrary stimulus-response maps from arbitrary neural codes with biologically-plausible readouts. We develop an analytical theory that predicts the generalization error of the readout as a function of the number of observed examples. Our theory illustrates in a mathematically precise way how the structure of population codes shapes inductive bias, and how a match between the code and the task is crucial for sample-efficient learning. It elucidates a bias to explain observed data with simple stimulus-response maps. Using recordings from the mouse primary visual cortex, we demonstrate the existence of an efficiency bias towards low frequency orientation discrimination tasks for grating stimuli and low spatial frequency reconstruction tasks for natural images. We reproduce the discrimination bias in a simple model of primary visual cortex, and further show how invariances in the code to certain stimulus variations alter learning performance. We extend our methods to time-dependent neural codes and predict the sample efficiency of readouts from recurrent networks. We observe that many different codes can support the same inductive bias. By analyzing recordings from the mouse primary visual cortex, we demonstrate that biological codes have lower total activity than other codes with identical bias. Finally, we discuss implications of our theory in the context of recent developments in neuroscience and artificial intelligence. Overall, our study provides a concrete method for elucidating inductive biases of the brain and promotes sample-efficient learning as a general normative coding principle.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A timer gene network is spatially regulated by the terminal system in the Drosophila embryo</a></h4>

              
                In insect embryos, anteroposterior patterning is coordinated by the sequential expression of the 'timer' genes <i>caudal</i>, <i>Dichaete</i> and <i>odd-paired</i>, whose expression dynamics correlate with the mode of segmentation. In <i>Drosophila</i>, the timer genes are expressed broadly across much of the blastoderm, which segments simultaneously, but their expression is delayed in a small 'tail' region, just anterior to the hindgut, which segments during germband extension. Specification of the tail and the hindgut depends on the terminal gap gene <i>tailless</i>, but beyond this the regulation of the timer genes is poorly understood. We used a combination of multiplexed imaging, mutant analysis, and gene network modelling to resolve the regulation of the timer genes, identifying 11 new regulatory interactions and clarifying the mechanism of posterior terminal patterning. We propose that a dynamic Tailless expression gradient modulates the intrinsic dynamics of a timer gene cross-regulatorymodule, delineating the tail region and delaying its developmental maturation.

                The human endometrium experiences repetitive cycles of tissue wounding characterised by piecemeal shedding of the surface epithelium and rapid restoration of tissue homeostasis. In this study we used a mouse model of endometrial repair and three transgenic lines of mice to investigate whether epithelial cells that become incorporated into the newly formed luminal epithelium have their origins in one or more of the mesenchymal cell types present in the stromal compartment of the endometrium. Using scRNAseq we identified a novel population of PDGFRb+ mesenchymal stromal cells that developed a unique transcriptomic signature in response to endometrial breakdown/repair. These cells expressed genes usually considered specific to epithelial cells and in silico trajectory analysis suggested they were stromal fibroblasts in transition to becoming epithelial cells. To confirm our hypothesis we used a lineage tracing strategy to compare the fate of stromal fibroblasts (PDGFRa+) and stromal perivascular cells (NG2/CSPG4+). We demonstrated that stromal fibroblasts can undergo a mesenchyme to epithelial transformation and become incorporated into the re-epithelialised luminal surface of the repaired tissue. This study is the first to discover a novel population of wound-responsive, plastic endometrial stromal fibroblasts that contribute to the rapid restoration of an intact luminal epithelium during endometrial repair. These findings form a platform for comparisons both to endometrial pathologies which involve a fibrotic response (Asherman’s syndrome, endometriosis) as well as other mucosal tissues which have a variable response to wounding.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Lifespan extension in female mice by early, transient exposure to adult female olfactory cues</a></h4>

              
                Several previous lines of research have suggested, indirectly, that mouse lifespan is particularly susceptible to endocrine or nutritional signals in the first few weeks of life, as tested by manipulations of litter size, growth hormone levels, or mutations with effects specifically on early-life growth rate. The pace of early development in mice can also be influenced by exposure of nursing and weanling mice to olfactory cues. In particular, odors of same-sex adult mice can in some circumstances delay maturation. We hypothesized that olfactory information might also have a sex-specific effect on lifespan, and we show here that lifespan of female mice can be increased significantly by odors from adult females administered transiently, i.e. from 3 days until 60 days of age. Female lifespan was not modified by male odors, nor was male lifespan susceptible to odors from adults of either sex. Conditional deletion of the G protein Gαo in the olfactory system, which leads to impaired accessory olfactory system function and blunted reproductive priming responses to male odors in females, did not modify the effect of female odors on female lifespan. Our data provide support for the idea that very young mice are susceptible to influences that can have long-lasting effects on health maintenance in later life, and provide a potential example of lifespan extension by olfactory cues in mice.

                Systems genetics holds the promise to decipher complex traits by interpreting their associated SNPs through gene regulatory networks derived from comprehensive multi-omics data of cell types, tissues, and organs. Here, we propose SpecVar to integrate paired chromatin accessibility and gene expression data into context-specific regulatory network atlas and regulatory categories, conduct heritability enrichment analysis with GWAS summary statistics, identify relevant tissues, and depict common genetic factors acting in the shared regulatory networks between traits by relevance correlation. Our method improves power upon existing approaches by associating SNPs with context-specific regulatory elements to assess heritability enrichments and by explicitly prioritizing gene regulations underlying relevant tissues. Ablation studies, independent data validation, and comparison experiments with existing methods on GWAS of six phenotypes show that SpecVar can improve heritability enrichment, accurately detect relevant tissues, and reveal causal regulations. Furthermore, SpecVar correlates the relevance patterns for pairs of phenotypes and better reveals shared SNP associated regulations of phenotypes than existing methods. Studying GWAS of 206 phenotypes in UK-Biobank demonstrates that SpecVar leverages the context-specific regulatory network atlas to prioritize phenotypes' relevant tissues and shared heritability for biological and therapeutic insights. SpecVar provides a powerful way to interpret SNPs via context-specific regulatory networks and is available at https://github.com/AMSSwanglab/SpecVar.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical Reactivation of Non-Spatial and Spatial Memory Representations Coordinate with Hippocampus to Form a Memory Dialogue</a></h4>

              
                Episodic memory depends on the association of diverse attribute representations that are distributed across the neocortex, and evidence suggests that these attributes are linked, at least initially, by the hippocampus, which orchestrates retrieval and the offline replay of experience during memory consolidation. The dynamics that characterize this hippocampal-cortical dialogue, however, are only partly understood. Although it was originally proposed that replay is initiated in CA3, with the spontaneous emission of sharp-wave ripple (SWR) bursts, increasing evidence suggests that cortex may seed the process with partial information, leading to pattern completion in CA3 and subsequent global reactivation of the episode. A recent study has shown that the secondary motor cortex (M2), among other areas, carries two distinct types of representations: place cell-like activity, which relies on an intact hippocampus for its development, and responses tied to visuo-tactile cues -- the 'attributes' of the experience, which do not require the hippocampus. Using two-photon Ca2+ imaging, while simultaneously acquiring LFP from the ipsilateral CA1, we assessed the interactions among cortical retrieval of visuo-tactile attributes of previous experiences in a virtual environment, hippocampal SWR, and the cortical reinstatement of the spatial aspects of the same experiences. During rest after the experience, two types of reactivation events occurred, which separately conveyed information about spatial trajectories and visuo-tactile attributes. Reactivation of attribute information preceded that of trajectories in relation to hippocampal SWRs. Furthermore, paired reactivations of cue and trajectory information supported similar features of previous experiences. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that cortical retrieval of non-spatial attributes of recent experience seeds hippocampal reactivation of associated spatial sequences, which is followed by retrieval of episodic memory traces.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Timing of Cortical Activation in Associator Grapheme-Colour Synaesthetes using MEG</a></h4>

              
                Grapheme-colour synaesthetes experience an anomalous form of perception in which graphemes systematically induce specific colour concurrents in their mind's eye ("associator" type). Although grapheme-colour synaesthesia has been well characterized behaviourally, its neural mechanisms remain largely unresolved. There are currently several competing models, which can primarily be distinguished according to the anatomical and temporal predictions of synaesthesia-inducing neural activity. The first main model (Cross-Activation/ Cascaded Cross-Tuning) posits early recruitment of occipital colour areas in the initial feed-forward sweep of brain activity. The second (Disinhibited Feedback) posits: (i) later involvement of a multisensory convergence zone (for example, in parietal cortices) after graphemes have been processed in their entirety; and (ii) subsequent feedback to early visual areas (i.e., occipital colour areas). In this study, we examine both the timing and anatomical correlates of associator grapheme-colour synaesthetes (n=6) using MEG. Using unbiased analysis methods with little a priori assumptions, we applied Independent Component Analysis (ICA) on a single-subject level to identify the dominant patterns of the induced, synaesthetic percept. We observed evoked activity that significantly dissociates between synaesthesia-inducing and non-inducing conditions at approximately 190 ms following grapheme presentation. This effect is present in grapheme-colour synaesthetes, but not in matched controls, and exhibits an occipito-parietal topology localised consistently across individuals to extrastriate visual cortices and to superior parietal lobes. Due to the observed timing of this evoked activity and its localisation, our results support a model predicting relatively late synaesthesia-inducing activity, more akin to the Disinhibited Feedback model. In light of previous findings, our study suggest that differential timing and neural mechanisms may account for associator grapheme-colour synaesthetes, as compared to projectors.

                The rich repertoire of skilled mammalian behavior is the product of neural circuits that generate robust and flexible patterns of activity distributed across populations of neurons. Decades of associative studies have linked many behaviors to specific patterns of population activity, but association alone cannot reveal the dynamical mechanisms that shape those patterns. Are local neural circuits high- dimensional dynamical reservoirs able to generate arbitrary superpositions of patterns with appropriate excitation? Or might circuit dynamics be shaped in response to behavioral context so as to generate only the low-dimensional patterns needed for the task at hand? Here, we address these questions within primate motor cortex by delivering optogenetic and electrical microstimulation perturbations during reaching behavior. We develop a novel analytic approach that relates measured activity to theoretically tractable, dynamical models of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. This computational model captures the dynamical effects of these perturbations and demonstrates that motor cortical activity during reaching is shaped by a self-contained, low-dimensional dynamical system. The subspace containing task-relevant dynamics proves to be oriented so as to be robust to strong non-normal amplification within cortical circuits. This task dynamics space exhibits a privileged causal relationship with behavior, in that stimulation in motor cortex perturb reach kinematics only to the extent that it alters neural states within this subspace. Our results resolve long-standing questions about the dynamical structure of cortical activity associated with movement, and illuminate the dynamical perturbation experiments needed to understand how neural circuits throughout the brain generate complex behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Parallel motion vision pathways in the brain of a tropical bee</a></h4>

              
                Spatial orientation is a prerequisite for most behaviors. In insects, the underlying neural computations take place in the central complex (CX), the brains navigational center. In this region different streams of sensory information converge to enable context-dependent navigational decisions. Accordingly, a variety of CX input neurons deliver information about different navigation-relevant cues. In bees, direction encoding polarized light signals converge with translational optic flow signals that are suited to encode the flight speed of the animals. The continuous integration of speed and directions in the CX can be used to generate a vector memory of the bees current position in space in relation to its nest, i.e. perform path integration. This process depends on specific, complex features of the optic flow encoding CX input neurons, but it is unknown how this information is derived from the visual periphery. Here, we thus aimed at gaining insight into how simple motion signals are reshaped upstream of the speed encoding CX input neurons to generate their complex features. Using electrophysiology and anatomical analyses of the halictic bees Megalopta genalis and Megalopta centralis, we identified a wide range of motion-sensitive neurons connecting the optic lobes with the central brain. While most neurons formed pathways with characteristics incompatible with CX speed neurons, we showed that one group of lobula projection neurons possess some physiological and anatomical features required to generate the visual responses of CX optic-flow encoding neurons. However, as these neurons cannot explain all features of CX speed cells, local interneurons of the central brain or alternative input cells from the optic lobe are additionally required to construct inputs with sufficient complexity to deliver speed signals suited for path integration in bees.

                Motor learning is not only a key invention of the many new animals evolving new body plans during the Cambrian, it is also central to human existence such as in learning to speak or walk, rehabilitation after injury, or sports. Evidence suggests that all forms of motor learning may share an evolutionary conserved molecular plasticity pathway. Here we present novel insights into the molecular processes underlying a kind of motor learning in the fruit fly Drosophila, operant self-learning. We have discovered that the Forkhead Box gene FoxP is not required in the fly brain for this type of learning. Instead, atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) appears to be a central component in a plasticity process that takes place in FoxP-expressing motor neurons in the ventral nerve cord. Using CRISPR/Cas9 to knock out canonical aPKC interaction partners bazooka and the kidney and brain gene (KIBRA) in adult animals, we found that aPKC likely acts via non-canonical pathways in this form of learning. We also found that 14 but not 7 days after CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of FoxP in adult animals, learning is impaired, suggesting that adult FoxP expression is required for operant self-learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Intermittent Cytomegalovirus Infection Alters Neurobiological Metabolism and Induces Cognitive Deficits in Mice</a></h4>

              
                Risk factors contributing to dementia are multifactorial. Pathogens as risk factors for dementia is largely correlative with few causal relationships. Here, we demonstrate that intermittent cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in mice, mimicking human chronic infection and reactivation/reinfection events, alters blood brain barrier (BBB) metabolic pathways. An increase in basal mitochondrial function is observed in brain microvasculature endothelial cells (BMEC) at 12 months post infection but not at earlier time points and is accompanied by elevated levels of superoxide, indicative of oxidative stress. Further, these mice score lower in cognitive assays as compared to age-matched controls. Our data show that repeated systemic infection with CMV, alters BBB metabolic function and impacts cognition. These observations provide mechanistic insights through which pathogens contribute to the progression of pathologies associated with dementia.

In BriefMechanistic evidence supporting an infectious etiology of dementia (e.g. Alzheimers Disease) are poorly defined. Harrison et al., show that intermittent infection with cytomegalovirus metabolically rewires the blood brain barrier and neighboring glial cells altering their function, resulting in decreased cognitive function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Divergent associations between auditory activation and inhibition task performance in children and adults.</a></h4>

              
                Adults and children show remarkable differences in cortical auditory activation which, in children, have shown relevance for cognitive performance, specifically inhibitory control. However, it has not been tested whether these differences translate to functional differences in response inhibition between adults and children. We recorded auditory responses of adults and school-aged children (6-14y) using combined magneto- and electroencephalography (M/EEG) during passive listening conditions and an auditory Go/No-go task. The associations between auditory cortical responses and inhibition performance measures diverge between adults and children; while in children the brain-behavior associations are not significant, or stronger responses are beneficial, adults show negative associations between auditory cortical responses and inhibitory performance. Furthermore, we found qualitative differences in auditory responses between adults and children; the late (~200 ms post stimulation) adult peak activation shifts from auditory to frontomedial areas. In contrast, children show prolonged obligatory responses in the auditory cortex. Together this likely translates to a functional difference between adults and children in the cortical resources for performance consistency in auditory-based cognitive tasks.

                Perturbations during critical time windows in the normal series of development can lead to adverse functional consequences that manifest later in life. Here, we report that prenatal stress (PNS) during the last week of gestation (E14-delivery) dramatically increased the number of proliferating neural stem/progenitor cells (NSC/NPCs) in the ependymal-subventricular zone (E-SVZ) of male mouse offspring. PNS did not cause significant cell death or a deficit in neuroblast migration to the olfactory bulb (OB). Olfactory behavioral tests showed that while prenatally stressed male mice displayed normal olfactory function in differentiating nonsocial odors, these mice showed impairment in discriminating different social smells. Bulk and single nucleus transcriptomic analyses combined with rescue assays using mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) phosphorylation inhibitors revealed that PNS exposure during the critical period of neurogenesis promoted NSC/NPC proliferation in adult male offspring by sustaining MAPK3/1 activity. Compared to prenatally stressed males, their female littermates showed less change in the number of proliferating cells in the E-SVZ.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mapping Typical and Altered Neurodevelopment with Sleep Macro- and Micro-Architecture</a></h4>

              
                Profiles of sleep duration and timing and corresponding electroencephalographic activity reflect brain changes that support cognitive and behavioral maturation and may provide practical markers for tracking typical and atypical neurodevelopment. To build and evaluate a sleep-based, quantitative metric of brain maturation, we used whole-night polysomnography data, initially from two large National Sleep Research Resource samples, spanning childhood and adolescence (total N = 4,013, aged 2.5 to 17.5 years): the Childhood Adenotonsillectomy Trial (CHAT), a research study of children with snoring without neurodevelopmental delay, and NCH, a pediatric sleep clinic cohort. Among children without developmental disorders, sleep metrics derived from the electroencephalogram (EEG) displayed robust age-related changes consistently across datasets. Prominent stage-, band- and channel-specific developmental trajectories in spectral power were found. During non-rapid eye movement (NR) sleep, spindles and slow oscillations further exhibited characteristic developmental patterns, with respect to their rate of occurrence, temporal coupling and morphology. Based on these metrics in NCH, we constructed a model to predict an individual's chronological age. The model performed with high accuracy (r = 0.95 in the held-out NCH testing sample and r = 0.88 in a second independent replication sample (PATS) with a broadly comparable age range). EEG-based age predictions reflected clinically meaningful neurodevelopmental differences; for example, compared to typically developing children, those with neurodevelopmental diagnoses (NDD) showed greater variability in predicted age, and children with Down syndrome or intellectual disability had significantly younger brain age predictions (respectively, 2.2 and 0.59 years less than their chronological age) compared to age-matched non-NDD children. Overall, our results indicate that sleep architecture offers a sensitive window for characterizing brain maturation, suggesting the potential for scalable, objective sleep-based biomarkers to measure typical and atypical neurodevelopment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Presaccadic attention depends on eye movement direction</a></h4>

              
                With every saccadic eye movement, humans bring new information into their fovea to be processed with high visual acuity. Notably, perception is enhanced already before a relevant item is foveated: During saccade preparation, presaccadic attention shifts to the upcoming fixation location, which can be measured via behavioral correlates such as enhanced visual performance or modulations of sensory feature tuning. The coupling between saccadic eye movements and attention is assumed to be robust and mandatory, and considered a mechanism facilitating the integration of pre- and post-saccadic information. However, until recently it had not been investigated as a function of saccade direction. Here, we measured contrast response functions during fixation and saccade preparation and found that the pronounced response gain benefit typically elicited by presaccadic attention is selectively lacking before upward saccades, some observers even showed a cost. Individual observers' sensitivity before upward saccades was negatively related to their amount of surface area in primary visual cortex representing the saccade target, suggesting a potential compensatory mechanism that optimizes the use of the limited neural resources processing the upper visual field. Our results raise the question how perceptual continuity is achieved and upward saccades can be accurately targeted despite the lack of (theoretically required) presaccadic attention.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Explicit and implicit motor simulations are impaired in individuals with aphantasia</a></h4>

              
                Individuals with aphantasia report having difficulties or an inability to generate visual images of objects or events. So far, there is no evidence showing that this condition also impacts the motor system and the generation of motor simulations. We probed the neurophysiological marker of aphantasia during explicit and implicit forms of motor simulation, i.e., motor imagery and action observation, respectively. We tested a group of individuals without any reported imagery deficits (phantasics) as well as a group of individuals self-reporting the inability to form mental images (aphantasics). We instructed the participants to explicitly imagine a maximal pinch movement in the visual and kinesthetic modalities and to observe a video showing a pinch movement. By means of transcranial magnetic stimulation, we triggered motor-evoked potentials (MEP) in the target right index finger. As expected, MEP amplitude, a marker of corticospinal excitability, increased for phantasics during kinaesthetic motor imagery and action observation relative to rest but not during visual motor imagery. Interestingly, MEP amplitude did not increase in either form of motor simulation for the group of aphantasics. This result provides neurophysiological evidence that individuals living with aphantasia have a real deficit in activating the motor system during motor simulations.

                In patients blinded by geographic atrophy, subretinal photovoltaic implant with 100 um pixels provided visual acuity closely matching the pixel pitch. However, such flat bipolar pixels cannot be scaled below 75 um, limiting the attainable visual acuity. This limitation can be overcome by shaping the electric field with 3-dimensional electrodes. In particular, elevating the return electrode on top of honeycomb-shaped vertical walls surrounding each pixel extends the electric field vertically and decouples its penetration into tissue from the pixel width. This approach relies on migration of the retinal cells into the honeycomb wells. Here, we demonstrate that the majority of the inner retinal neurons migrate into 25 um deep wells, leaving the third-order neurons, such as amacrine and ganglion cells, outside. This is important for selective stimulation of the second-order neurons to preserve the retinal signal processing in prosthetic vision. Comparable glial response to that with flat implants suggests that migration and separation of the retinal cells by the walls does not cause additional stress. Furthermore, retinal migration into the honeycombs does not negatively affect its electrical excitability.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Using in silico perturbational approach to identify critical areas in schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                Schizophrenia is a debilitating neuropsychiatric disorder whose underlying correlates remain unclear despite decades of neuroimaging investigation. One contentious topic concerns the role of global signal fluctuations and how they affect more focal functional changes. Moreover, it has been difficult to pinpoint causal mechanisms of circuit disruption. Here we analysed resting-state fMRI data from 47 schizophrenia patients and 118 age-matched healthy controls and used dynamical analyses to investigate how global fluctuations and other functional metastable states are affected by this disorder. We then used in-silico perturbation of a whole-brain model to identify critical areas involved in the disease. We found that brain dynamics in the schizophrenic group were characterised by an increased probability of globally coherent states and reduced recurrence of a substate dominated by coupled activity in the default mode and limbic networks. Perturbing a set of temporoparietal sensory and associative areas in a model of the healthy brain reproduced global pathological dynamics. Healthy brain dynamics were instead restored by perturbing a set of medial fronto-temporal and cingulate regions in the model of pathology. These results highlight the relevance of global signal alterations in schizophrenia and identify a set of vulnerable areas involved in determining a shift in brain state.

                Cochlear inner hair cells (IHCs) form specialized ribbon synapses with spiral ganglion neurons that tirelessly transmit sound information at high rates over long time periods with extreme temporal precision. This functional specialization is essential for precise sound encoding and is attributed to a distinct molecular machinery with unique players or splice variants compared to conventional neuronal synapses. Among these is the active zone (AZ) scaffold protein piccolo/aczonin, which is represented by its short splice variant piccolino at cochlear and retinal ribbon synapses. While the function of piccolo at synapses of the central nervous system has been intensively investigated, the role of piccolino at IHC synapses remains unclear. In this study, we characterized the structure and function of IHC-synapses in piccolo gene-trap mutant rats (Pclogt/gt). We found a mild hearing deficit with elevated thresholds and reduced amplitudes of auditory brainstem responses. Ca2+ channel distribution and ribbon morphology were altered in apical IHCs, while their presynaptic function seemed unchanged. We conclude that piccolino contributes to the AZ organization in IHCs and is essential for normal synaptic transmission.

                Moving in synchrony to external rhythmic stimuli is an elementary function that humans regularly engage in. It is termed 'sensorimotor synchronization' and it is governed by two main parameters, the period and the phase of the movement with respect to the external rhythm. There has been an extensive body of research on the characteristics of these parameters, primarily once the movement synchronization has reached a steady-state level. Particular interest has been shown about how these parameters are corrected when there are deviations for the steady-state level. However, little is known about the initial 'tuning-in' interval, when one aligns the movement to the external rhythm from rest. The current work investigates this 'tuning-in' period for each of the four limbs and makes various novel contributions in the understanding of sensorimotor synchronization. The results suggest that phase and period alignment appear to be separate processes. Phase alignment involves limb-specific somatosensory memory in the order of minutes while period alignment has very limited memory usage. Phase alignment is the primary task but then the brain switches to period alignment where it spends most its resources. In overall this work suggests a central, cognitive role of period alignment and a peripheral, sensorimotor role of phase alignment.

	<p>Burnout is becoming a global pandemic jeopardizing brain health, with a huge impact on quality of life, available workforce, and the economy. Knowledge of the impact of burnout on cognition, physiology, and physical activity (PA) in daily life allows for an improved understanding of the health consequences and everyday ramifications of burnout. Twenty-eight volunteers participated in a three-day recording of daily physiology and PA, including heart rate (HR) and daily steps, with a wearable device. They filled in questionnaires screening for burnout (BBI-15), depression (BDI), and executive functions (EFs) in daily life (BRIEF-A). The subjects with burnout had more challenges in EFs, higher average HRs and lower numbers of steps in daily life than those without it. The BBI-15 scores correlated positively with the BDI scores and BRIEF-A indices and negatively with the awake HR variability (HRV) and daily steps. The metacognition index correlated negatively with the HRV. In conclusion, burnout is linked with compromised EFs along with alterations in cardiac physiology and PA in daily life. Such alterations may be easily detected with wearable devices, opening possibilities for novel biomarkers of burnout and other neuropsychiatric disorders. We suggest that physical activity and heart and brain health are intimately intertwined and that burnout interacts with each of them bidirectionally.</p>

	<p>Executive function (EF) includes a set of higher-order abilities that control one&amp;amp;rsquo;s actions and thoughts consciously and has a protracted developmental trajectory that parallels the maturation of the frontal lobes, which develop speedily over the preschool period. To fully understand the development of EF in preschoolers, this study examined the relationship among the three domains of executive function (cognitive shifting, inhibitory control, and working memory) to test the applicability of the unity&amp;amp;ndash;diversity model in preschoolers using both behavioral and fNIRS approaches. Altogether, 58 Chinese preschoolers (34 boys, 24 girls, Mage = 5.86 years, SD = 0.53, age range = 4.83&amp;amp;ndash;6.67 years) were administered the Dimensional Card Change Sort (DCCS), go/no-go, and missing scan task. Their brain activations in the prefrontal cortex during the tasks were examined using fNIRS. First, the behavioral results indicated that the missing scan task scores (working memory) correlated with the DCCS (cognitive shifting) and go/no-go tasks (inhibitory control). However, the latter two did not correlate with each other. Second, the fNIRS results demonstrated that the prefrontal activations during the working memory task correlated with those in the same regions during the cognitive shifting and inhibitory control tasks. However, the latter two still did not correlate. The behavioral and neuroimaging evidence jointly indicates that the unity&amp;amp;ndash;diversity model of EF does apply to Chinese preschoolers.</p>

	<p>The development of immunosuppressants has been key for the advancement of solid organ transplant surgery. Specifically, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, or everolimus have significantly increased the survival rate of patients by reducing the risk of a rejection of the transplanted organ and limiting graft-versus-host disease. We report the case of a 65-year-old man who, after undergoing a liver transplantation and receiving an immunosuppressive treatment with cyclosporine and everolimus, presented severe obsessive, psychotic, and behavioral symptoms over the past three years, and describe the pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions implemented against these symptoms. In this case, the immunosuppressants used have been cyclosporine and, preferably, everolimus. On the other hand, potential adverse reactions to the treatment have been observed, including neuropsychiatric symptoms such as tremor, anxiety, dysthymia, psychosis, and behavioral disorders, which make it necessary to use corrective psychoactive drugs such as benzodiazepines, antidepressants, and antipsychotics, combined with non-pharmacological interventions. A transversal approach, from the medical and psychosocial disciplines, facilitates success in managing neuropsychiatric symptoms after soft organ transplants.</p>

	<p>Central neuropathic pain (CNP) affects millions worldwide, with an estimated prevalence of around 10% globally. Although there are a wide variety of treatment options available, due to the complex and multidimensional nature in which CNP arises and presents symptomatically, many patients still experience painful symptoms. Pharmaceutical, surgical, non-invasive, cognitive and combination treatment options offer a generalized starting point for alleviating symptoms; however, a more customized approach may provide greater benefit. Here, we comment on the current treatment options that exist for CNP and further suggest the need for additional research regarding the use of biomarkers to help individualize treatment options for patients.</p>

	<p>Intra- and perioperatively recorded local field potential (LFP) activity of the nucleus subthalamicus (STN) has been suggested to guide contact selection in patients undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD). Despite the invention of sensing capacities in chronically implanted devices, a comprehensible algorithm that enables contact selection using such recordings is still lacking. We evaluated a fully automated algorithm that uses the weighted average of bipolar recordings to determine effective monopolar contacts based on elevated activity in the beta band. LFPs from 14 hemispheres in seven PD patients with newly implanted directional DBS leads of the STN were recorded. First, the algorithm determined the stimulation level with the highest beta activity. Based on the prior determined level, the directional contact with the highest beta activity was chosen in the second step. The mean clinical efficacy of the contacts chosen using the algorithm did not statistically differ from the mean clinical efficacy of standard contact selection as performed in clinical routine. All recording sites were projected into MNI standard space to investigate the feasibility of the algorithm with respect to the anatomical boundaries of the STN. We conclude that the proposed algorithm is a first step towards LFP-based contact selection in STN-DBS for PD using chronically implanted devices.</p>

	<p>Immune function and sleep are two normal physiological processes to protect the living organism from falling sick. There is hardly any disease in which they remain unaffected, though the quantum of effect may differ. Therefore, we propose the existence of a strong correlation between sleep (quality or quantity) and immune response. This may be supported by the fact that sleep loss modulates many of the immunological molecules, which includes interferons; however, not much is known about their mechanism of action. Sleep is divided into rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) and non-REMS. For practical reasons, experimental studies have been conducted mostly by inducing loss of REMS. It has been shown that withdrawal of noradrenaline (NA) is a necessity for generation of REMS. Moreover, NA level increases in the brain upon REMS loss and the elevated NA is responsible for many of the sleep loss-associated symptoms. In this review, we describe how sleep (and its disturbance/loss) modulates the immune system by modulating the NA level in the brain or vice versa to maintain immune functions, physiological homeostasis, and normal healthy living. The increased levels of NA during REMS loss may cause neuroinflammation possibly by glial activation (as NA is a key modulator of microglia). Therefore, maintaining sleep hygiene plays a crucial role for a normal healthy living.</p>

	<p>Handwriting plays an important role in written communication, reading, and academic success. However, little is known about the neural correlates of handwriting in children. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a copying task, we investigated regional brain activation and functional lateralization associated with Chinese handwriting in children (N = 36, 9&amp;amp;ndash;11 years old), as well as their relations to reading skills. We found significant activation of the bilateral frontal motor cortices, somatosensory cortex, intraparietal sulcus (IPS), fusiform gyrus (FuG), and cerebellum during handwriting, suggesting that an adult-like brain activation pattern emerges by middle childhood. Moreover, children showed left-lateralized and bilateral activation of motor regions and right-lateralized activation of the FuG and cerebellum during handwriting, suggesting that functional lateralization of handwriting is not fully established by this age. Finally, the activation of Exner&amp;amp;rsquo;s area and the lateralization of the IPS and cerebellum during handwriting were correlated with reading skills, possibly representing a neural link between handwriting and reading in children. Collectively, this study reveals the brain correlates of handwriting and their relation to reading development in Chinese children, offering new insight into the development of handwriting and reading skills.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Data-Driven Models of Efficient Chromatic Coding in the Outer Retina</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Recent experimental work on zebrafish has shown the <I>in vivo</I> activity of photoreceptors and horizontal cells (HCs) as a function of the stimulus spectrum, highlighting the appearance of chromatic-opponent signals at their first synaptic connection. Altogether with the observed lack of excitatory intercone connections, these findings suggest that the mechanism yielding early color opponency in zebrafish is dominated by inhibitory feedback. We propose a neuronal population model based on zebrafish retinal circuitry to investigate whether networks with predominantly inhibitory feedback are more advantageous in encoding chromatic information than networks with mixed excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms. We show that networks with dominant inhibitory feedback exhibit a unique and reliable encoding of chromatic information. In contrast, this property is not guaranteed in networks with strong excitatory intercone connections, exhibiting bistability. These findings provide a theoretical explanation for the absence of excitatory intercone couplings in zebrafish color circuits. In addition, our study shows that these networks, with only one type of horizontal cell, are suitable to encode most of the variance from the zebrafish environment. However, at least two successive layers of inhibitory neurons are needed to reach the optimum. Finally, we contrast the encoding performance of networks with different opsin sensitivities, showing an improvement of only 13% compared with zebrafish, suggesting that the zebrafish retina is adapted to encode color information from its habitat efficiently.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Differential Modes of Action of {alpha}1- and {alpha}1{gamma}2-Autoantibodies Derived from Patients with GABAAR Encephalitis</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Autoantibodies against central nervous system proteins are increasingly being recognized in association with neurologic disorders. Although a growing number of neural autoantibodies have been identified, a causal link between specific autoantibodies and disease symptoms remains unclear, as most studies use patient-derived CSF-containing mixtures of autoantibodies. This raises questions concerning mechanism of action and which autoantibodies truly contribute to disease progression. To address this issue, monoclonal autoantibodies were isolated from a young girl with a range of neurologic symptoms, some of which reacted with specific GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor (GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R) subunits, &alpha;1-subunit and &alpha;12-subunit, which in this study we have characterized in detail using a combination of cellular imaging and electrophysiological techniques. These studies in neurons from wild-type mice (C57BL/6J; RRID:<A HREF="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:000664">IMSR_JAX:000664</A>) of mixed-sex revealed that the &alpha;1 and &alpha;12 subunit-specific antibodies have differential effects on the GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor. Namely, the &alpha;1-antibody was found to directly affect GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor function on a short time scale that diminished GABA currents, leading to increased network excitability. On longer time scales those antibodies also triggered a redistribution of the GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor away from synapses. In contrast, the &alpha;12-antibody had no direct effect on GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor function and could possibly mediate its effect through other actors of the immune system. Taken together, these data highlight the complexity underlying autoimmune disorders and show that antibodies can exert their effect through many mechanisms within the same disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Serum leucine-rich alpha-2 glycoprotein levels in rheumatoid arthritis and spondyloarthritis: A promising biomarker [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In the early stages of the disease, some of the signs and symptoms of joint inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) may resemble that of spondyloarthritis (SpA). An examination that can help distinguish RA and SpA is warranted. One such examination is the measurement of serum leucine-rich alpha-2 glycoprotein (LRG) levels. This study aimed to measure serum LRG levels in RA and SpA patients and determine the role of LRG in the diagnosis of RA and SpA. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study consisting of 26 RA subjects and 26 SpA subjects. The SpA subjects were further grouped into ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and peripheral SpA. Measurement of serum LRG levels were conducted using ELISA. Difference between LRG levels of the two groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney test. Results: LRG levels were elevated in 76.9% and 84.6% of subjects with RA and SpA, respectively. The median LRG levels were higher in RA subjects (77.03 (27.16–107.73)) than SpA (68.67 (33.15–115.18)). There was no significant difference in LRG levels in RA and SpA subjects (p = .442). The RA and PsA group were predominated by diseases of moderate activity, 88.5% and 58.3%, respectively. In comparison, AS was dominated by high disease activity (85.7%). The highest median LRG levels in AR and SpA subjects were in new-onset patients (82.21 vs. 72.25 µg/dL). Conclusions: There was no significant difference in LRG levels between RA and SpA subjects. The role of LRG in the diagnosis of RA and SpA remains to be determined in future studies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Agent-based modelling for the study of shipwreck site formation processes: A theoretical framework and conceptual model. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Shipwreck site formation processes (SFP), their dynamics and transformation have long interested maritime archaeology from both a historical perspective and heritage management since shipwrecks constitute endangered cultural sites. Major contributions to shipwreck SFP have been made since the 1970s which conceive SFP from a systemic theoretical perspective, notably those of Keith Muckelroy and Martin Gibbs. However, to our view, such a perspective falls short in its capacity to explain and predict the distribution of elements in a shipwreck. In this article, we propose that shipwreck SFP can be understood from the theoretical framework of complex adaptive systems (CAS), where a SFP constitutes a CAS in which nonlinear interactions of natural and cultural factors give rise to the observed seabed distribution of a shipwreck as an emergent phenomenon. Methods From this theoretical framework, we propose agent-based modelling (ABM) as a suitable methodological approach for studying SFP. We show its implementation using the USS Somers, a 19th-century brig of war that sank in 1846 off the port of Veracruz, Mexico, during the Mexican-American War as a case study. The conceptual model was developed from the integration of historical data about the ship’s nautical characteristics and operation, information on the wrecking event from eyewitnesses, as well as modern environmental data. Results We present a conceptual model defining various elements that would constitute the Somers’ ABM. It gives specifics about the characteristics and variables regarding agents, global variables, processes, indicators, degradation and deposition sequences, and user interface. Conclusion The conceptual model served to develop ABM in a simulation platform where historical hypotheses can be tested and various possible scenarios of the SFP can be explored. By contrasting the simulation results with the archaeological record of the shipwreck, ABM would allow maritime archaeologists to postulate more supported and refined interpretations of a shipwreck’s SFP.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Smartphone use and social media addiction in undergraduate students [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Children’s use of social media has increased significantly over the past decade. As a result, they are susceptible to smartphone addiction. In particular, parents' and children's well-being and behaviors are negatively affected by smartphone addiction. Such addiction likely affects both physical performance and lifestyle. Adolescents utilize their smartphones while performing other tasks. The secondary task might divert attention away from the primary task. Reaction time is the combination of brain processing and muscular movement. Texting or communicating on a smartphone while performing another task may affect reaction time. Thus, the purpose of this study was to explore the influence of smartphone use on reaction time in undergraduate students who were addicted to smartphones. Methods: The Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version (SAS-SV) was used to assign 64 undergraduate students to the smartphone addiction group (n = 32) and the control group (n = 32). The reaction time (RT) of an organism is used to determine how rapidly it responds to stimuli. All participants were examined on the RT test under three conditions: no smartphone use (control), texting, and chatting on a smartphone. Participants were questioned by smartphone through text message or chat with the support of a researcher during the texting and conversation conditions. While responding to the questions, the participant was administered an RT test. Results: The results showed that smartphone addiction tends to have a reduced influence on reaction time when compared to the control group. Also, texting or conversing on a smartphone while doing other work had a substantial impact on reaction time in the undergraduates. Conclusions: Combining smartphone use with other activities tends to reduce undergraduate students' reaction time.

     alt="Chromatic organization of retinal photoreceptors during eye migration of Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus)"/>
<p>Flatfishes undergo a pronounced metamorphosis whereby a bilateral, pelagic larva transforms into a flattened, benthic juvenile with both eyes on the same side of the head. The changes in photoreceptor visual pigment protein (opsin) expression during this period of eye migration are unknown. Here, we describe the chromatic organization of photoreceptors during eye migration using antibodies that label blue (SWS2) opsin, and green (RH) and red (LWS) opsins simultaneously. Our results reveal opsin co-expression within individual cone photoreceptors and a gradient in SWS2-expressing cones that may guide the creation of the square mosaic from an hexagonal mosaic.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The retinas of fishes often have single and double cone photoreceptors that are organized in lattice-like mosaics. In flatfishes experiencing eye migration (i.e., the metamorphic process whereby one eye migrates to the other side of the head), the hexagonal lattice of single cones present in the larva undergoes major restructuring resulting in a dominant square mosaic postmetamorphosis consisting of four double cones surrounding each single cone. The expression of different opsin types during eye migration has not been examined despite its importance in understanding photoreceptor plasticity and whether cell fate (in terms of spectral phenotype) could influence square mosaic formation. Here, we probed the retina of Atlantic halibut undergoing eye migration for opsin expression using two antibodies, AHblue and AB5407, that labeled short wavelength sensitive 2 (SWS2) opsin and longer wavelength (predominantly middle wavelength sensitive, RH2) opsins, respectively. Throughout the retina, double and triple cones labeled with AB5407 exclusively, whereas the vast majority of single cones labeled with AHblue. A minority (&lt;5%) of single cones in the square mosaic of the centroventral retina labeled with AB5407. In regions of mosaic transition and near peripheral growth zones, some single cones co-expressed at least two opsins as they labeled with both antibodies. Short wavelength (SWS2 expressing, or S) cones formed a nonrandom mosaic gradient from central to dorsal retina in a region dominated by the larval single cone mosaic. Our results demonstrate the expression of at least two opsins throughout the postmetamorphic retina and suggest opsin switching as a mechanism to create new cone spectral phenotypes. In addition, the S cone gradient at the onset of eye migration may underlie a plastic, cell induction mechanism by which a cone's phenotype determines that of its neighbors and the formation of the square mosaic.</p>

     alt="Loss of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-receptor 1 and TNF-receptor 2 partially replicate effects of TNF deficiency on dendritic spines of granule cells in mouse dentate gyrus"/>
<p>Hippocampal granule cells of adult mice lacking canonical TNF-Rs were filled with Alexa568 and immunolabeled for Synaptopodin. Morphometric analysis of their spines revealed that TNF-R mutants partially replicate changes previously reported for TNF-deficient mice. Since TNF tunes network excitability via TNF-Rs, TNF deficiency and altered TNF-R-signaling may cause morphological spine changes. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is involved in the regulation of physiological and pathophysiological processes in the central nervous system. In previous work, we showed that mice lacking constitutive levels of TNF exhibit a reduction in spine density and changes in spine head size distribution of dentate granule cells. Here, we investigated which TNF-receptor pathway is responsible for this phenotype and analyzed granule cell spine morphology in TNF-R1-, TNF-R2-, and TNF-R1/R2-deficient mice. Single granule cells were filled with Alexa568 in fixed hippocampal brain slices and immunostained for the actin-modulating protein synaptopodin (SP), a marker for strong and stable spines. An investigator blind to genotype investigated dendritic spines using deconvolved confocal image stacks. Similar to TNF-deficient mice, TNF-R1 and TNF-R2 mutants showed a decrease in the size of small spines (SP−negative) with TNF-R1/R2-KO mice exhibiting an additive effect. TNF-R1 mutants also showed an increase in the size of large spines (SP−positive), mirroring the situation in TNF-deficient mice. Unlike the TNF-deficient mouse, none of the TNF-R mutants exhibited a reduction in their granule cell spine densities. Since TNF tunes the excitability of networks, lack of constitutive TNF reduces network excitation. This may explain why we observed alterations in spine head size distributions in TNF- and TNF-R-deficient granule cells. The changes in spine density observed in the TNF-deficient mouse could not be linked to canonical TNF-R-signaling. Instead, noncanonical pathways or unknown developmental functions of TNF may cause this phenomenon.</p>

Of note, the orbital cortex almost exclusively distributes to the nuclei of the “limbic thalamus”; that is, to the midline, intralaminar, submedial, anterior, and mediodorsal nuclei.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The orbital cortex (ORB) of the rat consists of five divisions: the medial (MO), ventral (VO), ventrolateral (VLO), lateral (LO), and dorsolateral (DLO) orbital cortices. No previous report has comprehensively examined and compared projections from each division of the ORB to the thalamus. Using the anterograde anatomical tracer, <i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i> leucoagglutinin, we describe the efferent projections from the five divisions of the ORB to the thalamus in the rat. We demonstrated that, with some overlap, each division of the ORB distributed in a distinct (and unique) manner to nuclei of the thalamus. Overall, ORB projected to a relatively restricted number of sites in the thalamus, and strikingly distributed entirely to structures of the medial/midline thalamus, while completely avoiding lateral regions or principal nuclei of the thalamus. The main termination sites in the thalamus were the paratenial nucleus (PT) and nucleus reuniens (RE) of the midline thalamus, the medial (MDm) and central (MDc) divisions of the mediodorsal nucleus, the intermediodorsal nucleus, the central lateral, paracentral, and central medial nuclei of the rostral intralaminar complex and the submedial nucleus (SM). With some exceptions, medial divisions of the ORB (MO, VO) mainly targeted “limbic-associated” nuclei such as PT, RE, and MDm, whereas lateral division (VLO, LO, DLO) primarily distributed to “sensorimotor-associated” nuclei including MDc, SM, and the rostral intralaminar complex. As discussed herein, the medial/midline thalamus may represent an important link (or bridge) between the orbital cortex and the hippocampus and between the ORB and medial prefrontal cortex. In summary, the present results demonstrate that each division of the orbital cortex projects in a distinct manner to nuclei of the thalamus which suggests unique functions for each division of the orbital cortex.</p>

     alt="Lifespan changes in cannabinoid 1 receptor mRNA expression in the female C57BL/6J mouse brain"/>
<p>The number of cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB<sub>1</sub>R) positive cell in the brain varies along life span of female C57BL/6J mice, whose patterns can be clustered into 9 catagories indicating possible correlation among the brain regions. The dynamics of CB<sub>1</sub>R positive cell number along life span may partially be responsible to disease suceptability in different ages in female.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Many brain functions that underlie behavior, cognition, and emotions vary with age, as does susceptibility to neuropsychological disorders. The expression of specific genes that are involved in these functions, such as the genes encoding for oxytocin, its receptors, and apolipoprotein D, varies with age across different brain regions. The cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB<sub>1</sub>R) is one of the most widely spread G-protein coupled receptors in the central nervous system and is increasingly recognized for its important contribution to various brain functions. Although changes in CB<sub>1</sub>R expression with age have been reported in the male mouse brain, they have not been well investigated in the female brain. Here, we used fluorescence in situ hybridization to target CB<sub>1</sub>R mRNA in the whole brains of female C57BL/6J mice aged 4, 6, 12, 52 (12 months) and 86 weeks (20 months), and quantified CB<sub>1</sub>R-positive cells in 36 brain regions across the whole brain. The results showed that CB<sub>1</sub>R-positive cells number changed with age. Specifically, CB<sub>1</sub>R expression increased with age in some subregions of the cortex, decreased with age in the lateral septal area, and reached its lowest level at 52 weeks in the thalamus, hypothalamus, and hindbrain subregions. Cluster analysis revealed that some brain regions shared similar temporal characteristics in CB<sub>1</sub>R-positive cell number across the lifespan. Our results provide evidence that investigation of the neural basis of age-related characteristics of female brain functions is not only warranted but required.</p>

     alt="Spexin in the European sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax: Characterization, brain distribution, and interaction with Gnrh and Gnih neurons"/>
<p>The main objective of this work was to obtain detailed information on the distribution and localization of the spexin (Spx) system in the sea bass brain. To this purpose, we first identified and characterized the <i>spx1</i> gene and analyzed its expression in the central nervous system (CNS) of the European sea bass by using quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR). Then, we mapped the Spx1 system by immunohistochemistry using an antibody against mammalian SPX, and finally we determined its interaction with other reproductive-related neuroendocrine systems by using double immunohistochemistry and gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (Gnih), prepro-gonadotropin-releasing hormone (Gnrh1), -(Gnrh2) and -(Gnrh3) antisera. The results obtained suggest that Spx1 could be involved in both reproductive and nonreproductive (i.e., food intake, behavior) functions in sea bass.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Spexin (Spx) is a recently characterized neuropeptide implicated in multiple physiological processes in vertebrates, including reproduction, food intake, and regulation of anxiety and stress. Two orthologs (Spx1 and Spx2) are present in some nonmammalian vertebrates, including teleosts. However, information on the distribution of Spx in the brain and its interactions with other neuroendocrine systems in fish is still scarce. In this work, we cloned and sequenced the sea bass (<i>Dicentrarchus labrax</i>) Spx1, which included a 27 aa signal peptide and a mature peptide of 14 aa that is C-terminal amidated. <i>spx1</i> transcripts were higher in the diencephalon/caudal preoptic area/hypothalamus and medulla but were also detected in the olfactory bulbs, telencephalon/rostral preoptic area, optic tectum/tegmentum, cerebellum/pons, and pituitary. The immunohistochemical study revealed Spx1-immunoreactive (ir) cells in different nuclei of the preoptic area, habenula, prethalamus, mesencephalic tegmentum and in the proximal <i>pars distalis</i> (PPD) and <i>pars intermedia</i> of the pituitary. Spx1-ir fibers were widely distributed throughout the brain being particularly abundant in the midbrain and hindbrain, in close contact with tegmental gonadotropin-releasing hormone 2 (Gnrh2) cells and isthmic gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (Gnih) cells of the secondary gustatory nucleus. Moreover, Gnih fibers were observed innervating Spx1-ir cells lying in several subdivisions of the magnocellular preoptic nucleus and in the lateral nucleus of the valvula, whereas ventrolateral prethalamic Spx1-ir cells received immunopositive Gnrh2 fibers. In the pituitary, Gnrh1-ir fibers were observed closely associated with Spx1-ir cells of the PPD. These results suggest that Spx1 could be involved in both reproductive and nonreproductive (i.e., food intake, behavior) functions in sea bass.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Microglia are macrophage-like cells exerting determinant roles in neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress processes during brain regeneration. We used zebrafish as a model of brain plasticity and repair. First, by performing L-plastin (Lcp1) immunohistochemistry and using transgenic Tg(<i>mpeg1.1:GFP</i>) or Tg(<i>mpeg1.1:mCherry</i>) fish, we analyzed the distribution of microglia/immune cells in the whole brain. Specific regional differences were evidenced in terms of microglia/immune cell density and morphology (elongated, branched, highly branched, and amoeboid). Taking advantage of Tg(<i>fli:GFP</i>) and Tg(<i>GFAP::GFP)</i> enabling the detection of endothelial cells and neural stem cells (NSCs), we highlighted the association of elongated microglia/immune cells with blood vessels and rounded/amoeboid microglia with NSCs. Second, after telencephalic injury, we showed that L-plastin cells were still abundantly present at 5 days post-lesion (dpl) and were associated with regenerative neurogenesis. Finally, RNA-sequencing analysis from injured telencephalon (5 dpl) confirmed the upregulation of microglia/immune cell markers and highlighted a significant increase of genes involved in oxidative stress <i>(nox2</i>, <i>nrf2a</i>, and <i>gsr)</i>. The analysis of antioxidant activities at 5 dpl also revealed an upregulation of superoxide dismutase and persistent H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation in the injured telencephalon. Also, microglia/immune cells were shown to be a source of oxidative stress at 5 dpl. Overall, our data provide a better characterization of microglia/immune cell distribution in the healthy zebrafish brain, highlighting some evolutionarily conserved features with mammals. They also emphasize that 5 days after injury, microglia/immune cells are still activated and are associated to a persistent redox imbalance. Together, these data raise the question of the role of oxidative stress in regenerative neurogenesis in zebrafish.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Topographical organization and morphology of substance P (SP)‐immunoreactive axons in the whole stomach of mice</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Nociceptive afferents innervate the stomach and send signals centrally to the brain and locally to stomach tissues. Nociceptive afferents can be detected with a variety of different markers. In particular, substance P (SP) is a neuropeptide and is one of the most commonly used markers for nociceptive nerves in the somatic and visceral organs. However, the topographical distribution and morphological structure of SP-immunoreactive (SP-IR) axons and terminals in the whole stomach have not yet been fully determined. In this study, we labeled SP-IR axons and terminals in flat mounts of the ventral and dorsal halves of the stomach of mice. Flat-mount stomachs, including the longitudinal and circular muscular layers and the myenteric ganglionic plexus, were processed with SP primary antibody followed by fluorescent secondary antibody and then scanned using confocal microscopy. We found that (1) SP-IR axons and terminals formed an extensive network of fibers in the muscular layers and within the ganglia of the myenteric plexus of the whole stomach. (2) Many axons that ran in parallel with the long axes of the longitudinal and circular muscles were also immunoreactive for the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT). (3) SP-IR axons formed very dense terminal varicosities encircling individual neurons in the myenteric plexus; many of these were VAChT immunoreactive. (4) The regional density of SP-IR axons and terminals in the muscle and myenteric plexus varied in the following order from high to low: antrum-pylorus, corpus, fundus, and cardia. (5) In only the longitudinal and circular muscles, the regional density of SP-IR axon innervation from high to low were: antrum-pylorus, corpus, cardia, and fundus. (6) The innervation patterns of SP-IR axons and terminals in the ventral and dorsal stomach were comparable. Collectively, our data provide for the first time a map of the distribution and morphology of SP-IR axons and terminals in the whole stomach with single-cell/axon/synapse resolution. This work will establish an anatomical foundation for functional mapping of the SP-IR axon innervation of the stomach and its pathological remodeling in gastrointestinal diseases.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Genome-wide identification and characterization of DNA enhancers with a stacked multivariate fusion framework</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yansong Wang, Zilong Hou, Yuning Yang, Ka-chun Wong, Xiangtao Li</p>

Enhancers are short non-coding DNA sequences outside of the target promoter regions that can be bound by specific proteins to increase a gene’s transcriptional activity, which has a crucial role in the spatiotemporal and quantitative regulation of gene expression. However, enhancers do not have a specific sequence motifs or structures, and their scattered distribution in the genome makes the identification of enhancers from human cell lines particularly challenging. Here we present a novel, stacked multivariate fusion framework called SMFM, which enables a comprehensive identification and analysis of enhancers from regulatory DNA sequences as well as their interpretation. Specifically, to characterize the hierarchical relationships of enhancer sequences, multi-source biological information and dynamic semantic information are fused to represent regulatory DNA enhancer sequences. Then, we implement a deep learning–based sequence network to learn the feature representation of the enhancer sequences comprehensively and to extract the implicit relationships in the dynamic semantic information. Ultimately, an ensemble machine learning classifier is trained based on the refined multi-source features and dynamic implicit relations obtained from the deep learning-based sequence network. Benchmarking experiments demonstrated that SMFM significantly outperforms other existing methods using several evaluation metrics. In addition, an independent test set was used to validate the generalization performance of SMFM by comparing it to other state-of-the-art enhancer identification methods. Moreover, we performed motif analysis based on the contribution scores of different bases of enhancer sequences to the final identification results. Besides, we conducted interpretability analysis of the identified enhancer sequences based on attention weights of EnhancerBERT, a fine-tuned BERT model that provides new insights into exploring the gene semantic information likely to underlie the discovered enhancers in an interpretable manner. Finally, in a human placenta study with 4,562 active distal gene regulatory enhancers, SMFM successfully exposed tissue-related placental development and the differential mechanism, demonstrating the generalizability and stability of our proposed framework.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Recalibrating probabilistic forecasts of epidemics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Aaron Rumack, Ryan J. Tibshirani, Roni Rosenfeld</p>

Distributional forecasts are important for a wide variety of applications, including forecasting epidemics. Often, forecasts are miscalibrated, or unreliable in assigning uncertainty to future events. We present a recalibration method that can be applied to a black-box forecaster given retrospective forecasts and observations, as well as an extension to make this method more effective in recalibrating epidemic forecasts. This method is guaranteed to improve calibration and log score performance when trained and measured in-sample. We also prove that the increase in expected log score of a recalibrated forecaster is equal to the entropy of the PIT distribution. We apply this recalibration method to the 27 influenza forecasters in the FluSight Network and show that recalibration reliably improves forecast accuracy and calibration. This method, available on Github, is effective, robust, and easy to use as a post-processing tool to improve epidemic forecasts.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Using smartphone-GPS data to quantify human activity in green spaces</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alessandro Filazzola, Garland Xie, Kimberly Barrett, Andrea Dunn, Marc T. J. Johnson, James Scott MacIvor</p>

Cities are growing in density and coverage globally, increasing the value of green spaces for human health and well-being. Understanding the interactions between people and green spaces is also critical for biological conservation and sustainable development. However, quantifying green space use is particularly challenging. We used an activity index of anonymized GPS data from smart devices provided by Mapbox (www.mapbox.com) to characterize human activity in green spaces in the Greater Toronto Area, Canada. The goals of our study were to describe i) a methodological example of how anonymized GPS data could be used for human-nature research and ii) associations between park features and human activity. We describe some of the challenges and solutions with using this activity index, especially in the context of green spaces and biodiversity monitoring. We found the activity index was strongly correlated with visitation records (i.e., park reservations) and that these data are useful to identify high or low-usage areas within green spaces. Parks with a more extensive trail network typically experienced higher visitation rates and a substantial proportion of activity remained on trails. We identified certain land covers that were more frequently associated with human presence, such as rock formations, and find a relationship between human activity and tree composition. Our study demonstrates that anonymized GPS data from smart devices are a powerful tool for spatially quantifying human activity in green spaces. These could help to minimize trade-offs in the management of green spaces for human use and biological conservation will continue to be a significant challenge over the coming decades because of accelerating urbanization coupled with population growth. Importantly, we include a series of recommendations when using activity indexes for managing green spaces that can assist with biomonitoring and supporting sustainable human use.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Eleven quick tips for data cleaning and feature engineering</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Davide Chicco, Luca Oneto, Erica Tavazzi</p>

Applying computational statistics or machine learning methods to data is a key component of many scientific studies, in any field, but alone might not be sufficient to generate robust and reliable outcomes and results. Before applying any discovery method, preprocessing steps are necessary to prepare the data to the computational analysis. In this framework, data cleaning and feature engineering are key pillars of any scientific study involving data analysis and that should be adequately designed and performed since the first phases of the project. We call “feature” a variable describing a particular trait of a person or an observation, recorded usually as a column in a dataset. Even if pivotal, these data cleaning and feature engineering steps sometimes are done poorly or inefficiently, especially by beginners and unexperienced researchers. For this reason, we propose here our quick tips for data cleaning and feature engineering on how to carry out these important preprocessing steps correctly avoiding common mistakes and pitfalls. Although we designed these guidelines with bioinformatics and health informatics scenarios in mind, we believe they can more in general be applied to any scientific area. We therefore target these guidelines to any researcher or practitioners wanting to perform data cleaning or feature engineering. We believe our simple recommendations can help researchers and scholars perform better computational analyses that can lead, in turn, to more solid outcomes and more reliable discoveries.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Systematic comparison of modeling fidelity levels and parameter inference settings applied to negative feedback gene regulation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Adrien Coulier, Prashant Singh, Marc Sturrock, Andreas Hellander</p>

Quantitative stochastic models of gene regulatory networks are important tools for studying cellular regulation. Such models can be formulated at many different levels of fidelity. A practical challenge is to determine what model fidelity to use in order to get accurate and representative results. The choice is important, because models of successively higher fidelity come at a rapidly increasing computational cost. In some situations, the level of detail is clearly motivated by the question under study. In many situations however, many model options could qualitatively agree with available data, depending on the amount of data and the nature of the observations. Here, an important distinction is whether we are interested in inferring the true (but unknown) physical parameters of the model or if it is sufficient to be able to capture and explain available data. The situation becomes complicated from a computational perspective because inference needs to be approximate. Most often it is based on likelihood-free Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) and here determining which summary statistics to use, as well as how much data is needed to reach the desired level of accuracy, are difficult tasks. Ultimately, all of these aspects—the model fidelity, the available data, and the numerical choices for inference—interplay in a complex manner. In this paper we develop a computational pipeline designed to systematically evaluate inference accuracy for a wide range of true known parameters. We then use it to explore inference settings for negative feedback gene regulation. In particular, we compare a detailed spatial stochastic model, a coarse-grained compartment-based multiscale model, and the standard well-mixed model, across several data-scenarios and for multiple numerical options for parameter inference. Practically speaking, this pipeline can be used as a preliminary step to guide modelers prior to gathering experimental data. By training Gaussian processes to approximate the distance function values, we are able to substantially reduce the computational cost of running the pipeline.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Ten simple rules for failing successfully in academia</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Stefan Gaillard, Tara van Viegen, Michele Veldsman, Melanie I. Stefan, Veronika Cheplygina</p>

Failure is an integral part of life and by extension academia. At the same time, failure is often ignored, with potentially negative consequences both for the science and the scientists involved. This article provides several strategies for learning from and dealing with failure instead of ignoring it. Hopefully, our recommendations are widely applicable, while still taking into account individual differences between academics. These simple rules allow academics to further develop their own strategies for failing successfully in academia.

                <p>by Benjamin Offei, Stephanie Braun-Galleani, Anjan Venkatesh, William T. Casey, Kevin E. O’Connor, Kevin P. Byrne, Kenneth H. Wolfe</p>

The yeast <i>Komagataella phaffii</i> (formerly called <i>Pichia pastoris</i>) is used widely as a host for secretion of heterologous proteins, but only a few isolates of this species exist and all the commonly used expression systems are derived from a single genetic background, CBS7435 (NRRL Y-11430). We hypothesized that other genetic backgrounds could harbor variants that affect yields of secreted proteins. We crossed CBS7435 with 2 other <i>K</i>. <i>phaffii</i> isolates and mapped quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for secretion of a heterologous protein, β-glucosidase, by sequencing individual segregant genomes. A major QTL mapped to a frameshift mutation in the mannosyltransferase gene <i>HOC1</i>, which gives CBS7435 a weaker cell wall and higher protein secretion than the other isolates. Inactivation of <i>HOC1</i> in the other isolates doubled β-glucosidase secretion. A second QTL mapped to an amino acid substitution in <i>IRA1</i> that tripled β-glucosidase secretion in 1-week batch cultures but reduced cell viability, and its effects are specific to this heterologous protein. Our results demonstrate that QTL analysis is a powerful method for dissecting the basis of biotechnological traits in nonconventional yeasts, and a route to improving their industrial performance.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Integrated neural dynamics of sensorimotor decisions and actions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by David Thura, Jean-François Cabana, Albert Feghaly, Paul Cisek</p>

Recent theoretical models suggest that deciding about actions and executing them are not implemented by completely distinct neural mechanisms but are instead two modes of an integrated dynamical system. Here, we investigate this proposal by examining how neural activity unfolds during a dynamic decision-making task within the high-dimensional space defined by the activity of cells in monkey dorsal premotor (PMd), primary motor (M1), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) as well as the external and internal segments of the globus pallidus (GPe, GPi). Dimensionality reduction shows that the four strongest components of neural activity are functionally interpretable, reflecting a state transition between deliberation and commitment, the transformation of sensory evidence into a choice, and the baseline and slope of the rising urgency to decide. Analysis of the contribution of each population to these components shows meaningful differences between regions but no distinct clusters within each region, consistent with an integrated dynamical system. During deliberation, cortical activity unfolds on a two-dimensional “decision manifold” defined by sensory evidence and urgency and falls off this manifold at the moment of commitment into a choice-dependent trajectory leading to movement initiation. The structure of the manifold varies between regions: In PMd, it is curved; in M1, it is nearly perfectly flat; and in dlPFC, it is almost entirely confined to the sensory evidence dimension. In contrast, pallidal activity during deliberation is primarily defined by urgency. We suggest that these findings reveal the distinct functional contributions of different brain regions to an integrated dynamical system governing action selection and execution.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Age‐related effects on the anterior and posterior hippocampal volumes in 6–21 year olds: A model selection approach</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Although recent studies support significant differences in intrinsic structure, function, and connectivity along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus, few studies have investigated the normative development of this dimension. In addition, factors known to influence hippocampal structure, such as sex or puberty, have yet to be characterized when assessing age-related effects on its subregions. This study addresses this gap by investigating the relationship of the anterior (antHC) and posterior (postHC) hippocampus volumes with age, and how these are moderated by sex or puberty, in structural magnetic resonance imaging scans from 183 typically developing participants aged 6–21 years. Based on previous literature, we first anticipated that non-linear models would best represent the relationship between age and the antHC and postHC volumes. We found that age-related effects are region-specific, such that the antHC volume remains stable with increasing age, while the postHC shows a cubic function characterized by overall volume increase with age but a slower rate during adolescence. Second, we hypothesized that models, which include biological sex or pubertal status would best describe these relationships. Contrary to expectation, models comprising either biological sex or pubertal status did not significantly improve model performance. Further longitudinal research is needed to evaluate their effects on the antHC and postHC development.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Place cells are nonrandomly clustered by field location in CA1 hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A challenge in both modern and historic neuroscience has been achieving an understanding of neuron circuits, and determining the computational and organizational principles that underlie these circuits. Deeper understanding of the organization of brain circuits and cell types, including in the hippocampus, is required for advances in behavioral and cognitive neuroscience, as well as for understanding principles governing brain development and evolution. In this manuscript, we pioneer a new method to analyze the spatial clustering of active neurons in the hippocampus. We use calcium imaging and a rewarded navigation task to record from 100 s of place cells in the CA1 of freely moving rats. We then use statistical techniques developed for and in widespread use in geographic mapping studies, global Moran's I, and local Moran's I to demonstrate that cells that code for similar spatial locations tend to form small spatial clusters. We present evidence that this clustering is not the result of artifacts from calcium imaging, and show that these clusters are primarily formed by cells that have place fields around previously rewarded locations. We go on to show that, although cells with similar place fields tend to form clusters, there is no obvious topographic mapping of environmental location onto the hippocampus, such as seen in the visual cortex. Insights into hippocampal organization, as in this study, can elucidate mechanisms underlying motivational behaviors, spatial navigation, and memory formation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The COVID-19 pandemic and mental health outcomes – A cross-sectional study among health care workers in Coastal South India [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Frontline health care workers (HCWs) are at increased risk of developing unfavourable mental health outcomes and burnout, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recognizing the early warning signs of mental distress is very important to ensure the provision of quality patient care. Methods: In this facility-based cross-sectional study, HCWs of the teaching hospitals affiliated to Kasturba Medical College, Mangalore were assessed regarding their mental health status using a semi-structured questionnaire. All doctors and nurses who were willing to participate from these teaching hospitals were included in the study. Data was collected over a period of four months (1st March -30th June 2021) till the required sample size was reached and analysed using IBM SPSS and expressed using mean (standard deviation), median (interquartile range), and proportions. Univariate analysis was done to identify the factors associated with mental health outcomes among the HCWs and the corresponding unadjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence interval were reported. Results: A total of 245 HCWs [52.2% (n=128) doctors and 47.8% (n=117) nurses] were included in our study. The proportion of participants with depressive symptoms, anxiety, and insomnia assessed using PHQ-9, GAD-7, and ISI-7 scales were 49% (n=119), 38% (n=93), and 42% (n=102) respectively. Depression, anxiety, and insomnia were more likely to be experienced by HCWs aged > 27 years, females, and involved in COVID-19 patient care. (p>0.05) Conclusions:  Our findings that 38% of the examined HCWs had clinically relevant anxiety symptoms and 49% had clinically relevant depression symptoms draws attention to the importance of systematically tracking the mental health of HCWs during this ongoing pandemic. HCWs should monitor their stress reactions and seek appropriate help both on a personal and professional level. Appropriate workplace interventions including psychological support should be provided to HCWs, to ensure provision of uncompromised quality patient care.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">SnakeMAGs: a simple, efficient, flexible and scalable workflow to reconstruct prokaryotic genomes from metagenomes [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Over the last decade, we have observed in microbial ecology a transition from gene-centric to genome-centric analyses. Indeed, the advent of metagenomics combined with binning methods, single-cell genome sequencing as well as high-throughput cultivation methods have contributed to the continuing and exponential increase of available prokaryotic genomes, which in turn has favored the exploration of microbial metabolisms. In the case of metagenomics, data processing, from raw reads to genome reconstruction, involves various steps and software which can represent a major technical obstacle. Methods: To overcome this challenge, we developed SnakeMAGs, a simple workflow that can process Illumina data, from raw reads to metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) classification and relative abundance estimate. It integrates state-of-the-art bioinformatic tools to sequentially perform: quality control of the reads (illumina-utils, Trimmomatic), host sequence removal (optional step, using Bowtie2), assembly (MEGAHIT), binning (MetaBAT2), quality filtering of the bins (CheckM), classification of the MAGs (GTDB-Tk) and estimate of their relative abundance (CoverM). Developed with the popular Snakemake workflow management system, it can be deployed on various architectures, from single to multicore and from workstation to computer clusters and grids. It is also flexible since users can easily change parameters and/or add new rules. Results: Using termite gut metagenomic datasets, we showed that SnakeMAGs is slower but allowed the recovery of more MAGs encompassing more diverse phyla compared to another similar workflow named ATLAS. Conclusions: Overall, it should make the reconstruction of MAGs more accessible to microbiologists. SnakeMAGs as well as test files and an extended tutorial are available at https://github.com/Nachida08/SnakeMAGs.

                Background: This study aims to determine the factors affecting HBV DNA suppression in chronic hepatitis B patients with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). Methods: A case-control was carried out from October 2021 to August 2022 on 182 chronic hepatitis B patients who had TDF therapy regularly for 24 weeks at H. Adam Malik and USU Hospitals in Medan, Indonesia. The history of the samples was obtained, followed by physical examination, and blood collection. CTLA-4 polymorphism examination was carried out using real-time PCR, while the serum CTLA-4 levels were assessed with ELISA. Results: The results showed that CTLA-4, HBV DNA, ALT, and CTLA-4 -1661G>A polymorphisms have a relationship with HBV DNA suppression in chronic hepatitis B patients with TDF. Conclusions: The levels of CTLA-4, HBV DNA, ALT, and CTLA-4 -1661G>A polymorphism have a potential relationship with the suppression of HBV DNA in chronic hepatitis B patients with TDF.

                Background: Cannabis ( Cannabis sativa, L.) is an archaic, most infamous plant with unique therapeutic characteristics, and great economic interest. The identification of its THCAS synthesizing enzyme was a great leap forward in Cannabis investigation. However, basic molecular biology for THCAS gene expression remains largely unstudied. In this paper, we explored the ability of bioinformatics resources in the design of molecular cloning protocol and prediction of three-dimensional structure of recombinant THCAS in Moroccan Cannabis sativa variety. Methods:  We described conventional experiments performed in vitro. We used specific primers to isolate the nucleotide sequence of THCAS from the leaves of Cannabis, without including the native signal sequence.we prepared the gene by amors containing specific adapters to integrate the gene into the expression vector PpinkαHC, transforming E.coli bacteria, in order to express the gene in Pichia pasteri yeast. Results: As a result, we found high sequence similarity with THCAS and the mRNA precursor of the same gene as previously reported. In addition, we predicted the structure of the recombinant THCAS using the organic crystal structure prediction method, the amino acid sequence reference, and the artificial intelligence technology. Conclusions: In this study, we have successfuly cloned recombinant THCAS enzyme in E.Coli for further expression in host Pichia pastori.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Olfactory glomeruli are the sites of initial synaptic integration in olfactory information processing. They are surrounded by juxtaglomerular (JG) cells, which include periglomerular, superficial short axon, and external tufted cells. A subpopulation of JG cells expresses the dopamine synthetic enzymes, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), and aromatic <span class="smallCaps">l</span>-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC). TH cells corelease γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and their processes extend to multiple glomeruli forming intra- and interglomerular circuits. It is well established that 17β-estradiol (E2) exerts wide ranging effects in the central nervous system. However, participation of E2 in the modulation of neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity of TH cells in olfactory glomeruli is unknown. To address this, we subcutaneously implanted a 60-day release pellet of E2 or placebo into intact male mice and compared glomerular TH, AADC, and vesicular γ-aminobutyric acid transporter (VGAT) immunoreactivity between them. High-voltage electron microscopy (HVEM) and ultra-HVEM using immunogold revealed significantly increased immunoreactive intensity at the cellular level for TH and AADC after E2 treatment and for VGAT in TH cells. These results indicate that E2 may affect the interplay between dopaminergic and GABAergic systems. Moreover, random-section electron microscopy analysis showed a significant increase in the number of symmetrical synapses from TH cell to mitral/tufted cell dendrites after E2 treatment. This result was supported by quantitative immunofluorescence staining with synapse markers. Together, these data indicate that E2 may regulate inhibition between TH cells and olfactory bulb neurons within the glomerulus via interaction between dopaminergic and GABAergic systems, thereby contributing to neuromodulation of odor information processing.</p>
