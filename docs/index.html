                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10193">Uncovering differential identifiability in network properties of human brain functional connectomes. (arXiv:1911.10193v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>The Identifiability Framework (If) has been shown to improve differential
identifiability (reliability across-sessions and -sites, and differentiability
across-subjects) of functional connectomes for a variety of fMRI tasks. But
having a robust single session/subject functional connectome is just the
starting point to subsequently assess network properties for characterizing
properties of integration, segregation and communicability, among others.
Naturally, one wonders if uncovering identifiability at the connectome level
also uncovers identifiability on the derived network properties. This also
raises the question of where to apply the If framework: on the connectivity
data or directly on each network measurement? Our work answers these questions
by exploring the differential identifiability profiles of network measures when
If is applied on 1) the functional connectomes, and 2) directly on derived
network measurements. Results show that improving across-session reliability of
FCs also improves reliability of derived network measures. We also find that,
for specific network properties, application of If directly on network
properties is more effective. Finally, we discover that applying the framework,
either way, increases task sensitivity of network properties. At a time when
the neuroscientific community is focused on subject-level inferences, this
framework is able to uncover FC fingerprints, which propagates to derived
network properties.

<p>In this work we address the problem of neuronal cell-type classification, and
we employ a real-world dataset of raw neuronal activity measurements obtained
with calcium imaging techniques. While neuronal cell-type classification is a
crucial step in understanding the function of neuronal circuits, and thus a
systematic classification of neurons is much needed, it still remains a
challenge. In recent years, several approaches have been employed for a
reliable neuronal cell-type recognition, such as immunohistochemical (IHC)
analysis and feature extraction algorithms based on several characteristics of
neuronal cells. These methods, however, demand a lot of human intervention and
observation, they are time-consuming and regarding the feature extraction
algorithms it is not clear or obvious what are the best features that define a
neuronal cell class. In this work we examine three different deep learning
models aiming at an automated neuronal cell-type classification and compare
their performance. Experimental analysis demonstrates the efficacy and potent
capabilities for each one of the proposed schemes.

<p>A computational architecture is presented, in which "swift and fuzzy"
emotional channels guide a "slow and precise" decision-making channel. Reported
neurobiological studies first provide hints on the representation of both
emotional and cognitive dimensions across brain structures, mediated by the
neuromodulation system. The related model is based on Guided Propagation
Networks, the inner flows of which can be guided through modulation. A
key-channel of this model grows from a few emotional cues, and is aimed at
anticipating the consequences of ongoing possible actions. Current experimental
results of a computer simulation show the integrated contribution of several
emotional influences, as well as issues of accidental all-out emotions.

<p>The classic Hodgkin-Huxley model is widely used for understanding the
electrophysiological dynamics of a single neuron. While applying a constant
current to the system results in a single voltage spike, it is possible to
produce more interesting dynamics by applying time-varying currents, which may
not be experimentally measurable. The aim of this work is to estimate
time-varying applied currents of different deterministic forms given noisy
voltage data. In particular, we utilize an augmented ensemble Kalman filter
with parameter tracking to estimate four different deterministic applied
currents, analyzing how the model dynamics change in each case. We test the
efficiency of the parameter tracking algorithm in this setting by exploring the
effects of changing the standard deviation of the parameter drift and the
frequency of data available on the resulting time-varying applied current
estimates and related uncertainty.

<p>Most studies indicate that intelligence (g) is positively correlated with
cortical thickness. However, the interindividual variability of cortical
thickness has not been taken into account. In this study, we aimed to identify
the association between intelligence and cortical thickness in adolescents from
both the group's mean and dispersion point of view, utilizing the structural
brain imaging from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD)
Consortium, the largest cohort in early adolescents around 10 years old. The
mean and dispersion parameters of cortical thickness and their association with
intelligence were estimated using double generalized linear models(DGLM). We
found that for the mean model part, the thickness of the frontal lobe like
superior frontal gyrus was negatively related to intelligence, while the
surface area was most positively associated with intelligence in the frontal
lobe. In the dispersion part, intelligence was negatively correlated with the
dispersion of cortical thickness in widespread areas, but not with the surface
area. These results suggested that people with higher IQ are more similar in
cortical thickness, which may be related to less differentiation or
heterogeneity in cortical columns.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/853820v1?rss=1">Ectopic HCN4 expression drives mTOR-dependent epilepsy</a></h4>

The causative link between focal cortical malformations (FCM) and epilepsy is well-accepted, especially among patients with focal cortical dysplasia type II (FCDII) and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). However, the mechanisms underlying seizures remain unclear. Using a mouse model of TSC- and FCDII-associated FCM, we show that FCM neurons are responsible for seizure activity via their unexpected abnormal expression of the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated potassium channel isoform 4 (HCN4), which is normally not present in cortical pyramidal neurons after birth. Increasing intracellular cAMP levels, which preferentially affects HCN4 gating relative to the other isoforms, drove repetitive firing of FCM neurons but not that of control pyramidal neurons. Ectopic HCN4 expression was mTOR-dependent, preceded the onset of seizures, and was also found in diseased neurons in tissue resected for epilepsy treatment from TSC and FCDII patients. Finally, blocking HCN4 channel activity in FCM neurons prevented epilepsy in mice. These findings that demonstrate HCN4 acquisition as seizure-genic, identify a novel cAMP-dependent seizure mechanism in TSC and FCDII. Furthermore, the unique expression of HCN4 exclusively in FCM neurons provides opportunities for using HCN4 as a gene therapy target to treat epilepsy in individuals with FCDII or TSC.

The remarkable cognitive abilities characterizing humans has been linked to unique patterns of connectivity characterizing the neocortex. Comparative studies have shown that human cortical pyramidal neurons (PN) receive a significant increase of synaptic inputs when compared to other mammals, including non-human primates and rodents, but how this may relate to changes in cortical connectivity and function remains largely unknown. We previously identified a human-specific gene duplication (HSGD), SRGAP2C, that, when induced in mouse cortical PNs drives human-specific features of synaptic development, including a correlated increase in excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) synapse density. However, the origin and nature of this increased connectivity and its impact on cortical circuit function was unknown. Here, using a combination of transgenic approaches and quantitative monosynaptic tracing, we demonstrate that humanization of SRGAP2C expression in the mouse cortex leads to a specific increase in local and long-range cortico-cortical inputs received by layer 2/3 cortical PNs. Moreover, using in vivo 2-photon imaging in the barrel cortex of awake mice, we show that humanization of SRGAP2C expression increases the reliability and selectivity of sensory-evoked responses in layer 2-3 PNs. Our results suggest that the emergence of SRGAP2C during human evolution led to increased local and long-range cortico-cortical connectivity and improved reliability of sensory-evoked cortical coding.

Genome stability is essential for brain development and function. However, the contribution of DNA repair to genome stability in neurons remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the base excision repair protein Pol{beta} is involved in hippocampal neuronal differentiation via a TET-mediated active DNA demethylation during early postnatal stages. Pol{beta} deficiency induced extensive DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in hippocampal neurons, and a lesser extent in cortical neurons, during a period in which decreased levels of 5-methylcytosine were observed in genomic DNA. Inhibition of the hydroxylation of 5-methylcytosine by microRNAs miR29a/b-1 expression diminished DSB formation. Conversely, its induction by TET1 overexpression increased DSBs. The damaged hippocampal neurons exhibited aberrant neuronal gene expression profiles and dendrite formation. Behavioral analyses revealed impaired spatial learning and memory in adulthood. Thus, Pol{beta} maintains genome stability in the active DNA demethylation that occurs during postnatal neuronal development, thereby contributing to differentiation and subsequent behavior.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with exposure to contact and collision sports, including American football. We hypothesized a dose–response relationship between duration of football played and CTE risk and severity.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In a convenience sample of 266 deceased American football players from the Veterans Affairs–Boston University–Concussion Legacy Foundation and Framingham Heart Study Brain Banks, we estimated the association of years of football played with CTE pathological status and severity. We evaluated the ability of years played to classify CTE status using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Simulation analyses quantified conditions that might lead to selection bias.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In total, 223 of 266 participants met neuropathological diagnostic criteria for CTE. More years of football played were associated with having CTE (odds ratio [OR] = 1.30 per year played, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.19–1.41; <i>p</i> = 3.8 × 10<sup>−9</sup>) and with CTE severity (severe vs mild; OR = 1.14 per year played, 95% CI = 1.07–1.22; <i>p</i> = 3.1 × 10<sup>−4</sup>). Participants with CTE were 1/10th as likely to have played &lt;4.5 years (negative likelihood ratio [LR] = 0.102, 95% CI = 0.100–0.105) and were 10 times as likely to have played &gt;14.5 years (positive LR = 10.2, 95% CI = 9.8–10.7) compared with participants without CTE. Sensitivity and specificity were maximized at 11 years played. Simulation demonstrated that years played remained adversely associated with CTE status when years played and CTE status were both related to brain bank selection across widely ranging scenarios.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The odds of CTE double every 2.6 years of football played. After accounting for brain bank selection, the magnitude of the relationship between years played and CTE status remained consistent. ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

The locus coeruleus (LC) is a nucleus within the brainstem that consists of norepinephrine-releasing neurons. It is involved in broad processes including autonomic regulation, and cognitive and emotional functions such as arousal, attention and anxiety. Understanding the mechanisms that control the excitability of LC neurons is important because they innervate widespread regions of the central nervous system. One of the key regulators is the cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]c), the increases in which can be amplified by calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) from the intracellular calcium stores. Although the electrical activities of LC neurons are regulated by changes in [Ca2+]c, the extent of CICR involvement in this regulation has remained unclear. Here we show that CICR hyperpolarizes acutely dissociated LC neurons of the rat brain and demonstrate the pathway whereby it does this. When CICR was activated by extracellular application of 10 mM caffeine, LC neurons were hyperpolarized in the current-clamp mode of the patch-clamp recording, and the majority of neurons showed an outward current in the voltage-clamp mode. This outward current was accompanied by an increase in membrane conductance, and its reversal potential was close to the K+ equilibrium potential, indicating that it is mediated by the opening of K+ channels. The outward current was generated in the absence of extracellular calcium and was blocked when the calcium stores were inhibited by applying ryanodine. Pharmacological experiments indicated that the outward current was mediated by Ca2+-activated K+ channels of the non-small conductance type. Finally, the application of caffeine led to an increase in the [Ca2+]c in these neurons, as visualized by fluorescence microscopy. These findings delineate a mechanism whereby CICR suppresses the electrical activity of LC neurons, and indicate that it could play a dynamic role in modulating the LC-mediated noradrenergic tone in the brain.

Background: TDCS modulates cortical excitability in a polarity-specific way. When used in combination with a behavioural task, it can also alter performance. Previously, tDCS modulated the performance of older adults on a complex speech motor learning task, which involved repetition of tongue twisters (Fiori et al., 2014). Objective: We aimed to replicate this finding in healthy young participants and to extend it by measuring tDCS-induced changes in motor excitability using transcranial magnetic stimulation and motor-evoked potentials elicited in the lips. Method: In a double-blind randomized sham-controlled study, three groups of 20 participants received: 1) anodal tDCS to the left IFG/LipM1 and cathodal tDCS to the right hemisphere homologue; or 2) cathodal tDCS over the left and anodal over the right; or 3) sham stimulation. Participants heard and repeated tongue twisters and matched simple sentences before, during and 10 minutes after the stimulation. Motor excitability was measured before and immediately after the tDCS. Results: The improvement in performance of tongue twister repetition from baseline to after stimulation was significantly greater than for the simple sentences but did not differ among the three groups. Motor excitability significantly decreased to a small but similar extent across the three groups. Conclusions: TDCS did not modulate performance on a complex articulation task in healthy young adults. TDCS applied concurrently with task learning also failed to modulate motor excitability in expected ways. TDCS may be most effective in brains where brain function is sub-optimal due to age-related declines or pathology.

Newborns and hatchlings of many species perform incredibly sophisticated behaviors, but all vertebrates and many invertebrates selectively abstain from sexual activity at the beginning of life. Hormonal changes have long been associated with adolescence, but it is not clear how these circulating factors create a new motivation and drive its associated behaviors. We show that the transition to sexuality in male Drosophila is controlled by juvenile hormone, which spikes at eclosion and declines over days as the propensity for courtship gradually increases. Juvenile hormone directly inhibits the activity of at least three courtship-motivating circuit elements, ensuring the complete suppression of sexual motivation and behavior. Blocking or overriding these inhibitory mechanisms evokes immediate and robust sexual behavior from very young and otherwise asexual males. These results provide a first example of hormonal changes gating the transition to sexuality by activating latent, but largely developed and functional, motivational circuitry.

BACKGROUND: Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is critical for the extinction of drug-seeking. Expression of the Bdnf gene is highly regulated via interactions with non-coding RNA, which themselves are altered following drug exposure. Here we investigate whether a novel long non-coding RNA antisense to Bdnf prevents extinction of drug-seeking. METHODS: Strand-specific RNA sequencing identified a novel long non-coding RNA antisense to exon IV of the Bdnf gene in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex of 8 adult male rats. We then assessed asBdnf-IV expression using strand-specific reverse transcription and quantitative polymerase chain reaction following acquisition, extinction or abstinence from intravenous nicotine self-administration (N = 116). A functional role of the asBdnf-IV in extinction of nicotine-seeking was established by infusing gapmer oligonucleotides into the infralimbic cortex prior to extinction and testing for the effect of these infusions on reinstatement and reacquisition of nicotine-seeking (N = 36). RESULTS: RNA sequencing identified the presence of a novel long non-coding RNA antisense to exon IV of the Bdnf gene (asBdnf-IV). Expression of asBdnf-IV was elevated following intravenous nicotine self-administration but not experimenter-administered nicotine. Elevated asBdnf-IV persisted across abstinence and to a greater extent following extinction training, suggesting an interaction between abstinence and extinction learning. In support of this, knockdown of the asBdnf-IV across extinction, but not abstinence, significantly attenuated nicotine-primed reinstatement of nicotine-seeking. CONCLUSIONS: asBdnf-IV accumulates in the infralimbic cortex across self-administration training, interferes with the inhibitory learning that underpins extinction of drug-seeking, and predisposes animals to drug relapse.

Because the motives behind goal-directed behaviors are often complex, most behaviors result from the interplay between different motives. However, it is unclear how this interplay between multiple motives affects the neural computation of goal-directed behaviors. Using a combination of drift-diffusion modeling and fMRI, we show that the interplay between different social motives changes initial preferences for prosocial behavior before a person makes a behavioral choice. This increase in preferences for the prosocial choice option was tracked by neural responses in the bilateral dorsal striatum, which in turn lowered the amount of information necessary for choosing prosocial behavior. We obtained these results using a paradigm in which each participant performed the same behavior based on different, simultaneously activated motives, or based on each of the motives separately. Thus, our findings provide a model of behavioral choice computation in complex motivational states, i.e., the motivational setting that drives most goal-directed human behaviors.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/851550v1?rss=1">Different principles govern different scales of brain folding</a></h4>

The signature folds of the human brain are formed through a complex and developmentally regulated process. In vitro and in silico models of this process demonstrate a random pattern of sulci and gyri, unlike the highly ordered and conserved structure seen in the human cortex. Here, we account for the large-scale pattern of cortical folding by combining advanced fetal MRI with nonlinear diffeomorphic registration and volumetric analysis. Our analysis demonstrates that in utero brain growth follows a logistic curve, in the absence of an external volume constraint. The Sylvian fissure forms from interlobar folding, where separate lobes overgrow and close an existing subarachnoid space. In contrast, other large sulci, which are the ones represented in existing models, fold through an invagination of a flat surface, a mechanistically different process. Analyzing local variations in volumetric expansion rates, we demonstrate that the three phases of the logistic curve correspond to three different phases of folding - interlobar, large sulcal, and secondary folding. Cortical folding is driven by multiple spatially and temporally different mechanisms, therefore regionally distinct biological process may be responsible for the global geometry of the adult brain.

<p>by Kiya W. Govek, Venkata S. Yamajala, Pablo G. Camara</p>

The prevailing paradigm for the analysis of biological data involves comparing groups of replicates from different conditions (e.g. control and treatment) to statistically infer features that discriminate them (e.g. differentially expressed genes). However, many situations in modern genomics such as single-cell omics experiments do not fit well into this paradigm because they lack true replicates. In such instances, spectral techniques could be used to rank features according to their degree of consistency with an underlying metric structure without the need to cluster samples. Here, we extend spectral methods for feature selection to abstract simplicial complexes and present a general framework for clustering-independent analysis. Combinatorial Laplacian scores take into account the topology spanned by the data and reduce to the ordinary Laplacian score when restricted to graphs. We demonstrate the utility of this framework with several applications to the analysis of gene expression and multi-modal genomic data. Specifically, we perform differential expression analysis in situations where samples cannot be grouped into distinct classes, and we disaggregate differentially expressed genes according to the topology of the expression space (e.g. alternative paths of differentiation). We also apply this formalism to identify genes with spatial patterns of expression using fluorescence in-situ hybridization data and to establish associations between genetic alterations and global expression patterns in large cross-sectional studies. Our results provide a unifying perspective on topological data analysis and manifold learning approaches to the analysis of large-scale biological datasets.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2bPoyHJP3uw" width="1" />

Seasonal influenza results in substantial annual morbidity and mortality in the United States and worldwide. Accurate forecasts of key features of influenza epidemics, such as the timing and severity of the peak incidence in a given season, can inform public health response to outbreaks. As part of ongoing efforts to incorporate data and advanced analytical methods into public health decision-making, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has organized seasonal influenza forecasting challenges since the 2013/2014 season. In the 2017/2018 season, 22 teams participated. A subset of four teams created a research consortium called the FluSight Network in early 2017. During the 2017/2018 season they worked together to produce a collaborative multi-model ensemble that combined 21 separate component models into a single model using a machine learning technique called stacking. This approach creates a weighted average of predictive densities where the weight for each component is determined by maximizing overall ensemble accuracy over past seasons. In the 2017/2018 influenza season, one of the largest seasonal outbreaks in the last 15 years, this multi-model ensemble performed better on average than all individual component models and placed second overall in the CDC challenge. It also outperformed the baseline multi-model ensemble created by the CDC that took a simple average of all models submitted to the forecasting challenge. This project shows that collaborative efforts between research teams to develop ensemble forecasting approaches can bring measurable improvements in forecast accuracy and important reductions in the variability of performance from year to year. Efforts such as this, that emphasize real-time testing and evaluation of forecasting models and facilitate the close collaboration between public health officials and modeling researchers, are essential to improving our understanding of how best to use forecasts to improve public health response to seasonal and emerging epidemic threats.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/eMce6xkJIF4" width="1" />

<p>by Charlotte Le Mouel, Romain Brette</p>

External perturbation forces may compromise standing balance. The nervous system can intervene only after a delay greater than 100 ms, during which the body falls freely. With ageing, sensorimotor delays are prolonged, posing a critical threat to balance. We study a generic model of stabilisation with neural delays to understand how the organism should adapt to challenging balance conditions. The model suggests that ankle stiffness should be increased in anticipation of perturbations, for example by muscle co-contraction, so as to slow down body fall during the neural response delay. Increased ankle muscle co-contraction is indeed observed in young adults when standing in challenging balance conditions, and in older relative to young adults during normal stance. In parallel, the analysis of the model shows that increases in either stiffness or neural delay must be coordinated with decreases in spinal sensorimotor gains, otherwise the feedback itself becomes destabilizing. Accordingly, a decrease in spinal feedback is observed in challenging conditions, and with age-related increases in neural delay. These observations have been previously interpreted as indicating an increased reliance on cortical rather than spinal control of balance, despite the fact that cortical responses have a longer latency. Our analysis challenges this interpretation by showing that these observations are consistent with a functional coadaptation of spinal feedback gains to functional changes in stiffness and neural delay.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ons7ZPkKFWY" width="1" />

Infections are a serious health concern worldwide, particularly in vulnerable populations such as the immunocompromised, elderly, and young. Advances in metagenomic sequencing availability, speed, and decreased cost offer the opportunity to supplement or even replace culture-based identification of pathogens with DNA sequence-based diagnostics. Adopting metagenomic analysis for clinical use requires that all aspects of the workflow are optimized and tested, including data analysis and computational time and resources. We tested the accuracy, sensitivity, and resource requirements of three top metagenomic taxonomic classifiers that use fast k-mer based algorithms: Centrifuge, CLARK, and KrakenUniq. Binary mixtures of bacteria showed all three reliably identified organisms down to 1% relative abundance, while only the relative abundance estimates of Centrifuge and CLARK were accurate. All three classifiers identified the organisms present in their default databases from a mock bacterial community of 20 organisms, but only Centrifuge had no false positives. In addition, Centrifuge required far less computational resources and time for analysis. Centrifuge analysis of metagenomes obtained from samples of VAP, infected DFUs, and FN showed Centrifuge identified pathogenic bacteria and one virus that were corroborated by culture or a clinical PCR assay. Importantly, in both diabetic foot ulcer patients, metagenomic sequencing identified pathogens 4–6 weeks before culture. Finally, we show that Centrifuge results were minimally affected by elimination of time-consuming read quality control and host screening steps.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9p_4mLbCm9o" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Febrile seizures may follow vaccination. Common variants in the sodium channel gene, <i>SCN1A</i>, are associated with febrile seizures and rare pathogenic variants in <i>SCN1A</i> cause the severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy Dravet Syndrome. Following vaccination, febrile seizures may raise the spectre of poor outcome and inappropriately implicate vaccination as the cause. We aimed to determine the prevalence of <i>SCN1A</i> variants in children having their first febrile seizure either proximal to vaccination, or unrelated to vaccination compared to controls.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed <i>SCN1A</i> sequencing, blind to clinical category, in a prospective cohort of children presenting with their first febrile seizure as vaccine proximate (n=69), or as non‐vaccine proximate (n=75), and children with no history of seizures (n=90) recruited in Australian paediatric hospitals.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We detected two pathogenic variants in vaccine proximate cases (p.R568X and p.W932R), both of whom developed Dravet syndrome, and one in a non‐vaccine proximate case (p.V947L) who had Febrile seizures plus from 9 months. All had generalised tonic‐clonic seizures lasting longer than 15 minutes. We also found enrichment of a reported risk allele, rs6432860‐T, in children with febrile seizures compared to controls (Odds Ratio 1.91 [95% CI 1.31‐ 2.81]).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Pathogenic <i>SCN1A</i> variants may be identified in infants with vaccine proximate febrile seizures. As early diagnosis of Dravet syndrome is essential for optimal management and outcome. <i>SCN1A</i> sequencing in infants with prolonged febrile seizures, proximate to vaccination, should become routine.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Clinical outcomes in multiple sclerosis (MS) are highly variable. We aim to determine the long‐term clinical outcomes in MS, and to identify early prognostic features of these outcomes.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>One hundred thirty‐two people presenting with a clinically isolated syndrome were prospectively recruited between 1984 and 1987, and followed up clinically and radiologically 1, 5, 10, 14, 20, and now 30 years later. All available notes and magnetic resonance imaging scans were reviewed, and MS was defined according to the 2010 McDonald criteria.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Clinical outcome data were obtained in 120 participants at 30 years. Eighty were known to have developed MS by 30 years. Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores were available in 107 participants, of whom 77 had MS; 32 (42%) remained fully ambulatory (EDSS scores ≤3.5), all of whom had relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS), 3 (4%) had RRMS and EDSS scores &gt;3.5, 26 (34%) had secondary progressive MS (all had EDSS scores &gt;3.5), and MS contributed to death in 16 (20%). Of those with MS, 11 received disease‐modifying therapy. The strongest early predictors (within 5 years of presentation) of secondary progressive MS at 30 years were presence of baseline infratentorial lesions and deep white matter lesions at 1 year.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Thirty years after onset, in a largely untreated cohort, there was a divergence of MS outcomes; some people accrued substantial disability early on, whereas others ran a more favorable long‐term course. These outcomes could, in part, be predicted by radiological findings from within 1 year of first presentation. ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate the network dynamics mechanisms underlying differential initiation of epileptic interictal spikes and seizures.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed combined in vivo 2‐photon calcium imaging from different targeted neuronal subpopulations and extracellular electrophysiological recordings during 4‐aminopyridine–induced neocortical spikes and seizures.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Both spikes and seizures were associated with intense synchronized activation of excitatory layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons (PNs) and to a lesser degree layer 4 neurons, as well as inhibitory parvalbumin‐expressing interneurons (INs). In sharp contrast, layer 5 PNs and somatostatin‐expressing INs were gradually and asynchronously recruited into the ictal activity during the course of seizures. Within layer 2/3, the main difference between onset of spikes and seizures lay in the relative recruitment dynamics of excitatory PNs compared to parvalbumin‐ and somatostatin‐expressing inhibitory INs. Whereas spikes exhibited balanced recruitment of PNs and parvalbumin‐expressing INs, during seizures IN responses were reduced and less synchronized than in layer 2/3 PNs. Similar imbalance was not observed in layers 4 or 5 of the neocortex. Machine learning–based algorithms we developed were able to distinguish spikes from seizures based solely on activation dynamics of layer 2/3 PNs at discharge onset.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>During onset of seizures, the recruitment dynamics markedly differed between neuronal subpopulations, with rapid synchronous recruitment of layer 2/3 PNs, layer 4 neurons, and parvalbumin‐expressing INs and gradual asynchronous recruitment of layer 5 PNs and somatostatin‐expressing INs. Seizures initiated in layer 2/3 due to a dynamic mismatch between local PNs and inhibitory INs, and only later spread to layer 5 by gradually and asynchronously recruiting PNs in this layer.

<p>Parallel developments in neuroscience and deep learning have led to mutually
productive exchanges, pushing our understanding of real and artificial neural
networks in sensory and cognitive systems. However, this interaction between
fields is less developed in the study of motor control. In this work, we
develop a virtual rodent as a platform for the grounded study of motor activity
in artificial models of embodied control. We then use this platform to study
motor activity across contexts by training a model to solve four complex tasks.
Using methods familiar to neuroscientists, we describe the behavioral
representations and algorithms employed by different layers of the network
using a neuroethological approach to characterize motor activity relative to
the rodent's behavior and goals. We find that the model uses two classes of
representations which respectively encode the task-specific behavioral
strategies and task-invariant behavioral kinematics. These representations are
reflected in the sequential activity and population dynamics of neural
subpopulations. Overall, the virtual rodent facilitates grounded collaborations
between deep reinforcement learning and motor neuroscience.

<p>Averaging amplitudes over consecutive time samples within a time-window is
widely used to calculate the amplitude of an event-related potential (ERP) for
cognitive neuroscience. Objective determination of the time-window is critical
for determining the ERP component. Clustering on the spatio-temporal ERP data
can obtain the time-window in which the consecutive time samples topographies
are expected to be highly similar in practice. However, there exists a
challenging problem of determining an optimal number of clusters. Here, we
develop a novel methodology to obtain the optimal number of clusters using
consensus clustering on the spatio-temporal ERP data. Various clustering
methods, namely, K-means, hierarchical clustering, fuzzy C-means,
self-organizing map, and diffusion maps spectral clustering are combined in an
ensemble clustering manner to find the most reliable clusters. When a range of
numbers of clusters is applied on the spatio-temporal ERP dataset, the optimal
number of clusters should correspond to the cluster of interest within which
the average of correlation coefficients between topographies of every two-time
sample in the time-window is the maximum for an ERP of interest. In our method,
we consider fewer cluster maps for analyzing an optimal number of clusters for
isolating the components of interest in the spatio-temporal ERP. The
statistical comparison demonstrates that the present method outperforms other
conventional approaches. This finding would be practically useful for
discovering the optimal clustering in spatio-temporal ERP, especially when the
cognitive knowledge about time-window is not clearly defined.

<p>Distinct scientific theories can make similar predictions. To adjudicate
between theories, we must design experiments for which the theories make
distinct predictions. Here we consider the problem of comparing deep neural
networks as models of human visual recognition. To efficiently determine which
models better explain human responses, we synthesize controversial stimuli:
images for which different models produce distinct responses. We tested nine
different models, which employed different architectures and recognition
algorithms, including discriminative and generative models, all trained to
recognize handwritten digits (from the MNIST set of digit images). We
synthesized controversial stimuli to maximize the disagreement among the
models. Human subjects viewed hundreds of these stimuli and judged the
probability of presence of each digit in each image. We quantified how
accurately each model predicted the human judgements. We found that the
generative models (which learn the distribution of images for each class)
better predicted the human judgments than the discriminative models (which
learn to directly map from images to labels). The best performing model was the
generative Analysis-by-Synthesis model (based on variational autoencoders).
However, a simpler generative model (based on Gaussian-kernel-density
estimation) also performed better than each of the discriminative models. None
of the candidate models fully explained the human responses. We discuss the
advantages and limitations of controversial stimuli as an experimental paradigm
and how they generalize and improve on adversarial examples as probes of
discrepancies between models and human perception.

<p>Cortical slow oscillations (≲1 Hz) are an emergent property of the cortical network that integrate connectivity and physiological features. This rhythm, highly revealing of the characteristics of the underlying dynamics, is a hallmark of low complexity brain states like sleep, and represents a default activity pattern. Here, we present a methodological approach for quantifying the spatial and temporal properties of this emergent activity. We improved and enriched a robust analysis procedure that has already been successfully applied to both in vitro and in vivo data acquisitions. We tested the new tools of the methodology by analyzing the electrocorticography (ECoG) traces recorded from a custom 32-channel multi-electrode array in wild-type isoflurane-anesthetized mice. The enhanced analysis pipeline, named SWAP (Slow Wave Analysis Pipeline), detects Up and Down states, enables the characterization of the spatial dependency of their statistical properties, and supports the comparison of different subjects. The SWAP is implemented in a data-independent way, allowing its application to other data sets (acquired from different subjects, or with different recording tools), as well as to the outcome of numerical simulations. By using the SWAP, we report statistically significant differences in the observed slow oscillations (SO) across cortical areas and cortical sites. Computing cortical maps by interpolating the features of SO acquired at the electrode positions, we give evidence of gradients at the global scale along an oblique axis directed from fronto-lateral toward occipito-medial regions, further highlighting some heterogeneity within cortical areas. The results obtained using the SWAP will be essential for producing data-driven brain simulations. A spatial characterization of slow oscillations will also trigger a discussion on the role of, and the interplay between, the different regions in the cortex, improving our understanding of the mechanisms of generation and propagation of delta rhythms and, more generally, of cortical properties.</p>

<p>Optogenetics is a state-of-the-art tool for interrogating neural circuits. In the cerebellum, Purkinje cells serve as the sole output of the cerebellar cortex where they synapse on neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN). To investigate the properties of this synaptic connection, we sought to elicit time-locked single action potentials from Purkinje cell axons. Using optical stimulation of channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-expressing Purkinje cells combined with patch-clamp recordings of Purkinje cells and DCN neurons in acute cerebellar slices, we determine the photostimulation parameters required to elicit single time-locked action potentials from Purkinje cell axons. We show that axons require longer light pulses than somata do to elicit single action potentials and that Purkinje cell axons are also more susceptible to light perturbations. We then demonstrate that these empirically determined photostimulation parameters elicit time-locked synaptic currents from postsynaptic cells in the DCN. Our results highlight the importance of optimizing optogenetic stimulation conditions to interrogate synaptic connections.</p>

<p>Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a challenging clinical problem worldwide. The cellular state and molecular expression in spinal cord tissue after injury are extremely complex and closely related to functional recovery. However, the spatial and temporal changes of gene expression and regulation in various cell types after SCI are still unclear. Here, we collected the rostral and caudal regions to the lesion at 11 time points over a period of 28 days after rat hemisection SCI. Combining whole-transcriptome sequencing and bioinformatic analysis, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between spinal cord tissue from injured and sham-operated animals. Significantly altered biological processes were enriched from DEGs in astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, immune cells, and vascular systems after SCI. We then identified dynamic trends in these processes using the average expression profiles of DEGs. Gene expression and regulatory networks for selected biological processes were also constructed to illustrate the complicate difference between rostral and caudal tissues. Finally, we validated the expressions of some key genes from these networks, including α-synuclein, heme oxygenase 1, bone morphogenetic protein 2, activating transcription factor 3, and leukemia inhibitory factor. Collectively, we provided a comprehensive network of gene expression and regulation to shed light on the molecular characteristics of critical biological processes that occur after SCI, which will broaden the understanding of SCI and facilitate clinical therapeutics for SCI.</p>

<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as master switch regulators in many biological processes in health and disease, including neuropathy. miRNAs are commonly quantified by reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), usually estimated as relative expression through reference genes normalization. Different non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are used for miRNA normalization; however, there is no study identifying the optimal reference genes in animal models for peripheral nerve injury. We evaluated the stability of eleven ncRNAs, commonly used for miRNA normalization, in dorsal root ganglia (DRG), dorsal horn of the spinal cord (dhSC), and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in the mouse spared nerve injury (SNI) model. After RT-qPCR, the stability of each ncRNA was determined by using four different methods: BestKeeper, the comparative delta-Cq method, geNorm, and NormFinder. The candidates were rated according to their performance in each method and an overall ranking list was compiled. The most stable ncRNAs were: sno420, sno429, and sno202 in DRG; sno429, sno202, and U6 in dhSC; sno202, sno420, and sno142 in mPFC. We provide the first reference genes’ evaluation for miRNA normalization in different neuronal tissues in an animal model of peripheral nerve injury. Our results underline the need for careful selection of reference genes for miRNA normalization in different tissues and experimental conditions. We further anticipate that our findings can be used in a broad range of nerve injury related studies, to ensure validity and promote reproducibility in miRNA quantification.</p>

<p>The inhibitory glycine receptor (GlyR) plays an important role in rapid synaptic inhibition in mammalian spinal cord, brainstem, higher brain centers, and is involved in transmission of nociceptive signals. Glucose and related mono- and disaccharides potentiate currents mediated by recombinant α1, α1-β, and α3 GlyRs. Here, we confirmed the specific potentiation of α3 GlyR signaling by glucose through: (i) patch-clamp electrophysiology on recombinant receptors; and (ii) by verifying in vitro data in a mouse model in vivo. Mice were intraperitoneally (IP) injected with glucose (2 g/kg) or vehicle, and then challenged with sublethal doses of strychnine (0.2 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg). Pain-related behavior was assessed using two established models: (i) touch sensitivity tests using von Frey filaments; and (ii) hotplate assay. We observed a reduction of pain sensitivity in glucose-treated mice relative to vehicle-treated control mice. Injection of strychnine resulted in an increased sensitivity to tactile and heat stimuli, which was reversed in the presence of glucose. Analgesic effects of glucose were more pronounced in von Frey experiments, consistent with the established use of this model for neuropathic pain. Overall, glucose showed mild analgesic effects and was able to compensate for strychnine-induced allodynia in mice. Since the action of strychnine is specific for GlyR, these experiments show for the first time an in vivo potentiation of GlyR activity by glucose and suggest a molecular mechanism for glucose-mediated analgesia.</p>

<p>Usher’s syndrome is the most common combined blindness–deafness disorder with USH1B, caused by mutations in MYO7A, resulting in the most severe phenotype. The existence of numerous, naturally occurring shaker1 mice harboring variable MYO7A mutations on different genetic backgrounds has complicated the characterization of MYO7A knockout (KO) and heterozygote mice. We generated a novel MYO7A KO mouse (Myo7a<sup>–</sup><sup>/</sup><sup>–</sup>) that is easily genotyped, maintained, and confirmed to be null for MYO7A in both the eye and inner ear. Like USH1B patients, Myo7a<sup>–</sup><sup>/</sup><sup>–</sup> mice are profoundly deaf, and display near complete loss of inner and outer cochlear hair cells (HCs). No gross structural changes were observed in vestibular HCs. Myo7a<sup>–</sup><sup>/</sup><sup>–</sup> mice exhibited modest declines in retinal function but, unlike patients, no loss of retinal structure. We attribute the latter to differential expression of MYO7A in mouse vs. primate retina. Interestingly, heterozygous Myo7a<sup>+</sup><sup>/</sup><sup>–</sup> mice had reduced numbers of cochlear HCs and concomitant reductions in auditory function relative to Myo7a<sup>+/+</sup> controls. Notably, this is the first report that loss of a single Myo7a allele significantly alters auditory structure and function and suggests that audiological characterization of USH1B carriers is warranted. Maintenance of vestibular HCs in Myo7a<sup>–</sup><sup>/</sup><sup>–</sup> mice suggests that gene replacement could be used to correct the vestibular dysfunction in USH1B patients. While Myo7a<sup>–</sup><sup>/</sup><sup>–</sup> mice do not exhibit sufficiently robust retinal phenotypes to be used as a therapeutic outcome measure, they can be used to assess expression of vectored MYO7A on a null background and generate valuable pre-clinical data toward the treatment of USH1B.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01239">Gastrodin Ameliorates Motor Learning Deficits Through Preserving Cerebellar Long-Term Depression Pathways in Diabetic Rats</a></h4>

<p>Cognitive dysfunction is a very severe consequence of diabetes, but the underlying causes are still unclear. Recently, the cerebellum was reported to play an important role in learning and memory. Since long-term depression (LTD) is a primary cellular mechanism for cerebellar motor learning, we aimed to explore the role of cerebellar LTD pathways in diabetic rats and the therapeutic effect of gastrodin. Diabetes was induced by a single injection of streptozotocin into adult Sprague–Dawley rats. Motor learning ability was assessed by a beam walk test. Pathological changes of the cerebellum were assessed by Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) and Nissl staining. Cellular apoptosis was assessed by anti-caspase-3 immunostaining. Protein expression levels of LTD pathway-related factors, including GluR2, protein kinase C (PKC), NR2A, and nNOS, in the cerebellar cortex were evaluated by western blotting and double immunofluorescence. The NO concentration was measured. The cellular degeneration and the apoptosis of Purkinje cells were evident in the cerebellum of diabetic rats. Protein expression levels of GluR2 (NC9W: 1.26 ± 0.12; DM9W + S: 0.81 ± 0.07), PKC (NC9W: 1.66 ± 0.10; DM9W + S: 0.58 ± 0.19), NR2A (NC9W: 1.40 ± 0.05; DM9W + S: 0.63 ± 0.06), nNOS (NC9W: 1.26 ± 0.12; DM9W + S: 0.68 ± 0.04), and NO (NC9W: 135.61 ± 31.91; DM9W + S: 64.06 ± 24.01) in the cerebellum were significantly decreased in diabetic rats. Following gastrodin intervention, the outcome of motor learning ability was significantly improved (NC9W: 6.70 ± 3.31; DM9W + S: 20.47 ± 9.43; DM9W + G: 16.04 ± 7.10). In addition, degeneration and apoptosis were ameliorated, and this was coupled with the elevation of the protein expression of the abovementioned biomarkers. Arising from the above, we concluded that gastrodin may contribute to the improvement of motor learning by protecting the LTD pathways in Purkinje cells.</p>

<p>We evaluated whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in two different montages could improve picture naming abilities in participants with anomic Alzheimer Disease or Frontotemporal dementia.</p>Methods<p>Utilizing a double-blind cross-over design, twelve participants were trained on picture naming over a series of 10 sessions with 30 min of anodal (2 mA) tDCS stimulation to either the left inferior parietotemporal region (P3), the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (F3), or sham stimulation. We evaluated performance on a trained picture naming list, an equivalent novel untrained list, and additional neuropsychological tasks.</p>Results<p>For trained item picture naming, significantly larger improvement was seen for real stimulation vs. sham stimulation for both the DLPFC and left inferior parieto-temporal stimulation montages at the end of the stimulation sessions. The parieto-temporal montage remained superior to sham 2 weeks poststimulation. Significant improvement vs. sham was also seen for novel “untrained” item picture naming 2 weeks post-stimulation when the parieto-temporal montage was given, whereas no change was observed when the DLPFC montage was given. Finally, comparing groups when they received the parieto-temporal montage, participants with semantic variant Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA) showed the least improvement for untrained items after their sessions. Scores on the additional neuropsychological tasks were unchanged.</p>Conclusion<p>tDCS stimulation has promise as a treatment for individuals with anomia arising from neurodegenerative disease, but its effectiveness can vary depending on the training given, the montage location used, as well as a participants’ diagnosis.</p>

<p>This study was conducted to explore the composition of the fecal microflora of Chinese Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, as well as to explore links between PD clinical features and antiparkinsonian medications on the gut microflora. Seventy-two PD cases [59 patients suffering from PD for &gt;1 year (OPD) and 13 new PD (NPD) patients] were studied. Microflora communities in the feces of the patients and corresponding healthy controls (HCs) were examined using high-throughput Illumina MiSeq sequencing targeting the 16S rRNA gene. The gut microflora of OPD patients contained high levels of Rikenellaceae compared to corresponding HCs. In addition, significantly higher levels of Turicibacteraceae were found in the NPD group compared to the corresponding HCs. The genera Turicibacter and Prevotella were significantly correlated with the PD severity scores. Our findings that some fecal microflora were closely related to PD clinical characteristics may enhance our understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment of PD.</p>

<p>Stereotypes exist in the interactions between different social groups, and gender stereotypes are particularly prevalent. Previous studies have suggested that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is involved in the social cognition that plays an important role in gender stereotypes, but the specific causal effect of the mPFC remains controversial. In this study, we aimed to use transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to identify a direct link between the mPFC and gender bias. Implicit stereotypes were measured by the gender implicit association test (IAT), and explicit prejudice was measured by the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI). We found that male and female participants had different behavioral and neural correlates of gender stereotypes. Anodal tDCS significantly reduced male participants’ gender D-IAT scores compared with cathodal and sham stimulation, while the stimulation had an insignificant effect in female participants. The reduction in male participants’ gender bias mainly resulted from a decrease in the difference in reaction time (RT) between congruent and incongruent blocks. Regarding the explicit bias measurement, male and female participants had distinct attitudes, but tDCS had no effect on ASI. Our results revealed that the mPFC played a causal role in controlling implicit gender stereotypes, which is consistent with previous observations and complements past lesion, neuroimaging, and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies and suggests that males and females have different neural bases for gender stereotypes.</p>

<p>Pericytes are functional components of the neurovascular unit (NVU) that are located around the blood vessels, and their roles in the regulation of cerebral health and diseases has been reported. Currently, the potential properties of pericytes as emerging therapeutic targets for cerebrovascular diseases have attracted considerable attention. Nonetheless, few reviews have comprehensively discussed pericytes and their roles in cerebrovascular diseases. Therefore, in this review, we not only summarized and described the basic characteristics of pericytes but also focused on clarifying the new understanding about the roles of pericytes in the pathogenesis of cerebrovascular diseases, including white matter injury (WMI), hypoxic–ischemic brain damage, depression, neovascular insufficiency disease, and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Furthermore, we summarized the current therapeutic strategies targeting pericytes for cerebrovascular diseases. Collectively, this review is aimed at providing a comprehensive understanding of pericytes and new insights about the use of pericytes as novel therapeutic targets for cerebrovascular diseases.</p>

<p>Cochlear implantation (CI) is now widely used to provide auditory rehabilitation to individuals having severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). However, CI can lead to electrode insertion trauma (EIT) that can cause damage to sensory cells in the inner ear resulting in loss of residual hearing. Even with soft surgical techniques where there is minimal macroscopic damage, we can still observe the generation of molecular events that may initiate programmed cell death via various mechanisms such as oxidative stress, the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and activation of the caspase pathway. In addition, individuals with CI may be exposed to noise trauma (NT) due to occupation and leisure activities that may affect their hearing ability. Recently, there has been an increased interest in the auditory community to determine the efficacy of drug-eluting electrodes for the protection of residual hearing. The objective of this study is to determine the effect of NT on implanted cochlea as well as the otoprotective efficacy of dexamethasone eluting electrode to implanted cochlea exposed to NT in a guinea pig model of CI. Animals were divided into five groups: EIT with dexamethasone eluting electrode exposed to NT; EIT exposed to NT; NT only; EIT only and naïve animals (control group). The hearing thresholds were determined by auditory brainstem recordings (ABRs). The cochlea was harvested and analyzed for transcript levels of inflammation, apoptosis and fibrosis genes. We observed that threshold shifts were significantly higher in EIT, NT or EIT + NT groups compared to naive animals at all the tested frequencies. The dexamethasone eluting electrode led to a significant decrease in hearing threshold shifts in implanted animals exposed to NT. Proapoptotic tumor necrosis factor-α [TNF-α, TNF-α receptor 1a (TNFαR1a)] and pro-fibrotic transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ) genes were more than two-fold up-regulated following EIT and EIT + NT compared to the control group. The use of dexamethasone releasing electrode significantly decreased the transcript levels of pro-apoptotic and pro-fibrotic genes. The dexamethasone releasing electrode has shown promising results for hearing protection in implanted animals exposed to NT. The results of this study suggest that dexamethasone releasing electrode holds great potential in developing effective treatment modalities for NT in the implanted cochlea.</p>

<p>The acquisition and retention of motor skills is necessary for everyday functioning in the elderly and may be critical in the context of motor rehabilitation. Recent studies indicate that motor training closely followed by sleep may result in better engagement of procedural (“how to”) memory consolidation processes in the elderly. Nevertheless, elderly individuals are mostly morning oriented and a common practice is to time rehabilitation programs to morning hours. Here, we tested whether the time-of-day wherein training is afforded (morning, 8–10:30 a.m., or evening, 6–9 p.m.) affects the long-term outcome of a multi-session motor practice program (10 sessions across 3–4 weeks) in healthy elderly participants. Twenty-nine (15 women) older adults (60–75 years) practiced an explicitly instructed five-element key-press sequence by repeatedly generating the sequence “as fast and accurately as possible.” The groups did not differ in terms of sleep habits and quality (1-week long actigraphy); all were morning-oriented individuals. All participants gained robustly from the intervention, shortening sequence tapping duration and retaining the gains (&gt; 90%) at 1-month post-intervention, irrespective of the time-of-day of training. However, retesting at 7-months post-intervention showed that the attrition of the training induced gains was more pronounced in the morning trained group compared to the evening group (76 and 56.5% loss in sequence tapping time; 7/14 and 3/14 participants showed a &gt; 5% decline in accuracy relative to end of training, respectively). Altogether, the results show that morning-oriented older adults effectively acquired skill in the performance of a sequence of finger movements, in both morning and evening practice sessions. However, evening training leads to a significant advantage, over morning training, in the long-term retention of the skill. Evening training should be considered an appropriate time window for motor skill learning in older adults, even in individuals with morning chronotype. The results are in line with the notion that motor training preceding a sleep interval may be better consolidated into long-term memory in the elderly, and thus result in lower forgetting rates.</p>

<p>Aging is associated with sensory, motor and cognitive impairments that may lead to reduced daily life functioning including gait disturbances, falls, injuries and mobility restrictions. A strong need exists for implementing effective evidence-based interventions for healthy aging. Therefore, the aim of this study was to (i) evaluate the feasibility and usability of an in-home multicomponent exergame training and (ii) explore its effects on physical functions, cognition and cortical activity. Twenty-one healthy and independently living older adults were included (11 female, 74.4 ± 7.0 years, range: 65–92 years) and performed 24 trainings sessions (each 40 min) over eight weeks. The first part was conducted in a living lab (home-like laboratory environment), the second part at participants’ home. The multicomponent exergame included Tai Chi-inspired exercises, dance movements and step-based cognitive games to train strength, balance and cognition. Attendance and attrition rates were calculated and safety during training was evaluated to determine feasibility. Participants rated the usability of the exergame (System Usability Scale) and reported on their game experience (Game Experience Questionnaire). Physical and cognitive functions and cortical activity (resting state electroencephalopathy) were assessed pre and post intervention. Results showed a high training attendance rate for the living lab and the home-based setting (91.7 and 91.0%, respectively) with a rather high attrition rate (28.6%, six drop-outs). Half of the drop-out reasons were related to personal or health issues. System usability was rated acceptable with a mean score of 70.6/100. Affective game experience was rated favorable. Significant improvements were found for minimal toe clearance, short-term attentional span, and information processing speed (p &lt; 0.05). No significant pre-post differences were found for cortical activity. To summarize, the exergame is generally feasible and usable for healthy older adults applied in an in-home setting and provides an overall positive emotional game experience. Nevertheless, flawless technical functionality should be a mandatory consideration. Additionally, the training might have potential positive influence on specific functions in older adults. However, the efficacy has to be evaluated in a future randomized controlled trial assessing the behavioral and neuroplastic changes in a larger population after a longer training period.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/52164">Cryo-EM structure of the KvAP channel reveals a non-domain-swapped voltage sensor topology</a></h4>

Conductance in voltage-gated ion channels is regulated by membrane voltage through structural domains known as voltage sensors. A single structural class of voltage sensor domain exists, but two different modes of voltage sensor attachment to the pore occur in nature: domain-swapped and non-domain-swapped. Since the more thoroughly studied Kv1-7, Nav and Cav channels have domain-swapped voltage sensors, much less is known about non-domain-swapped voltage-gated ion channels. In this paper, using cryo-EM, we show that KvAP from <i>Aeropyrum pernix</i> has non-domain-swapped voltage sensors as well as other unusual features. The new structure, together with previous functional data, suggest that KvAP and the Shaker channel, to which KvAP is most often compared, probably undergo rather different voltage-dependent conformational changes when they open.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/49720">Multistability and regime shifts in microbial communities explained by competition for essential nutrients</a></h4>

Microbial communities routinely have several possible species compositions or community states observed for the same environmental parameters. Changes in these parameters can trigger abrupt and persistent transitions (regime shifts) between such community states. Yet little is known about the main determinants and mechanisms of multistability in microbial communities. Here, we introduce and study a consumer-resource model in which microbes compete for two types of essential nutrients each represented by multiple different metabolites. We adapt game-theoretical methods of the stable matching problem to identify all possible species compositions of such microbial communities. We then classify them by their resilience against three types of perturbations: fluctuations in nutrient supply, invasions by new species, and small changes of abundances of existing ones. We observe multistability and explore an intricate network of regime shifts between stable states in our model. Our results suggest that multistability requires microbial species to have different stoichiometries of essential nutrients. We also find that a balanced nutrient supply promotes multistability and species diversity, yet make individual community states less stable.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/49455">Prolonged ovarian storage of mature <i>Drosophila</i> oocytes dramatically increases meiotic spindle instability</a></h4>

Human oocytes frequently generate aneuploid embryos that subsequently miscarry. In contrast, <i>Drosophila</i> oocytes from outbred laboratory stocks develop fully regardless of maternal age. Since mature <i>Drosophila</i> oocytes are not extensively stored in the ovary under laboratory conditions like they are in the wild, we developed a system to investigate how storage affects oocyte quality. The developmental capacity of stored mature Drosophila oocytes decays in a precise manner over 14 days at 25<sup>o</sup>C. These oocytes are transcriptionally inactive and persist using ongoing translation of stored mRNAs. Ribosome profiling revealed a progressive 2.3-fold decline in average translational efficiency during storage that correlates with oocyte functional decay. Although normal bipolar meiotic spindles predominate during the first week, oocytes stored for longer periods increasingly show tripolar, monopolar and other spindle defects, and give rise to embryos that fail to develop due to aneuploidy. Thus, meiotic chromosome segregation in mature <i>Drosophila</i> oocytes is uniquely sensitive to prolonged storage. Our work suggests the chromosome instability of human embryos could be mitigated by reducing the period of time mature human oocytes are stored in the ovary prior to ovulation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/49000">From plasmodesma geometry to effective symplasmic permeability through biophysical modelling</a></h4>

Regulation of molecular transport via intercellular channels called plasmodesmata (PDs) is important for both coordinating developmental and environmental responses among neighbouring cells, and isolating (groups of) cells to execute distinct programs. Cell-to-cell mobility of fluorescent molecules and PD dimensions (measured from electron micrographs) are both used as methods to predict PD transport capacity (i.e., effective symplasmic permeability), but often yield very different values. Here, we build a theoretical bridge between both experimental approaches by calculating the effective symplasmic permeability from a geometrical description of individual PDs and considering the flow towards them. We find that a dilated central region has the strongest impact in thick cell walls and that clustering of PDs into pit fields strongly reduces predicted permeabilities. Moreover, our open source multi-level model allows to predict PD dimensions matching measured permeabilities and add a functional interpretation to structural differences observed between PDs in different cell walls.

We previously demonstrated that CRM1, a major nuclear export factor, accumulates at <i>Hox</i> cluster regions to recruit nucleoporin-fusion protein Nup98HoxA9, resulting in robust activation of <i>Hox</i> genes (Oka et al., 2016). However, whether this phenomenon is general to other leukemogenic proteins remains unknown. Here, we show that two other leukemogenic proteins, nucleoporin-fusion SET-Nup214 and the NPM1 mutant, NPM1c, which contains a nuclear export signal (NES) at its C-terminus and is one of the most frequent mutations in acute myeloid leukemia, are recruited to the <i>HOX</i> cluster region via chromatin-bound CRM1, leading to <i>HOX</i> gene activation in human leukemia cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this mechanism is highly sensitive to a CRM1 inhibitor in leukemia cell line. Together, these findings indicate that CRM1 acts as a key molecule that connects leukemogenic proteins to aberrant <i>HOX</i> gene regulation either via nucleoporin-CRM1 interaction (for SET-Nup214) or NES-CRM1 interaction (for NPM1c).

Speech is a complex and ambiguous acoustic signal that varies significantly within and across speakers. A prevalent and ubiquitous example of such variation is accented speech, to which humans adapt extremely rapidly. The goal of this study is to uncover the neurobiological bases of the attunement process that enables such fluent comprehension. Twenty-four native English participants listened to words spoken by an unaccented "canonical" American talker and two "accented" talkers, and performed a word-picture matching task, while magnetoencephalography (MEG) was recorded. Accented speech was created by including systematic phonological substitutions within the word (e.g. [s] -&gt; [sh]). Activity in the auditory cortex (superior temporal gyrus) was greater for accented speech, but, critically, this was not attenuated by exposure. By contrast, prefrontal regions showed an interaction between the presence of an accent and amount of exposure: while activity decreased for canonical speech over time, responses to accented speech remained consistently elevated. Grainger causality analyses further revealed that prefrontal responses serve to modulate activity in auditory regions, suggesting the recruitment of top-down processing to decode accented signal. In sum, our results show that accented speech does not elicit the same prefrontal reduction in amplitude over time that unaccented speech does, and points to a dynamic exchange of information between the prefrontal and auditory cortices in order to recalculate phonetic classification and subsequent identification of lexical items.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/852202v1?rss=1">Statistical power: implications for planning MEG studies</a></h4>

Statistical power is key for robust, replicable science. Here, we systematically explored how numbers of trials and subjects affect statistical power in MEG sensor-level data. More specifically, we simulated "experiments" using the MEG resting-state dataset of the Human Connectome Project (HCP); we divided the data in two conditions, injected a dipolar source at a known anatomical location in one condition, but not the other, and detected significant differences at sensor level with classical paired t-tests across subjects. The group-level detectability of these simulated effects varied drastically with their anatomical origin. We thus examined in detail which spatial properties of the sources affected detectability, looking specifically at the distance and orientation of the source with respect to the closest sensor, and at the variability of these parameters across subjects. In line with previous single-subject studies, we found that the most detectable effects originate from source positions that are closest to the sensors and oriented tangentially with respect to the sensor array. In addition, cross-subject variability in orientation also affected group-level effect detectability, boosting detection in regions where this variability was small and hindering detection in regions where it was large. Incidentally, we observed a considerable covariation of source position, orientation, and their cross-subject variability in the individual brain anatomical space, making it difficult to assess the impact of each of these variables independently of one another. Therefore, we performed an additional set of simulations with the same simulation strategy as before, but this time, controlling spatial properties independently of individual anatomy. This allowed us to disentangle the effects of position, orientation, and cross-subject variability of the sources on detectability, and confirmed the strong impact of distance and orientation on detectability. Moreover, it emphasized that orientation variability across subjects also affects detectability, whereas position variability does not. Importantly, our study indicates that strict unequivocal recommendations as to the ideal number of trials and subjects for any experiment cannot be realistically provided for neurophysiological studies. Rather, it highlights the importance of considering the spatial constraints underlying expected sources of activity while planning experiments. This is particularly true when performing network level analyses in cognitive neuroscience studies, where nodes in a network shall not be considered equally detectable. Finally, we note that this variation in detectability may also account, in part, for the over-representation of some fields of study over others in the MEG domain (e.g. sensorimotor and auditory studies).

Cardiac performance is regulated by input of sympathetic nervous system. Junctions between sympathetic ganglion neurons (SGN) and cardiac myocytes are unique cell-cell contacts designed for the efficient regulation of heart rate and contractility by the autonomic nervous system. In the present study, we report that scaffold protein ankyrin G is localized to the postsynaptic sites in co-culture of cardiac myocytes and SGN. Consistent with roles of ankyrin G in targeting Nav channels to excitable domains in neurons and cardiac myocytes, we observed increased density of Nav channels at the neuro-cardiac junctions in co-cultures of cardiac myocytes and SGN. We also have found that KCNQ1 channels are present in increased density at the specialized zones of contacts of cardiac myocytes and SGN. An increased density of Nav and KCNQ1 channels at the neuro-cardiac sympathetic junctions may have an important role in modulation of cardiac action potential by neuronal input.

Individuals differ in their response to environmental stimuli, but the stability of individualized behaviors and their associated changes in brain plasticity are poorly understood. We developed a novel model of enriched environment to longitudinally monitor 40 inbred mice exploring 35 connected cages over periods of three to six months. We show that behavioral individuality that emerged during the first three months of environmental enrichment persisted when mice were withdrawn from the enriched environment for three additional months. Behavioral trajectories were associated with stable inter-individual differences in adult hippocampal neurogenesis and persistent epigenetic effects on neuronal plasticity genes in the hippocampus. Using genome-wide DNA methylation sequencing, we show that one third of the DNA methylation changes were maintained after withdrawal from the enriched environment. Our results suggest that, even under the most constraint conditions controlling genes and environment, early-life experiences result in lasting individualized changes in behavior and brain plasticity.

Determination of muscle forces during motion can help to understand motor control, assess pathological movement, diagnose neuromuscular disorders, or estimate joint loads. Difficulty of in vivo measurement made computational analysis become a common alternative in which, as several muscles serve each degree of freedom, the muscle redundancy problem must be solved. Unlike static optimization (SO), synergy optimization (SynO) couples muscle activations across all time frames, thereby altering estimated muscle co-contraction. This study explores whether the use of a muscle synergy structure within a static optimization framework improves prediction of muscle activations during walking. A motion/force/EMG gait analysis was performed on five healthy subjects. A musculoskeletal model of the right leg actuated by 43 Hill-type muscles was scaled to each subject and used to calculate joint moments, muscle-tendon kinematics and moment arms. Muscle activations were then estimated using SynO with two to six synergies and traditional SO, and these estimates were compared with EMG measurements. SynO neither improved SO prediction of experimental activation patterns nor provided SO exact matching of joint moments. Finally, synergy analysis was performed on SO estimated activations, being found that the reconstructed activations produced poor matching of experimental activations and joint moments. As conclusion, it can be said that, although SynO did not improve prediction of muscle activations during gait, its reduced dimensional control space could be beneficial for applications such as functional electrical stimulation (FES) or motion control and prediction.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/851709v1?rss=1">Rare Rewards Amplify Dopamine Learning Responses</a></h4>

Dopamine neurons drive learning by coding reward prediction errors (RPEs), which are formalized as subtractions of predicted values from reward values. Subtractions accommodate point estimate predictions of value, such as the average value. However, point estimate predictions fail to capture many features of choice and learning behaviors. For instance, reaction times and learning rates consistently reflect higher moments of probability distributions. Here, we demonstrate that dopamine RPE responses code probability distributions. We presented monkeys with rewards that were drawn from the tails of normal and uniform reward size distributions to generate rare and common RPEs, respectively. Behavioral choices and pupil diameter measurements indicated that monkeys learned faster and registered greater arousal from rare RPEs, compared to common RPEs of identical magnitudes. Dopamine neuron recordings indicated that rare rewards amplified RPE responses. These results demonstrate that dopamine responses reflect probability distributions and suggest a neural mechanism for the amplified learning and enhanced arousal associated with rare events.

Peripheral nerve injury leads to altered cortical excitation-inhibition balance which is associated with sensory dysfunctions. We tested if non-invasive repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) which has shown to induce neuronal excitability, and cell-specific magnetic activation via the Electromagnetic-perceptive gene (EPG) which is a novel gene that was identified and cloned from Kryptopterrus bicirrhis and demonstrated to evoke neural responses when magnetically stimulated, can restore cortical excitability. A battery of behavioral tests, fMRI and immunochemistry were performed in the weeks following limb denervation in rats. The results demonstrate that neuromodulation significantly improved long-term mobility, decreased anxiety and enhanced neuroplasticity. The study also identifies the acute post-injury phase as a critical time for intervention. Moreover, the results implicate EPG as an effective cell-specific neuromodulation approach. Together, these results reinforce the growing amount of evidence from human and animal studies that are establishing neuromodulation as an effective strategy to promote plasticity and rehabilitation.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/851055v1?rss=1">Welcoming back my arm: Affective touch increases body ownership following right hemisphere stroke</a></h4>

Right hemisphere stroke can impair the ability to recognise one's contralesional body parts as belonging to one's self. The study of this so-called 'disturbed sense of limb ownership' (DSO) can provide unique insights into the neurocognitive mechanisms of body ownership. Here, we address a hypothesis built upon experimental studies on body ownership in healthy volunteers. These studies have shown that affective (pleasant) touch, an interoceptive modality associated with unmyelinated, slow-conducting C tactile afferents, has a unique role in the sense of body ownership. Here we systematically investigated whether affective touch stimulation could increase body ownership in patients with DSO following right hemisphere stroke. An initial feasibility study in 16 adult, acute stroke patients enabled us to optimise and calibrate an affective touch protocol to be administered by the bedside. The main experiment, conducted with a different sample of 26 right hemisphere patients, assessed changes in limb ownership elicited following self- (patient) versus other- (experimenter) generated tactile stimulation, using a velocity known to optimally activate C-tactile fibres (i.e. 3cm/s), and a second velocity that is suboptimal for C-tactile activation (i.e. 18cm/s). We further examined the specificity and mechanism of observed changes in limb ownership in secondary analyses looking at (1) the influence of perceived intensity and pleasantness of touch, (2) touch laterality, and (3) level of DSO on ownership change, as well as (4) changes in unilateral neglect arising from touch. Findings indicated a significant increase in limb ownership following experimenter-administered, CT-optimal touch. Voxel-based Lesion-Symptom Mapping (VLSM) identified damage to the right insula and, more substantially, the right corpus callosum, associated with a failure to increase body ownership following experimenter-administered, affective touch. Our findings suggest that affective touch can increase the sense of body-part ownership following right hemisphere stroke, potentially due to its unique role in the multisensory integration processes that underlie the sense of body ownership.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/850396v1?rss=1">Extended access self-administration of methamphetamine is associated with age- and sex-dependent differences in drug taking behavior and recognition memory deficits in rats</a></h4>

Individuals who begin drug use during early adolescence experience more adverse consequences compared to those initiating later, especially if they are female. The mechanisms for these age and gender differences remain obscure, but studies in rodents suggest that psychostimulants may disrupt the normal ontogeny of dopamine and glutamate systems in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Here, we studied Sprague-Dawley rats of both sexes who began methamphetamine (METH, i.v.) self-administration (SA) in adolescence (postnatal [P] day 41) or adulthood (P91). Rats received seven daily 2-h SA sessions with METH or saccharin as the reinforcer, followed by 14 daily long access (LgA; 6 h) sessions. After 7 and 14 days of abstinence, novel object (OR) or object-in-place (OiP) recognition was assessed. PFC and nucleus accumbens were collected 7 days after the final cognitive test and NMDA receptor subunits and dopamine D1 receptor expression was measured. We found that during LgA sessions, adolescent-onset rats escalated METH intake more rapidly than adult-onset rats, with adolescent-onset females earning the most infusions. Adolescent-onset rats exhibited modest deficits in OiP compared to adult-onset rats, but there was no sex difference in this effect and no groups differed in OR. We found no group differences in D1 and NMDA receptor expression, suggesting no long-lasting alteration of ontogenetic expression profiles. Our findings suggest that adolescent-onset drug use is more likely to lead to compulsive-like patterns of drug-taking and subsequent dysfunction of PFC-dependent cognition.

ObjectiveHand movement is a crucial function for humans daily life. Developing brain-machine interface (BMI) to control a robotic hand by brain signals would help the severely paralyzed people partially regain the functional independence. Previous intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG)-based BMIs towards gesture decoding mostly used neural signals from the primary sensorimotor cortex while ignoring the hand movement related signals from posterior parietal cortex (PPC). Here, we propose combining iEEG recordings from PPC with that from primary sensorimotor cortex to enhance the gesture decoding performance of iEEG-based BMI.

ApproachStereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) signals from 25 epilepsy subjects were recorded when they performed a three-class hand gesture task. Across all 25 subjects, we identified 524, 114 and 221 electrodes from three regions of interest (ROIs), including PPC, postcentral cortex (POC) and precentral cortex (PRC), respectively. Based on the time-varying high gamma power (55-150 Hz) of SEEG signal, both the general activation in the task and the fine selectivity to gestures of each electrode in these ROIs along time was evaluated by the coefficient of determination r2. According to the activation along time, we further assessed the first activation time of each ROI. Finally, the decoding accuracy for gestures was obtained by linear support vector machine classifier to comparatively explore if the PPC will assist PRC and POC for gesture decoding.

Main ResultsWe find that a majority(L: &gt;60%, R: &gt;40%) of electrodes in all the three ROIs present significant activation during the task. A large scale temporal activation sequence exists among the ROIs, where PPC activates first, PRC second and POC last. Among the activated electrodes, 15% (PRC), 26% (POC) and 4% (left PPC) of electrodes are significantly selective to gestures. Moreover, decoding accuracy obtained by combining the selective electrodes from three ROIs together is 5%, 3.6%, and 8% higher than that from only PRC and POC when decoding features across, before, and after the movement onset, were used.

SignificanceThis is the first human iEEG study demonstrating that PPC contains neural information about fine hand movement, supporting the role of PPC in hand shape encoding. Combining PPC with primary sensorimotor cortex can provide more information to improve the gesture decoding performance. Our results suggest that PPC could be a rich neural source for iEEG-based BMI. Our findings also demonstrate the early involvement of human PPC in visuomotor task and thus may provide additional implications for further scientific research and BMI applications.

Wide-field imaging conventionally results in a single image plane oriented perpendicular to the optical axis. However, in brain slice or in vivo recording, neuronal or circuit morphologies lie in arbitrarily tilted planes. Consequently the spatiotemporal advantages of wide-field non-scanned imaging are lost because of the time required for stepwise focal readjustments to view an entire neuron or network. We describe an application of remote focus that views simultaneously two planes separated by up to 100 {micro}m, each with variable tilt from the conventional image plane. This permits fluorescence detection of ion fluxes or membrane potential across neuronal compartments and their correlation with electrical activity. Further, two fluorophores can be viewed simultaneously in each plane.

We show (i) neuronal images tilted to optimise simultaneous aquisition of somatic, dendritic and axonal compartments; (ii) networks viewed simultaneously at 2 depths separated by up to 100 {micro}m, (iii) widefield imaging at 30 Hz of Gcamp5 fluorescence during spontaneous spiking in motoneuron layers of zebrafish spinal cord separated by 30-40 microns.

<p>by Prashant Rangarajan, Sandeep K. Mody, Madhav Marathe</p>

Dengue and influenza-like illness (ILI) are two of the leading causes of viral infection in the world and it is estimated that more than half the world’s population is at risk for developing these infections. It is therefore important to develop accurate methods for forecasting dengue and ILI incidences. Since data from multiple sources (such as dengue and ILI case counts, electronic health records and frequency of multiple internet search terms from Google Trends) can improve forecasts, standard time series analysis methods are inadequate to estimate all the parameter values from the limited amount of data available if we use multiple sources. In this paper, we use a computationally efficient implementation of the known variable selection method that we call the Autoregressive Likelihood Ratio (ARLR) method. This method combines sparse representation of time series data, electronic health records data (for ILI) and Google Trends data to forecast dengue and ILI incidences. This sparse representation method uses an algorithm that maximizes an appropriate likelihood ratio at every step. Using numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method recovers the underlying sparse model much more accurately than the lasso method. We apply our method to dengue case count data from five countries/states: Brazil, Mexico, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand and to ILI case count data from the United States. Numerical experiments show that our method outperforms existing time series forecasting methods in forecasting the dengue and ILI case counts. In particular, our method gives a 18 percent forecast error reduction over a leading method that also uses data from multiple sources. It also performs better than other methods in predicting the peak value of the case count and the peak time.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RY7VezuN2ss" width="1" />

<p>by Delyle T. Polet, John E. A. Bertram</p>

It is widely held that quadrupeds choose steady gaits that minimize their energetic cost of transport, but it is difficult to explore the entire range of possible footfall sequences empirically. We present a simple model of a quadruped that can spontaneously produce any of the thousands of planar footfall sequences available to quadrupeds. The inelastic, planar model consists of two point masses connected with a rigid trunk on massless legs. It requires only center of mass position, hind and forelimb proportions and a stride-length to speed relationship as input. Through trajectory optimization of a work and force-rate cost, and a large sample of random initial guesses, we provide evidence for the global optimality of symmetrical four-beat walking at low speeds and two beat running (trotting) at intermediate speeds. Using input parameters based on measurements in dogs (<i>Canis lupus familiaris</i>), the model predicts the correct phase offset in walking and a realistic walk-trot transition speed. It also spontaneously reproduces the double-hump ground reaction force profile observed in walking, and the smooth single-hump profile observed in trotting. Actuation appears elastic, despite the model’s lack of springs, suggesting that spring-like locomotory behaviour emerges as an optimal tradeoff between work minimization and force-rate penalties.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0AJ6qImOFXQ" width="1" />

<p>by Stefano Avanzini, Tibor Antal</p>

As cancer advances, cells often spread from the primary tumor to other parts of the body and form metastases. This is the main cause of cancer related mortality. Here we investigate a conceptually simple model of metastasis formation where metastatic lesions are initiated at a rate which depends on the size of the primary tumor. The evolution of each metastasis is described as an independent branching process. We assume that the primary tumor is resected at a given size and study the earliest time at which any metastasis reaches a minimal detectable size. The parameters of our model are estimated independently for breast, colorectal, headneck, lung and prostate cancers. We use these estimates to compare predictions from our model with values reported in clinical literature. For some cancer types, we find a remarkably wide range of resection sizes such that metastases are very likely to be present, but none of them are detectable. Our model predicts that only very early resections can prevent recurrence, and that small delays in the time of surgery can significantly increase the recurrence probability.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/L50I85XwiuA" width="1" />

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Unawareness, or <i>anosognosia,</i> of memory deficits is a challenging manifestation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that adversely affects a patient's safety and decision‐making. However, there is a lack of consensus regarding the presence, as well as the evolution of altered awareness of memory function across the preclinical and prodromal stages of AD. Here, we aimed to characterize change in awareness of memory abilities and its relationship to beta‐amyloid (Aß) burden in a large cohort (N=1,070) of individuals across the disease spectrum.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Memory awareness was longitudinally assessed (average number of visits=4.3) and operationalized using the discrepancy between mean participant and partner report on the Everyday Cognition scale (ECog; memory domain). Aß deposition was measured at baseline using [18F]Florbetapir positron emission tomography imaging.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Aß predicted longitudinal changes in memory awareness, such that awareness decreased faster in participants with increased Aß burden. Aß and clinical group interacted to predict change in memory awareness, demonstrating the strongest effect in dementia participants, but could also be found in the CN participants. In a subset of CN participants who progressed to MCI, heightened memory awareness was observed up to 1.6 years before MCI diagnosis, with memory awareness declining until the time of progression to MCI (‐0.08discrepant‐points/year<i>)</i>. In a subset of MCI participants who progressed to dementia, awareness was low initially and continued to decline (‐0.23discrepant‐points/year<i>),</i> reaching anosognosia 3.2 years before dementia onset.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Aß burden is associated with a progressive decrease in self‐awareness of memory deficits, reaching anosognosia approximately three years before dementia diagnosis.</p>

<p>Recent work has indicated that, unlike humans, ImageNet-trained CNNs tend to
classify images by texture rather than shape. How pervasive is this bias, and
where does it come from? We find that, when trained on datasets of images with
conflicting shape and texture, the inductive bias of CNNs often favors shape;
in general, models learn shape at least as easily as texture. Moreover,
although ImageNet training leads to classifier weights that classify ambiguous
images according to texture, shape is decodable from the hidden representations
of ImageNet networks. Turning to the question of the origin of texture bias, we
identify consistent effects of task, architecture, preprocessing, and
hyperparameters. Different self-supervised training objectives and different
architectures have significant and largely independent effects on the shape
bias of the learned representations. Among modern ImageNet architectures, we
find that shape bias is positively correlated with ImageNet accuracy.
Random-crop data augmentation encourages reliance on texture: Models trained
without crops have lower accuracy but higher shape bias. Finally,
hyperparameter combinations that yield similar accuracy are associated with
vastly different levels of shape bias. Our results suggest general strategies
to reduce texture bias in neural networks.

<p>We present a novel machine learning architecture for classification suggested
by experiments on the insect olfactory system. The network separates odors via
a winnerless competition network, then classifies objects by projection into a
high dimensional space where a support vector machine provides more precision
in classification. We build this network using biophysical models of neurons
with our results showing high discrimination among inputs and exceptional
robustness to noise. The same circuitry accurately identifies the amplitudes of
mixtures of the odors on which it has been trained.

<p>In the past few years, deep learning has transformed artificial intelligence
research and led to impressive performance in various difficult tasks. However,
it is still unclear how the brain can perform credit assignment across many
areas as efficiently as backpropagation does in deep neural networks. In this
paper, we introduce a model that relies on a new role for a neuronal inhibitory
machinery, referred to as ghost units. By cancelling the feedback coming from
the upper layer when no target signal is provided to the top layer, the ghost
units enables the network to backpropagate errors and do efficient credit
assignment in deep structures. While considering one-compartment neurons and
requiring very few biological assumptions, it is able to approximate the error
gradient and achieve good performance on classification tasks. Error
backpropagation occurs through the recurrent dynamics of the network and thanks
to biologically plausible local learning rules. In particular, it does not
require separate feedforward and feedback circuits. Different mechanisms for
cancelling the feedback were studied, ranging from complete duplication of the
connectivity by long term processes to online replication of the feedback
activity. This reduced system combines the essential elements to have a working
biologically abstracted analogue of backpropagation with a simple formulation
and proofs of the associated results. Therefore, this model is a step towards
understanding how learning and memory are implemented in cortical multilayer
structures, but it also raises interesting perspectives for neuromorphic
hardware.

<p>The fields of artificial intelligence and neuroscience have a long history of
fertile bi-directional interactions. On the one hand, important inspiration for
the development of artificial intelligence systems has come from the study of
natural systems of intelligence, the mammalian neocortex in particular. On the
other, important inspiration for models and theories of the brain have emerged
from artificial intelligence research. A central question at the intersection
of these two areas is concerned with the processes by which neocortex learns,
and the extent to which they are analogous to the back-propagation training
algorithm of deep networks. Matching the data efficiency, transfer and
generalization properties of neocortical learning remains an area of active
research in the field of deep learning. Recent advances in our understanding of
neuronal, synaptic and dendritic physiology of the neocortex suggest new
approaches for unsupervised representation learning, perhaps through a new
class of objective functions, which could act alongside or in lieu of
back-propagation. Such local learning rules have implicit rather than explicit
objectives with respect to the training data, facilitating domain adaptation
and generalization. Incorporating them into deep networks for representation
learning could better leverage unlabelled datasets to offer significant
improvements in data efficiency of downstream supervised readout learning, and
reduce susceptibility to adversarial perturbations, at the cost of a more
restricted domain of applicability.

<p>The mirror neuron theory that has enjoyed continued validations was developed
with no particular attention to the phenomenon of the vision. Understandably
the perception of vision has always been thought to happen, naturally, as that
for any of the other four senses. However, the reality that underlies this
presumption is by no means obvious; vision perception is based on remote
sensing of the ecology, fundamentally different form that of the other senses,
which have tactile stimulation origin (contact with matter). While its reality,
as explicated here, explains why the above presumption is true, it also bears
heavily on the mirror neuron theory: the revelation of the nature of vision
makes mirror neurons unnecessary. The extensive cognitive neurosciences
investigation of primates and humans, over the past three decades, have
experimentally validated the theory of mirror neurons which had been put
forward early in the period (1980s and 1990s) based on the results of cognitive
research experiments on the macaque monkeys. Based on further experimental
works, phenomena such as learning, empathy, and some aspects of survival, are
ascribed to the operations of this class of additional neurons. Here I reason
that all the results of the efforts of the proponents of the theory can, not
only find explanation in the context of the new theory of vision but also
provide support for it. This new take of the phenomenon of vision is developed
based on the nature of the experimental methods that have succeeded in
developing some measure of vision for the blinds, and the inferences from the
very likely nature of the computational strategy of the brain. I present
evidence that the mental phenomena, which rendered the claim of the mirror
neurons, are in essence the results of subjects beings variably touched by
their ecology, through the coherent tactile operation of all senses.

<p>The problem of deciphering how low-level patterns (action potentials in the
brain, amino acids in a protein, etc.) drive high-level biological features
(sensorimotor behavior, enzymatic function) represents the central challenge of
quantitative biology. The lack of general methods for doing so from the size of
datasets that can be collected experimentally severely limits our understanding
of the biological world. For example, in neuroscience, some sensory and motor
codes have been shown to consist of precisely timed multi-spike patterns.
However, the combinatorial complexity of such pattern codes have precluded
development of methods for their comprehensive analysis. Thus, just as it is
hard to predict a protein's function based on its sequence, we still do not
understand how to accurately predict an organism's behavior based on neural
activity. Here we derive a method for solving this class of problems. We
demonstrate its utility in an application to neural data, detecting precisely
timed spike patterns that code for specific motor behaviors in a songbird vocal
system. Our method detects such codewords with an arbitrary number of spikes,
does so from small data sets, and accounts for dependencies in occurrences of
codewords. Detecting such dictionaries of important spike patterns --- rather
than merely identifying the timescale on which such patterns exist, as in some
prior approaches --- opens the door for understanding fine motor control and
the neural bases of sensorimotor learning in animals. For example, for the
first time, we identify differences in encoding motor exploration versus
typical behavior. Crucially, our method can be used not only for analysis of
neural systems, but also for understanding the structure of correlations in
other biological and nonbiological datasets.

<p>The specific connectivity of a neuronal network is reflected in the dynamics
of the signals recorded on its nodes. The analysis of how the activity in one
node predicts the behaviour of another gives the directionality in their
relationship. However, each node is composed of many different elements which
define the properties of the links. For instance, excitatory and inhibitory
neuronal subtypes determine the functionality of the connection. Classic
indexes such as the Granger causality (GC) quantifies these interactions, but
they do not infer into the mechanism behind them. Here, we introduce an
extension of the well-known GC that analyses the correlation associated to the
specific influence that a transmitter node has over the receiver. This way, the
G-causal link has a positive or negative effect if the predicted activity
follows directly or inversely, respectively, the dynamics of the sender. The
method is validated in a neuronal population model, testing the paradigm that
excitatory and inhibitory neurons have a differential effect in the
connectivity. Our approach correctly infers the positive or negative coupling
produced by different types of neurons. Our results suggest that the proposed
approach provides additional information on the characterization of G-causal
connections, which is potentially relevant when it comes to understanding
interactions in the brain circuits.

<p>The development of the brain is shaped by a myriad of factors among which neurotransmitters play remarkable roles before and during the formation and maturation of synaptic circuits. Cellular processes such as neurogenesis, morphological development, synaptogenesis and maturation of synapses are temporary and spatially regulated by the local or distal influence of neurotransmitters in the developing cortex. Thus, research on this area has contributed to the understanding of fundamental mechanisms of brain development and to shed light on the etiology of various human neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and Rett syndrome (RTT), among others. Recently, the field of neuroscience has been shaken by an explosive advance of experimental approaches linked to the use of induced pluripotent stem cells and reprogrammed neurons. This new technology has allowed researchers for the first time to model in the lab the unique events that take place during early human brain development and to explore the mechanisms that cause synaptopathies. In this context, the role of neurotransmitters during early stages of cortex development is beginning to be re-evaluated and a revision of the state of the art has become necessary in a time when new protocols are being worked out to differentiate stem cells into functional neurons. New perspectives on reconsidering the function of neurotransmitters include opportunities for methodological advances, a better understanding of the origin of mental disorders and the potential for development of new treatments.</p>

<p>Serotonylation, the covalent linkage of serotonin to proteins has been discovered more than 60 years ago but only recently the mechanisms and first functions have been elucidated. It has been found that transglutaminases (TG) such as TG2 and the blood coagulation factor XIIIa are the enzymes which catalyze the linkage of serotonin and other monoamines to distinct glutamine (Gln) residues of target proteins. The first target proteins, small G-proteins and extracellular matrix constituents, were found in platelets and are pivotally involved in platelet aggregation and the formation of thrombi. The serotonylation of the same proteins is also involved in insulin secretion and in the proliferation of pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells and thereby in the pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Recently histones have been described as targets of serotonylation opening the area of transcriptional control to this posttranslational protein modification. Future studies will certainly reveal further target proteins, signaling pathways, cellular processes, and diseases, in which serotonylation or, more general, monoaminylation is important.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00282">Immune Checkpoint Blockade – How Does It Work in Brain Metastases?</a></h4>

<p>Immune checkpoints restrain the immune system following its activation and their inhibition unleashes anti-tumor immune responses. Immune checkpoint inhibitors revolutionized the treatment of several cancer types, including melanoma, and immune checkpoint blockade with anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies is becoming a frontline therapy in metastatic melanoma. Notably, up to 60% of metastatic melanoma patients develop metastases in the brain. Brain metastases (BrM) are also very common in patients with lung and breast cancer, and occur in ∼20–40% of patients across different cancer types. Metastases in the brain are associated with poor prognosis due to the lack of efficient therapies. In the past, patients with BrM used to be excluded from immune-based clinical trials due to the assumption that such therapies may not work in the context of “immune-specialized” environment in the brain, or may cause harm. However, recent trials in patients with BrM demonstrated safety and intracranial activity of anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 therapy. We here discuss how immune checkpoint therapy works in BrM, with focus on T cells and the cross-talk between BrM, the immune system, and tumors growing outside the brain. We discuss major open questions in our understanding of what is required for an effective immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy in BrM.</p>

<p>The pathological aggregation of tau characterizes a set of neurodegenerative diseases collectively referred to as tauopathies. Recent studies using cellular and animal models have suggested that tau pathology progresses by trans-cellular propagation. The process of propagation is mediated by certain species of extracellular tau, which are taken up by recipient cells and serve as a seed for tau aggregation. Tau propagation is currently one of the most active areas of research in dementia. Previous efforts to identify the specific tau molecules involved in propagation have suggested that multiple forms of tau with different molecular weights derived from recombinant tau or brain lysates exert seeding activity. Nonetheless, the molecular characteristics of the “extracellular” seed-competent tau as well as its release mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Given that tau is physiologically released into the extracellular space, it is critical to distinguish seed-competent tau from normal monomeric tau. Utilizing biosensor cells expressing P301S mutant tau fused to CFP/YFP, here we discriminated between seed-competent tau and inert monomer tau released from HEK293 cells. By analyzing the size-exclusion fractions of the media, we found that seed-competent tau was enriched in high molecular weight fractions of &gt;2,000 kDa, while the majority of soluble tau in the media positively detected by ELISA was in low molecular weight fractions. We also found that lysosomal stress not only increased Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent release of seed-competent tau but also altered its molecular size. Inhibiting lysosomal exocytosis specifically decreased release of seed-competent tau without influencing total tau. These data underscore the differential response of seed-competent tau and inert tau to lysosomal stress and indicates the presence of distinct release mechanisms via lysosomes.</p>

<p>Stroke patients often use trunk to compensate for impaired upper limb motor function during upper limb rehabilitation training, which results in a reduced rehabilitation training effect. Detecting trunk compensations can improve the effect of rehabilitation training. This study investigates the feasibility of a surface electromyography-based trunk compensation detection (sEMG-bTCD) method. Five healthy subjects and nine stroke subjects with cognitive and comprehension skills were recruited to participate in the experiments. The sEMG signals from nine superficial trunk muscles were collected during three rehabilitation training tasks (reach-forward-back, reach-side-to-side, and reach-up-to-down motions) without compensation and with three common trunk compensations [lean-forward (LF), trunk rotation (TR), and shoulder elevation (SE)]. Preprocessing like filtering, active segment detection was performed and five time domain features (root mean square, variance, mean absolute value (MAV), waveform length, and the fourth order autoregressive model coefficient) were extracted from the collected sEMG signals. Excellent TCD performance was achieved in healthy participants by using support vector machine (SVM) classifier (LF: accuracy = 94.0%, AUC = 0.97, F1 = 0.94; TR: accuracy = 95.8%, AUC = 0.99, F1 = 0.96; SE: accuracy = 100.0%, AUC = 1.00, F1 = 1.00). By using SVM classifier, TCD performance in stroke participants was also obtained (LF: accuracy = 74.8%, AUC = 0.90, F1 = 0.73; TR: accuracy = 67.1%, AUC = 0.85, F1 = 0.71; SE: accuracy = 91.3%, AUC = 0.98, F1 = 0.90). Compared with the methods based on cameras or inertial sensors, better detection performance was obtained in both healthy and stroke participants. The results demonstrated the feasibility of the sEMG-bTCD method, and it helps to prompt the stroke patients to correct their incorrect posture, thereby improving the effectiveness of rehabilitation training.</p>

<p>Traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) is a major contributor to global air pollution. The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported that air pollution due to gasoline and diesel emissions from internal combustion engines of automobiles, trucks, locomotives, and ships leads to 800,000 premature deaths annually due to pulmonary, cardiovascular, and neurological complications. It has been observed that individuals living and working in areas of heavy vehicle traffic have high susceptibility to anxiety, depression, and cognitive deficits. Information regarding the mechanisms that potentially lead to detrimental mental health effects of TRAP is gradually increasing. Several studies have suggested that TRAP is associated with adverse effects in the central nervous system (CNS), primarily due to increase in oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Animal studies have provided further useful insights on the deleterious effects of vehicle exhaust emissions (VEEs). The mechanistic basis for these effects is unclear, although gasoline and diesel exhaust-induced neurotoxicity seems the most plausible cause. Several important points emerge from these studies. First, TRAP leads to neurotoxicity. Second, TRAP alters neurobehavioral function. Exactly how that happens remains unclear. This review article will discuss current state of the literature on this subject and potential leads that have surfaced from the preclinical work.</p>

<p>Stuttering is a neurodevelopmental disorder that manifests as frequent disruptions in the flow of speech, affecting 1% of adults. Treatments are limited to behavioral interventions with variable success and high relapse rates, particularly in adults. However, even in severe cases, fluency can be temporarily induced during conditions in which the speaker synchronizes his speech with external rhythmic cues, such as when reading in unison (choral speech) or with a metronome. Non-invasive neuromodulation techniques such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have shown promise in augmenting the effects of behavioral treatment during motor and speech/language rehabilitation, but only one study to date has examined behavioral modulatory effects of tDCS in the context of stuttering. Using high-definition (HD)-tDCS electrodes, which improves focality of stimulation relative to conventional tDCS, we investigated the effects of tDCS on speech fluency and brain activation in 14 adults who stutter (AWS). Either anodal or sham stimulation was delivered on separate days over left supplementary motor area (SMA). During stimulation, participants read aloud in sync with a metronome. Measures of speech fluency and brain activity functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) were collected before and after stimulation. No significant differences in brain activity or speech fluency were found when comparing active and sham stimulation. However, stuttering severity significantly modulated the effect of stimulation: active stimulation attenuated the atypically strong association between stuttering severity and right thalamocortical network activity, especially in more severe speakers. These preliminary results warrant additional research into potential application of HD-tDCS to modulate speech motor networks to enhance fluency in stuttering.</p>

<p>Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes loss of normal sensation and often leads to debilitating neuropathic pain (NeP). Chronic NeP develops at or below the SCI lesion in as many as 80% of patients with SCI and may be induced by modulators of neuronal excitability released from activated microglia and macrophages. In the inflammatory response after SCI, different microglia/macrophage populations that are classically activated (M1 phenotype) or alternatively activated (M2 phenotype) have become of great interest. Chemokines have also recently attracted attention in neuron-microglia communication. CCL21 is a chemokine that activates microglia in the central nervous system (CNS) and is expressed only in neurons with an insult or mechanical injury. In this study using an SCI model in mutant (plt) mice with deficient CCL21 expression, we assessed post-SCI NeP and expression of microglia/macrophages and inflammatory cytokines at the injured site and lumbar enlargement. SCI-induced hypersensitivities to mechanical and thermal stimulation were relieved in plt mice compared with those in wild-type (C57BL/6) mice, although there was no difference in motor function. Immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry analysis showed that the phenotype of microglia/macrophages was M1 type-dominant in both types of mice at the lesion site and lumbar enlargement. A decrease of M1-type microglia/macrophages was seen in plt mice compared with wild-type, while the number of M2-type microglia/macrophages did not differ between these mice. In immunoblot analysis, expression of M1-induced cytokines [tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interferon-γ (IFN-γ)] was decreased in plt mice, while that of M2-induced cytokines interleukin-4 (IL-4, IL-10) did not differ in the two types of mice. The results of this study indicate that suppression of expression of inflammatory cytokines by decreasing the number of M1-type microglia/macrophages at the injured site and lumbar enlargement is associated with provision of an environment for reduction of NeP. These findings may be useful for the design of new therapies to alleviate NeP after SCI.</p>

<p>Voa protein is a subunit of V-ATPase proton pump which is essential to acidify intracellular organelles including synaptic vesicles. Voa1 is one of the four isoforms of Voa family with strong expression in neurons. Our present study was aimed to examine the role of Voa1 protein in mammalian brain neurons. To circumvent embryonic lethality, we generated conditional Voa1 knockout mice in which Voa1 was selectively deleted from forebrain pyramidal neurons. We performed experiments in the Voa1 knockout mice of ages 5–6 months to assess the persistent effects of Voa1 deletion. We found that the Voa1 knockout mice exhibited poor performance in the Morris water maze test compared to control mice. In addition, synaptic field potentials of the hippocampal CA1 region were greatly diminished in the Voa1 knockout mice when examined in brain slices in vitro. Furthermore, brain histological experiments showed severe degeneration of dorsal hippocampal CA1 neurons while CA3 neurons were largely preserved. The CA1 neurodegeneration was associated with general brain atrophy as overall hemispheric areas were reduced in the Voa1 cKO mice. Despite the CA1 degeneration and dysfunction, electroencephalographic recordings from the hippocampal CA3 area revealed aberrant spikes and non-convulsive discharges in the Voa1 knockout mice but not in control mice. These hippocampal spikes were suppressed by single intra-peritoneal injection of diazepam which is a benzodiazepine GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor enhancer. Together these results suggest that Voa1 related activities are essential for the survival of the targeted neurons in the dorsal hippocampal CA1 as well as other forebrain areas. We postulate that the Voa1 knockout mice may serve as a valuable model for further investigation of V-ATPase dysfunction related neuronal degeneration and functional abnormalities in forebrain areas particularly the hippocampus.</p>

<p>Multiple neurological, physiological, and behavioral functions are synchronized by circadian clocks into daily rhythms. Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and related tauopathies are associated with a decay of circadian rhythms, disruption of sleep patterns, and impaired cognitive function but the mechanisms underlying these alterations are still unclear. Traditional approaches in neurodegeneration research have focused on understanding how pathology impinges on circadian function. Since in Alzheimer’s disease and related tauopathies tau proteostasis is compromised, here we sought to understand the role of tau protein in neuronal circadian biology and related behavior. Considering molecular mechanisms underlying circadian rhythms are conserved from Drosophila to humans, here we took advantage of a recently developed tau-deficient Drosophila line to show that loss of tau promotes dysregulation of daily circadian rhythms and sleep patterns. Strikingly, tau deficiency dysregulates the structural plasticity of the small ventral lateral circadian pacemaker neurons by disrupting the temporal cytoskeletal remodeling of its dorsal axonal projections and by inducing a slight increase in the cytoplasmic accumulation of core clock proteins. Taken together, these results suggest that loss of tau function participates in the regulation of circadian rhythms by modulating the correct operation and connectivity of core circadian networks and related behavior.</p>

<p>Objective: To investigate changes in brain function at the regional and whole-brain levels in patients with tremor-dominant Parkinson’s disease (TDPD) complicated by sleep disorder (SD) by regional homogeneity (ReHo) and functional connectivity (FC) analysis of whole-brain resting-state functional magnetic resonance images.</p><p>Materials and Methods: ReHo and seed-based FC analyses were conducted among 32 patients with TDPD and SD (TDPD-SD), 24 with TDPD and no SD (TDPD-NSD), and 23 healthy controls (HCs) to assess spontaneous brain activity and network-level brain function. Correlation analyses were used to examine the associations between brain activity and the clinical data.</p><p>Results: Anterior cingulate gyrus (ACC) ReHo values differed significantly among the groups. ACC ReHo values were increased in TDPD-SD vs. HC and TDPD-SD vs. TDPD-NSD. ACC ReHo values were reduced in TDPD-NSD vs. HC. TDPD-SD ReHo values were positively correlated with Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores (r = 0.41, p = 0.020) but negatively correlated with Parkinson’s Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS) scores (r = −0.38, p = 0.030). FC analysis using ACC as a mask showed that FC of the left olfactory cortex (L-OC), right straight gyrus (R-SG), right superior parietal gyrus (R-SPG), and right precuneus differed significantly among the groups. FC values between R-SG and ACC were significantly lower in TDPD-SD than in TDPD-NSD, while the FC of L-OC and R-OC with ACC was significantly lower in TDPD-SD than in HC. FC between ACC and L-OC, R-SPG, and the right precuneus was lower in TDPD-NSD than in HC. There was no correlation between the FC values and other clinical data in any of the groups.</p><p>Conclusion: Localized abnormal activity in TDPD-SD was chiefly triggered by ACC. The change in the ReHo of ACC is closely related to the severity of TDPD-associated SD, revealing the role of this region as a regulator of the sleep mechanism in TDPD. Significant abnormal FC was found between R-SG and ACC in TDPD-SD but was not shown to correlate with clinical data.</p>

<p>Age-related neurodegenerative and neurochemical changes are considered to be the basis for the decline of motor function; however, the change of effective connections in cortical motor networks that come with aging remains unclear. Here, we investigated the age-related changes of the dynamic interaction between cortical motor regions. Twenty young subjects and 20 older subjects underwent both right hand motor execution (ME) and right hand motor imagery (MI) tasks by using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Conditional Granger causality analysis (CGCA) was used to compare young and older adults’ effective connectivity among regions of the motor network during the tasks. The more effective connections among motor regions in older adults were found during ME; however, effective within-domain hemisphere connections were reduced, and the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal was significantly delayed in older adults during MI. Supplementary motor area (SMA) had a significantly higher In+Out degree within the network during ME and MI in older adults. Our results revealed a dynamic interaction within the motor network altered with aging during ME and MI, which suggested that the interaction with cortical motor neurons caused by the mental task was more difficult with aging. The age-related effects on the motor cortical network provide a new insight into our understanding of neurodegeneration in older individuals.</p>

<p>Age-related differences in white matter (WM) microstructure have been linked to lower performance in tasks of processing speed in healthy older individuals. However, only few studies have examined this link in a longitudinal setting. These investigations have been limited to the correlation of simultaneous changes in WM microstructure and processing speed. Still little is known about the nature of age-related changes in WM microstructure, i.e., regionally distinct vs. global changes. In the present study, we addressed these open questions by exploring whether previous changes in WM microstructure were related to subsequent changes in processing speed: (a) 1 year later; or (b) 2 years later. Furthermore, we investigated whether age-related changes in WM microstructure were regionally specific or global. We used data from four occasions (covering 4 years) of the Longitudinal Healthy Aging Brain (LHAB) database project (N = 232; age range at baseline = 64–86). As a measure of WM microstructure, we used mean fractional anisotropy (FA) in 10 major WM tracts averaged across hemispheres. Processing speed was measured with four cognitive tasks. Statistical analyses were conducted with bivariate latent change score (LCS) models. We found, for the first time, evidence for lagged couplings between preceding changes in FA and subsequent changes in processing speed 2 years, but not 1 year later in some of the WM tracts (anterior thalamic radiation, superior longitudinal fasciculus). Our results supported the notion that FA changes were different between regional WM tracts rather than globally shared, with some tracts showing mean declines in FA, and others remaining relatively stable across 4 years.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50697">A projection specific logic to sampling visual inputs in mouse superior colliculus</a></h4>

Using sensory information to trigger different behaviors relies on circuits that pass through brain regions. The rules by which parallel inputs are routed to downstream targets are poorly understood. The superior colliculus mediates a set of innate behaviors, receiving input from &gt;30 retinal ganglion cell types and projecting to behaviorally important targets including the pulvinar and parabigeminal nucleus. Combining transsynaptic circuit tracing with in vivo and ex vivo electrophysiological recordings, we observed a projection-specific logic where each collicular output pathway sampled a distinct set of retinal inputs. Neurons projecting to the pulvinar or the parabigeminal nucleus showed strongly biased sampling from four cell types each, while six others innervated both pathways. The visual response properties of retinal ganglion cells correlated well with those of their disynaptic targets. These findings open the possibility that projection-specific sampling of retinal inputs forms a basis for the selective triggering of behaviors by the superior colliculus.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50149">The ribosomal P-stalk couples amino acid starvation to GCN2 activation in mammalian cells</a></h4>

The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2a (eIF2a) kinase GCN2 is activated by amino acid starvation to elicit a rectifying physiological program known as the Integrated Stress Response (ISR). A role for uncharged tRNAs as activating ligands of yeast GCN2 is supported experimentally. However, mouse GCN2 activation has recently been observed in circumstances associated with ribosome stalling with no global increase in uncharged tRNAs. We report on a mammalian CHO cell-based CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis screen for genes that contribute to ISR activation by amino acid starvation. Disruption of genes encoding components of the ribosome P-stalk, uL10 and P1, selectively attenuated GCN2-mediated ISR activation by amino acid starvation or interference with tRNA charging without affecting the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein stress-induced ISR, mediated by the related eIF2a kinase PERK. Wildtype ribosomes isolated from CHO cells, but not those with P-stalk lesions, stimulated GCN2-dependent eIF2a phosphorylation <i>in vitro</i>. These observations support a model whereby lack of a cognate charged tRNA exposes a latent capacity of the ribosome P-stalk to activate GCN2 in cells and help explain the emerging link between ribosome stalling and ISR activation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/49570">Persistent <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> infection in mice requires PerM for successful cell division</a></h4>

The ability of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (Mtb) to persist in its host is central to the pathogenesis of tuberculosis, yet the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely defined. PerM, an integral membrane protein, is required for persistence of Mtb in mice. Here, we show that <i>perM</i> deletion caused a cell division defect specifically during the chronic phase of mouse infection, but did not affect Mtb’s cell replication during acute infection. We further demonstrate that PerM is required for cell division in chronically infected mice and in vitro under host-relevant stresses because it is part of the mycobacterial divisome and stabilizes the essential divisome protein FtsB. These data highlight the importance of sustained cell division for Mtb persistence, define condition-specific requirements for cell division and reveal that survival of Mtb during chronic infection depends on a persistence divisome.

Multiple subtypes of dopamine receptors within the GPCR superfamily regulate neurological processes through various downstream signaling pathways. A crucial question about the dopamine receptor family is what structural features determine the subtype-selectivity of potential drugs. Here, we report the 3.5-angstrom crystal structure of mouse dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4) complexed with a subtype-selective antagonist, L745870. Our structure reveals a secondary binding pocket extended from the orthosteric ligand-binding pocket to a DRD4-specific crevice located between transmembrane helices 2 and 3. Additional mutagenesis studies suggest that the antagonist L745870 prevents DRD4 activation by blocking the relative movement between transmembrane helices 2 and 3. These results expand our knowledge of the molecular basis for the physiological functions of DRD4 and assist new drug design.

<p>by Jingyang Zhou, Noah C. Benson, Kendrick Kay, Jonathan Winawer</p>

Visual neurons respond to static images with specific dynamics: neuronal responses sum sub-additively over time, reduce in amplitude with repeated or sustained stimuli (neuronal adaptation), and are slower at low stimulus contrast. Here, we propose a simple model that predicts these seemingly disparate response patterns observed in a diverse set of measurements–intracranial electrodes in patients, fMRI, and macaque single unit spiking. The model takes a time-varying contrast time course of a stimulus as input, and produces predicted neuronal dynamics as output. Model computation consists of linear filtering, expansive exponentiation, and a divisive gain control. The gain control signal relates to but is slower than the linear signal, and this delay is critical in giving rise to predictions matched to the observed dynamics. Our model is simpler than previously proposed related models, and fitting the model to intracranial EEG data uncovers two regularities across human visual field maps: estimated linear filters (temporal receptive fields) systematically differ across and within visual field maps, and later areas exhibit more rapid and substantial gain control. The model is further generalizable to account for dynamics of contrast-dependent spike rates in macaque V1, and amplitudes of fMRI BOLD in human V1.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5J1pT69_J10" width="1" />

<p>Serum amyloid A (SAA) proteins are acute-phase reactant associated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles and increase in the plasma 1000-fold during inflammation. Recent studies have implicated SAAs in innate immunity and various disorders; however, the precise mechanism eludes us. Previous studies have shown SAAs are elevated following stroke and cerebral ischemia, and our studies demonstrated that SAA-deficient mice reduce inflammation and infarct volumes in a mouse stroke model. Our studies demonstrate that SAA increases the cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β), which is mediated by Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, cathepsin B, and caspase-1 and may play a role in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders. SAA induced the expression of NLRP3, which mediated IL-1β induction in murine BV-2 cells and both sex primary mouse microglial cells, in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. Inhibition or KO of the NLRP3 in microglia prevented the increase in IL-1β. <i>N</i>-acetyl-l-cysteine and mito-TEMPO blocked the induction of IL-1β by inhibiting ROS with SAA treatment. In addition, inhibition of cathepsin B with different drugs or microglia from CatB-deficient mice attenuated inflammasome activation. Our studies suggest that the impact of SAA on inflammasome stimulation is mediated in part by the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts and Toll-like receptor proteins 2 and 4. SAA induced inflammatory cytokines and an M1 phenotype in the microglial cells while downregulating anti-inflammation M2 phenotype. These studies suggest that brain injury to can elicit a systemic inflammatory response mediated through SAA that contributes to the pathological outcomes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In the present study, serum amyloid A can induce that activation of the inflammasome in microglial cells and give rise to IL-1β release, which can further inflammation in the brain following neurological diseases. The also presents a novel target for therapeutic approaches in stroke.</p>

<p>Seizures are common in humans with various etiologies ranging from congenital aberrations to acute injuries that alter the normal balance of brain excitation and inhibition. A notable consequence of seizures is the induction of aberrant neurogenesis and increased immature neuronal projections. However, regulatory mechanisms governing these features during epilepsy development are not fully understood. Recent studies show that microglia, the brain's resident immune cell, contribute to normal neurogenesis and regulate seizure phenotypes. However, the role of microglia in aberrant neurogenic seizure contexts has not been adequately investigated. To address this question, we coupled the intracerebroventricular kainic acid model with current pharmacogenetic approaches to eliminate microglia in male mice. We show that microglia promote seizure-induced neurogenesis and subsequent seizure-induced immature neuronal projections above and below the pyramidal neurons between the DG and the CA3 regions. Furthermore, we identify microglial P2Y12 receptors (P2Y12R) as a participant in this neurogenic process. Together, our results implicate microglial P2Y12R signaling in epileptogenesis and provide further evidence for targeting microglia in general and microglial P2Y12R in specific to ameliorate proepileptogenic processes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Epileptogenesis is a process by which the brain develops epilepsy. Several processes have been identified that confer the brain with such epileptic characteristics, including aberrant neurogenesis and increased immature neuronal projections. Understanding the mechanisms that promote such changes is critical in developing therapies to adequately restrain epileptogenesis. We investigated the role of purinergic P2Y12 receptors selectively expressed by microglia, the resident brain immune cells. We report, for the first time, that microglia in general and microglial P2Y12 receptors in specific promote both aberrant neurogenesis and increased immature neuronal projections. These results indicate that microglia enhance epileptogenesis by promoting these processes and suggest that targeting this immune axis could be a novel therapeutic strategy in the clinic.</p>

<p>Narcolepsy, characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, is associated with dysfunction of the hypothalamic hypocretin/orexin (Hcrt) system, either due to extensive loss of Hcrt cells (Type 1, NT1) or hypothesized Hcrt signaling impairment (Type 2, NT2). Accordingly, efforts to recapitulate narcolepsy-like symptoms in mice have involved ablating these cells or interrupting Hcrt signaling. Here, we describe <i>orexin/Arch</i> mice, in which a modified archaerhodopsin-3 gene was inserted downstream of the <i>prepro-orexin</i> promoter, resulting in expression of the yellow light-sensitive Arch-3 proton pump specifically within Hcrt neurons. Histological examination along with <i>ex vivo</i> and <i>in vivo</i> electrophysiological recordings of male and female <i>orexin/Arch</i> mice demonstrated silencing of Hcrt neurons when these cells were photoilluminated. However, high expression of the <i>Arch</i> transgene affected cellular and physiological parameters independent of photoillumination. The excitability of Hcrt neurons was reduced, and both circadian and metabolic parameters were perturbed in a subset of <i>orexin/Arch</i> mice that exhibited high levels of Arch expression. <i>Orexin/Arch</i> mice also had increased REM sleep under baseline conditions but did not exhibit cataplexy, a sudden loss of muscle tone during wakefulness characteristic of NT1. These aberrations resembled some aspects of mouse models with Hcrt neuron ablation, yet the number of Hcrt neurons in <i>orexin/Arch</i> mice was not reduced. Thus, <i>orexin/Arch</i> mice may be useful to investigate Hcrt system dysfunction when these neurons are intact, as is thought to occur in narcolepsy without cataplexy (NT2). These results also demonstrate the utility of extended phenotypic screening of transgenic models when specific neural circuits have been manipulated.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Optogenetics has become an invaluable tool for functional dissection of neural circuitry. While opsin expression is often achieved by viral injection, stably integrated transgenes offer some practical advantages. Here, we demonstrate successful transgenic expression of an inhibitory opsin in hypocretin/orexin neurons, which are thought to promote or maintain wakefulness. Both brief and prolonged illumination resulted in inhibition of these neurons and induced sleep. However, even in the absence of illumination, these cells exhibited altered electrical characteristics, particularly when transgene expression was high. These aberrant properties affected metabolism and sleep, resulting in a phenotype reminiscent of the narcolepsy Type 2, a sleep disorder for which no good animal model currently exists.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/47/9424?rss=1">Threat Memory Reminder Under Matrix Metalloproteinase 9 Inhibitor Doxycycline Globally Reduces Subsequent Memory Plasticity</a></h4>

<p>Associative memory can be rendered malleable by a reminder. Blocking the ensuing reconsolidation process is suggested as a therapeutic target for unwanted aversive memories. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is required for structural synapse remodeling involved in memory consolidation. Inhibiting MMP-9 with doxycycline is suggested to attenuate human threat conditioning. Here, we investigated whether MMP-9 inhibition also interferes with threat memory reconsolidation. Male and female human participants (<i>N</i> = 78) learned the association between two visual conditioned stimuli (CS<sup>+</sup>) and a 50% chance of an unconditioned nociceptive stimulus (US), and between CS<sup>–</sup> and the absence of US. On day 7, one CS<sup>+</sup> was reminded without reinforcement 3.5 h after ingesting either 200 mg of doxycycline or placebo. On day 14, retention of CS memory was assessed under extinction by fear-potentiated startle. Contrary to our expectations, we observed a greater CS<sup>+</sup>/CS<sup>–</sup> difference in participants who were reminded under doxycycline compared with placebo. Participants who were reminded under placebo showed extinction learning during the retention test, which was not observed in the doxycycline group. There was no difference between the reminded and the nonreminded CS<sup>+</sup> in either group. In contrast, during relearning after the retention test, the CS<sup>+</sup>/CS<sup>–</sup> difference was more pronounced in the placebo group than in the doxycycline group. To summarize, a single dose of doxycycline before threat memory reminder appeared to have no specific impact on reconsolidation, but to globally impair extinction learning, and threat relearning, beyond drug clearance.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Matrix metalloproteinase-9 inhibition appears to attenuate memory consolidation. It could also be a target for blocking reconsolidation. Here, we test this hypothesis in human threat conditioning. We find that doxycycline has no specific impact on a reminded cue, but confers a global reduction in extinction learning and threat learning beyond the clearance of the drug. This may point toward a more long-lasting impact of doxycycline treatment on memory plasticity.</p>

<p>Human behavior is dependent on the ability of neuronal circuits to predict the outside world. Neuronal circuits in early visual areas make these predictions based on internal models that are delivered via non-feedforward connections. Despite our extensive knowledge of the feedforward sensory features that drive cortical neurons, we have a limited grasp on the structure of the brain's internal models. Progress in neuroscience therefore depends on our ability to replicate the models that the brain creates internally. Here we record human fMRI data while presenting partially occluded visual scenes. Visual occlusion allows us to experimentally control sensory input to subregions of visual cortex while internal models continue to influence activity in these regions. Because the observed activity is dependent on internal models, but not on sensory input, we have the opportunity to map visual features conveyed by the brain's internal models. Our results show that activity related to internal models in early visual cortex are more related to scene-specific features than to categorical or depth features. We further demonstrate that behavioral line drawings provide a good description of internal model structure representing scene-specific features. These findings extend our understanding of internal models, showing that line drawings provide a window into our brains' internal models of vision.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We find that fMRI activity patterns corresponding to occluded visual information in early visual cortex fill in scene-specific features. Line drawings of the missing scene information correlate with our recorded activity patterns, and thus to internal models. Despite our extensive knowledge of the sensory features that drive cortical neurons, we have a limited grasp on the structure of our brains' internal models. These results therefore constitute an advance to the field of neuroscience by extending our knowledge about the models that our brains construct to efficiently represent and predict the world. Moreover, they link a behavioral measure to these internal models, which play an active role in many components of human behavior, including visual predictions, action planning, and decision making.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/47/9397?rss=1">Predictability and Uncertainty in the Pleasure of Music: A Reward for Learning?</a></h4>

<p>Music ranks among the greatest human pleasures. It consistently engages the reward system, and converging evidence implies it exploits predictions to do so. Both prediction confirmations and errors are essential for understanding one's environment, and music offers many of each as it manipulates interacting patterns across multiple timescales. Learning models suggest that a balance of these outcomes (i.e., intermediate complexity) optimizes the reduction of uncertainty to rewarding and pleasurable effect. Yet evidence of a similar pattern in music is mixed, hampered by arbitrary measures of complexity. In the present studies, we applied a well-validated information-theoretic model of auditory expectation to systematically measure two key aspects of musical complexity: predictability (operationalized as information content [IC]), and uncertainty (entropy). In Study 1, we evaluated how these properties affect musical preferences in 43 male and female participants; in Study 2, we replicated Study 1 in an independent sample of 27 people and assessed the contribution of veridical predictability by presenting the same stimuli seven times. Both studies revealed significant quadratic effects of IC and entropy on liking that outperformed linear effects, indicating reliable preferences for music of intermediate complexity. An interaction between IC and entropy further suggested preferences for more predictability during more uncertain contexts, which would facilitate uncertainty reduction. Repeating stimuli decreased liking ratings but did not disrupt the preference for intermediate complexity. Together, these findings support long-hypothesized optimal zones of predictability and uncertainty in musical pleasure with formal modeling, relating the pleasure of music listening to the intrinsic reward of learning.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Abstract pleasures, such as music, claim much of our time, energy, and money despite lacking any clear adaptive benefits like food or shelter. Yet as music manipulates patterns of melody, rhythm, and more, it proficiently exploits our expectations. Given the importance of anticipating and adapting to our ever-changing environments, making and evaluating uncertain predictions can have strong emotional effects. Accordingly, we present evidence that listeners consistently prefer music of intermediate predictive complexity, and that preferences shift toward expected musical outcomes in more uncertain contexts. These results are consistent with theories that emphasize the intrinsic reward of learning, both by updating inaccurate predictions and validating accurate ones, which is optimal in environments that present manageable predictive challenges (i.e., reducible uncertainty).</p>

<p>The addition of rewarding feedback to motor learning tasks has been shown to increase the retention of learning, spurring interest in its possible utility for rehabilitation. However, motor tasks using rewarding feedback have repeatedly been shown to lead to great interindividual variability in performance. Understanding the causes of such variability is vital for maximizing the potential benefits of reward-based motor learning. Thus, using a large human cohort of both sexes (<i>n</i> = 241), we examined whether spatial (SWM), verbal, and mental rotation (RWM) working memory capacity and dopamine-related genetic profiles were associated with performance in two reward-based motor tasks. The first task assessed the participant's ability to follow a slowly shifting reward region based on hit/miss (binary) feedback. The second task investigated the participant's capacity to preserve performance with binary feedback after adapting to the rotation with full visual feedback. Our results demonstrate that higher SWM is associated with greater success and an enhanced capacity to reproduce a successful motor action, measured as change in reach angle following reward. In contrast, higher RWM was predictive of an increased propensity to express an explicit strategy when required to make large reach angle adjustments. Therefore, SWM and RWM were reliable, but dissociable, predictors of success during reward-based motor learning. Change in reach direction following failure was also a strong predictor of success rate, although we observed no consistent relationship with working memory. Surprisingly, no dopamine-related genotypes predicted performance. Therefore, working memory capacity plays a pivotal role in determining individual ability in reward-based motor learning.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Reward-based motor learning tasks have repeatedly been shown to lead to idiosyncratic behaviors that cause varying degrees of task success. Yet, the factors determining an individual's capacity to use reward-based feedback are unclear. Here, we assessed a wide range of possible candidate predictors, and demonstrate that domain-specific working memory plays an essential role in determining individual capacity to use reward-based feedback. Surprisingly, genetic variations in dopamine availability were not found to play a role. This is in stark contrast with seminal work in the reinforcement and decision-making literature, which show strong and replicated effects of the same dopaminergic genes in decision-making. Therefore, our results provide novel insights into reward-based motor learning, highlighting a key role for domain-specific working memory capacity.</p>

<p>Conditioned taste aversion (CTA) is an associative learning paradigm, wherein consumption of an appetitive tastant (e.g., saccharin) is paired to the administration of a malaise-inducing agent, such as intraperitoneal injection of LiCl. Aversive taste learning and retrieval require neuronal activity within the anterior insula (aIC) and the basolateral amygdala (BLA). Here, we labeled neurons of the aIC projecting to the BLA in adult male mice using a retro-AAV construct and assessed their necessity in aversive and appetitive taste learning. By restricting the expression of chemogenetic receptors in aIC-to-BLA neurons, we demonstrate that activity within the aIC-to-BLA projection is necessary for both aversive taste memory acquisition and retrieval, but not for its maintenance, nor its extinction. Moreover, inhibition of the projection did not affect incidental taste learning per se, but effectively suppressed aversive taste memory retrieval when applied either during or before the encoding of the unconditioned stimulus for CTA (i.e., malaise). Remarkably, activation of the projection after novel taste consumption, without experiencing any internal discomfort, was sufficient to form an artificial aversive taste memory, resulting in strong aversive behavior upon retrieval. Our results indicate that aIC-to-BLA projecting neurons are an essential component in the ability of the brain to associate taste sensory stimuli with body states of negative valence and guide the expression of valence-specific behavior upon taste memory retrieval.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In the present study we subjected mice to the conditioned taste aversion paradigm, where animals learn to associate novel taste with malaise (i.e., assign it negative valence). We show that activation of neurons in the anterior insular cortex (aIC) that project into the basolateral amygdala (BLA) in response to conditioned taste aversion is necessary to form a memory for a taste of negative valence. Moreover, artificial activation of this pathway (without any feeling of pain) after the sampling of a taste can also lead to such associative memory. Thus, activation of aIC-to-BLA projecting neurons is necessary and sufficient to form and retrieve aversive taste memory.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/47/9360?rss=1">Effects of Locomotion on Visual Responses in the Mouse Superior Colliculus</a></h4>

<p>Visual responses are extensively shaped by internal factors. This effect is drastic in the primary visual cortex (V1), where locomotion profoundly increases visually-evoked responses. Here we investigate whether a similar effect exists in another major visual structure, the superior colliculus (SC). By performing two-photon calcium imaging of head-fixed male and female mice running on a treadmill, we find that only a minority of neurons in the most superficial lamina of the SC display significant changes during locomotion. This modulation includes both increase and decrease in response amplitude and is similar between excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The overall change in the SC is small, whereas V1 responses almost double during locomotion. Additionally, SC neurons display lower response variability and less spontaneous activity than V1 neurons. Together, these experiments indicate that locomotion-dependent modulation is not a widespread phenomenon in the early visual system and that the SC and V1 use different strategies to encode visual information.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Visual information captured by the retina is processed in parallel through two major pathways, one reaching the primary visual cortex through the thalamus, and the other projecting to the superior colliculus. The two pathways then merge in the higher areas of the visual cortex. Recent studies have shown that behavioral state such as locomotion is an essential component of vision and can strongly affect visual responses in the thalamocortical pathway. Here we demonstrate that neurons in the mouse superior colliculus and primary visual cortex display striking differences in their modulation by locomotion, as well as in response variability and spontaneous activity. Our results reveal an important "division of labor" in visual processing between these two evolutionarily distinct structures.</p>

<p>Subcortical white matter stroke is a common stroke subtype. White matter stroke stimulates adjacent oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) to divide and migrate to the lesion, but stroke OPCs have only a limited differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes. To understand the molecular systems that are active in OPC responses in white matter stroke, OPCs were virally labeled and laser-captured in the region of partial damage adjacent to the infarct in male mice. RNAseq indicates two distinct OPC transcriptomes associated with the proliferative and limited-regeneration phases of OPCs after stroke. Molecular pathways related to nuclear receptor activation, ECM turnover, and lipid biosynthesis are activated during proliferative OPC phases after stroke; inflammatory and growth factor signaling is activated in the later stage of limited OPC differentiation. Within ECM proteins, Matrilin-2 is induced early after stroke and then rapidly downregulated. Prediction of upstream regulators of the OPC stroke transcriptome identifies several candidate molecules, including Inhibin A-a negative regulator of Matrilin-2. Inhibin A is induced in reactive astrocytes after stroke, including in humans. In functional assays, Matrilin-2 induces OPC differentiation, and Inhibin A inhibits OPC Matrilin-2 expression and inhibits OPC differentiation. <i>In vivo</i>, Matrilin-2 promotes motor recovery after white matter stroke, and promotes OPC differentiation and ultrastructural evidence of remyelination. These studies show that white matter stroke induces an initial proliferative and reparative response in OPCs, but this is blocked by a local cellular niche where reactive astrocytes secrete Inhibin A, downregulating Matrilin-2 and blocking myelin repair and recovery.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Stroke in the cerebral white matter of the brain is common. The biology of damage and recovery in this stroke subtype are not well defined. These studies use cell-specific RNA sequencing and gain-of-function studies to show that white matter stroke induces a glial signaling niche, present in both humans and mice, between reactive astrocytes and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. Astrocyte secretion of Inhibin A and downregulation of oligodendrocyte precursor production of Matrilin-2 limit OPC differentiation, tissue repair, and recovery in this disease.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/47/9328?rss=1">Remapping in Cerebral and Cerebellar Cortices Is Not Restricted by Somatotopy</a></h4>

<p>A fundamental organizing principle in the somatosensory and motor systems is somatotopy, where specific body parts are represented separately and adjacently to other body parts, resulting in a body map. Different terminals of the sensorimotor network show varied somatotopic layouts, in which the relative position, distance, and overlap between body-part representations differ. Since somatotopy is best characterized in the primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortices, these terminals have been the main focus of research on somatotopic remapping following loss of sensory input (e.g., arm amputation). Cortical remapping is generally considered to be driven by the layout of the underlying somatotopy, such that neighboring body-part representations tend to activate the deprived brain region. Here, we challenge the assumption that somatotopic layout restricts remapping, by comparing patterns of remapping in humans born without one hand (hereafter, one-handers, <i>n</i> = 26) across multiple terminals of the sensorimotor pathway. We first report that, in the cerebellum of one-handers, the deprived hand region represents multiple body parts. Importantly, the native representations of some of these body parts do not neighbor the deprived hand region. We further replicate our previous findings, showing a similar pattern of remapping in the deprived hand region of the cerebral cortex in one-handers. Finally, we report preliminary results of a similar remapping pattern in the putamen of one-handers. Since these three sensorimotor terminals (cerebellum, cerebrum, putamen) contain different somatotopic layouts, the parallel remapping they undergo demonstrates that the mere spatial layout of body-part representations may not exclusively dictate remapping in the sensorimotor systems.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> When a hand is missing, the brain region that typically processes information from that hand may instead process information from other body parts, a phenomenon termed remapping. It is commonly thought that only body parts whose information is processed in regions neighboring the hand region could "take up" the resources of this now deprived region. Here we demonstrate that information from multiple body parts is processed in the hand regions of both the cerebral cortex and cerebellum. The native brain regions of these body parts have varying levels of overlap with the hand regions of the cerebral cortex and cerebellum, and do not necessarily neighbor the hand regions. We therefore propose that proximity between brain regions does not limit brain remapping.</p>

<p>Regenerating axons often have to grow considerable distances to reestablish circuits, making functional recovery a lengthy process. One solution to this problem would be to co-opt the "temporal" guidance mechanisms that control the rate of axon growth during development to accelerate the rate at which nerves regenerate in adults. We have previously found that the loss of Limk1, a negative regulator of cofilin, accelerates the rate of spinal commissural axon growth. Here, we use mouse models to show that spinal motor axon outgrowth is similarly promoted by the loss of Limk1, suggesting that temporal guidance mechanisms are widely used during development. Furthermore, we find that the regulation of cofilin activity is an acute response to nerve injury in the peripheral nervous system. Within hours of a sciatic nerve injury, the level of phosphorylated cofilin dramatically increases at the lesion site, in a Limk1-dependent manner. This response may be a major constraint on the rate of peripheral nerve regeneration. Proof-of-principle experiments show that elevating cofilin activity, through the loss of Limk1, results in faster sciatic nerve growth, and improved recovery of some sensory and motor function.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The studies shed light on an endogenous, shared mechanism that controls the rate at which developing and regenerating axons grow. An understanding of these mechanisms is key for developing therapies to reduce painful recovery times for nerve-injury patients, by accelerating the rate at which damaged nerves reconnect with their synaptic targets.</p>

<p>Mounting evidence suggests numerous glutamatergic synapse subtypes exist in the brain, and that these subtypes are likely defined by unique molecular regulatory mechanisms. Recent work has identified substantial divergence of molecular composition between commonly studied Schaffer collateral synapses and perforant path–dentate gyrus (DG) synapses of the hippocampus. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that may confer unique properties to perforant path–DG synapses. Here we investigate whether the RhoGEF (Rho guanine–nucleotide exchange factor) protein Tiam1 plays a unique role in the regulation of glutamatergic synapses in dentate granule neurons using a combination of molecular, electrophysiological, and imaging approaches in rat entorhino-hippocampal slices of both sexes. We find that inhibition of Tiam1 function in dentate granule neurons reduces synaptic AMPA receptor function and causes dendritic spines to adopt an elongated filopodia-like morphology. We also find that Tiam1's support of perforant path–DG synapse function is dependent on its GEF domain and identify a potential role for the auto-inhibitory PH domain of Tiam1 in regulating Tiam1 function at these synapses. In marked contrast, reduced Tiam1 expression in CA1 pyramidal neurons produced no effect on glutamatergic synapse development. Together, these data identify a critical role for Tiam1 in the hippocampus and reveal a unique Tiam1-mediated molecular program of glutamatergic synapse regulation in dentate granule neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Several lines of evidence independently point to the molecular diversity of glutamatergic synapses in the brain. Rho guanine–nucleotide exchange factor (RhoGEF) proteins as powerful modulators of glutamatergic synapse function have also become increasingly appreciated in recent years. Here we investigate the synaptic regulatory role of the RhoGEF protein Tiam1, whose expression appears to be remarkably enriched in granule neurons of the dentate gyrus. We find that Tiam1 plays a critical role in the development of glutamatergic perforant path–dentate gyrus synapses, but not in commonly studied in Schaffer collateral–CA1 synapses. Together, these data reveal a unique RhoGEF-mediated molecular program of glutamatergic synapse regulation in dentate granule neurons.</p>

<p>Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in <i>TSC1</i> or <i>TSC2</i>. Patients frequently have epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder, and/or intellectual disability, as well as other systemic manifestations. In this study, we differentiated human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from a female patient with TSC with one or two mutations in <i>TSC2</i> into neurons using induced expression of NGN2 to examine neuronal dysregulation associated with the neurological symptoms in TSC. Using this method, neuronal differentiation was comparable between the three genotypes of iPSCs. We observed that <i>TSC2</i><sup>+/–</sup> neurons show mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) hyperactivation and associated increased cell body size and process outgrowth, as well as exacerbation of the abnormalities by loss of the second allele of <i>TSC2</i> in <i>TSC2</i><sup>–/–</sup> neurons. Interestingly, iPSC-derived neurons with either a single or biallelic mutation in <i>TSC2</i> demonstrated hypersynchrony and downregulation of FMRP targets. However, only neurons with biallelic mutations of <i>TSC2</i> demonstrated hyperactivity and transcriptional dysregulation observed in cortical tubers. These data demonstrate that loss of one allele of <i>TSC2</i> is sufficient to cause some morphological and physiological changes in human neurons but that biallelic mutations in <i>TSC2</i> are necessary to induce gene expression dysregulation present in cortical tubers. Finally, we found that treatment of iPSC-derived neurons with rapamycin reduced neuronal activity and partially reversed gene expression abnormalities, demonstrating that mTOR dysregulation contributes to both phenotypes. Therefore, biallelic mutations in <i>TSC2</i> and associated molecular dysfunction, including mTOR hyperactivation, may play a role in the development of cortical tubers.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In this study, we examined neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells with two, one, or no functional <i>TSC2</i> (tuberous sclerosis complex 2) alleles and found that loss of one or both alleles of <i>TSC2</i> results in mTORC1 hyperactivation and specific neuronal abnormalities. However, only biallelic mutations in <i>TSC2</i> resulted in elevated neuronal activity and upregulation of cell adhesion genes that is also observed in cortical tubers. These data suggest that loss of heterozygosity of <i>TSC1</i> or <i>TSC2</i> may play an important role in the development of cortical tubers, and potentially epilepsy, in patients with TSC.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/47/9277?rss=1">Heterosynaptic GABAB Receptor Function within Feedforward Microcircuits Gates Glutamatergic Transmission in the Nucleus Accumbens Core</a></h4>

<p>Complex circuit interactions within the nucleus accumbens (NAc) facilitate goal-directed behavior. Medium spiny neurons (MSNs) mediate NAc output by projecting to functionally divergent brain regions, a property conferred, in part, by the differential projection patterns of D1- and D2 dopamine receptor-expressing MSNs. Glutamatergic afferents to the NAc direct MSN output by recruiting feedforward inhibitory microcircuits comprised of parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons (INs). Furthermore, the GABA<sub>B</sub> heteroreceptor (GABA<sub>B</sub>R), a G<sub>i/o</sub>-coupled G-protein-coupled receptor, is expressed at glutamatergic synapses throughout the mesolimbic network, yet its physiological context and synaptic mechanism within the NAc remains unknown. Here, we explored GABA<sub>B</sub>R function at glutamatergic synapses within PV-IN-embedded microcircuits in the NAc core of male mice. We found that GABA<sub>B</sub>R is expressed presynaptically and recruits a noncanonical signaling mechanism to reduce glutamatergic synaptic efficacy at D1(+) and D1(–) (putative D2) MSN subtypes. Furthermore, PV-INs, a robust source of neuronal GABA in the NAc, heterosynaptically target GABA<sub>B</sub>R to selectively modulate glutamatergic transmission onto D1(+) MSNs. These findings elucidate a new mechanism of feedforward inhibition and refine mechanisms by which GABA<sub>B</sub> heteroreceptors modulate mesolimbic circuit function.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Glutamatergic transmission in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) critically contributes to goal-directed behaviors. However, intrinsic microcircuit mechanisms governing the integration of these synapses remain largely unknown. Here, we show that parvalbumin-expressing interneurons within feedforward microcircuits heterosynaptically target GABA<sub>B</sub> heteroreceptors (GABA<sub>B</sub>R) on glutamate terminals. Activation of presynaptically-expressed GABA<sub>B</sub>R decreases glutamatergic synaptic strength by engaging a non-canonical signaling pathway that interferes with vesicular exocytotic release machinery. These findings offer mechanistic insight into the role of GABA<sub>B</sub> heteroreceptors within reward circuitry, elucidate a novel arm to feedforward inhibitory networks, and inform the growing use of GABA<sub>B</sub>R-selective pharmacotherapy for various motivational disorders, including addiction, major depressive disorder, and autism (Cousins et al., 2002; Kahn et al., 2009; Jacobson et al., 2018; Stoppel et al., 2018; Pisansky et al., 2019).</p>

<p>Extracellular vesicles (EVs) include exosomes and microvesicles and have been shown to have roles in the CNS ranging from the removal of unwanted biomolecules to intercellular communication to the spread of pathogenic proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases. EVs carry protein, lipid, and genetic cargo, and research over more than a decade has shown that they contain the misfolded forms of proteins associated with Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and the prion diseases. Altered genetic cargo, usually in the form of miRNAs, have also been identified in EVs patients with these diseases, suggesting that EVs may be a source of disease biomarkers. Whether EVs play a key role in the pathogenesis of neurological diseases remains to be firmly established because most current research is performed using cell culture and transgenic animal models. If EVs are identified as a key pathological contributor to neurological conditions, they will form a novel target for therapeutic intervention. This Dual Perspectives article will discuss the current understanding of the role of EVs in neurological diseases and raise some of the limitations of our current understandings of this field.</p>

<p>Intercellular communication has recently been shown to occur via transfer of cargo loaded within extracellular vesicles (EVs). Present within all biofluids of the body, EVs can contain various signaling factors, including coding and noncoding RNAs (e.g., mRNA, miRNA, lncRNA, snRNA, tRNA, yRNA), DNA, proteins, and enzymes. Multiple types of cells appear to be capable of releasing EVs, including cancer, stem, epithelial, immune, glial, and neuronal cells. However, the functional impact of these circulating signals among neural networks within the brain has been difficult to establish given the complexity of cellular populations involved in release and uptake, as well as inherent limitations of examining a biofluid. In this brief commentary, we provide an analysis of the conceptual and technical considerations that limit our current understanding of signaling mediated by circulating EVs relative to their impact on neural function.</p>

<p>Food consumption is necessary for organisms to maintain metabolic homeostasis. Both extrinsic and intrinsic processes, relayed via intricate neural circuitry, orchestrate the initiation and termination of food intake. More specifically, there are functionally distinct neural circuits that mediate either homeostatic or hedonic suppression of feeding. Notably, being satiated is a positive feeling whereas food aversion is a negative feeling. While significant progress has been made toward elucidating neural circuitry underlying aversive appetite suppression in mice, the circuitry underlying homeostatic satiety is not fully understood. The lateral parabrachial nucleus (PB<sub>L</sub>) is known as a node that regulates various sensory and visceral processes. Here, we identified and selectively labeled neurons in the caudal lateral region of PB<sub>L</sub> (PB<sub>cl</sub>) that are activated by consumption of condensed milk, chocolate Ensure, or peanut butter, which we refer to as PB<sub>cl</sub>-palatable-food activated neurons (PANs). Specific optogenetic activation of PANs induced positive place preference but decreased the consumption of high-caloric foods such as condensed milk, whereas silencing these cells significantly increased condensed milk consumption in feeding assays. Thus, the PB<sub>cl</sub> PANs revealed here represent a novel neural substrate regulating caloric-sufficiency mediated satiation.</p>

<p>A fundamental strategy in sensory coding is parallel processing, whereby unique, distinct features of sensation are computed and projected to the central target in the form of submodal maps. It remains unclear, however, whether such parallel processing strategy is employed in the main olfactory system, which codes the complex hierarchical odor and behavioral scenes. A potential scheme is that distinct subsets of projection neurons in the olfactory bulb (OB) form parallel projections to the targets. Taking advantage of the observation that the distinct projection neurons develop at different times, we developed a Cre-loxP-based method that allows for birthdate-specific labeling of cell bodies and their axon projections in mice. This birthdate tag analysis revealed that the mitral cells (MCs) born in an early developmental stage and the external tufted cells (TCs) born a few days later form segregated parallel projections. Specifically, the latter subset converges the axons onto only two small specific targets, one of which, located at the anterolateral edge of the olfactory tubercle (OT), excludes widespread MC projections. This target is made up of neurons that express dopamine D1 but not D2 receptor and corresponds to the most anterolateral isolation of the CAP compartments (aiCAP) that were defined previously. This finding of segregated projections suggests that olfactory sensing does indeed involve parallel processing of functionally distinct submodalities. Importantly, the birthdate tag method used here may pave the way for deciphering the functional meaning of these individual projection pathways in the future.</p>

Abstract<p>Millions of people suffer mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBIs) every year, and there is growing evidence that repeated injuries can result in long-term pathology. The acute symptoms of these injuries may or may not include the loss of consciousness but do include disorientation, confusion, and/or the inability to concentrate. Most of these acute symptoms spontaneously resolve within a few hours or days. However, the underlying physiological and cellular mechanisms remain unclear. Spreading depolarizations (SDs) are known to occur in rodents and humans following moderate and severe TBIs, and SDs have long been hypothesized to occur in more mild injuries. Using a closed skull impact model, we investigated the presence of SDs immediately following a mTBI. Animals remained motionless for multiple minutes following an impact and once recovered had fewer episodes of movement. We recorded the defining electrophysiological properties of SDs, including the large extracellular field potential shifts and suppression of high frequency cortical activity. Impact-induced SDs were also associated with a propagating wave of reduced cerebral blood flow. In the wake of the SD, there was a prolonged period of reduced CBF that recovered in approximately 90 minutes. Similar to SDs in more severe injuries, the impact-induced SDs could be blocked with ketamine. Interestingly, impacts at a slower velocity did not produce the prolonged immobility and did not initiate SDs. Our data suggest that SDs play a significant role in mTBIs and SDs may contribute to the acute symptoms of mTBIs.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Millions of people suffer from concussions every year and repeated concussions are associated with Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE). Spreading Depolarizations (SDs) are propagating waves of brain tissue depolarization that have been associated with strokes, subarachnoid hemorrhages, and moderate to severe brain injuries. SDs have long been hypothesized to occur in mild brain injuries, but have not been recorded. Our studies are the first to directly record the electrophysiological properties of SDs following a closed skull impact, and suggest that SDs may contribute to the acute symptoms of mTBIs.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Generalized convulsive status epilepticus is associated with high mortality. We tested whether α‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor plasticity plays a role in sustaining seizures, seizure generalization, and mortality observed during focal onset status epilepticus. We also determined whether modified AMPA receptors generated during status epilepticus could be targeted with a drug.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Electrically induced status epilepticus was characterized by electroencephalogram and behavior in GluA1 knockout mice and in transgenic mice with selective knockdown of the GluA1 subunit in hippocampal principal neurons. Excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in CA1 neurons was studied using patch clamp electrophysiology. The dose response of <i>N,N,H</i>,‐trimethyl‐5‐([tricyclo(3.3.1.13,7)dec‐1‐ylmethyl]amino)‐1‐pentanaminiumbromide hydrobromide (IEM‐1460), a calcium‐permeable AMPA receptor antagonist, was determined.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Global removal of the GluA1 subunit did not affect seizure susceptibility; however, it reduced susceptibility to status epilepticus. GluA1 subunit knockout also reduced mortality, severity, and duration of status epilepticus. Absence of the GluA1 subunit prevented enhancement of glutamatergic synaptic transmission associated with status epilepticus; however, γ‐aminobutyric acidergic synaptic inhibition was compromised. Selective removal of the GluA1 subunit from hippocampal principal neurons also reduced mortality, severity, and duration of status epilepticus. IEM‐1460 rapidly terminated status epilepticus in a dose‐dependent manner.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>AMPA receptor plasticity mediated by the GluA1 subunit plays a critical role in sustaining and amplifying seizure activity and contributes to mortality. Calcium‐permeable AMPA receptors modified during status epilepticus can be inhibited to terminate status epilepticus. ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

<p>Statistical modeling techniques, such as projection pursuit regression (PPR)
and convolutional neural network (CNN) approaches, provide state-of-the-art
performance in characterizing visual cortical neurons' receptive fields and
predicting their responses to arbitrary input stimuli. However, the latent
feature components recovered by these methods, particularly that of CNN, are
often noisy and lack coherent structures, making it difficult to understand the
underlying feature components that are used to construct the receptive field
feature tunings of the neurons. In this paper, we showed that using a
dictionary of complex sparse codes, learned from natural scenes based on
efficient coding theory, as the front-end for these methods can improve their
performance in neural response prediction. At the same time, this approach
makes the component features of the models more transparent and interpretable.
We consider using these learned dictionaries as the front-end that can
effectively imposing priors on the constituent components. We found that models
with complex sparse code prior are significantly better than models with
classical Gabor and/or Laplacian of Gaussian filter priors for modeling and
predicting the activities of neurons that have been earlier identified to
exhibit higher-order (HO) complex pattern selectivity but not better for
modeling neurons that preferred orientation bars or grating (OT). This
observation affirms the recent discovery of complex feature selectivity of V1
neurons and also supports the predictions of efficient coding theory under
over-complete conditions.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07986">Comparison Against Task Driven Artificial Neural Networks Reveals Functional Organization of Mouse Visual Cortex. (arXiv:1911.07986v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>Partially inspired by features of computation in visual cortex, deep neural
networks compute hierarchical representations of their inputs. While these
networks have been highly successful in machine learning, it remains unclear to
what extent they can aid our understanding of cortical function. Several groups
have developed metrics that provide a quantitative comparison between
representations computed by networks and representations measured in cortex. At
the same time, neuroscience is well into an unprecedented phase of large-scale
data collection, as evidenced by projects such as the Allen Brain Observatory.
Despite the magnitude of these efforts, in a given experiment only a fraction
of units are recorded, limiting the information available about the cortical
representation. Moreover, only a finite number of stimuli can be shown to an
animal over the course of a realistic experiment. These limitations raise the
question of how and whether metrics that compare representations of deep
networks are meaningful on these datasets. Here, we empirically quantify the
capabilities and limitations of these metrics due to limited image
presentations and neuron samples. We find that the comparison procedure is
robust to different choices of stimuli set and the level of subsampling that
one might expect in a large-scale brain survey with thousands of neurons. Using
these results, we compare the representations measured in the Allen Brain
Observatory in response to natural image presentations to deep neural network.
We show that the visual cortical areas are relatively high order
representations (in that they map to deeper layers of convolutional neural
networks). Furthermore, we see evidence of a broad, more parallel organization
rather than a sequential hierarchy, with the primary area VISp(V1) being lower
order relative to the other areas.

<p>An individual's reaction time data to visual stimuli have usually been
represented in Experimental Psychology by means of an ex-Gaussian function
(EGF). In most previous works, researchers have mainly aimed at finding a
meaning for the parameters of the EGF function in relation to psychological
phenomena. We will focus on interpreting the reaction times (RTs) of a group of
individuals rather than a single person's RT, which is relevant for the
different contexts of social sciences. In doing so, the same model as for the
Ideal Gases (IG) (an inanimate system of non-interacting particles) emerges
from the experimental RT data. Both systems are characterised by a collective
parameter which is k_BT in the case of the system of particles and what we have
called life span parameter for the system of brains. Similarly, we came across
a Maxwell-Boltzmann-type distribution for the system of brains which provides a
natural and more complete characterisation of the collective time response than
has ever been provided before. Thus, we are able to know about the behaviour of
a single individual in relation to the coetaneous group to which they belong
and through the application of a physical law. This leads to a new
entropy-based methodology for the classification of the individuals forming the
system which emerges from the physical law governing the system of brains. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in the literature reporting
on the emergence of a physical theory (IG) from human RT experimental data.

<p>The connection strength of most chemical synapses changes dynamically during normal use as a function of the recent history of activity. The phenomenon is known as short-term synaptic plasticity or synaptic dynamics, and is thought to be involved in processing and filtering information as it is transmitted across the synaptic cleft. Multiple presynaptic mechanisms have been implicated, but large gaps remain in our understanding of how the mechanisms are modulated and how they interact. One important factor is the timing of recruitment of synaptic vesicles to a readily-releasable pool. A number of studies have concluded that activity and/or residual Ca<sup>2+</sup> can accelerate the mechanism, but alternative explanations for some of the evidence have emerged. Here I review the methodology that we have developed for isolating the recruitment and the dependence on activity from other kinds of mechanisms that are activated concurrently.</p>

Background<p>Optic radiation (OR) tractography may help predict and reduce post-neurosurgical visual field deficits. OR tractography methods currently lack pediatric and surgical focus.</p>Purpose<p>We propose a clinically feasible OR tractography strategy in a pediatric neurosurgery setting and examine its intra-rater and inter-rater reliability/agreements.</p>Methods<p>Preoperative and intraoperative MRI data were obtained from six epilepsy and two brain tumor patients on 3 Tesla MRI scanners. Four raters with different clinical experience followed the proposed strategy to perform probabilistic OR tractography with manually drawing anatomical landmarks to reconstruct the OR pathway, based on fiber orientation distributions estimated from high angular resolution diffusion imaging data. Intra- and inter-rater reliabilities/agreements of tractography results were assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and dice similarity coefficient (DSC) across various tractography and OR morphological metrics, including the lateral geniculate body positions, tract volumes, and Meyer’s loop position from temporal anatomical landmarks.</p>Results<p>Good to excellent intra- and inter-rater reproducibility was demonstrated for the majority of OR reconstructions (ICC = 0.70–0.99; DSC = 0.84–0.89). ICC was higher for non-lesional (0.82–0.99) than lesional OR (0.70–0.99). The non-lesional OR’s mean volume was 22.66 cm<sup>3</sup>; the mean Meyer’s loop position was 29.4 mm from the temporal pole, 5.89 mm behind of and 10.26 mm in front of the temporal ventricular horn. The greatest variations (± 1.00–3.00 mm) were observed near pathology, at the tract edges or at cortical endpoints. The OR tractography were used to assist surgical planning and guide lesion resection in all cases, no patient had new visual field deficits postoperatively.</p>Conclusion<p>The proposed tractography strategy generates reliable and reproducible OR tractography images that can be reliably implemented in the routine, non-emergency pediatric neurosurgical setting.</p>

<p>Microglia, the immune cells of the brain, play a major role in the maintenance of brain homeostasis and constantly screen the brain environment to detect any infection or damage. Once activated by a stimulus, microglial cells initiate an immune response followed by the resolution of brain inflammation. A failure or deviation in the housekeeping function of these guardian cells can lead to multiple diseases, including brain cancer and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). A small number of studies have investigated the causal relation of both diseases, thereby revealing an inverse relationship where cancer patients have a reduced risk to develop AD and vice versa. In this review, we aim to shed light on the role of microglia in the fate to develop specifically glioma as one type of cancer or AD. We will examine the common and/or opposing genetic predisposition as well as associated pathways of these diseases to unravel a possible involvement of microglia in the occurrence of either disease. Lastly, a set of guidelines will be proposed for future research and diagnostics to clarify and improve the knowledge on the role of microglia in the decision toward one pathology or another.</p>

<p>Commissural interneurons (CINs) mediate interactions between rhythm-generating locomotor circuits located on each side of the spinal cord and are necessary for left-right limb coordination during locomotion. While glutamatergic V3 CINs have been implicated in left-right coordination, their functional connectivity remains elusive. Here, we addressed this issue by combining experimental and modeling approaches. We employed Sim1<sup>Cre/+</sup>; Ai32 mice, in which light-activated Channelrhodopsin-2 was selectively expressed in V3 interneurons. Fictive locomotor activity was evoked by NMDA and 5-HT in the isolated neonatal lumbar spinal cord. Flexor and extensor activities were recorded from left and right L2 and L5 ventral roots, respectively. Bilateral photoactivation of V3 interneurons increased the duration of extensor bursts resulting in a slowed down on-going rhythm. At high light intensities, extensor activity could become sustained. When light stimulation was shifted toward one side of the cord, the duration of extensor bursts still increased on both sides, but these changes were more pronounced on the contralateral side than on the ipsilateral side. Additional bursts appeared on the ipsilateral side not seen on the contralateral side. Further increase of the stimulation could suppress the contralateral oscillations by switching to a sustained extensor activity, while the ipsilateral rhythmic activity remained. To delineate the function of V3 interneurons and their connectivity, we developed a computational model of the spinal circuits consisting of two (left and right) rhythm generators (RGs) interacting via V0<sub>V</sub>, V0<sub>D</sub>, and V3 CINs. Both types of V0 CINs provided mutual inhibition between the left and right flexor RG centers and promoted left-right alternation. V3 CINs mediated mutual excitation between the left and right extensor RG centers. These interactions allowed the model to reproduce our current experimental data, while being consistent with previous data concerning the role of V0<sub>V</sub> and V0<sub>D</sub> CINs in securing left–right alternation and the changes in left–right coordination following their selective removal. We suggest that V3 CINs provide mutual excitation between the spinal neurons involved in the control of left and right extensor activity, which may promote left-right synchronization during locomotion.</p>

<p>Tau is a microtubule-associated protein, localizing mainly in the axon of mature neurons. Phenotypic analysis of Tau knockout mice has revealed an impairment of synaptic plasticity but without gross changes in brain morphology. Since we previously described the presence of tau mRNA in the somatodendritic compartment, including the postsynapse, and demonstrated that it could be locally translated in response to glutamate, it appears that the regulated translation of synaptic tau can have a direct impact on synaptic function. Using SH-SY5Y cells, we herein confirm that glutamate dose-dependently regulates the translation of tau protein without altering tau mRNA levels. This is supported by the finding that cycloheximide blocks glutamate-stimulated increases in tau protein levels. Our observation that neural excitation can directly upregulate tau mRNA translation helps explain the pathological accumulation of tau in the somatodendrite.</p>

<p>Neurons are highly specialized post-mitotic cells that are inherently dependent on mitochondria owing to their high bioenergetic demand. Mitochondrial dysfunction is therefore associated with various age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), wherein accumulation of damaged and dysfunctional mitochondria has been reported as an early symptom further contributing to disease progression. In AD, impairment of mitochondrial function causes bioenergetic deficiency, intracellular calcium imbalance and oxidative stress, thereby aggravating the effect of Aβ and tau pathologies, leading to synaptic dysfunction, cognitive impairment and memory loss. Although there are reports suggesting intricate parallelism between mitochondrial dysfunction and AD pathologies such as Aβ aggregation and hyperphosphorylated tau accumulation, the factors that drive the pathogenesis of either are unclear. In addition, emerging evidence suggest that mitochondrial quality control (QC) mechanisms such as mitophagy are impaired in AD. As an important mitochondrial QC mechanism, mitophagy plays a critical role in maintaining neuronal health and function. Studies show that various proteins involved in mitophagy, mitochondrial dynamics, and mitochondrial biogenesis are affected in AD. Compromised mitophagy may also be attributed to impairment in autophagosome–lysosome fusion and defects in lysosomal acidification. Therapeutic interventions aiming to restore mitophagy functions can be used as a strategy for ameliorating AD pathogenesis. Recent evidence implicates the role of microglial activation via mitophagy induction in reducing amyloid plaque load. This review summarizes the current developments in the field of mitophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction in AD.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50496">Myofibril diameter is set by a finely tuned mechanism of protein oligomerization in <i>Drosophila</i></a></h4>

Myofibrils are huge cytoskeletal assemblies embedded in the cytosol of muscle cells. They consist of arrays of sarcomeres, the smallest contractile unit of muscles. Within a muscle type, myofibril diameter is highly invariant and contributes to its physiological properties, yet little is known about the underlying mechanisms setting myofibril diameter. Here we show that the PDZ and LIM domain protein Zasp, a structural component of Z-discs, mediates Z-disc and thereby myofibril growth through protein oligomerization. Oligomerization is induced by an interaction of its ZM domain with LIM domains. Oligomerization is terminated upon upregulation of shorter Zasp isoforms which lack LIM domains at later developmental stages. The balance between these two isoforms, which we call growing and blocking isoforms sets the stereotyped diameter of myofibrils. If blocking isoforms dominate, myofibrils become smaller. If growing isoforms dominate, myofibrils and Z-discs enlarge, eventually resulting in large pathological aggregates that disrupt muscle function.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50354">Single cell transcriptome atlas of the <i>Drosophila</i> larval brain</a></h4>

Cell diversity of the brain and how it is affected by starvation, remains largely unknown. Here we introduce a single cell transcriptome atlas of the entire <i>Drosophila </i>first instar larval brain. We first assigned cell-type identity based on known marker genes, distinguishing five major groups: neural progenitors, differentiated neurons, glia, undifferentiated neurons and non-neural cells. All major classes were further subdivided into multiple subtypes, revealing biological features of various cell-types. We further assessed transcriptional changes in response to starvation at the single-cell level. While after starvation the composition of the brain remains unaffected, transcriptional profile of several cell clusters changed. Intriguingly, different cell-types show very distinct responses to starvation, suggesting the presence of cell-specific programs for nutrition availability. Establishing a single-cell transcriptome atlas of the larval brain provides a powerful tool to explore cell diversity and assess genetic profiles from developmental, functional and behavioral perspectives.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/49921">Combinatorial chromatin dynamics foster accurate cardiopharyngeal fate choices</a></h4>

During embryogenesis, chromatin accessibility profiles control lineage-specific gene expression by modulating transcription, thus impacting multipotent progenitor states and subsequent fate choices. Subsets of cardiac and pharyngeal/head muscles share a common origin in the cardiopharyngeal mesoderm, but the chromatin landscapes that govern multipotent progenitors competence and early fate choices remain largely elusive. Here, we leveraged the simplicity of the chordate model <i>Ciona</i> to profile chromatin accessibility through stereotyped transitions from naive <i>Mesp</i>+ mesoderm to distinct fate-restricted heart and pharyngeal muscle precursors. An FGF-Foxf pathway acts in multipotent progenitors to establish cardiopharyngeal-specific patterns of accessibility, which govern later heart vs. pharyngeal muscle-specific expression profiles, demonstrating extensive spatiotemporal decoupling between early cardiopharyngeal enhancer accessibility and late cell-type-specific activity. We found that multiple <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements, with distinct chromatin accessibility profiles and motif compositions, are required to activate <i>Ebf</i> and <i>Tbx1/10</i>, two key determinants of cardiopharyngeal fate choices. We propose that these 'combined enhancers' foster spatially and temporally accurate fate choices, by increasing the repertoire of regulatory inputs that control gene expression, through either accessibility and/or activity.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/49578">Seasonal plasticity in GABA<sub>A</sub> signaling is necessary for restoring phase synchrony in the master circadian clock network</a></h4>

Annual changes in the environment threaten survival, and numerous biological processes in mammals adjust to this challenge via seasonal encoding by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). To tune behavior according to day length, SCN neurons display unified rhythms with synchronous phasing when days are short, but will divide into two sub-clusters when days are long. The transition between SCN states is critical for maintaining behavioral responses to seasonal change, but the mechanisms regulating this form of neuroplasticity remain unclear. Here we identify that a switch in chloride transport and GABA<sub>A</sub> signaling is critical for maintaining state plasticity in the SCN network. Further, we reveal that blocking excitatory GABA<sub>A</sub> signaling locks the SCN into its long day state. Collectively, these data demonstrate that plasticity in GABA<sub>A</sub> signaling dictates how clock neurons interact to maintain environmental encoding. Further, this work highlights factors that may influence susceptibility to seasonal disorders in humans.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/48718">Receptor-specific interactome as a hub for rapid cue-induced selective translation in axons</a></h4>

Extrinsic cues trigger the local translation of specific mRNAs in growing axons via cell surface receptors. The coupling of ribosomes to receptors has been proposed as a mechanism linking signals to local translation but it is not known how broadly this mechanism operates, nor whether it can selectively regulate mRNA translation. We report that receptor-ribosome coupling is employed by multiple guidance cue receptors and this interaction is mRNA-dependent. We find that different receptors associate with distinct sets of mRNAs and RNA-binding proteins. Cue stimulation of growing <i>Xenopus</i> retinal ganglion cell axons induces rapid dissociation of ribosomes from receptors and the selective translation of receptor-specific mRNAs. Further, we show that receptor-ribosome dissociation and cue-induced selective translation are inhibited by co-exposure to translation-repressive cues, suggesting a novel mode of signal integration. Our findings reveal receptor-specific interactomes and suggest a generalizable model for cue-selective control of the local proteome.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/48476">Systematic genetic analysis of the MHC region reveals mechanistic underpinnings of HLA type associations with disease</a></h4>

The MHC region is highly associated with autoimmune and infectious diseases. Here we conduct an in-depth interrogation of associations between genetic variation, gene expression and disease. We create a comprehensive map of regulatory variation in the MHC region using WGS from 419 individuals to call eight-digit HLA types and RNA-seq data from matched iPSCs. Building on this regulatory map, we explored GWAS signals for 4,083 traits, detecting colocalization for 180 disease loci with eQTLs. We show that eQTL analyses taking HLA type haplotypes into account have substantially greater power compared with only using single variants. We examined the association between the 8.1 ancestral haplotype and delayed colonization in Cystic Fibrosis, postulating that downregulation of <i>RNF5</i> expression is the likely causal mechanism. Our study provides insights into the genetic architecture of the MHC region and pinpoints disease associations that are due to differential expression of HLA genes and non-HLA genes.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/48373">Ultrastructural heterogeneity of layer 4 excitatory synaptic boutons in the adult human temporal lobe neocortex</a></h4>

Synapses are fundamental building blocks controlling and modulating the 'behavior' of brain networks. How their structural composition, most notably their quantitative morphology underlie their computational properties remains rather unclear, particularly in humans. Here, excitatory synaptic boutons (SBs) in layer 4 (L4) of the temporal lobe neocortex (TLN) were quantitatively investigated. Biopsies from epilepsy surgery were used for fine-scale and tomographic electron microscopy (EM) to generate 3D-reconstructions of SBs. Particularly, the size of active zones (AZs) and that of the three functionally defined pools of synaptic vesicles (SVs) were quantified. SBs were comparatively small (~2.50 μm<sup>2</sup>), with a single AZ (~0.13 µm<sup>2</sup>); preferentially established on spines. SBs had a total pool of ~1800 SVs with strikingly large readily releasable (~ 20), recycling (~ 80) and resting pools (~850). Thus, human L4 SBs may act as 'amplifiers' of signals from the sensory periphery, integrate, synchronize and modulate intra- and extracortical synaptic activity.

Seemingly, a paradox exists between reports of wide-scale task-dependent cortical activity and the causal requirement for only a restricted number of motor and sensory cortical areas in some behavioral studies. In this issue of Neuron, Pinto et al. (2019) indicate that scenarios where mice must accumulate evidence and hold it during a delay period are causally linked to wide regions of cortex.

How does diversity in the organization of secretory machines determine properties of neurotransmitter release? In this issue of Neuron, Rebola et al. (2019) found that distinct nanoscale assemblies of Ca2+ channels and Munc13, not overall channel abundance, mediate differing release characteristics of two cerebellar synapses.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To examine whether prior suicidal behavior and familial predisposition to psychiatric disorders modify the association between antiepileptic drug use and completed suicide.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Using the Danish National Prescription Register, we identified all incident users of antiepileptic drugs aged 15 years or older in Denmark between July 1997 and December 2015. We carried out a nested case–control study and defined exposure to antiepileptic drugs at the index date (ie, time of suicide). Conditional logistic regressions were used to estimate mortality rate ratios (MRRs) of suicide in current versus previous users of antiepileptic drugs. We also analyzed suicide risk associated with the 9 most commonly used antiepileptic drugs.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 1,759 individuals completing suicide. Current versus previous use of any antiepileptic drug was associated with an increased risk of suicide (MRR = 1.26, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.13–1.40). This excess risk was observed in individuals with a history of suicidal behavior (MRR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.07–1.54) and in those without (MRR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.11–1.43), and in individuals with a familial predisposition to psychiatric disorders (MRR = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.18–1.87) and in those without (MRR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.07–1.35).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Use of antiepileptic drugs was associated with an increased risk of suicide. The findings do not support that the risk of suicide following treatment with antiepileptic drugs identified in randomized trials is explained by prior suicidality or familial predisposition to psychiatric disorders. The additional risk of suicide associated with use of antiepileptic drugs was generally low and should be balanced against benefits of treatment. ANN NEUROL 2019;86:951–961</p>

<p>Accurate antemortem diagnosis of parkinsonism is primarily based on clinical evaluation with limited biomarkers. We evaluated the diagnostic utility of quantitative rapid eye movement (REM) sleep without atonia analysis in the submentalis and anterior tibialis muscles in parkinsonian patients (53 synucleinopathy, 24 tauopathy). Receiver operating characteristic curves determined REM sleep without atonia cutoffs distinguishing synucleinopathies from tauopathies. Elevated submentalis muscle activity was highly sensitive (70–77%) and specific (95–100%) in distinguishing synucleinopathy from tauopathy. In contrast, anterior tibialis synucleinopathy discrimination was poor. Our results suggest that elevated submentalis REM sleep without atonia appears to be a potentially useful biomarker for presumed synucleinopathy etiologies in parkinsonism.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To test the hypothesis that Alzheimer's disease and related neuropathologies contribute to the association between hospitalization and cognitive decline in old age.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>As part of a longitudinal clinical–pathologic cohort study, 526 older persons (mean age at death = 90.9 years, 71% female) without dementia at baseline completed annual cognitive testing and were autopsied at death. Hospitalization information was obtained from linked Medicare claims records. Neuropathologic examination assessed β‐amyloid burden, tau tangle density, neocortical Lewy bodies, hippocampal sclerosis, chronic gross and microscopic cerebral infarcts, and transactive response DNA binding protein 43 kDa.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Over a mean of 5.1 years, a total of 1,383 hospitalizations occurred, and the mean annual rate of hospitalization was 0.5 (standard deviation = 0.6, median = 0.4). Higher rate of hospitalization was not directly related to higher burden for any of the neuropathologic markers. Higher rate of hospitalization was associated with more rapid cognitive decline (estimate = −0.042, standard error [SE] = 0.012, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and after controlling for all 7 neuropathologic markers, the association was essentially the same (estimate = −0.040, SE = 0.013, <i>p</i> = 0.002). In a multivariable model with 3‐way interactions of neuropathologic markers with hospitalization rate and time, the association between hospitalization rate and faster cognitive decline was greater in persons with more tangle pathology (estimate for interaction = −0.007, SE = 0.002, <i>p</i> = 0.002) and in persons with neocortical Lewy bodies (estimate for interaction = −0.117, SE = 0.042, <i>p</i> = 0.005).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Older persons with more hospitalizations experienced faster rates of cognitive decline, and this association was more pronounced in persons with more tau tangle density and with neocortical Lewy body pathologies. ANN NEUROL 2019;86:844–852</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The Popeye domain containing 3 (<i>POPDC3)</i> gene encodes a membrane protein involved in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling. Besides gastric cancer, no disease association has been described. We describe a new muscular dystrophy associated with this gene.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We screened 1,500 patients with unclassified limb girdle weakness or hyperCKemia for pathogenic <i>POPDC3</i> variants. Five patients carrying <i>POPDC3</i> variants were examined by muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), muscle biopsy, and cardiac examination. We performed functional analyses in a zebrafish <i>popdc3</i> knockdown model and heterologous expression of the mutant proteins in <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes to measure TREK‐1 current.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified homozygous <i>POPDC3</i> missense variants (p.Leu155His, p.Leu217Phe, and p.Arg261Gln) in 5 patients from 3 ethnically distinct families. Variants affected highly conserved residues in the Popeye (p.Leu155 and p.Leu217) and carboxy‐terminal (p.Arg261) domains. The variants were almost absent from control populations. Probands’ muscle biopsies were dystrophic, and serum creatine kinase levels were 1,050 to 9,200U/l. Muscle weakness was proximal with adulthood onset in most patients and affected lower earlier than upper limbs. Muscle MRI revealed fat replacement of paraspinal and proximal leg muscles; cardiac investigations were unremarkable. Knockdown of <i>popdc3</i> in zebrafish, using 2 different splice‐site blocking morpholinos, resulted in larvae with tail curling and dystrophic muscle features. All 3 mutants cloned in <i>Xenopus</i> oocytes caused an aberrant modulation of the mechano‐gated potassium channel, TREK‐1.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings point to an important role of POPDC3 for skeletal muscle function and suggest that pathogenic variants in <i>POPDC3</i> are responsible for a novel type of autosomal recessive limb girdle muscular dystrophy. ANN NEUROL 2019;86:832–843</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures (EIMFS) is one of the most severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathies. We delineate the genetic causes and genotype–phenotype correlations of a large EIMFS cohort.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Phenotypic and molecular data were analyzed on patients recruited through an international collaborative study.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We ascertained 135 patients from 128 unrelated families. Ninety‐three of 135 (69%) had causative variants (42/55 previously reported) across 23 genes, including 9 novel EIMFS genes: de novo dominant <i>GABRA1, GABRB1</i>, <i>ATP1A3</i>; X‐linked <i>CDKL5</i>, <i>PIGA</i>; and recessive <i>ITPA</i>, <i>AIMP1</i>, <i>KARS</i>, <i>WWOX</i>. The most frequently implicated genes were <i>KCNT1</i> (36/135, 27%) and <i>SCN2A</i> (10/135, 7%). Mosaicism occurred in 2 probands (<i>SCN2A</i>, <i>GABRB3</i>) and 3 unaffected mothers (<i>KCNT1</i>). Median age at seizure onset was 4 weeks, with earlier onset in the <i>SCN2A</i>, <i>KCNQ2</i>, and <i>BRAT1</i> groups. Epileptic spasms occurred in 22% patients. A total of 127 patients had severe to profound developmental impairment. All but 7 patients had ongoing seizures. Additional features included microcephaly, movement disorders, spasticity, and scoliosis. Mortality occurred in 33% at median age 2 years 7 months.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We identified a genetic cause in 69% of patients with EIMFS. We highlight the genetic heterogeneity of EIMFS with 9 newly implicated genes, bringing the total number to 33. Mosaicism was observed in probands and parents, carrying critical implications for recurrence risk. EIMFS pathophysiology involves diverse molecular processes from gene and protein regulation to ion channel function and solute trafficking. ANN NEUROL 2019;86:821–831</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Holmes tremor is a debilitating movement disorder with limited treatment options. Lesions causing Holmes tremor can occur in multiple different brain locations, leaving the neuroanatomical substrate unclear. Here, we test whether lesion locations that cause Holmes tremor map to a connected brain circuit and whether this circuit might serve as a useful therapeutic target.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Case reports of Holmes tremor caused by focal brain lesions were identified through a systematic literature search. Connectivity between each lesion location and the rest of the brain was computed using resting state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging data from 1,000 healthy volunteers. Commonalities across lesion locations were identified. This Holmes tremor circuit was then compared to neurosurgical treatment targets and clinical efficacy.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 36 lesions causing Holmes tremor, which were scattered across multiple different brain regions. However, all lesion locations were connected to a common brain circuit with nodes in the red nucleus, thalamus, globus pallidus, and cerebellum. In cases with effective neurosurgical treatment, the treatment target was connected with the lesion location, indicating that a second hit to the same circuit might be beneficial. Commonly used deep brain stimulation targets such as the ventral intermediate nucleus and subthalamic nucleus fell outside our Holmes tremor circuit, whereas the globus pallidus target was close, consistent with published clinical response rates for these targets.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Lesions causing Holmes tremor are part of a single connected brain circuit that may serve as an improved therapeutic target. ANN NEUROL 2019;86:812–820</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The majority of patients with stroke survive the acute episode and live with enduring disability. Effective therapies to support recovery of motor function after stroke are yet to be developed. Key to this development is the identification of neurophysiologic signals that mark recovery and are suitable and susceptible to interventional therapies. Movement preparatory low‐frequency oscillations (LFOs) play a key role in cortical control of movement. Recent animal data point to a mechanistic role of motor cortical LFOs in stroke motor deficits and demonstrate neuromodulation intervention with therapeutic benefit. Their relevance in human stroke pathophysiology is unknown.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We studied the relationship between movement‐preparatory LFOs during the performance of a visuomotor grip task and motor function in a longitudinal (&lt;5 days, 1 and 3 months) cohort study of 33 patients with motor stroke and in 19 healthy volunteers.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Acute stroke–lesioned brains fail to generate the LFO signal. Whereas in healthy humans, a transient occurrence of LFOs preceded movement onset at predominantly contralateral frontoparietal motor regions, recordings in patients revealed that movement‐preparatory LFOs were substantially diminished to a level of 38% after acute stroke. LFOs progressively increased at 1 and 3 months. This re‐emergence closely tracked the recovery of motor function across several movement qualities including grip strength, fine motor skills, and synergies and was frequency band specific.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results provide the first human evidence for a link between movement‐preparatory LFOs and functional recovery after stroke, promoting their relevance for movement control. These results suggest that it may be interesting to explore targeted, LFOs‐restorative brain stimulation therapy in human stroke patients. ANN NEUROL 2019;86:853–865</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To assess the associations of several blood immune biomarkers with the future risks of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson disease in a prospective cohort study with 20 years of follow‐up.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The Swedish Apolipoprotein‐Related Mortality Risk study is a longitudinal cohort study including 812,073 participants with repeated blood biomarker measurements between 1985 and 1996 and a follow‐up until 2011. Using a Cox model, we first estimated hazard ratios of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson disease in relation to leukocytes, immunoglobulin G, haptoglobin, and uric acid. We further described the temporal changes of these biomarkers during the 20 years prior to the diagnosis of these diseases.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 585 incident cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and 3,769 incident cases of Parkinson disease were identified during the follow‐up. Increasing concentrations of leukocytes, haptoglobin, and uric acid were associated with a lower risk of Parkinson disease. No statistically significant association was, however, noted between the studied biomarkers and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Parkinson disease patients appeared to have lower levels of leukocytes and haptoglobin between 20 and 10 years before diagnosis and lower levels of uric acid during the 20 years before diagnosis, compared to controls, although statistically significant differences were only noted during parts of the respective time intervals after multivariable adjustment. No clear differences were noted between patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and controls.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>If verified in studies of independent populations, our findings may suggest a different role of systemic inflammation on the risk of Parkinson disease compared to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. ANN NEUROL 2019;86:913–926</p>

Abstract<p>Ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons receive glutamatergic and/or GABAergic input from other local neurons within the VTA. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) activity is capable of modulating such intra-VTA transmission, but the mechanisms are unclear. Here, we isolated monosynaptic glutamate or GABA transmission from mouse medial VTA (mVTA) to lateral VTA (latVTA) using pharmacology and optogenetics, and we studied nicotine’s ability to modulate these modes of transmission. Nicotine’s action on mVTA to latVTA glutamate transmission was bidirectional; nicotine enhanced glutamate release in half of the recorded latVTA cells and inhibited release in the other half. Nicotine-mediated reduction in glutamate release was reversed by blockade of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. This, coupled with expression data demonstrating co-expression of vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (vGluT2) and glutamate decarboxylase 2 (Gad2) in mVTA neurons, suggests that nicotine is able to stimulate GABA co-release from mVTA vGluT2<sup>+</sup> neurons. Nicotine had an altogether different effect on mVTA to latVTA GABA release from Gad2<sup>+</sup> cells; nicotine suppressed GABA release from mVTA Gad2<sup>+</sup> terminals in nearly all cells tested. Together, these data uncover a complex system of local circuitry in the VTA that is modulated by nAChR activity. These actions of nicotine, which occurred at concentrations of nicotine found in the artificial cerebrospinal fluid of cigarette smokers, may play a role in the reward system’s adaptive response to repeated nicotine exposure.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> This study uncovers novel aspects of nAChR neuropharmacology and VTA neurobiology that have implications for understanding nicotine dependence mechanisms. Nicotine must interact with receptors and circuits in VTA to cause dependence, and this study advances our understanding of specific nicotine-sensitive circuits that reside within this brain area. Identifying these novel nicotine-sensitive systems could provide new/additional mechanisms for targeting with smoking cessation drugs or therapeutics. Our results also add new details to the conceptual framework associated with reward circuit wiring, which could lead to an improved mechanistic understanding of natural reward processing.</p>

Abstract<p>Although within-modality sensory plasticity is limited to early developmental periods, cross-modal plasticity can occur even in adults. <i>In vivo</i> electrophysiological studies have shown that transient visual deprivation (dark exposure, DE) in adult mice improves the frequency selectivity and discrimination of neurons in thalamorecipient layer 4 (L4) of primary auditory cortex (A1). Since sound information is processed hierarchically in A1 by populations of neurons, we investigated if DE alters network activity in A1 L4 and layer 2/3 (L2/3). We examined neuronal populations in both L4 and L2/3 using <i>in vivo</i> two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging of transgenic mice expressing GCaMP6s. We find that one week of DE in adult mice increased the sound evoked responses and frequency selectivity of both L4 and L2/3 neurons. Moreover, after DE the frequency representation changed with L4 and L2/3 showing a reduced representation of cells with best frequencies between 8 and 16 kHz and an increased representation of cells with best frequencies above 32 kHz. Cells in L4 and L2/3 showed decreased pairwise signal correlations (SCs) consistent with sharper tuning curves. The decreases in SCs were larger in L4 than in L2/3. The decreased pairwise correlations indicate a sparsification of A1 responses to tonal stimuli. Thus, cross-modal experience in adults can both alter the sound-evoked responses of A1 neurons and change activity correlations within A1 potentially enhancing the encoding of auditory stimuli.</p><p><b>Significance</b> Our results show that the brief period of visual deprivation in mice can alter the tone evoked responses of neurons as well as the frequency representation in multiple layers of the primary auditory cortex. Thus, the tuning of auditory cortex neurons can be altered even after the critical period. Moreover, our results show that pairwise correlations are decreased indicating a sparsification of the evoked responses in the auditory cortex. These results add to the mounting evidence that cross-modal sensory experience has the power to alter network circuitry and population dynamics even into adulthood.</p>

Abstract<p>Excitatory neurons in the primary motor cortex project bilaterally to the striatum. However, whether synaptic structure and function in ipsilateral and contralateral cortico-striatal pathways is identical or different remains largely unknown. Here, we describe that excitatory synapses in the mouse contralateral pathway have higher levels of NMDA-type of glutamate receptors (NMDARs) than those in the ipsilateral pathway, although both synapses utilize the same presynaptic vesicular glutamate transporter. We also show that NMDARs containing the GluN2B subunit, but not GluN2A, contribute to this difference. The altered NMDAR subunit composition in these two pathways results in opposite synaptic plasticity induced by theta burst stimulus: long-term depression in the ipsilateral pathway and long-term potentiation in the contralateral pathway. The standard LTD-inducing protocol using paired post- and presynaptic activity triggers synaptic depression at ipsilateral pathway synapses, but not at those of the contralateral pathway. Altogether, our results provide novel and unexpected evidence for the lack of bilaterality of NMDAR-mediated synaptic transmission at cortico-striatal pathways due to differences in the expression of GluN2B subunits, which results in differences in bidirectional synaptic plasticity.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Excitatory neurons in the cortex project bilaterally to the striatum. It is generally assumed that synapses formed by ipsilateral and contralateral cortical efferents have similar synaptic features, and serve to synchronize inter-hemispheric activity. We demonstrate that the contralateral cortico-striatal pathway has higher levels of GluN2B-containing NMDARs than the ipsilateral pathway. This altered content of GluN2B and GluN2A subunits in NMDARs results in different forms of LTP and LTD at excitatory synapses in the ipsilateral and contralateral pathways. These findings provide a novel mechanistic insight into how cortical neurons distinctly modulate ipsilateral and contralateral subcortical regions.</p>

Abstract<p>The circadian clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in mammals entrains to ambient light via the retinal photoreceptors. This allows behavioural rhythms to change in synchrony with seasonal and daily changes in light period. Circadian rhythmicity is progressively disrupted in Huntington’s disease (HD) and in HD mouse models such as the transgenic R6/2 line. Although retinal afferent inputs to the SCN are disrupted in R6/2 mice at late stages, they can respond to changes in light-dark cycles, as seen in jet lag and 23-hour-day paradigms. To investigate photic entrainment and SCN function in R6/2 mice at different stages of disease, we first assessed the effect on locomotor activity of exposure to a 15-minute light pulse given at different times of the day. We then placed the mice under 5 non-standard light conditions. These were light cycle regimes (T-cycles) of T21 (10.5h light:10.5h dark), T22 (11h light:11h dark), T26 (13h light:13h dark), constant light or constant dark. We found a progressive impairment in photic synchronisation in R6/2 mice when the stimuli required the SCN to lengthen rhythms (phase-delaying light pulse, T26 or constant light), but normal synchronisation to stimuli that required the SCN to shorten rhythms (phase-advancing light pulse and T22). Despite the behavioural abnormalities, we found that <i>Per1</i> and <i>c-fos</i> gene expression remained photo-inducible in SCN of R6/2 mice. Both the endogenous drift of the R6/2 mouse SCN to shorter periods and its inability to adapt to phase-delaying changes will contribute to the HD circadian dysfunction.</p>

The early stages of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) are characterized by the accumulation of basal laminar deposits (BLamDs). The mechanism for BLamDs accumulating between the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and its basal lamina remains elusive.

<p>Unsupervised learning requiring only raw data is not only a fundamental
function of the cerebral cortex, but also a foundation for a next generation of
artificial neural networks. However, a unified theoretical framework to treat
sensory inputs, synapses and neural activity together is still lacking. The
computational obstacle originates from the discrete nature of synapses, and
complex interactions among these three essential elements of learning. Here, we
propose a variational mean-field theory in which only the distribution of
synaptic weight is considered. The unsupervised learning can then be decomposed
into two interwoven steps: a maximization step is carried out as a gradient
ascent of the lower-bound on the data log-likelihood, and an expectation step
is carried out as a message passing procedure on an equivalent or dual neural
network whose parameter is specified by the variational parameter of the weight
distribution. Therefore, our framework explains how data (or sensory inputs),
synapses and neural activities interact with each other to achieve the goal of
extracting statistical regularities in sensory inputs. This variational
framework is verified in restricted Boltzmann machines with planted synaptic
weights and learning handwritten digits.

<p>A main challenge for the development of cortical visual prostheses is to
spatially localize individual spots of light, called phosphenes, by assigning
appropriate stimulating parameters to implanted electrodes. Imitating the
natural responses to phosphene-like stimuli at different positions can help in
designing a systematic procedure to determine these parameters. The key
characteristic of such a system is the ability to discriminate between
responses to different positions in the visual field. While most previous
prosthetic devices have targeted the primary visual cortex, the extrastriate
cortex has the advantage of covering a large part of the visual field with a
smaller amount of cortical tissue, providing the possibility of a more compact
implant. Here, we studied how well ensembles of Multiunit activity (MUA) and
Local Field Potentials (LFPs) responses from extrastriate cortical visual area
V4 of a behaving macaque monkey can discriminate between two-dimensional
spatial positions. We found that despite the large receptive field sizes in V4,
the combined responses from multiple sites, whether MUA or LFP, has the
capability for fine and coarse discrimination of positions. We identified a
selection procedure that could significantly increase the discrimination
performance while reducing the required number of electrodes. Analysis of noise
correlation in MUA and LFP responses showed that noise correlations in LFP
responses carry more information about the spatial positions. Overall, these
findings suggest that spatial positions could be localized with patterned
stimulation in extrastriate area V4.

<p>Developing a high-throughput approach to quantify the extent of myelin integrity in preclinical models of demyelinating diseases will enhance our capacity to identify novel therapies for myelin repair. In light of the technical limitations of electron microscopy and immunohistochemical analyses of myelination, we have utilized a novel imaging technique, spectral confocal reflectance (SCoRe) microscopy. SCoRe takes advantage of the optically reflective properties of compact myelin, allowing the integrity of compact myelin to be quantified over the course of the cuprizone-induced model of central demyelination. We applied SCoRe imaging on fixed frozen brain sections. SCoRe analysis of control mice identified an increase in corpus callosum myelination during the period of cuprizone administration and recovery, suggesting that the normal developmental processes of myelination are ongoing at this time. Importantly, analysis of mice subjected to cuprizone identified a significant reduction in compact myelin in both rostral and caudal corpus callosum compared to age-matched control mice. SCoRe microscopy also allowed the visualization and quantification of the amount of myelin debris in demyelinating lesions. Combining SCoRe imaging with immunohistochemistry, we quantified the amount of myelin debris within IBA-1+ microglia and found that 11% of myelin debris colocalized in microglia irrespective of the callosal regions, with the vast majority of debris outside of microglia. In summary, we have demonstrated that SCoRe microscopy is an effective and powerful tool to perform both quantitative and qualitative analyses of compact myelin integrity in health or after injury in vivo, demonstrating its future application in high-throughput assessments and screening of the therapeutic efficacy of myelin repair therapies in preclinical animal models of demyelinating diseases.</p>

<p>A number of [PSI<sup>+</sup>]-no-more (PNM) mutations, eliminating [PSI<sup>+</sup>] prion, were previously described in SUP35. In this study, we designed and analyzed a new PNM mutation based on the parallel in-register β-structure of Sup35 prion fibrils suggested by the known experimental data. In such an arrangement, substitution of non-charged residues by charged ones may destabilize the fibril structure. We introduced Q33K/A34K amino acid substitutions into the Sup35 protein, corresponding allele was called sup35-M0. The mutagenized residues were chosen based on ArchCandy in silico prediction of high inhibitory effect on the amyloidogenic potential of Sup35. The experiments confirmed that Sup35-M0 leads to the elimination of [PSI<sup>+</sup>] with high efficiency. Our data suggested that the elimination of the [PSI<sup>+</sup>] prion is associated with the decreased aggregation properties of the protein. The new mutation can induce the prion with very low efficiency and is able to propagate only weak [PSI<sup>+</sup>] prion variants. We also showed that Sup35-M0 protein co-aggregates with the wild-type Sup35 in vivo. Moreover, our data confirmed the utility of the strategy of substitution of non-charged residues by charged ones to design new mutations to inhibit a prion formation.</p>

<p>Semantic audiovisual stimuli have a facilitatory effect on behavioral performance and influence the integration of multisensory inputs across sensory modalities. Many neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies investigated the neural mechanisms of multisensory semantic processing and reported that attention modulates the response to multisensory semantic inputs. In the present study, we designed an functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment of semantic discrimination using the unimodal auditory, unimodal visual and bimodal audiovisual stimuli with semantic information. By manipulating the stimuli present on attended and unattended position, we recorded the task-related fMRI data corresponding to the unimodal auditory, unimodal visual and bimodal audiovisual stimuli in attended and unattended conditions. We also recorded the fMRI data in resting state. Then the fMRI method was used together with a graph theoretical analysis to construct the functional brain networks in task-related and resting states and quantitatively characterize the topological network properties. The aim of our present study is to explore the characteristics of functional brain networks that process semantic audiovisual stimuli in attended and unattended conditions, revealing the neural mechanism of multisensory processing and the modulation of attention. The behavioral results showed that the audiovisual stimulus presented simultaneously promoted the performance of semantic discrimination task. And the analyses of network properties showed that compared with the resting-state condition, the functional networks of processing semantic audiovisual stimuli (both in attended and unattended conditions) had greater small-worldness, global efficiency, and lower clustering coefficient, characteristic path length, global efficiency and hierarchy. In addition, the hubs were concentrated in the bilateral temporal lobes, especially in the anterior temporal lobes (ATLs), which were positively correlated to reaction time (RT). Moreover, attention significantly altered the degree of small-worldness and the distribution of hubs in the functional network for processing semantic audiovisual stimuli. Our findings suggest that the topological structure of the functional brain network for processing semantic audiovisual stimulus is modulated by attention, and has the characteristics of high efficiency and low wiring cost, which maintains an optimized balance between functional segregation and integration for multisensory processing efficiently.</p>

<p>Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are an emergent public health problem, placing significant burden upon the individual, family and health system. ASD are polygenetic spectrum disorders of neural connectome development, in which one or more feedback loops amplify small genetic, structural, or functional variations in the very early development of motor and sensory-motor pathways. These perturbations trigger a ‘butterfly effect’ of unpredictable cascades of structural and functional imbalances in the global neuronal workspace, resulting in atypical behaviors, social communication, and cognition long-term. The first 100 days post-term are critically neuroplastic and comprise an injury-sensitive developmental window, characterized by a neural biomarker, the persistence of the cortical subplate, and a behavioral biomarker, the crying diathesis. By the time potential diagnostic signs are identified, from 6 months of age, ASD neuropathy is already entrenched. The International Society for Autism Research Special Interest Group has called for pre-emptive intervention, based upon rigorous theoretical frames, and real world translation and evaluation. This paper responds to that call. It synthesizes heterogenous evidence concerning ASD etiologies from both psychosocial and biological research literatures with complexity science and evolutionary biology, to propose a theoretical framework for pre-emptive intervention. This paper hypothesizes that environmental factors resulting from a mismatch between environment of evolutionary adaptedness and culture initiate or perpetuate early motor and sensory-motor lesions, triggering a butterfly effect of multi-directional cascades of atypical developmental in the complex adaptive system of the parent and ASD-susceptible infant. Chronic sympathetic nervous system/hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hyperarousal and disrupted parent-infant biobehavioral synchrony are the key biologic and behavioral mechanisms perpetuating these atypical developmental cascades. A clinical translation of this evidence is proposed, for application antenatally and in the first 6 months of life, as pre-emptive intervention for ASD.</p>

<p>Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is an autoimmune inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS). The purpose of the study was to examine the association between the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Val66Met genotype and structural and functional optic nerve damage in the eyes of NMOSD patients. A total of 17 NMOSD subjects (34 eyes) were included in the study and were divided into subgroups based on optic neuritis (ON) history and BDNF Val66Met polymorphisms. The mean (range) age was 47.8 (23–78) years, and the mean (SD) disease duration was 7.4 (2–39) years. All participants had undergone optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans for global retinal nerve fiber layer (gRNFL) and ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) thickness and multifocal visual evoked potential (mfVEP) test for amplitude and latency. BDNF Val66Met polymorphisms were genotyped in all participants. OCT and mfVEP changes were compared between two genotype groups (Met carriers vs. Val homozygotes) by using the generalised estimating equation (GEE) models. The BDNF Val66Met polymorphism was significantly associated with more severe nerve fiber layer damage and axonal loss in ON eyes of NMOSD subjects. Met carriers had more significantly reduced GCIPL (P = 0.002) and gRNFL (P &lt; 0.001) thickness as well as more delayed mfVEP latency (P = 0.008) in ON eyes. No association was found between Val66Met variants and non-ON (NON)-eye of the participants. These findings suggest that the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism may be associated with optic nerve damage caused by acute ON attacks in NMOSD patients.</p>

<p>EphA4 is a receptor of the Eph-ephrin system, which plays an important role in axon guidance during development. Previously, we identified EphA4 as a genetic modifier of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in both zebrafish and rodent models, via modulation of the intrinsic vulnerability, and re-sprouting capacity of motor neurons. Moreover, loss of EphA4 rescued the motor axon phenotype in a zebrafish model of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Similar to ALS, SMA is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting spinal motor neurons resulting in neuromuscular junction (NMJ) denervation, muscle atrophy and paralysis. In this study, we investigated the disease modifying potential of reduced EphA4 protein levels in the SMNΔ7 mouse model for severe SMA. Reduction of EphA4 did not improve motor function, survival, motor neuron survival or NMJ innervation. Our data suggest that either lowering EphA4 has limited therapeutic potential in SMA or that the clinical severity hampers the potential beneficial role of EphA4 reduction in this mouse model for SMA.</p>

Aim<p>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive and safe technique for treatment of central and peripheral nerve injury. In recent years, this technique has been widely used in clinic, and an increasing number of studies have reported its mechanisms. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of rTMS-mediated autophagy flux in human bone mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs).</p>Methods<p>A frequency of 50 Hz was employed. Cells were divided into five groups: (1) normal, (2) sham, (3) 0.5 T, (4) 1.0 T, and (5) 1.5 T. Cells were stimulated for 20 min/day. The levels of p62, LC3-II/I, phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK), ERK, phosphorylated-AKT (p-AKT), AKT, phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR), mTOR, phosphorylated protein kinase A (p-PKA), PKA, phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor (p-EGFR), EGFR, Nanog, Oct4, Sox2, and NMDA receptor (NMDAR1) were investigated by western blotting. Intracellular calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) levels were quantified by flow cytometry. p62 and LC3 expression was also assessed by immunofluorescence analysis.</p>Results<p>In the 0.5 T group, rTMS increased the expression of LC3-II/I, p-ERK/ERK, and NMDAR1 and decreased the levels of p62 and p-mTOR/mTOR than in the normal group. The ratio of p-AKT/AKT, p-PKA/PKA, and p-EGFR/EGFR and the expression of Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2 remained unchanged. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed colocalization of p62 with LC3 puncta, and flow cytometry analysis displayed that Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels were elevated. However, in the 1.0 and 1.5 T groups, no changes in the expression of these autophagy markers were observed.</p>Conclusion<p>In the 0.5 T group, high-frequency rTMS can induce autophagy through NMDAR–Ca<sup>2+</sup>–ERK–mTOR signaling in BMSCs. In the 1.0 and 1.5 T groups, autophagy is not activated.</p>

<p>Defects in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane shaping and interaction with other organelles seem to be a crucial mechanism underlying Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP) neurodegeneration. REEP1, a transmembrane protein belonging to TB2/HVA22 family, is implicated in SPG31, an autosomal dominant form of HSP, and its interaction with Atlastin/SPG3A and Spastin/SPG4, the other two major HSP linked proteins, has been demonstrated to play a crucial role in modifying ER architecture. In addition, the Drosophila ortholog of REEP1, named ReepA, has been found to regulate the response to ER neuronal stress. Herein we investigated the role of ReepA in ER morphology and stress response. ReepA is upregulated under stress conditions and aging. Our data show that ReepA triggers a selective activation of Ire1 and Atf6 branches of Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) and modifies ER morphology. Drosophila lacking ReepA showed Atf6 and Ire1 activation, expansion of ER sheet-like structures, locomotor dysfunction and shortened lifespan. Furthermore, we found that naringenin, a flavonoid that possesses strong antioxidant and neuroprotective activity, can rescue the cellular phenotypes, the lifespan and locomotor disability associated with ReepA loss of function. Our data highlight the importance of ER homeostasis in nervous system functionality and HSP neurodegenerative mechanisms, opening new opportunities for HSP treatment.</p>

<p>Brain regenerative strategies through the transplantation of stem cells hold the potential to promote functional rescue of brain lesions caused either by trauma or neurodegenerative diseases. Most of the positive modulations fostered by stem cells are fueled by bystander effects, namely increase of neurotrophic factors levels and reduction of neuroinflammation. Nevertheless, the ultimate goal of cell therapies is to promote cell replacement. Therefore, the ability of stem cells to migrate and differentiate into neurons that later become integrated into the host neuronal network replacing the lost neurons has also been largely explored. However, as most of the preclinical studies demonstrate, there is a small functional integration of graft-derived neurons into host neuronal circuits. Thus, it is mandatory to better study the whole brain cell therapy approach in order to understand what should be better comprehended concerning graft-derived neuronal and glial cells migration and integration before we can expect these therapies to be ready as a viable solution for brain disorder treatment. Therefore, this review discusses the positive mechanisms triggered by cell transplantation into the brain, the limitations of adult brain plasticity that might interfere with the neuroregeneration process, as well as some strategies tested to overcome some of these limitations. It also considers the efforts that have been made by the regulatory authorities to lead to better standardization of preclinical and clinical studies in this field in order to reduce the heterogeneity of the obtained results.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00402">Individual Differences in Verb Bias Sensitivity in Children and Adults With Developmental Language Disorder</a></h4>

<p>A number of experiments support the hypothetical utility of statistical information for language learning and processing among both children and adults. However, tasks in these studies are often very general, and only a few include populations with developmental language disorder (DLD). We wanted to determine whether a stronger relationship might be shown when the measure of statistical learning is chosen for its relevance to the language task when including a substantial number of participants with DLD. The language ability we measured was sensitivity to verb bias – the likelihood of a verb to appear with a certain argument or interpretation. A previous study showed adults with DLD were less sensitive to verb bias than their typical peers. Verb bias sensitivity had not yet been tested in children with DLD. In Study 1, 49 children, ages 7–9 years, 17 of whom were classified as having DLD, completed a task designed to measure sensitivity to verb bias through implicit and explicit measures. We found children with and without DLD showed sensitivity to verb bias in implicit but not explicit measures, with no differences between groups. In Study 2, we used a multiverse approach to investigate whether individual differences in statistical learning predicted verb bias sensitivity in these participants as well as in a dataset of adult participants. Our analysis revealed no evidence of a relationship between statistical learning and verb bias sensitivity in children, which was not unexpected given we found no group differences in Study 1. Statistical learning predicted sensitivity to verb bias as measured through explicit measures in adults, though results were not robust. These findings suggest that verb bias may still be relatively unstable in school age children, and thus may not play the same role in sentence processing in children as in adults. It would also seem that individuals with DLD may not be using the same mechanisms during processing as their typically developing (TD) peers in adulthood. Thus, statistical information may differ in relevance for language processing in individuals with and without DLD.</p>

<p>Adults who stutter (AWS) display altered patterns of neural phase coherence within the speech motor system preceding disfluencies. These altered patterns may distinguish fluent speech episodes from disfluent ones. Phase coherence is relevant to the study of stuttering because it reflects neural communication within brain networks. In this follow-up study, the oscillatory cortical dynamics preceding fluent speech in AWS and adults who do not stutter (AWNS) were examined during a single-word delayed reading task using electroencephalographic (EEG) techniques. Compared to AWNS, fluent speech preparation in AWS was characterized by a decrease in theta-gamma phase coherence and a corresponding increase in theta-beta coherence level. Higher spectral powers in the beta and gamma bands were also observed preceding fluent utterances by AWS. Overall, there was altered neural communication during speech planning in AWS that provides novel evidence for atypical allocation of feedforward control by AWS even before fluent utterances.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00073">Optogenetic/Chemogenetic Activation of GABAergic Neurons in the Ventral Tegmental Area Facilitates General Anesthesia via Projections to the Lateral Hypothalamus in Mice</a></h4>

<p>The ventral tegmental area (VTA) reportedly regulates sleep and wakefulness through communication with the lateral hypothalamus (LH). It has also been suggested that adequate anesthesia produced by administration of chloral hydrate, ketamine, or halothane significantly reduces the GABAergic neuronal firing rate within the VTA. However, the exact effects on GABAergic neurons in the VTA and the mechanisms through which these neurons modulate anesthesia through associated neural circuits is still unclear. Here, we used optogenetic and chemogenetic methods to specifically activate or inhibit GABAergic neuronal perikarya in the VTA or their projections to the LH in Vgat-Cre mice. Electroencephalogram (EEG) spectral analyses and burst suppression ratio (BSR) calculations were conducted following administration of 0.8 or 1.0% isoflurane, respectively; and loss of righting reflex (LORR), recovery of righting reflex (RORR), and anesthesia sensitivity were assessed under 1.4% isoflurane anesthesia. The results showed that activation of GABAergic neurons in the VTA increased delta wave power from 40.0 to 46.4% (P = 0.006) and decreased gamma wave power from 15.2 to 11.5% (P = 0.017) during anesthesia maintenance. BSR was increased from 51.8 to 68.3% (P = 0.017). Induction time (LORR) was reduced from 333 to 290 s (P = 0.019), whereas arousal time (RORR) was prolonged from 498 to 661 s (P = 0.007). Conversely, inhibition of VTA GABAergic neurons led to opposite effects. In contrast, optical activation of VTA–LH GABAergic projection neurons increased power of slow delta waves from 44.2 to 48.8% (P = 0.014) and decreased that of gamma oscillations from 10.2 to 8.0%. BSR was increased from 39.9 to 60.2% (P = 0.0002). LORR was reduced from 330 to 232 s (P = 0.002), and RORR increased from 396 to 565 s (P = 0.007). Optical inhibition of the projection neurons caused opposite effects in terms of both the EEG spectrum and the BSR, except that inhibition of this projection did not accelerate arousal time. These results indicate that VTA GABAergic neurons could facilitate the anesthetic effects of isoflurane during induction and maintenance while postponing anesthetic recovery, at least partially, through modulation of their projections to the LH.</p>

<p>Inhibitory neurons crucially contribute to shaping the breathing rhythm in the brain stem. These neurons use GABA or glycine as neurotransmitter; or co-release GABA and glycine. However, the developmental relationship between GABAergic, glycinergic and cotransmitting neurons, and the functional relevance of cotransmitting neurons has remained enigmatic. Transgenic mice expressing fluorescent markers or the split-Cre system in inhibitory neurons were developed to track the three different interneuron phenotypes. During late embryonic development, the majority of inhibitory neurons in the ventrolateral medulla are cotransmitting cells, most of which differentiate into GABAergic and glycinergic neurons around birth and around postnatal day 4, respectively. Functional inactivation of cotransmitting neurons revealed an increase of the number of respiratory pauses, the cycle-by-cycle variability, and the overall variability of breathing. In summary, the majority of cotransmitting neurons differentiate into GABAergic or glycinergic neurons within the first 2 weeks after birth and these neurons contribute to fine-tuning of the breathing pattern.</p>

<p>Mounting evidence suggests that neuroinflammation is not just a consequence but a vital contributor to the development and progression of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Microglia in particular, may contribute to the induction and modulation of inflammation in PD. Upon stimulation, microglia convert into activated phenotypes, which exist along a dynamic continuum and bear different immune properties depending on the disease stage and severity. Activated microglia release various factors involved in neuroinflammation, such as cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen species (RNS), and prostaglandins (PGs). Further, activated microglia interact with other cell types (e.g., neurons, astrocytes and mast cells) and are closely associated with α-synuclein (α-syn) pathophysiology and iron homeostasis disturbance. Taken together, microglial activation and microglia-mediated inflammatory responses play essential roles in the pathogenesis of PD and elucidation of the complexity and imbalance of microglial activation may shed light on novel therapeutic approaches for PD.</p>

<p>In the face of chronic changes in incoming sensory inputs, neuronal networks are capable of maintaining stable conditions of electrical activity over prolonged periods of time by adjusting synaptic strength, to amplify or dampen incoming inputs [homeostatic synaptic plasticity (HSP)], or by altering the intrinsic excitability of individual neurons [homeostatic intrinsic plasticity (HIP)]. Emerging evidence suggests a synergistic interplay between extracellular matrix (ECM) and metabotropic receptors in both forms of homeostatic plasticity. Activation of dopaminergic, serotonergic, or glutamate metabotropic receptors stimulates intracellular signaling through calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, protein kinase A, protein kinase C, and inositol trisphosphate receptors, and induces changes in expression of ECM molecules and proteolysis of both ECM molecules (lecticans) and ECM receptors (NPR, CD44). The resulting remodeling of perisynaptic and synaptic ECM provides permissive conditions for HSP and plays an instructive role by recruiting additional signaling cascades, such as those through metabotropic glutamate receptors and integrins. The superimposition of all these signaling events determines intracellular and diffusional trafficking of ionotropic glutamate receptors, resulting in HSP and modulation of conditions for inducing Hebbian synaptic plasticity (i.e., metaplasticity).

<p>The spinal cord after injury shows altered transcription in numerous genes. We tested in a pilot study whether the nucleus raphé magnus, a descending serotonergic brainstem region whose stimulation improves recovery after incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI), can influence these transcriptional changes. Rats received 2 h of low-frequency electrical stimulation in the raphé magnus 3 days after an impact contusion at segment T8. Comparison groups lacked injuries or activated stimulators or both. Immediately following stimulation, spinal cords were extracted, their RNA transcriptome sequenced, and differential gene expression quantified. Confirming many previous studies, injury primarily increased inflammatory and immune transcripts and decreased those related to lipid and cholesterol synthesis and neuronal signaling. Stimulation plus injury, contrasted with injury alone, caused significant changes in 43 transcripts (39 increases, 4 decreases), all protein-coding. Injury itself decreased only four of these 43 transcripts, all reversed by stimulation, and increased none of them. The non-specific 5-HT7 receptor antagonist pimozide reversed 25 of the 43 changes. Stimulation in intact rats principally caused decreases in transcripts related to oxidative phosphorylation, none of which were altered by stimulation in injury. Gene ontology (biological process) annotations comparing stimulation with either no stimulation or pimozide treatment in injured rats highlighted defense responses to lipopolysaccharides and microorganisms, and also erythrocyte development and oxygen transport (possibly yielding cellular oxidant detoxification). Connectivity maps of human orthologous genes generated in the CLUE database of perturbagen-response transcriptional signatures showed that drug classes whose effects in injured rats most closely resembled stimulation without pimozide include peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists and angiotensin receptor blockers, which are reportedly beneficial in SCI. Thus the initial transcriptional response of the injured spinal cord to raphé magnus stimulation is upregulation of genes that in various ways are mostly protective, some probably located in recently arrived myeloid cells.</p>

<p>T helper 17 (Th17) cells represent a distinct population of immune cells, important in the defense of the organism against extracellular infectious agents. Because of their cytokine profile and ability to recruit other immune cell types, they are highly pro-inflammatory and are involved in the induction of several autoimmune disorders. Recent studies show that Th17 cells and their signature cytokine IL-17 have also a role in a wide variety of neurological diseases. This review article will briefly summarize the evidence linking Th17 cells to brain diseases associated with cognitive impairment, including multiple sclerosis (MS), ischemic brain injury and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We will also investigate the mechanisms by which these cells enter the brain and induce brain damage, including direct effects of IL-17 on brain cells and indirect effects mediated through disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), neurovascular dysfunction and gut-brain axis. Finally, therapeutic prospects targeting Th17 cells and IL-17 will be discussed.</p>

<p>Hibernating mammals undergo torpor periods characterized by a general decrease in body temperature, metabolic rate, and brain activity accompanied by complex adaptive brain changes that appear to protect the brain from extreme conditions of hypoxia and low temperatures. These processes are accompanied by morphological and neurochemical changes in the brain including those in cortical neurons such as the fragmentation and reduction of the Golgi apparatus (GA), which both reverse a few hours after arousal from the torpor state. In the present study, we characterized – by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy – the GA of cortical astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglial cells in the Syrian hamster, which is a facultative hibernator. We also show that after artificial induction of hibernation, in addition to neurons, the GA of glia in the Syrian hamster undergoes important structural changes, as well as modifications in the intensity of immunostaining and distribution patterns of Golgi structural proteins at different stages of the hibernation cycle.</p>

<p>Melatonin exerts neuroprotective effects on isoflurane-induced cognitive impairment. However, the underlying mechanism has yet to be elucidated. The present study sought to determine if melatonin confers its beneficial effects by acting on mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and attenuates the neuroinflammation in the hippocampus of aged mice. A total of 72 male C57BL/6 mice, 16-month-old, were randomly and equally divided into six groups: (1) the control group (CON); (2) the rapamycin group (RAP); (3) the melatonin group (MEL); (4) the isoflurane group (ISO); (5) the rapamycin + isoflurane group (RAP + ISO); and (6) the melatonin + isoflurane group (MEL + ISO). RAP, RAP + ISO, MEL, MEL + ISO groups received 1 mg/kg/day mTOR inhibitor rapamycin solution or 10 mg/kg/day melatonin solution, respectively, intraperitoneally at 5:00 p.m. for 14 days consecutively. Mice in the CON and ISO groups were administered an equivalent volume of saline. Subsequently, ISO, RAP + ISO, and MEL + ISO groups were exposed to inhale 2% isoflurane for 4 h; the CON, RAP, and MEL mice received only the vehicle gas. Then, the memory function and spatial learning of the mice were examined via the Morris water maze (MWM) test. mTOR expression was detected via Western blot, whereas the concentration of inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and that of melatonin was quantified with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Melatonin and rapamycin significantly ameliorated the isoflurane-induced cognitive impairment and also led to a decrease in the melatonin levels as well as the expression levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and p-mTOR in the hippocampus. In conclusion, these results showed that melatonin and rapamycin attenuates mTOR expression while affecting the downstream proinflammatory cytokines. Thus, these molecular findings could be associated with an improved cognitive function in mice exposed to isoflurane.</p>

<p>Age-associated macular degeneration (AMD), which leads to loss of vision at its end stage, is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases among the elderly. However, to date, no effective drug therapy is available for the prevention of AMD. Here, we report the occurrence of AMD pathology and its prevention by chronic treatment with the neurotrophic peptidergic compound P021, in aged rats and 3xTg-AD mice. We found photoreceptor degeneration, lipofuscin granules, vacuoles, and atrophy in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) as well as Bruch’s membrane (BM) thickening; in aged rats, we even found rosette-like structure formation. Microgliosis and astrogliosis were observed in different retinal layers. In addition, we also found that total tau, phosphorylated tau, Aβ/APP, and VEGF were widely distributed in the sub-retina of aged rats and 3xTg mice. Importantly, chronic treatment with P021 for 3 months in rats and for 18 months in 3xTg mice ameliorated the pathological changes above. These findings indicate the therapeutic potential of P021 for prevention and treatment of AMD and retinal changes associated with aging and Alzheimer’s disease.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50617">Cerebellar nuclei excitatory neurons regulate developmental scaling of presynaptic Purkinje cell number and organ growth</a></h4>

For neural systems to function effectively, the numbers of each cell type must be proportioned properly during development. We found that conditional knockout of the mouse homeobox genes <i>En1</i> and <i>En2</i> in the excitatory cerebellar nuclei neurons (eCN) leads to reduced postnatal growth of the cerebellar cortex. A subset of medial and intermediate eCN are lost in the mutants, with an associated cell non-autonomous loss of their presynaptic partner Purkinje cells by birth leading to proportional scaling down of neuron production in the postnatal cerebellar cortex. Genetic killing of embryonic eCN throughout the cerebellum also leads to loss of Purkinje cells and reduced postnatal growth but throughout the cerebellar cortex. Thus, the eCN play a key role in scaling the size of the cerebellum by influencing the survival of their Purkinje cell partners, which in turn regulate production of granule cells and interneurons via the amount of sonic hedgehog secreted.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50223">Genome-wide CRISPR screening reveals genetic modifiers of mutant EGFR dependence in human NSCLC</a></h4>

EGFR-mutant NSCLCs frequently respond to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, the responses are not durable, and the magnitude of tumor regression is variable, suggesting the existence of genetic modifiers of EGFR dependency. Here, we applied a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening to identify genetic determinants of EGFR TKI sensitivity and uncovered putative candidates. We show that knockout of <i>RIC8A</i>, essential for G-alpha protein activation, enhanced EGFR TKI-induced cell death. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that RIC8A is a positive regulator of YAP signaling, activation of which rescued the EGFR TKI sensitizing phenotype resulting from <i>RIC8A</i> knockout. We also show that knockout of <i>ARIH2</i>, or other components in the Cullin-5 E3 complex, conferred resistance to EGFR inhibition, in part by promoting nascent protein synthesis through METAP2. Together, these data uncover a spectrum of previously unidentified regulators of EGFR TKI sensitivity in EGFR-mutant human NSCLC, providing insights into the heterogeneity of EGFR TKI treatment responses.

Curative cancer therapies are uncommon and nearly always involve multi-drug combinations developed by experimentation in humans; unfortunately, the mechanistic basis for the success of such combinations has rarely been investigated in detail, obscuring lessons learned. Here we use isobologram analysis to score pharmacological interaction, and clone tracing and CRISPR screening to measure cross-resistance among the five drugs comprising R‑CHOP, a combination therapy that frequently cures Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphomas. We find that drugs in R‑CHOP exhibit very low cross-resistance but not synergistic interaction: together they achieve a greater fractional kill according to the null hypothesis for both the Loewe dose-additivity model and the Bliss effect-independence model. These data provide direct evidence for the 50-year old hypothesis that a curative cancer therapy can be constructed on the basis of independently effective drugs having non-overlapping mechanisms of resistance, without synergistic interaction, which has immediate significance for the design of new drug combinations.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/49753">Excitatory neurons are more disinhibited than inhibitory neurons by chloride dysregulation in the spinal dorsal horn</a></h4>

Neuropathic pain is a debilitating condition caused by the abnormal processing of somatosensory input. Synaptic inhibition in the spinal dorsal horn plays a key role in that processing. Mechanical allodynia – the misperception of light touch as painful – occurs when inhibition is compromised. Disinhibition is due primarily to chloride dysregulation caused by hypofunction of the potassium-chloride co-transporter KCC2. Here we show, in rats, that excitatory neurons are disproportionately affected. This is not because chloride is differentially dysregulated in excitatory and inhibitory neurons, but, rather, because excitatory neurons rely more heavily on inhibition to counterbalance strong excitation. Receptive fields in both cell types have a center-surround organization but disinhibition unmasks more excitatory input to excitatory neurons. Differences in intrinsic excitability also affect how chloride dysregulation affects spiking. These results deepen understanding of how excitation and inhibition are normally balanced in the spinal dorsal horn, and how their imbalance disrupts somatosensory processing.

<p>by Jani V. Anttila, Mikhail Shubin, Johannes Cairns, Florian Borse, Qingli Guo, Tommi Mononen, Ignacio Vázquez-García, Otto Pulkkinen, Ville Mustonen</p>

A tumour grows when the total division (birth) rate of its cells exceeds their total mortality (death) rate. The capability for uncontrolled growth within the host tissue is acquired via the accumulation of driver mutations which enable the tumour to progress through various hallmarks of cancer. We present a mathematical model of the penultimate stage in such a progression. We assume the tumour has reached the limit of its present growth potential due to cell competition that either results in total birth rate reduction or death rate increase. The tumour can then progress to the final stage by either seeding a metastasis or acquiring a driver mutation. We influence the ensuing evolutionary dynamics by cytotoxic (increasing death rate) or cytostatic (decreasing birth rate) therapy while keeping the effect of the therapy on net growth reduction constant. Comparing the treatments head to head we derive conditions for choosing optimal therapy. We quantify how the choice and the related gain of optimal therapy depends on driver mutation, metastasis, intrinsic cell birth and death rates, and the details of cell competition. We show that detailed understanding of the cell population dynamics could be exploited in choosing the right mode of treatment with substantial therapy gains.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9H-wsRJ20XM" width="1" />

<p>by Chen Zhao, Adam C. Mirando, Richard J. Sové, Thalyta X. Medeiros, Brian H. Annex, Aleksander S. Popel</p>

Macrophages respond to signals in the microenvironment by changing their functional phenotypes, a process known as polarization. Depending on the context, they acquire different patterns of transcriptional activation, cytokine expression and cellular metabolism which collectively constitute a continuous spectrum of phenotypes, of which the two extremes are denoted as classical (M1) and alternative (M2) activation. To quantitatively decode the underlying principles governing macrophage phenotypic polarization and thereby harness its therapeutic potential in human diseases, a systems-level approach is needed given the multitude of signaling pathways and intracellular regulation involved. Here we develop the first mechanism-based, multi-pathway computational model that describes the integrated signal transduction and macrophage programming under M1 (IFN-γ), M2 (IL-4) and cell stress (hypoxia) stimulation. Our model was calibrated extensively against experimental data, and we mechanistically elucidated several signature feedbacks behind the M1-M2 antagonism and investigated the dynamical shaping of macrophage phenotypes within the M1-M2 spectrum. Model sensitivity analysis also revealed key molecular nodes and interactions as targets with potential therapeutic values for the pathophysiology of peripheral arterial disease and cancer. Through simulations that dynamically capture the signal integration and phenotypic marker expression in the differential macrophage polarization responses, our model provides an important computational basis toward a more quantitative and network-centric understanding of the complex physiology and versatile functions of macrophages in human diseases.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gN44bEd0UOA" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Adolescent binge drinking is a serious public health concern and a risk factor for alcohol use disorder (AUD) and comorbid anxiety in adulthood. Chromatin remodeling mediated by epigenetic enzymes including lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) due to adolescent alcohol exposure may play a role in adult psychopathology. The mechanism by which adolescent alcohol exposure mechanistically regulates epigenetic reprogramming and behavioral changes in adulthood is unknown. We investigated the role of microRNA-137 (miR-137), which is crucial for normal neurodevelopment and targets LSD1, in adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure-induced anxiety-like and alcohol-drinking behaviors and related epigenetic reprogramming in the amygdala in adulthood. Adolescent rats were exposed to 2g/kg ethanol (2 days on/off; AIE) or intermittent n-saline (AIS) during postnatal days (PND) 28-41 and allowed to grow to adulthood for analysis of behavior, miRNA expression, and epigenetic measures in the amygdala. Interestingly, miR-137 was increased and its target genes <i>Lsd1</i> and <i>Lsd1 + 8a</i> were decreased in the AIE adult amygdala. Infusion of miR-137 antagomir directly into the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) rescues AIE-induced alcohol drinking and anxiety-like behaviors via normalization of decreased <i>Lsd1</i> expression, decreased LSD1 occupancy, and decreased <i>Bdnf IV</i> expression due to increased H3K9 dimethylation in AIE adult rats. Further, concomitant <i>Lsd1</i> siRNA infusion into the CeA prevents the miR-137-mediated reversal of AIE-induced adult anxiety and chromatin remodeling at the <i>Bdnf IV</i> promoter. These novel results highlight miR-137 as a potential therapeutic target for anxiety and AUD susceptibility after adolescent alcohol exposure in adulthood.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Adolescent alcohol exposure is a serious public health problem and contributes to alcohol use and anxiety disorders later in life. In this study, we identify microRNA-137, a small non-coding RNA, in the central nucleus of amygdala (CeA) as a crucial regulator of increased alcohol consumption and anxiety-like behavior in adult rats after adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure. Inhibition of microRNA-137 in the CeA reverses increased alcohol intake and anxiety-like behavior, and this effect is mediated by lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), a microRNA-137 target gene that regulates epigenetic programming. Thus, we have identified microRNA-137 and its target LSD1, in the CeA that play a mechanistic role in the pathogenesis of increased adult anxiety and alcohol consumption after adolescent alcohol exposure.</p>

Abstract<p>Clinical and preclinical studies have shown that ketamine, an NMDA-receptor antagonist, has promising therapeutic value for the treatment of alcohol use disorder (AUD). However, maintenance of remission will ultimately require repeated infusions of ketamine which may lead to abuse potential and may hinder its therapeutic benefits. It is therefore crucial to assess the effects of repeated treatments with ketamine on alcohol intake. Accordingly, this study aimed to examine in both sexes how individual differences in alcohol intake alter ketamine self-administration and how ketamine self-administration will alter subsequent alcohol drinking behaviors. Male and female rats intermittently drank alcohol or water for 10-weeks and were divided into high- or low-alcohol intake groups prior to ketamine self-administration. Rats self-administered ketamine under fixed and progressive ratios schedules of reinforcement from weeks 4-7, and incubation of ketamine craving was examined from weeks 8-10. To investigate structural plasticity in a brain region involved in reward, nucleus accumbens (NAc) dendritic spine morphology was examined. Our results show that high-alcohol intake in male rats attenuated ketamine self-administration whereas in female rats, high-alcohol intake enhanced motivation to self-administer ketamine. Ketamine reduced alcohol intake in high-alcohol male rats but increased it in low-alcohol female rats. Incubation of ketamine craving developed in all groups except low-alcohol females. 3-weeks abstinence from ketamine was associated with increased mushroom spines in all groups except the high-alcohol male group. Overall, these data suggest that ketamine as a treatment for AUD may benefit male but not female subjects and warrants further investigation before use as a therapeutic agent.</p><p><b>Significance statement:</b> Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is one of the most prevalent forms of addiction yet effective treatment options are lacking. Preclinical and clinical data suggest that ketamine is a potential AUD treatment option. Since ketamine is also an addictive drug, we investigated here the relationship between alcohol and ketamine in both sexes and examined morphological changes in nucleus accumbens (NAc) medium spiny neurons, which are involved in mediating addiction related plasticity. We showed clear individual and sex differences in the interactions between alcohol and ketamine, which were reflected with structural plasticity alterations in the NAc of both sexes. Our data suggest that ketamine could be further investigated in humans as a viable treatment for AUD in male but not female subjects.</p>

<p>by Kenneth Barr, John Reinitz, Ovidiu Radulescu</p>

Organisms must ensure that expression of genes is directed to the appropriate tissues at the correct times, while simultaneously ensuring that these gene regulatory systems are robust to perturbation. This idea is captured by a mathematical concept called <i>r</i>-robustness, which says that a system is robust to a perturbation in up to <i>r</i> − 1 randomly chosen parameters. <i>r</i>-robustness implies that the biological system has a small number of sensitive parameters and that this number can be used as a robustness measure. In this work we use this idea to investigate the robustness of gene regulation using a sequence level model of the <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> gene <i>even-skipped</i>. We consider robustness with respect to mutations of the enhancer sequence and with respect to changes of the transcription factor concentrations. We find that gene regulation is <i>r</i>-robust with respect to mutations in the enhancer sequence and identify a number of sensitive nucleotides. In both natural and <i>in silico</i> predicted enhancers, the number of nucleotides that are sensitive to mutation correlates negatively with the length of the sequence, meaning that longer sequences are more robust. The exact degree of robustness obtained is dependent not only on DNA sequence, but also on the local concentration of regulatory factors. We find that gene regulation can be remarkably sensitive to changes in transcription factor concentrations at the boundaries of expression features, while it is robust to perturbation elsewhere.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9RePbJHqLrI" width="1" />

<p>by David M. Alexander, Tonio Ball, Andreas Schulze-Bonhage, Cees van Leeuwen</p>

Predicting future brain signal is highly sought-after, yet difficult to achieve. To predict the future phase of cortical activity at localized ECoG and MEG recording sites, we exploit its predominant, large-scale, spatiotemporal dynamics. The dynamics are extracted from the brain signal through Fourier analysis and principal components analysis (PCA) only, and cast in a data model that predicts future signal at each site and frequency of interest. The dominant eigenvectors of the PCA that map the large-scale patterns of past cortical phase to future ones take the form of smoothly propagating waves over the entire measurement array. In ECoG data from 3 subjects and MEG data from 20 subjects collected during a self-initiated motor task, mean phase prediction errors were as low as 0.5 radians at local sites, surpassing state-of-the-art methods of within-time-series or event-related models. Prediction accuracy was highest in delta to beta bands, depending on the subject, was more accurate during episodes of high global power, but was not strongly dependent on the time-course of the task. Prediction results did not require past data from the to-be-predicted site. Rather, best accuracy depended on the availability in the model of long wavelength information. The utility of large-scale, low spatial frequency traveling waves in predicting future phase activity at local sites allows estimation of the error introduced by failing to account for irreducible trajectories in the activity dynamics.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oV-YJVFdqpw" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>Nicotine exposure during the fetal and neonatal periods [developmental nicotine exposure (DNE)] is associated with ineffective upper airway protective reflexes in infants. This could be explained by desensitized chemoreceptors and/or mechanoreceptors, diminished neuromuscular transmission or altered synaptic transmission among central neurons, as each of these systems depend in part on cholinergic signaling through nicotinic AChRs (nAChRs). Here, we showed that DNE blunts the response of the genioglossus (GG) muscle to nasal airway occlusion in lightly anesthetized rat pups. The GG muscle helps keep the upper airway open and is innervated by hypoglossal motoneurons (XIIMNs). Experiments using the phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparation showed that DNE does not alter transmission across the neuromuscular junction. Accordingly, we used whole cell recordings from XIIMNs in brainstem slices to examine the influence of DNE on glutamatergic synaptic transmission under baseline conditions and in response to an acute nicotine challenge. DNE did not alter excitatory transmission under baseline conditions. Analysis of cumulative probability distributions revealed that acute nicotine challenge of P1–P2 preparations resulted in an increase in the frequency of nicotine-induced glutamatergic inputs to XIIMNs in both control and DNE. By contrast, P3–P5 DNE pups showed a decrease, rather than an increase in frequency. We suggest that this, together with previous studies showing that DNE is associated with a compensatory increase in inhibitory synaptic input to XIIMNs, leads to an excitatory-inhibitory imbalance. This imbalance may contribute to the blunting of airway protective reflexes observed in nicotine exposed animals and human infants.</p>

Abstract
<p>Motion selectivity in primary visual cortex (V1) is approximately separable in orientation, spatial frequency, and temporal frequency ("frequency-separable"). Models for area MT neurons posit that their selectivity arises by combining direction-selective V1 afferents whose tuning is organized around a tilted plane in the frequency domain, specifying a particular direction and speed ("velocity-separable"). This construction explains "pattern direction-selective" MT neurons, which are velocity-selective but relatively invariant to spatial structure, including spatial frequency, texture and shape. We designed a set of experiments to distinguish frequency-separable and velocity-separable models and executed them with single-unit recordings in macaque V1 and MT. Surprisingly, when tested with single drifting gratings, most MT neurons’ responses are fit equally well by models with either form of separability. However, responses to plaids (sums of two moving gratings) tend to be better described as velocity-separable, especially for pattern neurons. We conclude that direction selectivity in MT is primarily computed by summing V1 afferents, but pattern-invariant velocity tuning for complex stimuli may arise from local, recurrent interactions.</p>

Abstract
<p>-Band (4–12 Hz) activities in the frontal cortex have been thought to be a key mechanism of sustained attention and goal-related behaviors, forming a phase-coherent network with task-related sensory cortices for integrated neuronal ensembles. However, recent visual task studies found that selective attention attenuates stimulus-related  power in the visual cortex, suggesting a functional dissociation of cortical  oscillations. To investigate this contradictory behavior of cortical , a visual Go/No-Go task was performed with electroencephalogram (EEG) recording in C57BL/6J mice. During the No-Go period, transient  oscillations were observed in both the frontal and visual cortices, but  oscillations of the two areas were prominent in different trial epochs. By separating trial epochs based on subjects’ short-term performance, we found that frontal  was prominent in good-performance epochs, while visual  was prominent in bad-performance epochs, exhibiting a functional dissociation of cortical  rhythms. Furthermore, the two  rhythms also showed a heterogeneous pattern of phase-amplitude coupling with fast oscillations, reflecting their distinct architecture in underlying neuronal circuitry. Interestingly, in good-performance epochs, where visual  was relatively weak, stronger fronto-visual long-range synchrony and shorter posterior-to-anterior temporal delay were found. These findings highlight a previously overlooked aspect of long-range synchrony between distinct oscillatory entities in the cerebral cortex and provide empirical evidence of a functional dissociation of cortical  rhythms.</p>

Abstract
<p>Premature infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) may be subjected to numerous painful procedures without analgesics. One necessary, though acutely painful, procedure is the use of heel lances to monitor blood composition. The current study examined the acute effects of neonatal pain on maternal behavior as well as amygdalar and hypothalamic activation, and the long-term effects of neonatal pain on later-life anxiety-like behavior, using a rodent model. Neonatal manipulations consisted of either painful needle pricks or non-painful tactile stimulation in subjects’ left plantar paw surface which occurred four times daily during the first week of life [postnatal day (PND)1–PND7]. Additionally, maternal behaviors in manipulated litters were compared against undisturbed litters via scoring of videotaped interactions to examine the long-term effects of pain on dam-pup interactions. Select subjects underwent neonatal brain collection (PND6) and fluorescent <i>in situ</i> hybridization (FISH) for corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and the immediate early gene c-fos. Other subjects were raised to juvenile age (PND24 and PND25) and underwent innate anxiety testing utilizing an elevated plus maze (EPM) protocol. FISH indicated that neonatal pain influenced amygdalar CRH and c-fos expression, predominately in males. No significant increase in c-fos or CRH expression was observed in the hypothalamus. Additionally, neonatal pain altered anxiety behaviors independent of sex, with neonatal pain subjects showing the highest frequency of exploratory behavior. Neonatal manipulations did not alter maternal behaviors. Overall, neonatal pain drives CRH expression and produces behavioral changes in anxiety that persist until the juvenile stage.</p>

Abstract
<p>Drug exposure induces cell and synaptic plasticity within the brain reward pathway that could be a catalyst for progression to addiction. Several cellular adaptations have been described in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a central component of the reward pathway that is the major source of dopamine release. For example, administration of morphine induces long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory synapses on VTA dopamine cells and blocks LTP at inhibitory synapses. Drug-induced synaptic changes have a common endpoint of increasing dopamine cell firing and dopamine release. However, gaining a complete picture of synaptic plasticity in the VTA is hindered by its complex circuitry of efferents and afferents. Most studies of synaptic plasticity in the VTA activated a mixed population of afferents, potentially yielding an incomplete and perhaps misleading view of how drugs of abuse modify VTA synapses. Here, we use midbrain slices from mice and find that electrical stimulation in two different regions induces different forms of plasticity, including two new forms of LTP at inhibitory synapses. High-frequency stimulation (HFS) induces LTP independently of NMDA receptor (NMDAR) activation, and surprisingly, some inhibitory inputs to the VTA also undergo NMDAR-independent LTP after a low-frequency stimulation (LFS) pairing protocol.</p>

Abstract
<p>Designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD)-based chemogenetic tools are extensively used to manipulate neuronal activity in a cell type-specific manner. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings indicate membrane depolarization, coupled with increased neuronal firing rate, following administration of the DREADD ligand, clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) to activate the Gq-coupled DREADD, hM3Dq. Although hM3Dq has been used to enhance neuronal firing in order to manipulate diverse behaviors, often within 30 min to 1 h after CNO administration, the physiological effects on excitatory neurotransmission remain poorly understood. We investigated the influence of CNO-mediated hM3Dq DREADD activation on distinct aspects of hippocampal excitatory neurotransmission at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapse in hippocampal slices derived from mice expressing hM3Dq in Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase α (CamKIIα)-positive excitatory neurons. Our results indicate a clear dose-dependent effect on field EPSP (fEPSP) slope, with no change noted at the lower dose of CNO (1 μM) and a significant, long-term decline in fEPSP slope observed at higher doses (5–20 μM). Further, we noted a robust  burst stimulus (TBS) induced long-term potentiation (LTP) in the presence of the lower CNO (1 μM) dose, which was significantly attenuated at the higher CNO (20 μM) dose. Whole-cell patch-clamp recording revealed both complex dose-dependent regulation of excitability, and spontaneous and evoked activity of CA1 pyramidal neurons in response to hM3Dq activation across CNO concentrations. Our data indicate that CNO-mediated activation of the hM3Dq DREADD results in dose-dependent regulation of excitatory hippocampal neurotransmission and highlight the importance of careful interpretation of behavioral experiments involving chemogenetic manipulation.</p>

Abstract
<p>The role of neuroinflammation in the mechanisms of epilepsy development is important because inflammatory mediators provide tractable targets for intervention. Inflammation is intrinsically involved in the generation of childhood febrile seizures (FSs), and prolonged FS [febrile status epilepticus (FSE)] precedes a large proportion of adult cases of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). As TLE is often refractory to therapy and is associated with serious cognitive and emotional problems, we investigated whether its development can be prevented using anti-inflammatory strategies. Using an immature rat model of FSE [experimental FSE (eFSE)], we administered dexamethasone (DEX), a broad anti-inflammatory agent, over 3 d following eFSE. We assessed eFSE-provoked hippocampal network hyperexcitability by quantifying the presence, frequency, and duration of hippocampal spike series, as these precede and herald the development of TLE-like epilepsy. We tested whether eFSE provoked hippocampal microgliosis, astrocytosis, and proinflammatory cytokine production in male and female rats and investigated blood–brain barrier (BBB) breaches as a potential contributor. We then evaluated whether DEX attenuated these eFSE sequelae. Spike series were not observed in control rats given vehicle or DEX, but occurred in 41.6% of eFSE-vehicle rats, associated with BBB leakage and elevated hippocampal cytokines. eFSE did not induce astrocytosis or microgliosis but provoked BBB disruption in 60% of animals. DEX significantly reduced spike series prevalence (to 7.6%) and frequency, and abrogated eFSE-induced cytokine production and BBB leakage (to 20%). These findings suggest that a short, postinsult intervention with a clinically available anti-inflammatory agent potently attenuates epilepsy-predicting hippocampal hyperexcitability, potentially by minimizing BBB disruption and related neuroinflammation.</p>

<p>Neurotransmitter release relies on an evolutionarily conserved presynaptic machinery. Nonetheless, some proteins occur in certain species and synapses, and are absent in others, indicating that they may have modulatory roles. How such proteins expand the power or versatility of the core release machinery is unclear. The presynaptic protein Mover/TPRGL/SVAP30 is heterogeneously expressed among synapses of the rodent brain, suggesting that it may add special functions to subtypes of presynaptic terminals. Mover is a synaptic vesicle-attached phosphoprotein that binds to Calmodulin and the active zone scaffolding protein Bassoon. Here we use a Mover knockout mouse line to investigate the role of Mover in the hippocampal mossy fiber (MF) to CA3 pyramidal cell synapse and Schaffer collateral to CA1. While Schaffer collateral synapses were unchanged by the knockout, the MFs showed strongly increased facilitation. The effect of Mover knockout in facilitation was both calcium- and age-dependent, having a stronger effect at higher calcium concentrations and in younger animals. Increasing cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels by forskolin equally potentiated both wildtype and knockout MF synapses, but occluded the increased facilitation observed in the knockout. These discoveries suggest that Mover has distinct roles at different synapses. At MF terminals, it acts to constrain the extent of presynaptic facilitation.</p>

<p>In this study, we performed a comprehensive behavioral and anatomical analysis of the Missing in Metastasis (Mtss1/MIM) knockout (KO) mouse brain. We also analyzed the expression of MIM in different brain regions at different ages. MIM is an I-BAR containing membrane curving protein, shown to be involved in dendritic spine initiation and dendritic branching in Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. Behavioral analysis of MIM KO mice revealed defects in both learning and reverse-learning, alterations in anxiety levels and reduced dominant behavior, and confirmed the previously described deficiency in motor coordination and pre-pulse inhibition. Anatomically, we observed enlarged brain ventricles and decreased cortical volume. Although MIM expression was relatively low in hippocampus after early development, hippocampal pyramidal neurons exhibited reduced density of thin and stubby dendritic spines. Learning deficiencies can be connected to all detected anatomical changes. Both behavioral and anatomical findings are typical for schizophrenia mouse models.</p>

<p>Down syndrome (DS), caused by trisomy of chromosome 21, is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability. We recently discovered that green tea extracts containing epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) improve cognition in mice transgenic for Dyrk1a (TgDyrk1A) and in a trisomic DS mouse model (Ts65Dn). Interestingly, paired with cognitive stimulation, green tea has beneficial pro-cognitive effects in DS individuals. Dual Specificity Tyrosine-Phosphorylation-Regulated Kinase 1A (DYRK1A) is a major candidate to explain the cognitive phenotypes of DS, and inhibiting its activity is a promising pro-cognitive therapy. DYRK1A kinase activity can be normalized in the hippocampus of transgenic DYRK1A mice administering green tea extracts, but also submitting the animals to environmental enrichment (EE). However, many other mechanisms could also explain the pro-cognitive effects of green tea extracts and EE. To underpin the overall alterations arising upon DYRK1A overexpression and the molecular processes underneath the pro-cognitive effects, we used quantitative proteomics. We investigated the hippocampal (phospho)proteome in basal conditions and after treatment with a green tea extract containing EGCG and/or EE in TgDyrk1A and control mice. We found that Dyrk1A overexpression alters protein and phosphoprotein levels of key postsynaptic and plasticity-related pathways and that these alterations were rescued upon the cognitive enhancer treatments.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01234">Investigations Into Bioenergetic Neuroprotection of Cone Photoreceptors: Relevance to Retinitis Pigmentosa</a></h4>

<p>Recent studies suggest cone degeneration in retinitis pigmentosa (RP) may result from intracellular energy depletion. We tested the hypothesis that cones die when depleted of energy by examining the effect of two bioenergetic, nutraceutical agents on cone survival. The study had three specific aims: firstly, we, studied the neuroprotective efficacies of glucose and creatine in an in vitro model of RP. Next, we utilized a well-characterized mouse model of RP to examine whether surviving cones, devoid of their inner segments, continue to express genes vital for glucose, and creatine utilization. Finally, we analyzed the neuroprotective properties of glucose and creatine on cone photoreceptors in a mouse model of RP. Two different bioenergy-based therapies were tested in rd1 mice: repeated local delivery of glucose and systemic creatine. Optomotor responses were tested and cone density was quantified on retinal wholemounts. The results showed that glucose supplementation increased survival of cones in culture subjected to mitochondrial stress or oxidative insult. Despite losing their inner segments, surviving cones in the rd1 retina continued to express the various glycolytic enzymes. Following a single subconjunctival injection, the mean vitreous glucose concentration was significantly elevated at 1 and 8 h, but not at 16 h after injection; however, daily subconjunctival injection of glucose neither enhanced spatial visual performance nor slowed cone cell degeneration in rd1 mice relative to isotonic saline. Creatine dose-dependently increased survival of cones in culture subjected to mitochondrial dysfunction, but not to oxidative stress. Despite the loss of their mitochondrial-rich inner segments, cone somas and axonal terminals in the rd1 retina were strongly positive for both the mitochondrial and cytosolic forms of creatine kinase at each time point examined. Creatine-fed rd1 mice displayed enhanced optomotor responses compared to mice fed normal chow. Moreover, cone density was significantly greater in creatine-treated mice compared to controls. The overall results of this study provide tentative support for the hypothesis that creatine supplementation may delay secondary degeneration of cones in individuals with RP.</p>

Background and Purpose<p>Amyloid imaging, gray matter (GM) morphometry and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) have all been used as predictive biomarkers in dementia. Our objective was to define the imaging profile of healthy elderly controls as a function of their cognitive trajectories and explore whether amyloid burden and white matter (WM) microstructure changes are associated with subtle decrement of neuropsychological performances in old age.</p>Materials and Methods<p>We performed a 4.5-year longitudinal study in 133 elderly individuals who underwent cognitive testing at inclusion and follow-up, amyloid PET, MRI including DTI sequences at inclusion, and APOE epsilon 4 genotyping. All cases were assessed using a continuous cognitive score (CCS) taking into account the global evolution of neuropsychological performances. Data processing included region of interest analysis of amyloid PET analysis, GM densities and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS)-DTI. Regression models were built to explore the association between the CCS and imaging parameters controlling for significant demographic and clinical covariates.</p>Results<p>Amyloid uptake was not related to the cognitive outcome. In contrast, GM densities in bilateral hippocampus were associated with worst CCS at follow-up. In addition, radial and axial diffusivities in left hippocampus were negatively associated with CCS. Amyloid load was associated with decreased VBM and increased radial and axial diffusivity in the same area. These associations persisted when adjusting for gender and APOE4 genotype. Importantly, they were absent in amygdala and neocortical areas studied.</p>Conclusion<p>The progressive decrement of neuropsychological performances in normal aging is associated with volume loss and WM microstructure changes in hippocampus long before the emergence of clinically overt symptoms. Higher amyloid load in hippocampus is compatible with cognitive preservation in cases with better preservation of GM densities and WM microstructure in this area.</p>

<p>Background: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has previously been reported to improve facets of upper limb motor performance such as accuracy and strength. However, the magnitude of motor performance improvement has not been reviewed by contemporaneous systematic review or meta-analysis of sham vs. active tDCS.</p><p>Objective: To systematically review and meta-analyse the existing evidence regarding the benefits of tDCS on upper limb motor performance in healthy adults.</p><p>Methods: A systematic search was conducted to obtain relevant articles from three databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO) yielding 3,200 abstracts. Following independent assessment by two reviewers, a total of 86 articles were included for review, of which 37 were deemed suitable for meta-analysis.</p><p>Results: Meta-analyses were performed for four outcome measures, namely: reaction time (RT), execution time (ET), time to task failure (TTF), and force. Further qualitative review was performed for accuracy and error. Statistically significant improvements in RT (effect size −0.01; 95% CI −0.02 to 0.001, p = 0.03) and ET (effect size −0.03; 95% CI −0.05 to −0.01, p = 0.017) were demonstrated compared to sham. In exercise tasks, increased force (effect size 0.10; 95% CI 0.08 to 0.13, p &lt; 0.001) and a trend towards improved TTF was also observed.</p><p>Conclusions: This meta-analysis provides evidence attesting to the impact of tDCS on upper limb motor performance in healthy adults. Improved performance is demonstrable in reaction time, task completion time, elbow flexion tasks and accuracy. Considerable heterogeneity exists amongst the literature, further confirming the need for a standardised approach to reporting tDCS studies.</p>

<p>Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have achieved great success for image classification in medical research. Deep learning with brain imaging is the imaging method of choice for the diagnosis and prediction of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, it is also well known that DCNNs are “black boxes” owing to their low interpretability to humans. The lack of transparency of deep learning compromises its application to the prediction and mechanism investigation in AD. To overcome this limitation, we develop a novel general framework that integrates deep leaning, feature selection, causal inference, and genetic-imaging data analysis for predicting and understanding AD. The proposed algorithm not only improves the prediction accuracy but also identifies the brain regions underlying the development of AD and causal paths from genetic variants to AD via image mediation. The proposed algorithm is applied to the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in 151 subjects (51 AD and 100 non-AD) who were measured at four time points of baseline, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months. The algorithm identified brain regions underlying AD consisting of the temporal lobes (including the hippocampus) and the ventricular system.</p>

<p>Maintaining the homeostasis of proteins (proteostasis) by controlling their synthesis, folding and degradation is a central task of cells and tissues. The gradual decline of the capacity of the various proteostasis machineries, frequently in combination with their overload through mutated, aggregation-prone proteins, is increasingly recognized as an important catalyst of age-dependent pathologies in the brain, most prominently neurodegenerative disorders. A dysfunctional proteostasis might also contribute to neurovascular disease as indicated by the occurrence of excessive protein accumulation or massive extracellular matrix expansion within vessel walls in conditions such as cerebral small vessel disease (SVD), a major cause of ischemic stroke, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Recent advances in brain vessel isolation techniques and mass spectrometry methodology have facilitated the analysis of cerebrovascular proteomes and fueled efforts to determine the proteomic signatures associated with neurovascular disease. In several studies in humans and mice considerable differences between healthy and diseased vessel proteomes were observed, emphasizing the critical contribution of an impaired proteostasis to disease pathogenesis. These findings highlight the important role of a balanced proteostasis for cerebrovascular health.</p>

<p>In this paper, we evaluate the computational performance of the GEneral NEural SImulation System (GENESIS) for large scale simulations of neural networks. While many benchmark studies have been performed for large scale simulations with leaky integrate-and-fire neurons or neuronal models with only a few compartments, this work focuses on higher fidelity neuronal models represented by 50–74 compartments per neuron. After making some modifications to the source code for GENESIS and its parallel implementation, PGENESIS, particularly to improve memory usage, we find that PGENESIS is able to efficiently scale on supercomputing resources to network sizes as large as 9 × 10<sup>6</sup> neurons with 18 × 10<sup>9</sup> synapses and 2.2 × 10<sup>6</sup> neurons with 45 × 10<sup>9</sup> synapses. The modifications to GENESIS that enabled these large scale simulations have been incorporated into the May 2019 Official Release of PGENESIS 2.4 available for download from the GENESIS web site (genesis-sim.org).</p>

<p>Our perception of the world is governed by a combination of bottom-up sensory and top-down cognitive processes. This often begs the question whether a perceptual phenomenon originates from sensory or cognitive processes in the brain. For instance, reference repulsion, a compelling visual illusion in which the subjective estimates about the direction of a motion stimulus are biased away from a reference boundary, is previously thought to be originated at the sensory level. Recent studies, however, suggest that the misperception is not sensory in nature but rather reflects post-perceptual cognitive biases. Here I challenge the post-perceptual interpretations on both empirical and conceptual grounds. I argue that these new findings are not incompatible with the sensory account and can be more parsimoniously explained as reflecting the consequences of motion representations in different reference frames. Finally, I will propose one concrete experiment with testable predictions to shed more insights on the sensory vs. cognitive nature of this visual illusion.</p>

<p>Adaptive training and workload management have the potential to drastically change safety and productivity in high-risk fields—including, air-traffic control, missile defense, and nuclear power-plant operations. Quantifying and classifying cognitive load is important for optimal performance. Brain-based metrics have previously been associated with mental workload. Specifically, attenuation of prefrontal activity has been linked to cognitive overload, a cognitive load state associated with degraded task performance. We hypothesized that a similar nonlinearity would be observed for cognitive underload. When underload and overload effects are combined, they should form a cubic function in lateral prefrontal cortex as a function of working memory load. The first of two studies assessed the relationships between spatial working memory load with subjective, behavioral and hemodynamic measures. A cubic function was observed in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (LDLPFC; Brodmann’s Area 46) relating working memory load to changes in oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO). The second, two-part study tested the effects of workload transitions to different cognitive load states. Part-one replicated the effects observed in study one and identified transition points for individual performers. Part-two assessed the effects of transitioning to different cognitive load states. Cognitive load state transitions caused a deviation between behavioral measures and induced a significant change in the cubic function relating LDLPFC HbO and working memory load. From these observations, we present a hypothesis associating workload transitions with the disruption of cognitive process integration.</p>

<p>Structural and metabolic connectivity are advanced features that facilitate the diagnosis of patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Connectivity from a single imaging modality, however, did not show evident discriminative value in predicting MCI-to-AD conversion, possibly because the inter-modal information was not considered when quantifying the relationship between brain regions. Here we introduce a novel approach that extracts connectivity based on both structural and metabolic information to improve AD early diagnosis. Principal component analysis was performed on each imaging modality to extract the key discriminative patterns of each brain region in an independent auxiliary domain composed of AD and normal control (NC) subjects, which were then used to project the two subtypes of MCI to the low-dimensional space. The connectivity between each target brain region and all other regions was quantified via a multi-task regression model using the projected data. The prediction performance was evaluated in 75 stable MCI (sMCI) patients and 51 progressive MCI (pMCI) patients who converted to AD within 3 years. We achieved 79.37% accuracy, with 74.51% sensitivity and 82.67% specificity, in predicting MCI-to-AD progression, superior to other existing algorithms using either structural and metabolic connectivities alone or a combination thereof. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-modal connectivity, serving as robust biomarker for early AD diagnosis.</p>

<p>There exist two major types of striatum-targeting neocortical neurons, specifically, intratelencephalic (IT) neurons and pyramidal-tract (PT) neurons. Regarding their striatal projections, it was once suggested that IT axons are extended whereas PT axons are primarily focal. However, subsequent study with an increased number of well-stained extended axons concluded that such an apparent distinction was spurious due to limited sample size. Recent work using genetically labeled neurons reintroduced the differential spatial extent of the striatal projections of IT and PT neurons through population-level analyses, complemented by observations of single axons. However, quantitative IT vs. PT comparison of a large number of axons remained to be conducted. We analyzed the data of axonal end-points of 161 IT neurons and 33 PT neurons in the MouseLight database (http://ml-neuronbrowser.janelia.org/). The number of axonal end-points in the ipsilateral striatum exhibits roughly monotonically decreasing distributions in both neuron types. Excluding neurons with no ipsilateral end-point, the distributions of the logarithm of the number of ipsilateral end-points are considerably overlapped between IT and PT neurons, although the proportion of neurons having more than 50 ipsilateral end-points is somewhat larger in IT neurons than in PT neurons. Looking at more details, among IT subpopulations in the secondary motor area (MOs), layer 5 neurons and bilateral striatum-targeting layer 2/3 neurons, but not contralateral striatum-non-targeting layer 2/3 neurons, have a larger number of ipsilateral end-points than MOs PT neurons. We also found that IT ipsilateral striatal axonal end-points are on average more widely distributed than PT end-points, especially in the medial-lateral direction. These results indicate that IT and PT striatal axons differ in the frequencies and spatial extent of end-points while there are wide varieties within each neuron type.</p>

<p>Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder characterized by recurrent and unprovoked seizures thought to arise from impaired balance between neuronal excitation and inhibition. Our understanding of the neurophysiological mechanisms that render the brain epileptogenic remains incomplete, reflected by the lack of satisfactory treatments that can effectively prevent epileptic seizures without significant drug-related adverse effects. Type 2 K<sup>+</sup>-Cl<sup>−</sup> cotransporter (KCC2), encoded by SLC12A5, is important for chloride homeostasis and neuronal excitability. KCC2 dysfunction attenuates Cl<sup>−</sup> extrusion and impairs GABAergic inhibition, and can lead to neuronal hyperexcitability. Converging lines of evidence from human genetics have secured the link between KCC2 dysfunction and the development of epilepsy. Here, we review KCC2 mutations in human epilepsy and discuss potential therapeutic strategies based on the functional impact of these mutations. We suggest that a strategy of augmenting KCC2 activity by antagonizing its critical inhibitory phosphorylation sites may be a particularly efficacious method of facilitating Cl<sup>−</sup> extrusion and restoring GABA inhibition to treat medication-refractory epilepsy and other seizure disorders.</p>

<p>The ability to control balance during activities of daily living (ADL) is impaired in older adults as a result of deterioration in the sensory systems (i.e., vestibular, visual, somatosensory), the cognitive system (central nervous system), and the musculoskeletal system. Consequently, many older adults face a risk of falling during their ADL. In most cases, falls and related injuries impair the quality of life and result in physical limitations, anxiety, loss of confidence, and fear of falling. Among a variety of fall prevention interventions, adapted physical activity programs have been suggested for improving balance control during ADL. These programs challenge the sensory, cognitive, and musculoskeletal systems while addressing balance constraints such as orientation in space, changes in direction, and the speed or height of the center of mass during static and dynamic situations resembling ADL. The above-mentioned elements can be dealt with through a combination of balance and coordination exercises that challenge the postural control systems in multiple dimensions—including vertical and horizontal changes of the center of mass, standing on unstable surfaces with a reduced base of support, and changing body directions. Consequently, such exercises require environmental information-processing. The combination of dual-task, function-oriented challenges while controlling balance stimulates the sensory and neuromuscular control mechanisms. Among older adults, these programs have been found to improve static and dynamic stability, as well as a number of aspects in the quality of life. Recently, they have also been found to improve cognitive functions such as memory and spatial cognition.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00317">Dreaming of a New World Where Alzheimer’s Is a Treatable Disorder</a></h4>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. It’s a chronic and untreatable neurodegenerative disease with irreversible progression and has important social and economic implications in terms of direct medical and social care costs. Despite prolonged and expensive efforts employed by the scientific community over the last few decades, no effective treatments are still available for patients, and the development of disease-modifying drugs is now a really urgent need. The recent failure of clinical trials based on the immunotherapeutic approach against amyloid-β(Aβ) protein questioned the validity of the “amyloid cascade hypothesis” as the molecular machinery causing the disease. Indeed, most attempts to design effective treatments for AD have been based until now on molecular targets suggested to be implicated in AD pathogenesis by the amyloid cascade hypothesis. However, mounting evidence from scientific literature supports the view of AD as a multifactorial disease that results from the concomitant action of multiple molecular players. This view, together with the lack of success of the disease-modifying single-target approaches, strongly suggests that AD drug design needs to be shifted towards multi-targeted compounds or drug combinations acting synergistically on the main core features of disease pathogenesis. The discovery of drug candidates targeting multiple factors involved in AD would greatly improve drug development. So, it is reasonable that upcoming strategies for the design of preventive and/or therapeutic agents for AD point to a multi-pronged approach including more than one druggable target to definitely defeat the disease.</p>

<p>The degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in Parkinson’s disease (PD) is related to inflammation and oxidative stress. Anti-inflammatory agents could reduce the risk or slow the progression of PD. Catalpol, an iridoid glycoside extracted from the roots of Rehmannia radix, has been reported to reduce the release of inflammatory factors and exert neuroprotective effects. 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated mice were used as the PD model and the roles of catalpol on DA neurons and its potential mechanism were investigated in this study. We found that catalpol administration mitigated the loss of DA neurons induced by MPTP and increased exploratory behavior along with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression, which was accompanied by astrocyte and microglia activation. Importantly, catalpol administration significantly inhibited MPTP-triggered oxidative stress, restored growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels. Further, we found that catalpol suppressed the activation of MKK4/JNK/c-Jun signaling, and reduced the pro-inflammatory factors and inflammasome in the mouse model of PD. Our results suggest that catalpol relieves MPTP-triggered oxidative stress, which may benefit to avoid the occurrence of chronic inflammatory reaction. Catalpol alleviates MPTP-triggered oxidative stress and thereby prevents neurodegenerative diseases-related inflammatory reaction, highlighting its therapeutic potential for the management of PD symptoms.</p>

<p>Research indicates that after advanced age, the major risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is female sex. Out of every three AD patients, two are females with postmenopausal women contributing to over 60% of all those affected. Sex- and gender-related differences in AD have been widely researched and several emerging lines of evidence point to different vulnerabilities that contribute to dementia risk. Among those being considered, it is becoming widely accepted that gonadal steroids contribute to the gender disparity in AD, as evidenced by the “estrogen hypothesis.” This posits that sex hormones, 17β-estradiol in particular, exert a neuroprotective effect by shielding females’ brains from disease development. This theory is further supported by recent findings that the onset of menopause is associated with the emergence of AD-related brain changes in women in contrast to men of the same age. In this review, we discuss genetic, medical, societal, and lifestyle risk factors known to increase AD risk differently between the genders, with a focus on the role of hormonal changes, particularly declines in 17β-estradiol during the menopause transition (MT) as key underlying mechanisms.</p>

<p>Although lipopolysaccharides (LPS) have been used to establish animal models of memory loss akin to what is observed in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the exact mechanisms involved have not been substantiated. In this study, we established an animal model of learning and memory impairment induced by LPS and explored the biological processes and pathways involved. Mice were continuously intraperitoneally injected with LPS for 7 days. Learning- and memory-related behavioral performance and the pathological processes involved were assessed using the Morris water maze test and immunostaining, respectively. We detected comprehensive expression of C1q, C3, microglia, and their regulatory cytokines in the hippocampus. After 7 days of LPS administration, we were able to observe LPS-induced learning and memory impairment in the mice, which was attributed to neural impairment and synapse loss in the hippocampus. We elucidated that the immune system was activated, with the classical complement pathway and microglial phagocytosis being involved in the synapse loss. This study demonstrates that an LPS-injected mouse can serve as an early memory impairment model for studies on anti-AD drugs.</p>

<p>by Julijana Gjorgjieva, Markus Meister, Haim Sompolinsky</p>

In many sensory systems the neural signal is coded by the coordinated response of heterogeneous populations of neurons. What computational benefit does this diversity confer on information processing? We derive an efficient coding framework assuming that neurons have evolved to communicate signals optimally given natural stimulus statistics and metabolic constraints. Incorporating nonlinearities and realistic noise, we study optimal population coding of the same sensory variable using two measures: maximizing the mutual information between stimuli and responses, and minimizing the error incurred by the optimal linear decoder of responses. Our theory is applied to a commonly observed splitting of sensory neurons into ON and OFF that signal stimulus increases or decreases, and to populations of monotonically increasing responses of the same type, ON. Depending on the optimality measure, we make different predictions about how to optimally split a population into ON and OFF, and how to allocate the firing thresholds of individual neurons given realistic stimulus distributions and noise, which accord with certain biases observed experimentally.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FDosLGxlm1Q" width="1" />

<p>by Elmar D. Grosskurth, Dominik R. Bach, Marcos Economides, Quentin J. M. Huys, Lisa Holper</p>

Human decisions can be habitual or goal-directed, also known as model-free (MF) or model-based (MB) control. Previous work suggests that the balance between the two decision systems is impaired in psychiatric disorders such as compulsion and addiction, via overreliance on MF control. However, little is known whether the balance can be altered through task training. Here, 20 healthy participants performed a well-established two-step task that differentiates MB from MF control, across five training sessions. We used computational modelling and functional near-infrared spectroscopy to assess changes in decision-making and brain hemodynamic over time. Mixed-effects modelling revealed overall no substantial changes in MF and MB behavior across training. Although our behavioral and brain findings show task-induced changes in learning rates, these parameters have no direct relation to either MF or MB control or the balance between the two systems, and thus do not support the assumption of training effects on MF or MB strategies. Our findings indicate that training on the two-step paradigm in its current form does not support a shift in the balance between MF and MB control. We discuss these results with respect to implications for restoring the balance between MF and MB control in psychiatric conditions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/eKPfhfz7iQA" width="1" />

<p>by Oliver W. Layton, D. C. Niehorster</p>

Many everyday interactions with moving objects benefit from an accurate perception of their movement. Self-motion, however, complicates object motion perception because it generates a global pattern of motion on the observer’s retina and radically influences an object’s retinal motion. There is strong evidence that the brain compensates by suppressing the retinal motion due to self-motion, however, this requires estimates of depth relative to the object—otherwise the appropriate self-motion component to remove cannot be determined. The underlying neural mechanisms are unknown, but neurons in brain areas MT and MST may contribute given their sensitivity to motion parallax and depth through joint direction, speed, and disparity tuning. We developed a neural model to investigate whether cells in areas MT and MST with well-established neurophysiological properties can account for human object motion judgments during self-motion. We tested the model by comparing simulated object motion signals to human object motion judgments in environments with monocular, binocular, and ambiguous depth. Our simulations show how precise depth information, such as that from binocular disparity, may improve estimates of the retinal motion pattern due the self-motion through increased selectivity among units that respond to the global self-motion pattern. The enhanced self-motion estimates emerged from recurrent feedback connections in MST and allowed the model to better suppress the appropriate direction, speed, and disparity signals from the object’s retinal motion, improving the accuracy of the object’s movement direction represented by motion signals.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lJtvW-z2TQA" width="1" />

Origin and functions of intermittent transitions among sleep stages, including short awakenings and arousals, constitute a challenge to the current homeostatic framework for sleep regulation, focusing on factors modulating sleep over large time scales. Here we propose that the complex micro-architecture characterizing the sleep-wake cycle results from an underlying non-equilibrium critical dynamics, bridging collective behaviors across spatio-temporal scales. We investigate <i>θ</i> and <i>δ</i> wave dynamics in control rats and in rats with lesions of sleep-promoting neurons in the parafacial zone. We demonstrate that intermittent bursts in <i>θ</i> and <i>δ</i> rhythms exhibit a complex temporal organization, with long-range power-law correlations and a robust duality of power law (<i>θ</i>-bursts, active phase) and exponential-like (<i>δ</i>-bursts, quiescent phase) duration distributions, typical features of non-equilibrium systems self-organizing at criticality. Crucially, such temporal organization relates to anti-correlated coupling between <i>θ</i>- and <i>δ</i>-bursts, and is independent of the dominant physiologic state and lesions, a solid indication of a basic principle in sleep dynamics.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/C9mDoTk7BgQ" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00069">Activation of Brainstem Neurons During Mesencephalic Locomotor Region-Evoked Locomotion in the Cat</a></h4>

<p>The distribution of locomotor-activated neurons in the brainstem of the cat was studied by c-Fos immunohistochemistry in combination with antibody-based cellular phenotyping following electrical stimulation of the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) – the anatomical constituents of which remain debated today, primarily between the cuneiform (CnF) and the pedunculopontine tegmental nuclei (PPT). Effective MLR sites were co-extensive with the CnF nucleus. Animals subject to the locomotor task showed abundant Fos labeling in the CnF, parabrachial nuclei of the subcuneiform region, periaqueductal gray, locus ceruleus (LC)/subceruleus (SubC), Kölliker–Fuse, magnocellular and lateral tegmental fields, raphe, and the parapyramidal region. Labeled neurons were more abundant on the side of stimulation. In some animals, Fos-labeled cells were also observed in the ventral tegmental area, medial and intermediate vestibular nuclei, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, n. tractus solitarii, and retrofacial nucleus in the ventrolateral medulla. Many neurons in the reticular formation were innervated by serotonergic fibers. Numerous locomotor-activated neurons in the parabrachial nuclei and LC/SubC/Kölliker–Fuse were noradrenergic. Few cholinergic neurons within the PPT stained for Fos. In the medulla, serotonergic neurons within the parapyramidal region and the nucleus raphe magnus were positive for Fos. Control animals, not subject to locomotion, showed few Fos-labeled neurons in these areas. The current study provides positive evidence for a role for the CnF in the initiation of locomotion while providing little evidence for the participation of the PPT. The results also show that MLR-evoked locomotion involves the parallel activation of reticular and monoaminergic neurons in the pons/medulla, and provides the anatomical and functional basis for spinal monoamine release during evoked locomotion. Lastly, the results indicate that vestibular, cardiovascular, and respiratory centers are centrally activated during MLR-evoked locomotion. Altogether, the results show a complex pattern of neuromodulatory influences of brainstem neurons by electrical activation of the MLR.</p>

<p>The brain is a genomic mosaic. Cell-to-cell genomic differences, which are the result of somatic mutations during development and aging, contribute to cellular diversity in the nervous system. This genomic diversity has important implications for nervous system development, function, and disease. Brain somatic mosaicism might contribute to individualized behavioral phenotypes and has been associated with several neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, understanding the causes and consequences of somatic mosaicism in neural circuits is of great interest. Recent advances in 3D cell culture technology have provided new means to study human organ development and various human pathologies in vitro. Cerebral organoids (“mini-brains”) are pluripotent stem cell-derived 3D culture systems that recapitulate, to some extent, the developmental processes and organization of the developing human brain. Here, I discuss the application of these neural organoids for modeling brain somatic mosaicism in a lab dish. Special emphasis is given to the potential role of microglial mutations in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

Objective<p>The objective of this study is to observe the effects of mild mechanical stimulation on acupuncture points of spinal motor neurons and active substances of sciatic nerve injury in rats, and to explore the morphological basis for the recovery of motor function in rats with sciatic nerve injury, using mild acupuncture. Acupuncture in the local area of injury may cause further damage to the peripheral nerve injury. We believe that mild mechanical stimulation on the surface, using some specific acupuncture points can also have a positive effect on nerve repair. This method, called Chinese tuina, has existed for more than 2,000 years in China.</p>Methods<p>This study establishes a rat model using sciatic nerve crush injury. Rats received Chinese tuina in accordance with the principle of the three methods and three points, once a day, for 20 days. The rats’ status of hindlimb recovery was detected by a sciatic functional index. The labeled neuronal cell body was used to evaluate the fiber recovery after the rats’ sciatic nerve injury, using a neural tracing technique. Our team studied motor neuronal cell bodies, CGRP-positive cells, and the microglia of damaged sciatic nerves which were stained with fluorescent triple staining, adopting a confocal multi-layer scanning technique, and then the changes in neuronal activity distribution and expression, and changes of time and treatment were described, using the method of morphological description.</p>Results<p>Sciatic nerve injury decreased the survival rate of motor neurons, affected CGRP-positive cells, and activated microglia in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. Compared with the model group, the survival of spinal ventral horn motor neurons was increased through tuina intervention. The swelling of CGRP-positive cells was alleviated, and the degree of microglia activation was less than that of the model group.</p>Conclusion<p>This study used visual morphological findings to assess changes in neurons and active substances with time after injury of the peripheral nerve, and demonstrated that peripheral mild acupuncture intervention improved the capacity of neurofibrillary axoplasmic transport, regulated microglia activation, and significantly promoted the recovery of sciatic nerve injury.</p>

<p>As the number of older adults increases, the prevalence of dementias, such as Alzheimer’s dementia (AD), vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, and frontotemporal dementias, also increases. Despite research into pharmacological approaches for treating diverse diseases, there is still no cure. Recently, novel non-pharmacological interventions are attracting attention. Non-pharmacological approaches include cognitive stimulation, alterations in diet, physical activity, and social engagement. Cognitive stimulating activities protect against the negative effects of cognitive decline caused by age-related neurogenerative diseases. Bilingualism is one form of cognitive stimulation that requires multiple aspects of brain activity and has been shown to delay the onset of dementia symptoms in patients by approximately 4–5 years as compared with monolingual patients through cognitive reserve. The purpose of this review was to bilingualism protects against cognitive decline associated with AD and other dementias. We discuss potential underlying neurological mechanisms, including: (1) stimulating adult neurogenesis, (2) enhancing synaptogenesis, (3) strengthening functional connectivity that bilingualism may delay clinical AD symptoms, (4) protecting white matter integrity, and (5) preserving gray matter density.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01215">Unfolding the Effects of Acute Cardiovascular Exercise on Neural Correlates of Motor Learning Using Convolutional Neural Networks</a></h4>

<p>Cardiovascular exercise is known to promote the consolidation of newly acquired motor skills. Previous studies seeking to understand the neural correlates underlying motor memory consolidation that is modulated by exercise, have relied so far on using traditional statistical approaches for a priori selected features from neuroimaging data, including EEG. With recent advances in machine learning, data-driven techniques such as deep learning have shown great potential for EEG data decoding for brain-computer interfaces, but have not been explored in the context of exercise. Here, we present a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based pipeline for analysis of EEG data to study the brain areas and spectral EEG measures modulated by exercise. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first one to demonstrate the ability of CNNs to be trained in a limited sample size setting. Our approach revealed discriminative spectral features within a refined frequency band (27–29 Hz) as compared to the wider beta bandwidth (15–30 Hz), which is commonly used in data analyses, as well as corresponding brain regions that were modulated by exercise. These results indicate the presence of finer EEG spectral features that could have been overlooked using conventional hypothesis-driven statistical approaches. Our study thus demonstrates the feasibility of using deep network architectures for neuroimaging analysis, even in small-scale studies, to identify robust brain biomarkers and investigate neuroscience-based questions.</p>

<p>Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) is emerging as a robust treatment alternative for major depressive disorder, with a potential for achieving higher remission rates by providing targeted stimulation to underlying brain networks, such as the salience network (SN). Growing evidence suggests that these therapeutic effects are dependent on the frequency and phase synchrony between SN oscillations and stimulation as well as the task-specific state of the SN during stimulation. However, the development of phase-synchronized non-invasive stimulation has proved challenging until recently. Here, we use a phase-locked pulsed brain stimulation approach to study the effects of two NIBS methods: transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) versus phase-locked transcranial pulsed current stimulation (tPCS), on the SN during an SN activating task. 20 healthy volunteers participated in the study. Each volunteer partook in four sessions, receiving one stimulation type at random (theta-tACS, peak tPCS, trough tPCS or sham) while undergoing a learning game, followed by an unstimulated test based on learned material. Each session lasted approximately 1.5 h, with an interval of at least 2 days to allow for washout and to avoid cross-over effects. Our results showed no statistically significant effect of stimulation on the event related potential (ERP) recordings, resting electroencephalogram (EEG), and the performance of the volunteers. While stimulation effects were not apparent in this study, the nominal performance of the phase-locking algorithm offers a technical foundation for further research in determining effective stimulation paradigms and conditions. Specifically, future work should investigate stronger stimulation and true task-specific stimulation of SN nodes responsible for the task as well as their recording. If refined, NIBS could offer an effective, homebased treatment option.</p>

<p>This study investigated the experience of open and closed motor skills on modulating proactive and reactive control processes in task switching. Fifty-four participants who were open-skilled (n = 18) or closed-skilled athletes (n = 18) or non-athletic adults (n = 18) completed a cued task-switching paradigm task. This task tapped into proactive or reactive controls of executive functions under different validity conditions. Electroencephalograms of the participants were captured during the task. In the 100% validity condition, the open-skilled participants showed significantly lower switch cost of response time than the closed-skilled and control participants. Results showed that the open-skilled participants had less positive-going parietal cue-locked P3 in the switch than repeat trials. Participants in the control group showed more positive-going cue-locked P3 in the switch than repeat trials, whereas the closed-skilled participants had no significant differences between the two types of trials. In the 50% validity condition, the open- and closed-skilled participants had less switch cost of response time than the control participants. Participants in the open- and closed-skilled groups showed less positive-going parietal stimulus-locked P3 in the switch than repeat trials, which was not the case for those in the control group. Our findings confirm the dissociation between proactive and reactive controls in relation to their modulations by the different motor-skill experiences. Both proactive and reactive controls of executive functions could be strengthened by exposing individuals to anticipatory or non-anticipatory enriched environments, suggesting proactive and reactive controls involved in motor-skill development seem to be transferable to domain-general executive functions.</p>

<p>With the recent surge of affordable, high-performance virtual reality (VR) headsets, there is unlimited potential for applications ranging from education, to training, to entertainment, to fitness and beyond. As these interfaces continue to evolve, passive user-state monitoring can play a key role in expanding the immersive VR experience, and tracking activity for user well-being. By recording physiological signals such as the electroencephalogram (EEG) during use of a VR device, the user's interactions in the virtual environment could be adapted in real-time based on the user's cognitive state. Current VR headsets provide a logical, convenient, and unobtrusive framework for mounting EEG sensors. The present study evaluates the feasibility of passively monitoring cognitive workload via EEG while performing a classical n-back task in an interactive VR environment. Data were collected from 15 participants and the spatio-spectral EEG features were analyzed with respect to task performance. The results indicate that scalp measurements of electrical activity can effectively discriminate three workload levels, even after suppression of a co-varying high-frequency activity.</p>

<p>In this EEG study, we used pre-registered and exploratory ERP and time-frequency analyses to investigate the resolution of anaphoric and non-anaphoric noun phrases during discourse comprehension. Participants listened to story contexts that described two antecedents, and subsequently read a target sentence with a critical noun phrase that lexically matched one antecedent (‘old’), matched two antecedents (‘ambiguous’), partially matched one antecedent in terms of semantic features (‘partial-match’), or introduced another referent (non-anaphoric, ‘new’). After each target sentence, participants judged whether the noun referred back to an antecedent (i.e., an ‘old/new’ judgment), which was easiest for ambiguous nouns and hardest for partially matching nouns. The noun-elicited N400 ERP component demonstrated initial sensitivity to repetition and semantic overlap, corresponding to repetition and semantic priming effects, respectively. New and partially matching nouns both elicited a subsequent frontal positivity, which suggested that partially matching anaphors may have been processed as new nouns temporarily. ERPs in an even later time window and ERPs time-locked to sentence-final words suggested that new and partially matching nouns had different effects on comprehension, with partially matching nouns incurring additional processing costs up to the end of the sentence. In contrast to the ERP results, the time-frequency results primarily demonstrated sensitivity to noun repetition, and did not differentiate partially matching anaphors from new nouns. In sum, our results show the ERP and time-frequency effects of referent repetition during discourse comprehension, and demonstrate the potentially demanding nature of establishing the anaphoric meaning of a novel noun.</p>

<p>The neurophysiological mechanisms underlying motor and language difficulties in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are still largely unclear. The present work investigates biological indicators of sound processing, (action-) semantic understanding and predictive coding and their correlation with clinical symptoms of ASD. Twenty-two adults with high-functioning ASD and 25 typically developed (TD) participants engaged in an auditory, passive listening, Mismatch Negativity (MMN) task while high-density electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. Action and non-action words were presented in the context of sounds, which were either semantically congruent with regard to the body part they relate to or semantically incongruent or unrelated. The anticipatory activity before sound onset, the Prediction Potential (PP), was significantly reduced in the ASD group specifically for action, but not for non-action sounds. The early-MMN-like responses to words (latency: 120 ms) were differentially modulated across groups: controls showed larger amplitudes for words in action-sound compared to non-action contexts, whereas ASD participants demonstrated enlarged early-MMN-like responses only in a pure tone context, with no other modulation dependent on action sound context. Late-MMN-like responses around 560 ms post-stimulus onset revealed body-part-congruent action-semantic priming for words in control participants, but not in the ASD group. Importantly, neurophysiological indices of semantic priming in ASD participants correlated with the extent of autistic traits as revealed by the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ). The data suggest that high-functioning adults with ASD show a specific deficit in semantic processing and predictive coding of sounds and words related to action, which is absent for neutral, non-action, sounds.</p>

<p>Phonological awareness skills in children with reading difficulty (RD) may reflect impaired automatic integration of orthographic and phonological representations. However, little is known about the underlying neural mechanisms involved in phonological awareness for children with RD. Eighteen children with RD, ages 9–13, participated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study designed to assess the relationship of two constructs of phonological awareness, phoneme synthesis, and phoneme analysis, with crossmodal rhyme judgment. Participants completed a rhyme judgment task presented in two modality conditions; unimodal auditory only and crossmodal audiovisual. Measures of phonological awareness were correlated with unimodal, but not crossmodal, lexical processing. Moreover, these relationships were found only in unisensory brain regions, and not in multisensory brain areas. The results of this study suggest that children with RD rely on unimodal representations and unisensory brain areas, and provide insight into the role of phonemic awareness in mapping between auditory and visual modalities during literacy acquisition.</p>

<p>Dysfunctional processing of auditory sensory gating has generally been found in schizophrenic patients and ultra-high-risk (UHR) individuals. The aim of the study was to investigate the differences of functional interaction between brain regions and performance during the P50 sensory gating in UHR group compared with those in first-episode schizophrenia patients (FESZ) and healthy controls (HC) groups. The study included 128-channel scalp Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings during the P50 auditory paradigm for 35 unmedicated FESZ, 30 drug-free UHR, and 40 HC. Cortical sources of scalp electrical activity were recomputed using exact low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA), and functional brain networks were built at the source level and compared between the groups (FESZ, UHR, HC). A classifier using decision tree was designed for differentiating the three groups, which uses demographic characteristics, MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery parameters, behavioral features in P50 paradigm, and the measures of functional brain networks based on graph theory during P50 sensory gating. The results showed that very few brain connectivities were significantly different between FESZ and UHR groups during P50 sensory gating, and that a large number of brain connectivities were significantly different between FESZ and HC groups and between UHR and HC groups. Furthermore, the FESZ group had a stronger connection in the right superior frontal gyrus and right insula than the HC group. And the UHR group had an enhanced connection in the paracentral lobule and the middle temporal gyrus compared with the HC group. Moreover, comparison of classification analysis results showed that brain network metrics during P50 sensory gating can improve the accuracy of the classification for FESZ, UHR and HC groups. Our findings provide insight into the mechanisms of P50 suppression in schizophrenia and could potentially improve the performance of early identification and diagnosis of schizophrenia for the earliest intervention.</p>

<p>The amygdala is an important center of fear learning and memory and plays a critical role in regulating stress disorders. Previous studies have shown that changes in the amygdala caused by stress are an important cause of mental disorders including anxiety, but the specific mechanism remains unclear. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether mental disorders induced by stress are related to γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neuron damage in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and whether endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) is involved in the injury process. Rat models of different durations of stress were established by restraint and forced ice-water swimming. Behavioral tests and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were used to detect anxiety in rats and changes in neurotransmitter levels in the BLA. Morphological approaches and microscopy-based multicolor tissue cytometry (MMTC) were used to detect the damage-induced changes in GABAergic neurons in the BLA. Immunofluorescence double labeling was used to detect the expression of ERS-related proteins before and after the inhibition of protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) pathway. Stress resulted in damage to GABAergic neurons in the BLA, decreased GABA and increased glutamic acid (GLU) levels, perturbation of the excitation/inhibition (E/I) ratio in the BLA, and obvious anxiety disorders in rats. Moreover, ERS-mediated GABAergic neuron injury was an important cause of neurotransmitter level changes in the BLA. These results suggested that ERS-mediated GABAergic neuron injury in the BLA may be an important cause of stress-induced mental disorders.</p>

<p>Microglia were previously regarded as a homogenous myeloid cell lineage in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). However, accumulating evidences show that microglia in the brain and SC are quite different in development, cellular phenotypes and biological functions. Although this is a very interesting phenomenon, the underlying mechanisms and its significance for neurological diseases in association with behavioral and cognitive changes are still unclear. How microglia differ between these two regions and whether such diversity may contribute to CNS development and functions as well as neurological diseases will be discussed in this Perspective.</p>

<p>It is commonly accepted that psychological stress is closely associated with the occurrence and development of chronic orofacial pain. However, the pathogenesis underlying this process has not been fully elucidated. In the present study, we explored the role of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) mediated intercellular communication between neurons and astrocytes in the spinal trigeminal nucleus caudalis (Vc) in the induction of masseter hyperalgesia by psychological stress in rats. We found that subjecting rats to 14 days of restraint stress (8 h/d) caused a significant decrease in body weight gain, behavioral changes and marked masseter hyperalgesia in the rats. We also found that exposure to restraint stress for 14 days caused the expression of pJNK in astrocytes in the Vc to significantly increase, and intrathecally infusing a JNK inhibitor significantly prevented restraint stress-induced masseter hyperalgesia in the rats. In addition, after exposure to restraint stress for 14 days, the stressed group exhibited a noticeably increased expression level of pNR2B in neurons in the Vc. Then, we intrathecally injected MK-801 (an NMDAR inhibitor) and ifenprodil (a selective NR2B subunit antagonist) and observed that the two types of inhibitors not only alleviated masseter hyperalgesia but also significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of JNK in the Vc after restraint stress; this indicates that the effect of NMDAR antagonists may influence the activation of astrocytic JNK. Furthermore, inhibitors of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) activation and guanylate cyclase (GC) inhibitor could not only inhibit the expression of pJNK in the Vc, but also effectively alleviate masseter hyperalgesia induced by restraint stress. Taken together, our results suggest that NMDAR activation could increase JNK phosphorylation in astrocytes after restraint stress, which may depend on the nNOS-GC pathway. The intercellular communication between neurons and astrocytes in the Vc may play a key role in the induction of masseter muscle hyperalgesia by psychological stress in rats.</p>

<p>by Jifan Shi, Tiejun Li, Luonan Chen, Kazuyuki Aihara</p>

Modeling cell differentiation from omics data is an essential problem in systems biology research. Although many algorithms have been established to analyze scRNA-seq data, approaches to infer the pseudo-time of cells or quantify their potency have not yet been satisfactorily solved. Here, we propose the Landscape of Differentiation Dynamics (LDD) method, which calculates cell potentials and constructs their differentiation landscape by a continuous birth-death process from scRNA-seq data. From the viewpoint of stochastic dynamics, we exploited the features of the differentiation process and quantified the differentiation landscape based on the source-sink diffusion process. In comparison with other scRNA-seq methods in seven benchmark datasets, we found that LDD could accurately and efficiently build the evolution tree of cells with pseudo-time, in particular quantifying their differentiation landscape in terms of potency. This study provides not only a computational tool to quantify cell potency or the Waddington potential landscape based on scRNA-seq data, but also novel insights to understand the cell differentiation process from a dynamic perspective.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uxtx5LmmfKg" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/46/9251?rss=1">Impairment of Sharp-Wave Ripples in a Murine Model of Dravet Syndrome</a></h4>

<p>Dravet syndrome (DS) is a severe early-onset epilepsy associated with heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in <i>SCN1A</i>. Animal models of DS with global <i>Scn1a</i> haploinsufficiency recapitulate the DS phenotype, including seizures, premature death, and impaired spatial memory performance. Spatial memory requires hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SPW-Rs), which consist of high-frequency field potential oscillations (ripples, 100–260 Hz) superimposed on a slower SPW. Published <i>in vitro</i> electrophysiologic recordings in DS mice demonstrate reduced firing of GABAergic inhibitory neurons, which are essential for the formation of SPW-R complexes. Here, <i>in vivo</i> electrophysiologic recordings of hippocampal local field potential in both male and female mice demonstrate that <i>Scn1a</i> haploinsufficiency slows intrinsic ripple frequency and reduces the rate of SPW-R occurrence. In DS mice, peak ripple-band power is shifted to lower frequencies, average intertrough intervals of individually detected ripples are slower, and the rate of SPW-R generation is reduced, while SPW amplitude remains unaffected. These alterations in SPW-R properties, in combination with published reductions in interneuron function in DS, suggest a direct link between reduced inhibitory neuron excitability and impaired SPW-R function. A simple interconnected, conductance-based <i>in silico</i> interneuron network model was used to determine whether reduced sodium conductance is sufficient to slow ripple frequency, and stimulation with a modeled SPW demonstrates that reduced sodium conductance alone is sufficient to slow oscillatory frequencies. These findings forge a potential mechanistic link between impaired SPW-R generation and <i>Scn1a</i> mutation in DS mice, expanding the set of disorders in which SPW-R dysfunction contributes to impaired memory.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Disruption of sharp-wave ripples, a characteristic hippocampal rhythm coordinated by the precise timing of GABAergic interneurons, impairs spatial learning and memory. Prior <i>in vitro</i> patch-clamp recordings in brain slices from genetic mouse models of Dravet syndrome (DS) reveal reduced sodium current and excitability in GABAergic interneurons but not excitatory cells, suggesting a causal role for impaired interneuron activity in seizures and cognitive impairment. Here, heterozygous <i>Scn1a</i> mutation in DS mice reduces hippocampal sharp-wave ripple occurrence and slows internal ripple frequency <i>in vivo</i> and a simple <i>in silico</i> model demonstrates reduction in interneuron function alone is sufficient to slow model oscillations. Together, these findings provide a plausible pathophysiologic mechanism for <i>Scn1a</i> gene mutation to impair spatial memory.</p>

Background<p>Compression of myofascial trigger points (MTrPs) in muscles is reported to reduce chronic musculoskeletal pain. Although the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is implicated in development of chronic pain, the mechanisms of how MTrP compression at low back regions affects PFC activity remain under debate. In this study, we investigated effects of MTrP compression on brain hemodynamics and EEG oscillation in subjects with chronic low back pain.</p>Methods<p>The study was a prospective, randomized, parallel-group trial and an observer and subject-blinded clinical trial. Thirty-two subjects with chronic low back pain were divided into two groups: subjects with compression at MTrPs (n = 16) or those with non-MTrPs (n = 16). Compression at MTrP or non-MTrP for 30 s was applied five times, and hemodynamic activity (near-infrared spectroscopy; NIRS) and EEGs were simultaneously recorded during the experiment.</p>Results<p>The results indicated that compression at MTrPs significantly (1) reduced subjective pain (P &lt; 0.05) and increased the pressure pain threshold (P &lt; 0.05), (2) decreased the NIRS hemodynamic activity in the frontal polar area (pPFC) (P &lt; 0.05), and (3) increased the current source density (CSD) of EEG theta oscillation in the anterior part of the PFC (P &lt; 0.05). CSD of EEG theta oscillation was negatively correlated with NIRS hemodynamic activity in the pPFC (P &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, functional connectivity in theta bands between the medial pPFC and insula cortex was significantly decreased in the MTrP group (P &lt; 0.05). The functional connectivity between those regions was positively correlated with subjective low back pain (P &lt; 0.05).</p>Discussion<p>The results suggest that MTrP compression at the lumbar muscle modulates pPFC activity and functional connectivity between the pPFC and insula, which may relieve chronic musculoskeletal pain.</p>Trial registration<p>This trial was registered at University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN000033913) on 27 August 2018, at https://upload.umin.ac.jp/cgi-open-bin/ctr/ctr_view.cgi?recptno=R000038660.</p>

<p>Understanding the origin of the main physiological processes involved in consciousness is a major challenge of contemporary neuroscience, with crucial implications for the study of Disorders of Consciousness (DOC). The difficulties in achieving this task include the considerable quantity of experimental data in this field, along with the non-intuitive, nonlinear nature of neuronal dynamics. One possibility of integrating the main results from the experimental literature into a cohesive framework, while accounting for nonlinear brain dynamics, is the use of physiologically-inspired computational models. In this study, we present a physiologically-grounded computational model, attempting to account for the main micro-circuits identified in the human cortex, while including the specificities of each neuronal type. More specifically, the model accounts for thalamo-cortical (vertical) regulation of cortico-cortical (horizontal) connectivity, which is a central mechanism for brain information integration and processing. The distinct neuronal assemblies communicate through feedforward and feedback excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections implemented in a template brain accounting for long-range connectome. The EEG generated by this physiologically-based simulated brain is validated through comparison with brain rhythms recorded in humans in two states of consciousness (wakefulness, sleep). Using the model, it is possible to reproduce the local disynaptic disinhibition of basket cells (fast GABAergic inhibition) and glutamatergic pyramidal neurons through long-range activation of vasoactive intestinal-peptide (VIP) interneurons that induced inhibition of somatostatin positive (SST) interneurons. The model (COALIA) predicts that the strength and dynamics of the thalamic output on the cortex control the local and long-range cortical processing of information. Furthermore, the model reproduces and explains clinical results regarding the complexity of transcranial magnetic stimulation TMS-evoked EEG responses in DOC patients and healthy volunteers, through a modulation of thalamo-cortical connectivity that governs the level of cortico-cortical communication. This new model provides a quantitative framework to accelerate the study of the physiological mechanisms involved in the emergence, maintenance and disruption (sleep, anesthesia, DOC) of consciousness.</p>

<p>Accurate and practical assessment of the brain circulation is needed to adequately estimate the viability of cerebral blood flow regulatory mechanisms in various physiological conditions. The objective of our study was to examine feasibility of the contactless green-light imaging photoplethysmography (PPG) for assessing cerebral autoregulation by revealing the dynamic relationships between cortical microcirculation assessed by PPG and changes in systemic blood pressure caused by visceral and somatic peripheral stimuli. In anesthetized male Wistar rats, the PPG video images of the open parietal cortex (either with unimpaired or dissected dura mater), electrocardiogram, and systemic arterial blood pressure (ABP) in the femoral artery were continuously recorded before, during and after visceral (colorectal distension) or somatic (tail squeezing) stimulation. In the vast majority of experiments with intact and removed dura mater, both spontaneous and peripheral stimulation-evoked changes in ABP negatively correlated with the accompanying alterations in the amplitude of pulsatile PPG component (APC), i.e., an increase of ABP resulted in a decrease of APC and vice versa. The most pronounced ABP and APC alterations were induced by noxious stimuli. Visceral painful stimulation in all cases caused short-term hypotension with simultaneous increase in cortical APC, whereas somatic noxious stimuli in 8 of 21 trials produced hypertensive effect with decreased APC. Animals with pressure 50-70 mmHg possessed higher negative cerebrovascular response rate of ABP-APC gradients than rats with either lower or higher pressure. Severe hypotension reversed the negative ratio to positive one, which was especially evident under visceral pain stimulation. Amplitude of the pulsatile PPG component probably reflects the regulation of vascular tone of cerebral cortex in response to systemic blood pressure fluctuations. When combined with different kinds of peripheral stimuli, the technique is capable for evaluation of normal and elucidation of impaired cerebrovascular system reactivity to particular physiological events, for example pain. The reported contactless PPG monitoring of cortical circulatory dynamics during neurosurgical interventions in combination with recordings of changes in other physiological parameters, such as systemic blood pressure and ECG, has the appealing potential to monitor viability of the cortex vessels and determine the state of patient’s cerebrovascular autoregulation.</p>

<p>Cerebral small vessel diseases play a crucial role in both vascular and non-vascular dementias. The location of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), a neuroimaging marker of cerebral small vessel disease, has been found to vary between different types of dementias, and those in the basal ganglia (BG) have been particularly associated with vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). However, anatomical variation of WMHs across BG nuclei and its effect on brain network dysconnectivity has not been clearly elucidated. The study sample consisted of 40 patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), 40 with subcortical vascular MCI (SVMCI), and 40 healthy control subjects. We examined the volume of WMH using T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. We also assessed the disturbances in BG-cortical communication by measuring resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) from the functional magnetic resonance imaging signal. WMHs were more pronounced in the SVMCI group particularly in the caudate regions. In SVMCI patients, while higher WMHs in the dorsal caudate correlated with weaker FC with executive control regions and worse immediate recall performance, WMHs in the ventral caudate were associated with weaker FC with anterior default mode regions and worse delayed recall performance. In contrast, in aMCI patients, BG WMHs were not correlated with their changes in functional connectivity changes, which showed weaker connectivity with almost all BG structures, rather than restricting to specific BG subdivisions as observed in the SVMCI group. Our findings demonstrate that heterogeneously distributed BG WMHs are associated with changes in functional network interactions and verbal episodic memory performance only in SVMCI patients, which establishes a link between cerebrovascular-related structural abnormality, functional integrity of BG circuits, and episodic memory impairments in SVMCI, and may reflect a differential role of the cerebrovascular pathology in disrupting network-level communications and cognition between Alzheimer’s and subcortical vascular dementia.</p>

<p>Myelin plays a crucial role in axon function recovery following nerve damage, and the interaction between Schwann cells (SCs) and regenerating axons profoundly affects myelin formation. Eph receptor A4 (EphA4), a member of the Eph tyrosine kinase receptor family, regulates cell-cell interactions via its ligand ephrins. However, our current knowledge on how EphA4 regulates the formation of myelin sheaths remains limited. In order to explore the roles of EphA4 in myelination in the peripheral nervous system, we used a combination of (1) a co-culture model of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) explants and SCs, (2) a SC differentiation model induced by db-cAMP, and (3) a regeneration model of crushed sciatic nerves in rats. Our results demonstrated that EphA4 inhibited myelination by inhibiting SC differentiation and facilitating SC proliferation in vitro. The in vivo experiments revealed that EphA4 expression in SCs is upregulated following nerve crush injury and then downregulated during remyelination. Moreover, silencing of EphA4 by siRNA or overexpression of EphA4 by genetic manipulation can accelerate or slow down nerve remyelination in crushed sciatic nerves. Taken together, our results suggest that EphA4 may negatively regulate myelination by abrogating SC differentiation.</p>

<p>The brain prefrontal control system is critical to successful recovery from substance use disorders, and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) regulates striatal reward-related processes. Substance-dependent individuals exhibit an increased response to drug rewards and decreased response to natural, nondrug rewards. Short-term aerobic exercise can ameliorate craving and inhibitory deficits in methamphetamine users, but the effect of exercise on food reward is unknown. This study used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure the effects of moderate- and high-intensity short-term aerobic exercise on prefrontal activity related to food images and recorded the subjective feelings of appetite in methamphetamine-dependent users. In total, 56 men who met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) criteria for methamphetamine dependence, with a mean (SD) body mass index of 24.7 (3.5) kg/m<sup>2</sup> and age of 30.2 (5.1) years, were randomly assigned to one of two exercise groups: moderate intensity (n = 28; 65%–75% of maximum heart rate) and high intensity (n = 28; 76%–85% of heart rate maximum). Each group also performed a resting control session for 35 min 1 week before or after the exercise, in a counterbalanced order. Mean oxygenated hemoglobin concentration changes in the PFC when viewing visual food cues were assessed by fNIRS, and subjective feelings of appetite were self-rated using visual analog scales after moderate- or high-intensity aerobic exercise and after the resting control session. A continuous-wave NIRS device was used to obtain functional data: eight sources and seven detectors were placed on the scalp covering the PFC, resulting in 20 channels per participant. We found that moderate-intensity aerobic exercise significantly increased both, the activation of the left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) to images of high-calorie food (P = 0.02) and subjective sensations of hunger (F<sub>(1,54)</sub> = 7.16, P = 0.01). To our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence that moderate-intensity aerobic exercise increases OFC activity associated with high-calorie food images and stimulates appetite in methamphetamine-dependent individuals. These changes suggest that exercise may reestablish the food reward pathway hijacked by drugs and restore sensitivity to natural rewards. This evidence may contribute to the development of specific exercise programs for populations with methamphetamine dependence.</p>

<p>The field of second language acquisition (SLA) is by nature of its subject a highly interdisciplinary area of research. Learning a (foreign) language, for example, involves encoding new words, consolidating and committing them to long-term memory, and later retrieving them. All of these processes have direct parallels in the domain of human memory and have been thoroughly studied by researchers in that field. Yet, despite these clear links, the two fields have largely developed in parallel and in isolation from one another. The present article aims to promote more cross-talk between SLA and memory science. We focus on foreign language (FL) attrition as an example of a research topic in SLA where the parallels with memory science are especially apparent. We discuss evidence that suggests that competition between languages is one of the mechanisms of FL attrition, paralleling the interference process thought to underlie forgetting in other domains of human memory. Backed up by concrete suggestions, we advocate the use of paradigms from the memory literature to study these interference effects in the language domain. In doing so, we hope to facilitate future cross-talk between the two fields and to further our understanding of FL attrition as a memory phenomenon.</p>

<p>Synaptic changes induced by neural activity need to be consolidated to maintain memory over a timescale of hours. In experiments, synaptic consolidation can be induced by repeating a stimulation protocol several times and the effectiveness of consolidation depends crucially on the repetition frequency of the stimulations. We address the question: is there an understandable reason why induction protocols with repetitions at some frequency work better than sustained protocols—even though the accumulated stimulation strength might be exactly the same in both cases? In real synapses, plasticity occurs on multiple time scales from seconds (induction), to several minutes (early phase of long-term potentiation) to hours and days (late phase of synaptic consolidation). We use a simplified mathematical model of just two times scales to elucidate the above question in a purified setting. Our mathematical results show that, even in such a simple model, the repetition frequency of stimulation plays an important role for the successful induction, and stabilization, of potentiation.</p>

<p>The importance of diverse lifestyle factors in sustaining cognition during aging and delaying the onset of decline in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias cannot be overstated. We explored the influence of cognitive, social, and physical lifestyle factors on resting-state lagged linear connectivity (LLC) in high-density electroencephalography (EEG) in adults, ages 35–75 years. Diverse lifestyle factors build cognitive reserve (CR), protecting cognition in the presence of physical brain decline. Differences in LLC were examined between high- and low-CR groups formed using cognitive, social, and exercise lifestyle factors. LLC is a measure of lagged coherence that excludes zero phase contributions and limits the effects of volume conduction on connectivity estimates. Significant differences in LLC were identified for cognitive and social factors, but not exercise. Participants high in social CR possessed greater local and long-range connectivity in theta and low alpha for eyes-open and eyes-closed recording conditions. In contrast, participants high in cognitive CR exhibited greater eyes-closed long-range connectivity between the occipital lobe and other cortical regions in low alpha. Greater eyes-closed local LLC in delta was also present in men high in cognitive CR. Cognitive factor scores correlated with sustained attention, whereas social factors scores correlated with spatial working memory. Gender was a significant covariate in our analyses, with women displaying higher local and long-range LLC in low beta. Our findings support distinct relationships between CR and LLC, as well as CR and cognitive function for cognitive and social subcomponents. These patterns reflect the importance of diverse lifestyle factors in building CR.</p>

<p>Background: The early progression continuum of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has been considered to advance through subjective cognitive decline (SCD), non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment (naMCI), and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Altered functional connectivity (FC) in the default mode network (DMN) is regarded as a hallmark of AD. Furthermore, the DMN can be divided into two subnetworks, the anterior and posterior subnetworks. However, little is known about distinct disruptive patterns in the subsystems of the DMN across the preclinical AD spectrum. This study investigated the connectivity patterns of anterior DMN (aDMN) and posterior DMN (pDMN) across the preclinical AD spectrum.</p><p>Methods: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) was used to investigate the FC in the DMN subnetworks in 20 healthy controls (HC), eight SCD, 11 naMCI, and 28 aMCI patients. Moreover, a correlation analysis was used to examine associations between the altered connectivity of the DMN subnetworks and the neurocognitive performance.</p><p>Results: Compared to the HC, SCD patients showed increased FC in the bilateral superior frontal gyrus (SFG), naMCI patients showed increased FC in the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL), and aMCI patients showed increased FC in the bilateral IPL in the aDMN; while SCD patients showed decreased FC in the precuneus, naMCI patients showed increased FC in the left middle temporal gyrus (MTG), and aMCI patients also showed increased FC in the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG) in the pDMN. Notably, the FC between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the left MFG and the IPL in the aDMN was associated with episodic memory in the SCD and aMCI groups. Interestingly, the FC between the posterior cingulated cortex (PCC) and several regions in the pDMN was associated with other cognitive functions in the SCD and naMCI groups.</p><p>Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the three preclinical stages of AD exhibit distinct FC alternations in the DMN subnetworks. Furthermore, the patient group data showed that the altered FC involves cognitive function. These findings can provide novel insights for tailored clinical intervention across the preclinical AD spectrum.</p>

<p>Rate coding and phase coding are the two major coding modes seen in the brain. For these two modes, network dynamics must either have a wide distribution of frequencies for rate coding, or a narrow one to achieve stability in phase dynamics for phase coding. Acetylcholine (ACh) is a potent regulator of neural excitability. Acting through the muscarinic receptor, ACh reduces the magnitude of the potassium M-current, a hyperpolarizing current that builds up as neurons fire. The M-current contributes to several excitability features of neurons, becoming a major player in facilitating the transition between Type 1 (integrator) and Type 2 (resonator) excitability. In this paper we argue that this transition enables a dynamic switch between rate coding and phase coding as levels of ACh release change. When a network is in a high ACh state variations in synaptic inputs will lead to a wider distribution of firing rates across the network and this distribution will reflect the network structure or pattern of external input to the network. When ACh is low, network frequencies become narrowly distributed and the structure of a network or pattern of external inputs will be represented through phase relationships between firing neurons. This work provides insights into how modulation of neuronal features influences network dynamics and information processing across brain states.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00273">Internalized GPCRs as Potential Therapeutic Targets for the Management of Pain</a></h4>

<p>Peripheral and central neurons in the pain pathway are well equipped to detect and respond to extracellular stimuli such as pro-inflammatory mediators and neurotransmitters through the cell surface expression of receptors that can mediate rapid intracellular signaling. Following injury or infection, activation of cell surface G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) initiates cell signaling processes that lead to the generation of action potentials in neurons or inflammatory responses such as cytokine secretion by immune cells. However, it is now appreciated that cell surface events alone may not be sufficient for all receptors to generate their complete signaling repertoire. Following an initial wave of signaling at the cell surface, active GPCRs can engage with endocytic proteins such as the adaptor protein β-arrestin (βArr) to promote clathrin-mediated internalization. Classically, βArr-mediated internalization of GPCRs was hypothesized to terminate signaling, yet for multiple GPCRs known to contribute to pain, it has been demonstrated that endocytosis can also promote a unique “second wave” of signaling from intracellular membranes, including those of endosomes and the Golgi, that is spatiotemporally distinct from initial cell-surface events. In the context of pain, understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive spatiotemporal signaling of GPCRs is invaluable for understanding how pain occurs and persists, and how current analgesics achieve efficacy or promote side-effects. This review article discusses the importance of receptor localization for signaling outcomes of pro- and anti-nociceptive GPCRs, and new analgesic opportunities emerging through the development of “location-biased” ligands that favor binding with intracellular GPCR populations.</p>

<p>There is a growing body of evidence that prionoid protein behaviors are a core element of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) that afflict humans. Common elements in pathogenesis, pathological effects and protein-level behaviors exist between Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), Parkinson’s Disease (PD), Huntington’s Disease (HD) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). These extend beyond the affected neurons to glial cells and processes. This results in a complicated system of disease progression, which often takes advantage of protective processes to promote the propagation of pathological protein aggregates. This review article provides a current snapshot of knowledge on these proteins and their intrinsic role in the pathogenesis and disease progression seen across NDs.</p>

<p>Collateral sprouting of surviving axons contributes to the synaptic reorganization after brain injury. To study this clinically relevant phenomenon, we used complex organotypic tissue cultures of mouse entorhinal cortex (EC) and hippocampus (H). Single EC-H cultures were generated to analyze associational sprouting, and double EC-H cultures were used to evaluate commissural sprouting of mossy cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) following entorhinal denervation. Entorhinal denervation (transection of the perforant path) was performed at 14 days in vitro (DIV) and associational/commissural sprouting was assessed at 28 DIV. First, associational sprouting was studied in genetically hybrid EC-H cultures of beta-actin-GFPtg and wild-type mice. Using calretinin as a marker, associational axons were found to re-innervate almost the entire entorhinal target zone. Denervation experiments performed with EC-H cultures of Thy1-YFPtg mice, in which mossy cells are YFP-positive, confirmed that the overwhelming majority of sprouting associational calretinin-positive axons are mossy cell axons. Second, we analyzed associational/commissural sprouting by combining wild-type EC-H cultures with calretinin-deficient EC-H cultures. In these cultures, only wild-type mossy cells contain calretinin, and associational and commissural mossy cell collaterals can be distinguished using calretinin as a marker. Nearly the entire DG entorhinal target zone was re-innervated by sprouting of associational and commissural mossy cell axons. Finally, viral labeling of newly formed associational/commissural axons revealed a rapid post-lesional sprouting response. These findings demonstrate extensive and rapid re-innervation of the denervated DG outer molecular layer by associational and commissural mossy cell axons, similar to what has been reported to occur in juvenile rodent DG in vivo.</p>

<p>Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the proof of concept of an intervention to decrease sympathetic activation as measured by skin conductivity (electrodermal activity, EDA) in children with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and auditory hypersensitivity (hyperacusis). In addition, researchers examined if the intervention provided protection against the negative effects of decibel level of environmental noises on electrodermal measures between interventions. The feasibility of implementation and outcome measures within natural environments were evaluated.</p><p>Method: A single-subject multi-treatment design was used with six children, aged 8–16 years, with a form of Autism (i.e., Autism, PDD-NOS). Participants used in-ear (IE) and over-ear (OE) headphones for two randomly sequenced treatment phases. Each child completed four phases: (1) a week of baseline data collection; (2) a week of an intervention; (3) a week of no intervention; and (4) a week of the other intervention. Empatica E4 wristbands collected EDA data. Data was collected on 16–20 occasions per participant, with five measurements per phase.</p><p>Results: Separated tests for paired study phases suggested that regardless of intervention type, noise attenuating headphones led to a significance difference in both skin conductance levels (SCL) and frequency of non-specific conductance responses (NS-SCRs) between the baseline measurement and subsequent phases. Overall, SCL and NS-SCR frequency significantly decreased between baseline and the first intervention phase. A protective effect of the intervention was tested by collapsing intervention results into three phases. Slope correlation suggested constant SCL and NS-SCR frequency after initial use of the headphones regardless of the increase in environmental noises. A subsequent analysis of the quality of EDA data identified that later phases of data collection were associated with better data quality.</p><p>Conclusion: Many children with ASD have hypersensitivities to sound resulting in high levels of sympathetic nervous system reactivity, which is associated with problematic behaviors and distress. The findings of this study suggest that the use of noise attenuating headphones for individuals with ASD and hyperacusis may reduce sympathetic activation. Additionally, results suggest that the use of wearable sensors to collect physiological data in natural environments is feasible with established protocols and training procedures.</p>

<p>In many mammalian species including opossums, adult neurogenesis, the function of which is not completely understood, declines with aging. Aging also causes impairment of cognition. To understand whether new neurons contribute to learning and memory, we performed experiments on young and aged laboratory opossums, Monodelphis domestica, and examined the association between spatial memory using the Morris water maze test and the rate of adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG). Modification of this test allowed us to assess how both young and aged opossums learn and remember the location of the platform in the water maze. We found that both young and aged opossums were motivated to perform this task. However, aged opossums needed more time to achieve the test than young opossums. Classical parameters measuring spatial learning in a water maze during a probe test showed that young opossums spent more time in the platform zone crossing it more often than aged opossums. Additionally, hippocampal neurogenesis was lower in the aged opossums than in the young animals but new neurons were still generated in the DG of aged opossums. Our data revealed individual differences in the levels of doublecortin in relation to memory performance across aged opossums. These differences were correlated with distinct behaviors, particularly, aged opossums with high levels of DCX achieved high performance levels in the water maze task. We, therefore suggest that new neurons in the DG of Monodelphis opossums contribute to learning and memory.</p>

<p>Sustained attention is a fundamental ability ensuring effective cognitive processing and can be enhanced by meditation practice. However, keeping a focused meditative state is challenging for novices because involuntary mind-wandering frequently occurs during their practice. Inspired by the potential of force-control tasks in invoking internal somatic attention, we proposed a haptics-assisted meditation (HAM) to help reduce mind-wandering and enhance attention. During HAM, participants were instructed to maintain awareness on the respiration and meanwhile adjust bimanual fingertip pressures to keep synchronized with the respiration. This paradigm required somatosensory attention as a physiological foundation, aiming to help novices meditate starting with the body and gradually gain essential meditation skills. A cross-sectional study on 12 novices indicated that the participants reported less mind-wandering during HAM compared with the classic breath-counting meditation (BCM). In a further longitudinal study, the experimental group with 10 novices showed significantly improved performance in several attentional tests after 5 days’ practice of HAM. They tended to show more significant improvements in a few tests than did the control group performing the 5-day BCM practice. To investigate the brain activities related to HAM, we applied functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to record cerebral hemodynamic responses from the prefrontal and sensorimotor cortices when performing HAM, and we assessed the changes in cerebral activation and functional connectivity (FC) after the 5-day HAM practice. The prefrontal and sensorimotor regions demonstrated a uniform activation when performing HAM, and there was a significant increase in the right prefrontal activation after the practice. We also observed significant changes in the FC between the brain regions related to the attention networks. These behavioral and neural findings together provided preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of HAM on attention enhancement in the early stage of meditation learning.</p>

<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the principal cause of death and disability in children and young adults. Clinical and preclinical research efforts have been carried out to understand the acute, life-threatening pathophysiological events happening after TBI. In the past few years, however, it was recognized that TBI causes significant morbidity weeks, months, or years after the initial injury, thereby contributing substantially to the overall burden of TBI and the decrease of life expectancy in these patients. Long-lasting sequels of TBI include cognitive decline/dementia, sensory-motor dysfunction, and psychiatric disorders, and most important for patients is the need for socio-economic rehabilitation affecting their quality of life. Cerebrovascular alterations have been described during the first week after TBI for direct consequence development of neuroinflammatory process in relation to brain edema. Within the brain–immune interactions, the complement system, which is a family of blood and cell surface proteins, participates in the pathophysiology process. In fact, the complement system is part of the primary defense and clearance component of innate and adaptive immune response. In this review, the complement activation after TBI will be described in relation to the activation of the microglia and astrocytes as well as the blood–brain barrier dysfunction during the first week after the injury. Considering the neuroinflammatory activity as a causal element of neurological handicaps, some major parallel lines of complement activity in multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer pathologies with regard to cognitive impairment will be discussed for chronic TBI. A better understanding of the role of complement activation could facilitate the development of new therapeutic approaches for TBI.</p>

<p>Propriospinal interneurons (INs) communicate information over short and long distances within the spinal cord. They act to coordinate different parts of the body by linking motor circuits that control muscles across the forelimbs, trunk, and hindlimbs. Their role in coordinating locomotor circuits near and far may be invaluable to the recovery of locomotor function lost due to injury to the spinal cord where the flow of motor commands from the brain and brainstem to spinal motor circuits is disrupted. The formation and activation of circuits established by spared propriospinal INs may promote the re-emergence of locomotion. In light of progress made in animal models of spinal cord injury (SCI) and in human patients, we discuss the role of propriospinal INs in the intact spinal cord and describe recent studies investigating the assembly and/or activation of propriospinal circuits to promote recovery of locomotion following SCI.</p>

<p>Brain mitochondrial dysfunction is involved in the development of neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. Mitochondria specifically located at synapses play a key role in providing energy to support synaptic functions and plasticity, thus their defects may lead to synaptic failure, which is a common hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases. High-Fat Diet (HFD) consumption increases brain oxidative stress and impairs brain mitochondrial functions, although the underlying mechanisms are not completely understood. The aim of our study is to analyze neuroinflammation and mitochondrial dysfunctions in brain cortex and synaptosomal fraction isolated from a mouse model of diet-induced obesity. Male C57Bl/6 mice were divided into two groups fed a standard diet or HFD for 18 weeks. At the end of the treatment, inflammation (detected by ELISA), antioxidant state (measured by enzymatic activity), mitochondrial functions and efficiency (detected by oxidative capacity and Seahorse analysis), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) pathway (analyzed by western blot) were determined in brain cortex and synaptosomal fraction. In HFD animals, we observed an increase in inflammatory parameters and oxidative stress and a decrease in mitochondrial oxidative capacity both in the brain cortex and synaptosomal fraction. These alterations parallel with modulation of BDNF, a brain key signaling molecule that is linking synaptic plasticity and energy metabolism. Neuroinflammation HFD-dependent negatively affects BDNF pathway and mitochondrial activity in the brain cortex. The effect is even more pronounced in the synaptic region, where the impaired energy supply may have a negative impact on neuronal plasticity.</p>

<p>Oriens-lacunosum moleculare (OLM) cells are hippocampal inhibitory interneurons that are implicated in the regulation of information flow in the CA1 circuit, inhibiting cortical inputs to distal pyramidal cell dendrites, whilst disinhibiting CA3 inputs to pyramidal cells. OLM cells express metabotropic cholinergic (mAChR) and glutamatergic (mGluR) receptors, so modulation of these cells via these receptors may contribute to switching between functional modes of the hippocampus. Using a transgenic mouse line to identify OLM cells, we found that both mAChR and mGluR activation caused the cells to exhibit long-lasting depolarizing plateau potentials following evoked spike trains. Both mAChR- and mGluR-induced plateau potentials were eliminated by blocking transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, and were dependent on intracellular calcium concentration and calcium entry. Pharmacological tests indicated that Group I mGluRs are responsible for the glutamatergic induction of plateaus. There was also a pronounced synergy between the cholinergic and glutamatergic modulation, plateau potentials being generated by agonists applied together at concentrations too low to elicit any change when applied individually. This synergy could enable OLM cells to function as coincidence detectors of different neuromodulatory systems, leading to their enhanced and prolonged activation and a functional change in information flow within the hippocampus.</p>

<p>Astrocytes, as the largest population of glial subtype, play crucial roles in normal brain function and pathological conditions, such as Parkinson’s disease (PD). Restoring the functions of astrocyte is a promising new therapeutic target for PD. Astrocytes can express multiple types of neurotransmitter receptors, including functional α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR). Previously, we found that a non-selective α7nAChR agonist nicotine exerted a protective effect against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced astrocyte apoptosis via an α7nAChR-dependent pathway. However, the molecular mechanism of the antiapoptotic response of astroglial α7nAChR has not been studied. In the present study, using pharmacological inhibition and genetic knockout of α7nAChR, we assessed the antiapoptotic effects of an α7nAChR agonist PNU-282987 in primary cultured astrocytes treated with 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP<sup>+</sup>). PNU-282987 promoted the viability of astrocytes, alleviated MPP<sup>+</sup> induced apoptosis, and decreased the number of GFAP<sup>+</sup>/TUNEL<sup>+</sup> cells. Meanwhile, PNU-282987 upregulated the expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 and downregulated the expression of the apoptotic protein Bax and cleaved-caspase-3. Moreover, the suppression of the JNK-p53-caspase-3 signaling may underlie the neuroprotective property of PNU-282987. Therefore, PNU-282987 ameliorates astroglial apoptosis induced by MPP<sup>+</sup> through α7nAChR-JNK-p53 signaling. Our findings suggest that PNU-282987 may be a potential drug for restoring astroglial functions in the treatment of PD.</p>

<p>Glia alterations in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) have been postulated to play an important role in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders. Astroglia is the most abundant type of glial cells in the central nervous system. The expression levels of astrocyte markers (glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), synemin-α, synemin-β, vimentin, nestin) in isolated gray matter from postmortem ACC and DLPFC were determined to investigate the possible involvement of astrocytes in depression. Donors were aged non-suicidal subjects with bipolar disorder (BPD) or major depressive disorder (MDD), and matched controls. GFAP mRNA levels were significantly increased in the ACC of BPD patients. However, GFAP immunohistochemistry showed that the area fraction of GFAP immunoreactive astrocytes was decreased in the ACC of BPD patients, while there were no changes in the cell density and integrated optical density (IOD), indicating that there might be a reduction of GFAP-positive astrocyte processes and remodeling of the astrocyte network in BPD. Furthermore, in controls, DLPFC GFAP mRNA levels were significantly lower with a time of death at daytime (08:01–20:00 h) compared to nighttime (20:01–08:00 h). In depression, such a diurnal pattern was not present. These findings in BPD and MDD subjects warrant further studies given the crucial roles of astrocytes in the central nervous system.</p>

<p>The target for the “rapid” (&lt;24 h) antidepressant effects of S-ketamine is unknown, vitiating programs to rationally develop more effective rapid antidepressants. To describe a drug’s target, one must first understand the compartments entered by the drug, at all levels—the organ, the cell, and the organelle. We have, therefore, developed molecular tools to measure the subcellular, organellar pharmacokinetics of S-ketamine. The tools are genetically encoded intensity-based S-ketamine-sensing fluorescent reporters, iSKetSnFR1 and iSKetSnFR2. In solution, these biosensors respond to S-ketamine with a sensitivity, S-slope = delta(F/F<sub>0</sub>)/(delta[S-ketamine]) of 0.23 and 1.9/μM, respectively. The iSKetSnFR2 construct allows measurements at &lt;0.3 μM S-ketamine. The iSKetSnFR1 and iSKetSnFR2 biosensors display &gt;100-fold selectivity over other ligands tested, including R-ketamine. We targeted each of the sensors to either the plasma membrane (PM) or the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Measurements on these biosensors expressed in Neuro2a cells and in human dopaminergic neurons differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) show that S-ketamine enters the ER within a few seconds after appearing in the external solution near the PM, then leaves as rapidly after S-ketamine is removed from the extracellular solution. In cells, S-slopes for the ER and PM-targeted sensors differ by &lt;2-fold, indicating that the ER [S-ketamine] is less than 2-fold different from the extracellular [S-ketamine]. Organelles represent potential compartments for the engagement of S-ketamine with its antidepressant target, and potential S-ketamine targets include organellar ion channels, receptors, and transporters.</p>

<p>Neurodegenerative diseases are disorders that are characterized by a progressive decline of motor and/or cognitive functions caused by the selective degeneration and loss of neurons within the central nervous system. The most common neurodegenerative diseases are Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and Huntington’s disease (HD). Neurons have high energy demands, and dysregulation of mitochondrial quality and function is an important cause of neuronal degeneration. Mitochondrial quality control plays an important role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and ensuring normal mitochondrial function; thus, defects in mitochondrial quality control are also significant causes of neurodegenerative diseases. The mitochondrial deacetylase SIRT3 has been found to have a large effect on mitochondrial function. Recent studies have also shown that SIRT3 has a role in mitochondrial quality control, including in the refolding or degradation of misfolded/unfolded proteins, mitochondrial dynamics, mitophagy, and mitochondrial biogenesis, all of which are affected in neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<p>Hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau and its resultant aggregation into neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) is a pathological characteristic of neurodegenerative disorders known as tauopathies. Tau is a neuronal protein involved in the stabilization of microtubule structures of the axon and the aberrant phosphorylation of tau is associated with several neurotoxic effects. The discovery of tau pathology and aggregates in the cortex of Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients has focused interest on hyperphosphorylation of tau as a potential mechanism contributing to increased states of hyperexcitability and cognitive decline. Previous studies using animal models of status epilepticus and tissue from patients with TLE have shown increased tau phosphorylation in the brain following acute seizures and during epilepsy, with tau phosphorylation correlating with cognitive deficits in patients. Suggesting a functional role of tau during epilepsy, studies in tau-deficient and tau-overexpressing mice have demonstrated a causal role of tau during seizure generation. Previous studies, analyzing the impact of seizures on tau hyperphosphorylation, have mainly used animal models of acute seizures. These models, however, do not replicate all aspects of chronic epilepsy. In this study, we investigated the effects of acute seizures (status epilepticus) and chronic epilepsy upon the expression and phosphorylation of tau using the intra-amygdala kainic acid (KA)-induced status epilepticus mouse model. Status epilepticus resulted in an immediate increase in total tau levels in the hippocampus, in particular, the dentate gyrus, and phosphorylation of the AT8 epitope (Ser202, Thr205), with phosphorylated tau mainly localizing to the mossy fibers of the dentate gyrus. During epilepsy, abnormal phosphorylation of tau was detected again at the AT8 epitope with lower total tau levels in the CA3 and CA1 subfields of the hippocampus. Chronic epilepsy in mice also resulted in a strong localization of AT8 phospho-tau to microglia, indicating a distinct pattern of tau hyperphosphorylation during chronic epilepsy compared to status epilepticus. Our results reaffirm previous observations of tau phosphorylation post-status epilepticus, but also elaborate on tau alterations in epileptic mice which more faithfully mimic TLE. Our results confirm seizures affect tau hyperphosphorylation, however, suggest epitope-specific phosphorylation of tau and differences in cell-specific localization according to disease progression.</p>

<p>by Sahand Khakabimamaghani, Dujian Ding, Oliver Snow, Martin Ester</p>

Cancer is driven by genetic mutations that dysregulate pathways important for proper cell function. Therefore, discovering these cancer pathways and their dysregulation order is key to understanding and treating cancer. However, the heterogeneity of mutations between different individuals makes this challenging and requires that cancer progression is studied in a subtype-specific way. To address this challenge, we provide a mathematical model, called Subtype-specific Pathway Linear Progression Model (SPM), that simultaneously captures cancer subtypes and pathways and order of dysregulation of the pathways within each subtype. Experiments with synthetic data indicate the robustness of SPM to problem specifics including noise compared to an existing method. Moreover, experimental results on glioblastoma multiforme and colorectal adenocarcinoma show the consistency of SPM’s results with the existing knowledge and its superiority to an existing method in certain cases. The implementation of our method is available at https://github.com/Dalton386/SPM.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4xYNLSR_9MM" width="1" />

<p>by Yichen Zheng, Thomas Wiehe</p>

Selective sweeps, the genetic footprint of positive selection, have been extensively studied in the past decades, with dozens of methods developed to identify swept regions. However, these methods suffer from both false positive and false negative reports, and the candidates identified with different methods are often inconsistent with each other. We propose that a biological cause of this problem can be population subdivision, and a technical cause can be incomplete, or inaccurate, modeling of the dynamic process associated with sweeps. Here we used simulations to show how these effects interact and potentially cause bias. In particular, we show that sweeps maybe misclassified as either hard or soft, when the true time stage of a sweep and that implied, or pre-supposed, by the model do not match. We call this “temporal misclassification”. Similarly, “spatial misclassification (softening)” can occur when hard sweeps, which are imported by migration into a new subpopulation, are falsely identified as soft. This can easily happen in case of local adaptation, i.e. when the sweeping allele is not under positive selection in the new subpopulation, and the underlying model assumes panmixis instead of substructure. The claim that most sweeps in the evolutionary history of humans were soft, may have to be reconsidered in the light of these findings.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Uo3Uonzh4A4" width="1" />

<p>by Tarunendu Mapder, Sam Clifford, John Aaskov, Kevin Burrage</p>

The titre of virus in a dengue patient and the duration of this viraemia has a profound effect on whether or not a mosquito will become infected when it feeds on the patient and this, in turn, is a key driver of the magnitude of a dengue outbreak. The assessment of the heterogeneity of viral dynamics in dengue-infected patients and its precise treatment are still uncertain. Infection onset, patient physiology and immune response are thought to play major roles in the development of the viral load. Research has explored the interference and spontaneous generation of defective virus particles, but have not examined both the antibody and defective particles during natural infection. We explore the intrinsic variability in the within-host dynamics of viraemias for a population of patients using the method of population of models (POMs). A dataset from 208 patients is used to initially calibrate 20,000 models for the infection kinetics for each of the four dengue virus serotypes. The calibrated POMs suggests that naturally generated defective particles may interfere with the viraemia, but the generated defective virus particles are not adequate to reduce high fever and viraemia duration. The effect of adding excess defective dengue virus interfering particles to patients as a therapeutic is evaluated using the calibrated POMs in a bang-bang (on-off or two-step) optimal control setting. Bang-bang control is a class of binary feedback control that turns either ‘ON’ or ‘OFF’ at different time points, determined by the system feedback. Here, the bang-bang control estimates the mathematically optimal dose and duration of the intervention for each model in the POM set.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DRPp8QCaKbw" width="1" />

<p>Publication date: December 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 59</p><p>Author(s): Daniele Canzio, Tom Maniatis</p><div><p>The assembly of functional neural circuits in vertebrate organisms requires complex mechanisms of self-recognition and self-avoidance. Neurites (axons and dendrites) from the same neuron recognize and avoid self, but engage in synaptic interactions with other neurons. Vertebrate neural self-avoidance requires the expression of distinct repertoires of clustered Protocadherin (Pcdh) cell-surface protein isoforms, which act as cell-surface molecular barcodes that mediate highly specific homophilic self-recognition, followed by repulsion. The generation of sufficiently diverse cell-surface barcodes is achieved by the stochastic and combinatorial activation of a subset of clustered Pcdh promoters in individual neurons. This remarkable mechanism leads to the generation of enormous molecular diversity at the cell surface. Here we review recent studies showing that stochastic expression of individual Pcdhα isoforms is accomplished through an extraordinary mechanism involving the activation of ‘antisense strand’ promoter within Pcdhα ‘variable’ exons, antisense transcription of a long non-coding RNA through the upstream ‘sense strand’ promoter, demethylation of this promoter, binding of the CTCF/cohesin complex and DNA looping to a distant enhancer through a mechanism of chromatin ‘extrusion’.</p></div>

<p>Adaptation is a multi-faceted phenomenon that is of interest in terms of both its function and its potential to reveal underlying neural processing. Many behavioral studies have shown that after exposure to an oriented adapter the perceived orientation of a subsequent test is repulsed away from the orientation of the adapter. This is the well-known Tilt Aftereffect (TAE). Recently, we showed that the dynamics of recurrently connected networks may contribute substantially to the neural changes induced by adaptation, especially on short time scales. Here we extended the network model and made the novel behavioral prediction that the TAE should be attractive, not repulsive, on a time scale of a few 100 ms. Our experiments, using a novel adaptation protocol that specifically targeted adaptation on a short time scale, confirmed this prediction. These results support our hypothesis that recurrent network dynamics may contribute to short-term adaptation. More broadly, they show that understanding the neural processing of visual inputs that change on the time scale of a typical fixation requires a detailed analysis of not only the intrinsic properties of neurons, but also the slow and complex dynamics that emerge from their recurrent connectivity. We argue that this is but one example of how even simple recurrent networks can underlie surprisingly complex information processing, and are involved in rudimentary forms of memory, spatio-temporal integration, and signal amplification.</p>

<p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) undergoes complex temporal and spectral changes during voluntary movement intention. Characterization of such changes has focused mostly on narrowband spectral processes such as Event-Related Desynchronization (ERD) in the sensorimotor rhythms because EEG is mostly considered as emerging from oscillations of the neuronal populations. However, the changes in the temporal dynamics, especially in the broadband arrhythmic EEG have not been investigated for movement intention detection. The Long-Range Temporal Correlations (LRTC) are ubiquitously present in several neuronal processes, typically requiring longer timescales to detect. In this paper, we study the ongoing changes in the dynamics of long- as well as short-range temporal dependencies in the single trial broadband EEG during movement intention. We obtained LRTC in 2 s windows of broadband EEG and modeled it using the Autoregressive Fractionally Integrated Moving Average (ARFIMA) model which allowed simultaneous modeling of short- and long-range temporal correlations. There were significant (p &lt; 0.05) changes in both broadband long- and short-range temporal correlations during movement intention and execution. We discovered that the broadband LRTC and narrowband ERD are complementary processes providing distinct information about movement because eliminating LRTC from the signal did not affect the ERD and conversely, eliminating ERD from the signal did not affect LRTC. Exploring the possibility of applications in Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI), we used hybrid features with combinations of LRTC, ARFIMA, and ERD to detect movement intention. A significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) classification accuracy of 88.3 ± 4.2% was obtained using the combination of ARFIMA and ERD features together, which also predicted the earliest movement at 1 s before its onset. The ongoing changes in the long- and short-range temporal correlations in broadband EEG contribute to effectively capturing the motor command generation and can be used to detect movement successfully. These temporal dependencies provide different and additional information about the movement.</p>

<p>Synaptic cell adhesion molecules are well established to exhibit synaptogenic activity when overexpressed in target cells, indicating that they are involved in formation and functional maturation of synapses. The postsynaptic adhesion proteins Neuroligin1 and LRRTM2 both induce synaptic vesicle clusters in presynaptic axons in vitro by transsynaptically interacting with neurexins. In neurons, this is accompanied by the induction of glutamatergic, but not GABAergic synapses. Although the synaptogenic activity of Neuroligin1 has been well characterized, the properties of the synaptogenic activities of other synaptic adhesion molecules are largely unknown. In this paper, we now compared characteristics of the synaptogenic activities of Neuroligin1 and LRRTM2 upon overexpression in cultured mouse cortical neurons. Individual cortical neurons were transfected with Neuroligin1 and LRRTM2 expression plasmids, respectively, and synaptic vesicle clustering in contacting axons was examined by immunostaining for the vesicle membrane protein VAMP2. In immature neurons at 6–7 days in vitro (DIV) both Neuroligin1 and LRRTM2 exhibited strong synaptogenic activity. However, upon further neuronal differentiation only LRRTM2 retained significant synaptogenic activity at 12–13 DIV. A similar differential developmental maturation of the synaptogenic activities of Neuroligin1 and LRRTM2 was observed for the induction of glutamatergic synapses, which were detected by co-immunostaining for VGLUT1 and Homer1. Most interestingly, the synaptogenic activity of Neuroligin1 was strongly dependent on the expression and function of the synaptic adhesion molecule N-cadherin in immature neurons. In contrast, the synaptogenic activity of LRRTM2 was independent of N-cadherin expression and function in both immature (6–7 DIV) and more mature neurons (14–15 DIV). Taken together, our results with overexpression in cultured cortical neurons revealed striking differences in the properties of the synaptogenic activities of Neuroligin1 and LRRTM2, although both transsynaptically interact with presynaptic neurexins.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology is characterized by the aggregation of beta-amyloid (Aβ) and tau in the form of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. It has been found that a synergistic relationship between these two proteins may contribute to their roles in disease progression. However, how Aβ and tau interact has not been fully characterized. Here, we analyze how tau seeding or aggregation is influenced by different Aβ self-assemblies (fibrils and oligomers). Our cellular assays utilizing tau biosensor cells show that transduction of Aβ oligomers into the cells greatly enhances seeded tau aggregation in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, transduced Aβ fibrils slightly reduce tau seeding while untransduced Aβ fibrils promote it. We also observe that the transduction of α-synuclein fibrils, another amyloid protein, has no effect on tau seeding. The enhancement of tau seeding by Aβ oligomers was confirmed using tau fibril seeds derived from both recombinant tau and PS19 mouse brain extracts containing human tau. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the specific form and cellular location of Aβ self-assembly when studying the relationship between Aβ and tau in future AD therapeutic development.</p>

<p>Neurotransmitter release is mediated by an evolutionarily conserved machinery. The synaptic vesicle (SV) associated protein Mover/TPRGL/SVAP30 does not occur in all species and all synapses. Little is known about its molecular properties and how it may interact with the conserved components of the presynaptic machinery. Here, we show by deletion analysis that regions required for homomeric interaction of Mover are distributed across the entire molecule, including N-terminal, central and C-terminal regions. The same regions are also required for the accumulation of Mover in presynaptic terminals of cultured neurons. Mutating two phosphorylation sites in N-terminal regions did not affect these properties. In contrast, a point mutation in the predicted Calmodulin (CaM) binding sequence of Mover abolished both homomeric interaction and presynaptic targeting. We show that this sequence indeed binds Calmodulin, and that recombinant Mover increases Calmodulin signaling upon heterologous expression. Our data suggest that presynaptic accumulation of Mover requires homomeric interaction mediated by regions distributed across large areas of the protein, and corroborate the hypothesis that Mover functionally interacts with Calmodulin signaling.</p>

<p>Adding noise to a weak input signal can enhance the response of a non-linear system, a phenomenon known as stochastic resonance (SR). SR has been demonstrated in a variety of diverse sensory systems including the visual system, where visual noise enhances human motion perception and detection performance. The SR effect has not been extensively studied in brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. This study compares the performance of BCIs based on SR-influenced steady-state motion visual evoked potentials. Stimulation paradigms were used between a periodically monochromatic motion-reversing simple ring and complex alternating checkerboard stimuli. To induce the SR effect, dynamic visual noise was masked on both the periodic simple and complex stimuli. Offline results showed that the recognition accuracy of different stimulation targets followed an inverted U-shaped function of noise level, which is a hallmark of SR. With the optimal visual noise level, the proposed visual noise masked checkerboard BCI paradigm achieved faster and more stable detection performance due to the noise-enhanced brain responses. This work demonstrates that the SR effect can be employed in BCI applications and can achieve considerable performance improvements.</p>

<p>The hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are genetic motor neuron diseases characterized by progressive degeneration of corticospinal tract axons. Mutations in SPAST, encoding the microtubule-severing ATPase spastin, are the most common causes of HSP. The broad SPAST mutational spectrum indicates a haploinsufficiency pathogenic mechanism in most cases. Most missense mutations cluster in the ATPase domain, where they disrupt the protein's ability to sever microtubules. However, several putative missense mutations in the protein's microtubule interacting and trafficking (MIT) domain have also been described, but the pathogenicity of these mutations has not been verified with functional studies. Spastin promotes endosomal tubule fission, and defects in this lead to lysosomal enzyme mistrafficking and downstream lysosomal abnormalities. We investigated the function of three disease-associated spastin MIT mutants and found that none was able to promote normal endosomal tubule fission, lysosomal enzyme receptor trafficking, or lysosomal morphology. One of the mutations affected recruitment of spastin to endosomes, a property that requires the canonical function of the MIT domain in binding endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-III proteins. However, the other mutants did not affect spastin's endosomal recruitment, raising the possibility of pathologically important non-canonical roles for the MIT domain. In conclusion, we demonstrate that spastin MIT mutants cause functional abnormalities related to the pathogenesis of HSP. These mutations do not directly affect spastin's microtubule-severing capacity, and so we identify a new molecular pathological mechanism by which spastin mutations may cause disease.</p>

<p>Cerebral palsy (CP) is a non-progressive syndrome due to a pre-, peri- or post-natal brain injury, which frequently involves an impairment of non-motor abilities. The aim of this article was to examine visuospatial attention and inhibitory control of prepotent motor responses in children with CP showing a normal IQ or mild cognitive impairment, measuring their performance in oculomotor tasks. Ten children (9–16-year-old) with spastic CP and 13 age-matched, typically developing children (TDC) participated in the study. Subjects performed a simple visually-guided saccade task and a cue-target task, in which they performed a saccade towards a peripheral target, after a non-informative visual cue was flashed 150 ms before the imperative target, either at the same (valid) or at a different (invalid) spatial position. Children with CP showed severe executive deficits in maintaining sustained attention and complying with task instructions. Furthermore, saccadic inhibitory control appeared to be significantly impaired in the presence of both stimulus-driven and goal-directed captures of attention. In fact, patients showed great difficulties in suppressing saccades not only to the cue stimuli but also to the always-present target placeholders, which represented powerful attentional attractors that had to be covertly attended throughout the task execution. Moreover, impairment did not affect in equal manner the whole visual field but showed a marked spatial selectivity in each individual subject. Saccade latencies in the cue-target task were faster in the valid than in the invalid condition in both child groups, indicating the preservation of low-level visuospatial attentive capabilities. Finally, this study provides evidence that these impairments of executive skills and in inhibitory control, following early brain injuries, manifest in childhood but recover to virtually normal level during adolescence.</p>

<p>Rapid and accurate processing of potential social threats is paramount to social thriving, and provides a clear evolutionary advantage. Though automatic processing of facial expressions has been assumed for some time, some researchers now question the extent to which this is the case. Here, we provide electrophysiological data from a psychological refractory period (PRP) dual-task paradigm in which participants had to decide whether a target face exhibited a neutral or fearful expression, as overlap with a concurrent auditory tone categorization task was experimentally manipulated. Specifically, we focused on four event-related potentials (ERP) linked to emotional face processing, covering distinct processing stages and topography: the early posterior negativity (EPN), early frontal positivity (EFP), late positive potential (LPP), and also the face-sensitive N170. As expected, there was an emotion modulation of each ERP. Most importantly, there was a significant attenuation of this emotional response proportional to the degree of task overlap for each component, except the N170. In fact, when the central overlap was greatest, this emotion-specific amplitude was statistically null for the EFP and LPP, and only marginally different from zero for the EPN. N170 emotion modulation was, on the other hand, unaffected by central overlap. Thus, our results show that emotion-specific ERPs for three out of four processing stages—i.e., perceptual encoding (EPN), emotion detection (EFP), or content evaluation (LPP)—are attenuated and even eliminated by central resource scarcity. Models assuming automatic processing should be revised to account for these results.</p>

<p>Prediction of overall survival based on multimodal MRI of brain tumor patients is a difficult problem. Although survival also depends on factors that cannot be assessed via preoperative MRI such as surgical outcome, encouraging results for MRI-based survival analysis have been published for different datasets. We assess if and how established radiomic approaches as well as novel methods can predict overall survival of brain tumor patients on the BraTS challenge dataset. This dataset consists of multimodal preoperative images of 211 glioblastoma patients from several institutions with reported resection status and known survival. In the official challenge setting, only patients with a reported gross total resection (GTR) are taken into account. We therefore evaluated previously published methods as well as different machine learning approaches on the BraTS dataset. For different types of resection status, these approaches are compared to a baseline, a linear regression on patient age only. This naive approach won the 3rd place out of 26 participants in the BraTS survival prediction challenge 2018. Previously published radiomic signatures show significant correlations and predictiveness to patient survival for patients with a reported subtotal resection. However, for patients with reported GTR, none of the evaluated approaches was able to outperform the age-only baseline in a cross-validation setting, explaining the poor performance of approaches based on radiomics in the BraTS challenge 2018.</p>

<p>Neuronal inhibition can be defined as a spatiotemporal restriction or suppression of local microcircuit activity. The importance of inhibition relies in its fundamental role in shaping signal processing in single neurons and neuronal circuits. In this context, the activity of inhibitory interneurons proved the key to endow networks with complex computational and dynamic properties. In the last 50 years, the prevailing view on the functional role of cerebellar cortical inhibitory circuits was that excitatory and inhibitory inputs sum spatially and temporally in order to determine the motor output through Purkinje cells (PCs). Consequently, cerebellar inhibition has traditionally been conceived in terms of restricting or blocking excitation. This assumption has been challenged, in particular in the cerebellar cortex where all neurons except granule cells (and unipolar brush cells in specific lobules) are inhibitory and fire spontaneously at high rates. Recently, a combination of electrophysiological recordings in vitro and in vivo, imaging, optogenetics and computational modeling, has revealed that inhibitory interneurons play a much more complex role in regulating cerebellar microcircuit functions: inhibition shapes neuronal response dynamics in the whole circuit and eventually regulate the PC output. This review elaborates current knowledge on cerebellar inhibitory interneurons [Golgi cells, Lugaro cells (LCs), basket cells (BCs) and stellate cells (SCs)], starting from their ontogenesis and moving up to their morphological, physiological and plastic properties, and integrates this knowledge with that on the more renown granule cells and PCs. We will focus on the circuit loops in which these interneurons are involved and on the way they generate feed-forward, feedback and lateral inhibition along with complex spatio-temporal response dynamics. In this perspective, inhibitory interneurons emerge as the real controllers of cerebellar functioning.</p>

<p>Spinal dorsal interneurons, which are generated during embryonic development, relay and process sensory inputs from the periphery to the central nervous system. Proper integration of these cells into neuronal circuitry depends on their correct positioning within the spinal parenchyma. Molecular cues that control neuronal migration have been extensively characterized but the genetic programs that regulate their production remain poorly investigated. Onecut (OC) transcription factors have been shown to control the migration of the dorsal interneurons (dINs) during spinal cord development. Here, we report that the OC factors moderate the expression of Pou2f2, a transcription factor essential for B-cell differentiation, in spinal dINs. Overexpression or inactivation of Pou2f2 leads to alterations in the differentiation of dI2, dI3 and Phox2a-positive dI5 populations and to defects in the distribution of dI2-dI6 interneurons. Thus, an OC-Pou2f2 genetic cascade regulates adequate diversification and distribution of dINs during embryonic development.</p>

<p>Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a deep deficit in language and social interaction, accompanied by restricted, stereotyped and repetitive behaviors. The use of genetic autism animal models has revealed that the alteration of the mechanisms controlling the formation and maturation of neural circuits are points of convergence for the physiopathological pathways in several types of autism. Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), a key multifunctional regulator of brain development, has been related to autism in several ways. However, its precise role is still elusive, in part, due to its extremely complex posttranscriptional regulation. In order to contribute to this topic, we treated prenatal rats with Valproate, a well-validated model of autism, to analyze BDNF levels in the hippocampus of juvenile rats. Valproate-treated rats exhibited an autism-like behavioral profile, characterized by a deficit in social interaction, anxiety-like behavior and repetitive behavior. In situ hybridization (ISH) experiments revealed that Valproate reduced BDNF mRNA, especially long-3′UTR-containing transcripts, in specific areas of the dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3 regions. At the same time, Valproate reduced BDNF immunoreactivity in the suprapyramidal and lucidum layers of CA3, but improved hippocampus-dependent spatial learning. The molecular changes reported here may help to explain the cognitive and behavioral signs of autism and reinforce BDNF as a potential molecular target for this neurodevelopmental disorder.</p>

<p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been proposed as a source of information for automatic prediction of individual diagnosis in schizophrenia. Optimal integration of data from different MRI modalities is an active area of research aimed at increasing diagnostic accuracy. Based on a sample of 96 patients with schizophrenia and a matched sample of 115 healthy controls that had undergone a single multimodal MRI session, we generated individual brain maps of gray matter vbm, 1back, and 2back levels of activation (nback fMRI), maps of amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (resting-state fMRI), and maps of weighted global brain connectivity (resting-state fMRI). Four unimodal classifiers (Ridge, Lasso, Random Forests, and Gradient boosting) were applied to these maps to evaluate their classification accuracies. Based on the assignments made by the algorithms on test individuals, we quantified the amount of predictive information shared between maps (what we call redundancy analysis). Finally, we explored the added accuracy provided by a set of multimodal strategies that included post-classification integration based on probabilities, two-step sequential integration, and voxel-level multimodal integration through one-dimensional-convolutional neural networks (1D-CNNs). All four unimodal classifiers showed the highest test accuracies with the 2back maps (80% on average) achieving a maximum of 84% with the Lasso. Redundancy levels between brain maps were generally low (overall mean redundancy score of 0.14 in a 0–1 range), indicating that each brain map contained differential predictive information. The highest multimodal accuracy was delivered by the two-step Ridge classifier (87%) followed by the Ridge maximum and mean probability classifiers (both with 85% accuracy) and by the 1D-CNN, which achieved the same accuracy as the best unimodal classifier (84%). From these results, we conclude that from all MRI modalities evaluated task-based fMRI may be the best unimodal diagnostic option in schizophrenia. Low redundancy values point to ample potential for accuracy improvements through multimodal integration, with the two-step Ridge emerging as a suitable strategy.</p>

<p>Animal behavioral paradigms, such as classical conditioning and operant conditioning, are an important tool to study the neural basis of cognition and behavior. These paradigms involve manipulating sensory stimuli in a way that learning processes are induced under controlled experimental conditions. However, the majority of the commercially available equipment did not offer flexibility to manipulate stimuli. Therefore, the development of most versatile devices would allow the study of more complex cognitive functions. The purpose of this work is to present a low-cost, customized and wireless-operated chamber for animal behavior conditioning, based on the joint operation of two microcontroller modules: Arduino Due and ESP8266-12E. Our results showed that the auditory stimulation system allows setting the carrier frequency in the range of 1 Hz up to more than 100 kHz and the sound stimulus can be modulated in amplitude, also over a wide range of frequencies. Likewise, foot-shock could be precisely manipulated regarding its amplitude (from ∼200 μA to ∼1500 μA) and frequency (up to 20 pulses per second). Finally, adult rats exposed to a protocol of cued fear conditioning in our device showed consistent behavioral response and electrophysiological evoked responses in the midbrain auditory pathway. Furthermore, the device developed in the current study represents an open source alternative to develop customized protocols to study fear memory under conditions of varied sensory stimuli.</p>

<p>Insects can detect the presence of discrete objects in their visual fields based on a range of differences in spatiotemporal characteristics between the images of object and background. This includes but is not limited to relative motion. Evidence suggests that edge detection is an integral part of this capability, and this study examines the ability of a bio-inspired processing model to detect the presence of boundaries between two regions of a one-dimensional visual field, based on general differences in image dynamics. The model consists of two parts. The first is an early vision module inspired by insect visual processing, which implements adaptive photoreception, ON and OFF channels with transient and sustained characteristics, and delayed and undelayed signal paths. This is replicated for a number of photoreceptors in a small linear array. It is followed by an artificial neural network trained to discriminate the presence vs. absence of an edge based on the array output signals. Input data are derived from natural imagery and feature both static and moving edges between regions with moving texture, flickering texture, and static patterns in all possible combinations. The model can discriminate the presence of edges, stationary or moving, at rates far higher than chance. The resources required (numbers of neurons and visual signals) are realistic relative to those available in the insect second optic ganglion, where the bulk of such processing would be likely to take place.</p>

<p>Evidence suggests that the pathophysiology associated with epileptic susceptibility may disturb the functional connectivity of neural circuits and compromise the brain functions, even when seizures are absent. Although memory impairment is a common comorbidity found in patients with epilepsy, it is still unclear whether more caudal structures may play a role in cognitive deficits, particularly in those cases where there is no evidence of hippocampal sclerosis. This work used a genetically selected rat strain for seizure susceptibility (Wistar audiogenic rat, WAR) and distinct behavioral (motor and memory-related tasks) and electrophysiological (inferior colliculus, IC) approaches to access acoustic primary integrative network properties. The IC neural assemblies’ response was evaluated by auditory transient (focusing on bottom-up processing) and steady-state evoked response (ASSR, centering on feedforward and feedback forces over neural circuitry). The results show that WAR displayed no disturbance in motor performance or hippocampus-dependent memory tasks. Nonetheless, WAR animals exhibited significative impairment for auditory fear conditioning (AFC) along with no indicative of IC plastic changes between the pre-conditioning and test phases (ASSR coherence analysis). Furthermore, WAR’s IC response to transient stimuli presented shorter latency and higher amplitude compared with Wistar; and the ASSR analysis showed similar results for WAR and Wistar animals under subthreshold dose of pentylenetetrazol (pro-convulsive drug) for seizure-induction. Our work demonstrated alterations at WAR IC neural network processing, which may explain the associated disturbance on AFC memory.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00062">Selectively Enhanced Development of Working Memory in Musically Trained Children and Adolescents</a></h4>

<p>In the current longitudinal study, we investigated the development of working memory in musically trained and nontrained children and adolescents, aged 9–20. We measured working memory with the Digit Span (DS) forwards and backwards tests (N = 106) and the Trail-Making A and B (TMT-A and B; N = 104) tests three times, in 2011, 2013, and 2016. We expected that musically trained participants would outperform peers with no musical training. Indeed, we found that the younger musically trained participants, in particular, outperformed their nontrained peers in the TMT-A, TMT-B and DS forwards tests. These tests all primarily require active maintenance of a rule in memory or immediate recall. In contrast, we found no group differences in the backwards test that requires manipulation and updating of information in working memory. These results suggest that musical training is more strongly associated with heightened working memory capacity and maintenance than enhanced working memory updating, especially in late childhood and early adolescence.</p>

<p>Electroencephalography (EEG) and source estimation can be used to identify brain areas activated during a task, which could offer greater insight on cortical dynamics. Source estimation requires knowledge of the locations of the EEG electrodes. This could be provided with a template or obtained by digitizing the EEG electrode locations. Operator skill and inherent uncertainties of a digitizing system likely produce a range of digitization reliabilities, which could affect source estimation and the interpretation of the estimated source locations. Here, we compared the reliabilities of five digitizing methods (ultrasound, structured-light 3D scan, infrared 3D scan, motion capture probe, and motion capture) and determined the relationship between digitization reliability and source estimation uncertainty, assuming other contributors to source estimation uncertainty were constant. We digitized a mannequin head using each method five times and quantified the reliability and validity of each method. We created five hundred sets of electrode locations based on our reliability results and applied a dipole fitting algorithm (DIPFIT) to perform source estimation. The motion capture method, which recorded the locations of markers placed directly on the electrodes had the best reliability with an average electrode variability of 0.001 cm. Then, in order of decreasing reliability were the method using a digitizing probe in the motion capture system, an infrared 3D scanner, a structured-light 3D scanner, and an ultrasound digitization system. Unsurprisingly, uncertainty of the estimated source locations increased with greater variability of EEG electrode locations and less reliable digitizing systems. If EEG electrode location variability was ∽1 cm, a single source could shift by as much as 2 cm. To help translate these distances into practical terms, we quantified Brodmann area accuracy for each digitizing method and found that the average Brodmann area accuracy for all digitizing methods was &gt;80%. Using a template of electrode locations reduced the Brodmann area accuracy to ∽50%. Overall, more reliable digitizing methods can reduce source estimation uncertainty, but the significance of the source estimation uncertainty depends on the desired spatial resolution. For accurate Brodmann area identification, any of the digitizing methods tested can be used confidently.</p>

<p>Recent evidence suggests that the cerebellum is related to motor and non-motor cognitive functions, and that several coupled cerebro-cerebellar networks exist, including links with the limbic network. Since several limbic structures are affected by Alzheimer pathology, even in the preclinical stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), we aimed to investigate the cerebral limbic network activity from the perspective of the cerebellum. Twenty patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 18 patients with AD, and 26 healthy controls (HC) were recruited to acquire Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI). We used seed-based approach to construct the cerebro-cerebellar limbic network. Two-sample t-tests were carried out to explore the differences of the cerebellar limbic network connectivity. The first result, a sub-scale network including the bilateral posterior part of the orbitofrontal cortex (POFC) extending to the anterior insular cortex (AIC) and left inferior parietal lobule (L-IPL), showed greater functional connectivity in MCI than in HC and less functional connectivity in AD than in MCI. The location of this sub-scale network was in accordance with components of the ventral attention network. Second, there was decreased functional connectivity to the right mid-cingulate cortex (MCC) in the AD and MCI patient groups relative to the HC group. As the cerebellum is not compromised by Alzheimer pathology in the prodromal stage of AD, this pattern indicates that the sub-scale ventral attention network may play a pivotal role in functional compensation through the coupled cerebro-cerebellar limbic network in MCI, and the cerebellum may be a key node in the modulation of social cognition.</p>

Electrodiffusion—that is, the interaction between electric fields and ionic diffusion—is applicable when analyzing the electrical properties of electrolytes in femto-liter compartments such as dendritic spines. In a classical electrical engineering approach, electricity in conductors is studied by linear combinations of terms like resistance and capacitance, which are the building blocks of classical electrical circuits. However, electrophysiological media are electrolyte based and thus are better modeled by electrodiffusion.

<p>Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) is being widely used for charting brain connectivity and dynamics in healthy and diseased brains. However, the resting state paradigm allows an unconstrained fluctuation of brain arousal, which may have profound effects on resting-state fMRI signals and associated connectivity/dynamic metrics. Here, we review current understandings of the relationship between resting-state fMRI and brain arousal, in particular the effect of a recently discovered event of arousal modulation on resting-state fMRI. We further discuss potential implications of arousal-related fMRI modulation with a focus on its potential role in mediating spurious correlations between resting-state connectivity/dynamics with physiology and behavior. Multiple hypotheses are formulated based on existing evidence and remain to be tested by future studies.</p>

<p>The brain–blood partition coefficient (BBPC) is necessary for quantifying cerebral blood flow (CBF) when using tracer based techniques like arterial spin labeling (ASL). A recent improvement to traditional MRI measurements of BBPC, called calibrated short TR recovery (CaSTRR), has demonstrated a significant reduction in acquisition time for BBPC maps in mice. In this study CaSTRR is applied to a cohort of healthy canines (n = 17, age = 5.0 – 8.0 years) using a protocol suited for application in humans at 3T. The imaging protocol included CaSTRR for BBPC maps, pseudo-continuous ASL for CBF maps, and high resolution anatomical images. The standard CaSTRR method of normalizing BBPC to gadolinium-doped deuterium oxide phantoms was also compared to normalization using hematocrit (Hct) as a proxy value for blood water content. The results show that CaSTRR is able to produce high quality BBPC maps with a 4 min acquisition time. The BBPC maps demonstrate significantly higher BBPC in gray matter (0.83 ± 0.05 mL/g) than in white matter (0.78 ± 0.04 mL/g, p = 0.006). Maps of CBF acquired with pCASL demonstrate a negative correlation between gray matter perfusion and age (p = 0.003). Voxel-wise correction for BBPC is also shown to improve contrast to noise ratio between gray and white matter in CBF maps. A novel aspect of the study was to show that that BBPC measurements can be calculated based on the known Hct of the blood sample placed in scanner. We found a strong correlation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.81 in gray matter, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.59 in white matter) established between BBPC maps normalized to the doped phantoms and BBPC maps normalized using Hct. This obviates the need for doped water phantoms which simplifies both the acquisition protocol and the post-processing methods. Together this suggests that CaSTRR represents a feasible, rapid method to account for BBPC variability when quantifying CBF. As canines have been used widely for aging and Alzheimer’s disease studies, the CaSTRR method established in the animals may further improve CBF measurements and advance our understanding of cerebrovascular changes in aging and neurodegeneration.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01182">Divide and Conquer: Stratifying Training Data by Tumor Grade Improves Deep Learning-Based Brain Tumor Segmentation</a></h4>

<p>It is a general assumption in deep learning that more training data leads to better performance, and that models will learn to generalize well across heterogeneous input data as long as that variety is represented in the training set. Segmentation of brain tumors is a well-investigated topic in medical image computing, owing primarily to the availability of a large publicly-available dataset arising from the long-running yearly Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge. Research efforts and publications addressing this dataset focus predominantly on technical improvements of model architectures and less on properties of the underlying data. Using the dataset and the method ranked third in the BraTS 2018 challenge, we performed experiments to examine the impact of tumor type on segmentation performance. We propose to stratify the training dataset into high-grade glioma (HGG) and low-grade glioma (LGG) subjects and train two separate models. Although we observed only minor gains in overall mean dice scores by this stratification, examining case-wise rankings of individual subjects revealed statistically significant improvements. Compared to a baseline model trained on both HGG and LGG cases, two separately trained models led to better performance in 64.9% of cases (p &lt; 0.0001) for the tumor core. An analysis of subjects which did not profit from stratified training revealed that cases were missegmented which had poor image quality, or which presented clinically particularly challenging cases (e.g., underrepresented subtypes such as IDH1-mutant tumors), underlining the importance of such latent variables in the context of tumor segmentation. In summary, we found that segmentation models trained on the BraTS 2018 dataset, stratified according to tumor type, lead to a significant increase in segmentation performance. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this gain in segmentation performance is evident in the case-wise ranking of individual subjects but not in summary statistics. We conclude that it may be useful to consider the segmentation of brain tumors of different types or grades as separate tasks, rather than developing one tool to segment them all. Consequently, making this information available for the test data should be considered, potentially leading to a more clinically relevant BraTS competition.</p>

<p>Background: Multi-compartment cable models of auditory nerve fibers have been developed to assist in the improvement of cochlear implants. With the advancement of computational technology and the results obtained from in vivo and in vitro experiments, these models have evolved to incorporate a considerable degree of morphological and physiological details. They have also been combined with three-dimensional volume conduction models of the cochlea to simulate neural responses to electrical stimulation. However, no specific rules have been provided on choosing the appropriate cable model, and most models adopted in recent studies were chosen without a specific reason or by inheritance.</p><p>Methods: Three of the most cited biophysical multi-compartment cable models of the human auditory nerve, i.e., Rattay et al. (2001b), Briaire and Frijns (2005), and Smit et al. (2010), were implemented in this study. Several properties of single fibers were compared among the three models, including threshold, conduction velocity, action potential shape, latency, refractory properties, as well as stochastic and temporal behaviors. Experimental results regarding these properties were also included as a reference for comparison.</p><p>Results: For monophasic single-pulse stimulation, the ratio of anodic vs. cathodic thresholds in all models was within the experimental range despite a much larger ratio in the model by Briaire and Frijns. For biphasic pulse-train stimulation, thresholds as a function of both pulse rate and pulse duration differed between the models, but none matched the experimental observations even coarsely. Similarly, for all other properties including the conduction velocity, action potential shape, and latency, the models presented different outcomes and not all of them fell within the range observed in experiments.</p><p>Conclusions: While all three models presented similar values in certain single fiber properties to those obtained in experiments, none matched all experimental observations satisfactorily. In particular, the adaptation and temporal integration behaviors were completely missing in all models. Further extensions and analyses are required to explain and simulate realistic auditory nerve fiber responses to electrical stimulation.</p>

<p>A number of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) protocols have been developed for modulating brain function non-invasively. To identify the most powerful one, these protocols have been compared in the context of the motor system. However, to what extent the conclusions could be generalized to high-level functions is largely unknown. In this study, we compared the modulatory effect of three excitatory rTMS protocols on high-level cognition represented by response inhibition ability. Our first experiment revealed that intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) could significantly improve reaction time in a stop signal task, while 5-Hz and 25-Hz stimuli were ineffective. This iTBS effect was significantly higher than that for the sham simulation and only occurred in the second session of the stop signal task after iTBS in the first experiment. However, this aftereffect of iTBS was not reproduced in the second experiment, indicating high variability across subjects. Thus, on the one hand, our findings indicate that iTBS on the pre-SMA could improve inhibitory control, but on the other hand, the reliability and reproducibility of this effect needs further investigation.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00077">Beta-Band Resonance and Intrinsic Oscillations in a Biophysically Detailed Model of the Subthalamic Nucleus-Globus Pallidus Network</a></h4>

<p>Increased beta-band oscillatory activity in the basal ganglia network is associated with Parkinsonian motor symptoms and is suppressed with medication and deep brain stimulation (DBS). The origins of the beta-band oscillations, however, remains unclear with both intrinsic oscillations arising within the subthalamic nucleus (STN)—external globus pallidus (GPe) network and exogenous beta-activity, originating outside the network, proposed as potential sources of the pathological activity. The aim of this study was to explore the relative contribution of autonomous oscillations and exogenous oscillatory inputs in the generation of pathological oscillatory activity in a biophysically detailed model of the parkinsonian STN-GPe network. The network model accounts for the integration of synaptic currents and their interaction with intrinsic membrane currents in dendritic structures within the STN and GPe. The model was used to investigate the development of beta-band synchrony and bursting within the STN-GPe network by changing the balance of excitation and inhibition in both nuclei, and by adding exogenous oscillatory inputs with varying phase relationships through the hyperdirect cortico-subthalamic and indirect striato-pallidal pathways. The model showed an intrinsic susceptibility to beta-band oscillations that was manifest in weak autonomously generated oscillations within the STN-GPe network and in selective amplification of exogenous beta-band synaptic inputs near the network's endogenous oscillation frequency. The frequency at which this resonance peak occurred was determined by the net level of excitatory drive to the network. Intrinsic or endogenously generated oscillations were too weak to support a pacemaker role for the STN-GPe network, however, they were considerably amplified by sparse cortical beta inputs and were further amplified by striatal beta inputs that promoted anti-phase firing of the cortex and GPe, resulting in maximum transient inhibition of STN neurons. The model elucidates a mechanism of cortical patterning of the STN-GPe network through feedback inhibition whereby intrinsic susceptibility to beta-band oscillations can lead to phase locked spiking under parkinsonian conditions. These results point to resonance of endogenous oscillations with exogenous patterning of the STN-GPe network as a mechanism of pathological synchronization, and a role for the pallido-striatal feedback loop in amplifying beta oscillations.</p>

<p>The literature is extensive on how hypertension affects the morphology and function of the central nervous system (CNS) and is being focused on multiple organ damage involving the kidneys, heart, endothelium and retina. Hypertension damage to the peripheral nervous system is less explored in the literature. We have previously shown morphometric alterations in large and small caliber myelinated fibers of nerves in the adult spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). However, the functional correlation of these findings has not been explored. We performed an electrophysiological investigation of hind limb nerves in SHR of both genders in different ages. Normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were used as controls. Electrophysiological recordings and determination of motor (MCV) and sensory (SCV) nerve conduction velocity were performed in the same animals at four different ages: 5, 8, 20 and 40 weeks after birth. Comparisons were made between ages, genders and animal strain. We showed a continuous body weight increase in adult life in all animals studied. MCV got stable at 20-week old hypertensive animals and continued to increase in normotensive ones. The SCV was constant between the ages of 20 and 40 weeks old in female SHR and decreased in male SHR while it continued to increase in WKY animals. The electrophysiological investigation of the nerves in WKY and SHR from both genders and different ages, associated with morphological and morphometric data from the literature suggest that hypertension affects the nerve function and might corroborate the development of a peripheral neuropathy.</p>

<p>Cognitive control is essential for flexible, top-down, goal-directed behavior. Individuals with Internet gaming disorder (IGD) are characterized by impaired prefrontal cortex function and cognitive control. This results in an increase in stimulus-driven habitual behavior, particularly related to pathological gaming. In the present study, we investigated the electroencephalographic (EEG) activity in individuals with IGD. Twenty-four individuals with IGD and 35 healthy control (HC) subjects were recruited. We analyzed their EEG activity while the subjects played their favorite game (30–40 min duration). We compared the band power between the two groups. During gaming, the left frontal theta, alpha, and beta band activities were lower in subjects with IGD than in HCs. Moreover, the left frontal theta power negatively correlated with IGD severity. These results indicate that left frontal theta power could be used as a neurophysiological biomarker for the detection of diminished cognitive control patterns in individuals with IGD.</p>

<p>The utility of premovement electroencephalography (EEG) for decoding movement intention during a reaching task has been demonstrated. However, the kind of information the brain represents regarding the intended target during movement preparation remains unknown. In the present study, we investigated which movement parameters (i.e., direction, distance, and positions for reaching) can be decoded in premovement EEG decoding. Eight participants performed 30 types of reaching movements that consisted of 1 of 24 movement directions, 7 movement distances, 5 horizontal target positions, and 5 vertical target positions. Event-related spectral perturbations were extracted using independent components, some of which were selected via an analysis of variance for further binary classification analysis using a support vector machine. When each parameter was used for class labeling, all possible binary classifications were performed. Classification accuracies for direction and distance were significantly higher than chance level, although no significant differences were observed for position. For the classification in which each movement was considered as a different class, the parameters comprising two vectors representing each movement were analyzed. In this case, classification accuracies were high when differences in distance were high, the sum of distances was high, angular differences were large, and differences in the target positions were high. The findings further revealed that direction and distance may provide the largest contributions to movement. In addition, regardless of the parameter, useful features for classification are easily found over the parietal and occipital areas.</p>

A genetically defined population of L6 CT cells project to infragranular GABAergic interneurons that hyperpolarize neurons in somatosensory barrel cortex (BC). Optogenetic activation of these neurons switched BC to an adapted mode in which excitatory cells lost their angular tuning. In contrast, however, this was not the case with a general activation of inhibitory interneurons via optogenetic activation of Gad2-expressing cells. The decrease in angular tuning, when L6 CT cells were activated, was due to changes in cortical inhibition, and not inherited from changes in the thalamic output. Furthermore, L6 CT driven cortical inhibition, but not the general activation of GABAergic interneurons, abolished adaptation to whisker responses. In the present study, evidence is presented that a subpopulation of L6 CT activates a specific circuit of GABAergic interneurons that will predispose neocortex toward processing of tactile information requiring multiple whisker touches, such as in a texture discrimination task.</p>

<p>N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptor 1 (NMDAR)-linked Ca<sup>++</sup> current represents a significant percentage of post-synaptic transient that modulates synaptic strength and is pertinent to dendritic spine plasticity. In the hippocampus, Ca<sup>++</sup> transient produced by glutamatergic ionotropic neurotransmission facilitates Ca<sup>++</sup>-Calmodulin-dependent kinase 2 (CaMKII) Thr286 phosphorylation and promote long-term potentiation (LTP) expression. At CA1 post-synaptic densities, Ca<sup>++</sup> transients equally activate small conductance (SK2) channel which regulates excitability by suppressing Ca<sup>++</sup> movement. Here, we demonstrate that upstream attenuation of GluN1 function in the hippocampus led to a decrease in Thr286 CaMKIIα phosphorylation, and increased SK2 expression. Consistent with the loss of GluN1 function, potentiation of SK channel in wild type hippocampus reduced CaMKIIα expression and abrogate synaptic localization of T286 pCaMKIIα. Our results demonstrate that positive modulation of SK channel at hippocampal synapses likely refine GluN1-linked plasticity by tuning dendritic localization of CaMKIIα.</p>

<p>Rats can be trained to associate relative spatial locations of objects with the spatial location of rewards. Here we ask whether rats can localize static silent objects with other body parts in the dark, and if so with what resolution. We addressed these questions in trained rats, whose interactions with the objects were tracked at high-resolution before and after whisker trimming. We found that rats can use other body parts, such as trunk and ears, to localize objects. Localization resolution with non-whisking body parts (henceforth, ‘body’) was poorer than that obtained with whiskers, even when left with a single whisker at each side. Part of the superiority of whiskers was obtained via the use of multiple contacts. Transfer from whisker to body localization occurred within one session, provided that body contacts with the objects occurred before whisker trimming, or in the next session otherwise. This transfer occurred whether temporal cues were used for discrimination or when discrimination was based on spatial cues alone. Rats’ decision in each trial was based on the sensory cues acquired in that trial and on decisions and reward locations in previous trials. When sensory cues were acquired by body contacts, rat decisions relied more on the reward location in previous trials. Overall, the results suggest that rats can generalize the idea of relative object location across different body parts, while preferring to rely on whiskers-based localization, which occurs earlier and conveys higher resolution.</p>

<p>Neurons perform computations by integrating inputs from thousands of synapses—mostly in the dendritic tree—to drive action potential firing in the axon. One fruitful approach to studying this process is to record from neurons using patch-clamp electrodes, fill the recorded neurons with a substance that allows subsequent staining, reconstruct the three-dimensional architectures of the dendrites, and use the resulting functional and structural data to develop computer models of dendritic integration. Accurately producing quantitative reconstructions of dendrites is typically a tedious process taking many hours of manual inspection and measurement. Here we present ShuTu, a new software package that facilitates accurate and efficient reconstruction of dendrites imaged using bright-field microscopy. The program operates in two steps: (1) automated identification of dendritic processes, and (2) manual correction of errors in the automated reconstruction. This approach allows neurons with complex dendritic morphologies to be reconstructed rapidly and efficiently, thus facilitating the use of computer models to study dendritic structure-function relationships and the computations performed by single neurons.</p>

<p>Resting state networks (RSNs) extracted from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans are believed to reflect the intrinsic organization and network structure of brain regions. Most traditional methods for computing RSNs typically assume these functional networks are static throughout the duration of a scan lasting 5–15 min. However, they are known to vary on timescales ranging from seconds to years; in addition, the dynamic properties of RSNs are affected in a wide variety of neurological disorders. Recently, there has been a proliferation of methods for characterizing RSN dynamics, yet it remains a challenge to extract reproducible time-resolved networks. In this paper, we develop a novel method based on dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) to extract networks from short windows of noisy, high-dimensional fMRI data, allowing RSNs from single scans to be resolved robustly at a temporal resolution of seconds. After validating the method on a synthetic dataset, we analyze data from 120 individuals from the Human Connectome Project and show that unsupervised clustering of DMD modes discovers RSNs at both the group (gDMD) and the single subject (sDMD) levels. The gDMD modes closely resemble canonical RSNs. Compared to established methods, sDMD modes capture individualized RSN structure that both better resembles the population RSN and better captures subject-level variation. We further leverage this time-resolved sDMD analysis to infer occupancy and transitions among RSNs with high reproducibility. This automated DMD-based method is a powerful tool to characterize spatial and temporal structures of RSNs in individual subjects.</p>

<p>Publication date: October 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 58</p><p>Author(s): Sander W Keemink, Christian K Machens</p><div><p>A central tenet of neuroscience is that the brain works through large populations of interacting neurons. With recent advances in recording techniques, the inner working of these populations has come into full view. Analyzing the resulting large-scale data sets is challenging because of the often complex and ‘mixed’ dependency of neural activities on experimental parameters, such as stimuli, decisions, or motor responses. Here we review recent insights gained from analyzing these data with dimensionality reduction methods that ‘demix’ these dependencies. We demonstrate that the mappings from (carefully chosen) experimental parameters to population activities appear to be typical and stable across tasks, brain areas, and animals, and are often identifiable by linear methods. By considering when and why dimensionality reduction and demixing work well, we argue for a view of population coding in which populations represent (demixed) latent signals, corresponding to stimuli, decisions, motor responses, and so on. These latent signals are encoded into neural population activity via non-linear mappings and decoded via linear readouts. We explain how such a scheme can facilitate the propagation of information across cortical areas, and we review neural network architectures that can reproduce the encoding and decoding of latent signals in population activities. These architectures promise a link from the biophysics of single neurons to the activities of neural populations.</p></div>

We propose that in the visual system, novelty representations are not configured with the principal goal of detecting novel objects, but rather with the broader goal of flexibly generalizing novelty information across different states in the service of driving novelty-based learning.</p></div>

<p>Publication date: October 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 58</p><p>Author(s): József Fiser, Gábor Lengyel</p><div><p>System-level learning of sensory information is traditionally divided into two domains: perceptual learning that focuses on acquiring knowledge suitable for fine discrimination between similar sensory inputs, and statistical learning that explores the mechanisms that develop complex representations of unfamiliar sensory experiences. The two domains have been typically treated in complete separation both in terms of the underlying computational mechanisms and the brain areas and processes implementing those computations. However, a number of recent findings in both domains call in question this strict separation. We interpret classical and more recent results in the general framework of probabilistic computation, provide a unifying view of how various aspects of the two domains are interlinked, and suggest how the probabilistic approach can also alleviate the problem of dealing with widely different types of neural correlates of learning. Finally, we outline several directions along which our proposed approach fosters new types of experiments that can promote investigations of natural learning in humans and other species.</p></div>

Classical approaches that investigate our ability to extract the principles of organisation that govern complex environments focus on reward-based learning. Yet, the human brain is shown to be expert at learning generative structure based on mere exposure and without explicit reward. Individuals are shown to adapt to–unbeknownst to them–changes in the environment’s temporal statistics and predict future events. Further, we present evidence for a common brain architecture for unsupervised structure learning and reward-based learning, suggesting that the brain is built on the premise that ‘learning is its own reward’ to support adaptive behaviour.</p></div>

Analysis of complex dynamical systems is also at the heart of control engineering, where it is central to the design of robust control strategies. Although a rich engineering literature has grown over decades to facilitate the analysis of such systems, little of it has percolated into neuroscience so far. Here, we give a brief introduction to a number of core control-theoretic concepts that provide useful perspectives on neural circuit dynamics. We introduce important mathematical tools related to these concepts, and establish connections to neural circuit analysis, focusing on a number of themes that have arisen from the modern ‘state-space’ view on neural population dynamics.</p></div>

Transitions from quiescent to aroused or task-engaged behavioral states are associated with common motifs of network activity, including changes in correlations and enhanced sensory encoding. Evidence points to a key role for selective activation of specific GABAergic interneuron populations in mediating mode-switching in cortical networks.

Recent experiments reveal that neuronal representations of learned sensorimotor tasks continually change over days and weeks, even after animals have achieved expert behavioral performance. How is learned information stored to allow consistent behavior despite ongoing changes in neuronal activity? What functions could ongoing reconfiguration serve? We highlight recent experimental evidence for such representational drift in sensorimotor systems, and discuss how this fits into a framework of distributed population codes. We identify recent theoretical work that suggests computational roles for drift and argue that the recurrent and distributed nature of sensorimotor representations permits drift while limiting disruptive effects. We propose that representational drift may create error signals between interconnected brain regions that can be used to keep neural codes consistent in the presence of continual change. These concepts suggest experimental and theoretical approaches to studying both learning and maintenance of distributed and adaptive population codes.</p></div>

Careful quantification of animal movements can also provide a more complete picture of how movements shape neural dynamics and reflect changes in brain state, such as arousal or stress.

Neurophysiological evidence from primate area V4 supports a third alternative — the joint, but independent, encoding of form and texture — that would be advantageous for segmenting objects from the background in natural scenes and for object recognition that is independent of surface texture.

We highlight recent results of correlational and causal examinations of choice and choice-history signals in sensory, and in part sensorimotor, cortex and address formal statistical frameworks to infer causal interactions from data.</p></div>

<p>Publication date: October 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 58</p><p>Author(s): Alison I Weber, Adrienne L Fairhall</p><div><p>The concept of ‘neural coding’ supposes that neural firing patterns in some sense represent some external correlate, whether sensory, motor, or structural knowledge about the world. While the implied existence of a one-to-one mapping between external referents and neural firing has been useful, the prevalence of adaptation challenges this. Adaptation provides neural responses with dynamics on timescales that range from milliseconds up to many seconds. These timescales are highly relevant for sensory experience in the natural world, in which local statistical properties of inputs change continuously, and are additionally altered by active sensing. Adaptation has a number of consequences for coding: it creates short-term history dependence; it engenders complex feature selectivity that is time-varying; and it can serve to enhance information representation in dynamic environments. Considering how to best incorporate adaptation into neural models exposes a fundamental dichotomy in approaches to the description of neural systems: ones that take an explicitly ‘coding’ perspective versus ones that describe the system’s dynamics. Here we discuss the pros and cons of different approaches to the modeling of adaptive dynamics.</p></div>

<p>Much of our present understanding of the function and operation of the basal ganglia rests on models of anatomical connectivity derived from tract-tracing approaches in rodents and primates. However, the last years have been characterized by promising step forwards in the in vivo investigation and comprehension of brain connectivity in humans. The aim of this review is to revise the current knowledge on basal ganglia circuits, highlighting similarities and differences across species, in order to widen the current perspective on the intricate model of the basal ganglia system. This will allow us to explore the implications of additional direct pathways running from cortex to basal ganglia and between basal ganglia and cerebellum recently described in animals and humans.</p>

<p>Epilepsy is associated with numerous neurodevelopmental disorders. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex coupled with electromyography (EMG) enables biomarkers that provide measures of cortical excitation and inhibition that are particularly relevant to epilepsy and related disorders. The motor threshold (MT), cortical silent period (CSP), short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), intracortical facilitation (ICF), and long interval intracortical inhibition (LICI) are among TMS-derived metrics that are modulated by antiepileptic drugs. TMS may have a practical role in optimization of antiepileptic medication regimens, as studies demonstrate dose-dependent relationships between TMS metrics and acute medication administration. A close association between seizure freedom and normalization of cortical excitability with long-term antiepileptic drug use highlights a plausible utility of TMS in measures of anti-epileptic drug efficacy. Finally, TMS-derived biomarkers distinguish patients with various epilepsies from healthy controls and thus may enable development of disorder-specific biomarkers and therapies both within and outside of the epilepsy realm.</p>

<p>There are no effective treatments for cocaine use disorder (CUD), a chronic, relapsing brain disease characterized by dysregulated circuits related to cue reactivity, reward processing, response inhibition, and executive control. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has the potential to modulate circuits and networks implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders, including addiction. Although acute applications of TMS have reduced craving in urine-negative cocaine users, the tolerability and safety of administering accelerated TMS to cocaine-positive individuals is unknown. As such, we performed a proof-of-concept study employing an intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) protocol in an actively cocaine-using sample. Although our main goal was to assess the tolerability and safety of administering three iTBS sessions daily, we also hypothesized that iTBS would reduce cocaine use in this non-treatment seeking cohort. We recruited 19 individuals with CUD to receive three open-label iTBS sessions per day, with approximately a 60-min interval between sessions, for 10 days over a 2-week period (30 total iTBS sessions). iTBS was delivered to left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) with neuronavigation guidance. Compliance and safety were assessed throughout the trial. Cocaine use behavior was assessed before, during, and after the intervention and at 1- and 4-week follow-up visits. Of the 335 iTBS sessions applied, 73% were performed on participants with cocaine-positive urine tests. Nine of the 14 participants who initiated treatment received at least 26 of 30 iTBS sessions and returned for the 4-week follow-up visit. These individuals reduced their weekly cocaine consumption by 78% in amount of dollars spent and 70% in days of use relative to pre-iTBS cocaine use patterns. Similarly, individuals reduced their weekly consumption of nicotine, alcohol, and THC, suggesting iTBS modulated a common circuit across drugs of abuse. iTBS was well-tolerated, despite the expected occasional headaches. A single participant developed a transient neurological event of uncertain etiology on iTBS day 9 and cocaine-induced psychosis 2 weeks after discontinuation. It thus appears that accelerated iTBS to left dlPFC administered in active, chronic cocaine users is both feasible and tolerable in actively using cocaine participants with preliminary indications of efficacy in reducing both the amount and frequency of cocaine (and other off target drug) use. The neural underpinnings of these behavioral changes could help in the future development of effective treatment of CUD.</p>

<p>A challenge in motor control research is to understand the mechanisms underlying the transformation of sensory information into arm motor commands. Here, we investigated these transformation mechanisms for movements whose targets were defined by information issued from body rotations in the dark (i.e., idiothetic information). Immediately after being rotated, participants reproduced the amplitude of their perceived rotation using their arm (Experiment 1). The cortical activation during movement planning was analyzed using electroencephalography and source analyses. Task-related activities were found in regions of interest (ROIs) located in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), dorsal premotor cortex, dorsal region of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the sensorimotor cortex. Importantly, critical regions for the cognitive encoding of space did not show significant task-related activities. These results suggest that arm movements were planned using a sensorimotor-type of spatial representation. However, when a 8 s delay was introduced between body rotation and the arm movement (Experiment 2), we found that areas involved in the cognitive encoding of space [e.g., ventral premotor cortex (vPM), rostral ACC, inferior and superior posterior parietal cortex (PPC)] showed task-related activities. Overall, our results suggest that the use of a cognitive-type of representation for planning arm movement after body motion is necessary when relevant spatial information must be stored before triggering the movement.</p>

<p>Spatial orientation relies on a representation of the position and orientation of the body relative to the surrounding environment. When navigating in the environment, this representation must be constantly updated taking into account the direction, speed, and amplitude of body motion. Visual information plays an important role in this updating process, notably via optical flow. Here, we systematically investigated how the size and the simulated portion of the field of view (FoV) affect perceived visual speed of human observers. We propose a computational model to account for the patterns of human data. This model is composed of hierarchical cells' layers that model the neural processing stages of the dorsal visual pathway. Specifically, we consider that the activity of the MT area is processed by populations of modeled MST cells that are sensitive to the differential components of the optical flow, thus producing selectivity for specific patterns of optical flow. Our results indicate that the proposed computational model is able to describe the experimental evidence and it could be used to predict expected biases of speed perception for conditions in which only some portions of the visual field are visible.</p>

<p>Spontaneous neural activities are endowed with specific patterning characterized by synchronizations within functionally relevant distant regions that are termed as resting-state networks (RSNs). Although the mechanisms that organize the large-scale neural systems are still largely unknown, recent studies have proposed a hypothesis that network-specific coactivations indeed emerge as the result of globally propagating neural activities with specific paths of transmission. However, the extent to which such a centralized global regulation, rather than network-specific control, contributes to the RSN synchronization remains unknown. In the present study, we investigated the contribution from each mechanism by directly identifying the global as well as local component of resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) data provided by human connectome project, using temporal independent component analysis (ICA). Based on the spatial distribution pattern, each ICA component was classified as global or local. Time lag mapping of each IC revealed several paths of global or semi-global propagations that are partially overlapping yet spatially distinct to each other. Consistent with previous studies, the time lag of global oscillation, although being less spatially homogenous than what was assumed to be, contributed to the RSN synchronization. However, an equivalent contribution was also shown on the part of the more locally confined activities that are independent to each other. While allowing the view that network-specific coactivation occurs as part of the sequences of global neural activities, these results further confirm an equally important role of the network-specific regulation for its coactivation, regardless of whether vascular artifacts contaminate the global component in fMRI measures.</p>

<p>The cerebellum is involved in sensorimotor, cognitive, and emotional functions through cerebello-cerebral connectivity. Cerebellar neurostimulation thus likely affects cortical circuits, as has been shown in studies using cerebellar stimulation to treat neurological disorders through modulation of frontal EEG oscillations. Here we studied the effects of different frequencies of cerebellar stimulation on oscillations and coherence in the cerebellum and prefrontal cortex in the urethane-anesthetized rat. Local field potentials were recorded in the right lateral cerebellum (Crus I/II) and bilaterally in the prefrontal cortex (frontal association area, FrA) in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Stimulation was delivered to the cerebellar vermis (lobule VII) using single pulses (0.2 Hz for 60 s), or repeated pulses at 1 Hz (30 s), 5 Hz (10 s), 25 Hz (2 s), and 50 Hz (1 s). Effects of stimulation were influenced by the initial state of EEG activity which varies over time during urethane-anesthesia; 1 Hz stimulation was more effective when delivered during the slow-wave state (Stage 1), while stimulation with single-pulse, 25, and 50 Hz showed stronger effects during the activated state (Stage 2). Single-pulses resulted in increases in oscillatory power in the delta and theta bands for the cerebellum, and in frequencies up to 80 Hz in cortical sites. 1 Hz stimulation induced a decrease in 0–30 Hz activity and increased activity in the 30–200 Hz range, in the right FrA. 5 Hz stimulation reduced power in high frequencies in Stage 1 and induced mixed effects during Stage 2.25 Hz stimulation increased cortical power at low frequencies during Stage 2, and increased power in higher frequency bands during Stage 1. Stimulation at 50 Hz increased delta-band power in all recording sites, with the strongest and most rapid effects in the cerebellum. 25 and 50 Hz stimulation also induced state-dependent effects on cerebello-cortical and cortico-cortical coherence at high frequencies. Cerebellar stimulation can therefore entrain field potential activity in the FrA and drive synchronization of cerebello-cortical and cortico-cortical networks in a frequency-dependent manner. These effects highlight the role of the cerebellar vermis in modulating large-scale synchronization of neural networks in non-motor frontal cortex.</p>

<p>This study investigated the corticospinal excitability of reciprocal muscles during tasks involving sensory difference between proprioceptive and visual inputs. Participants were instructed to relax their muscles and to observe a screen during vibratory stimulation. A video screen was placed on the board covering the right hand and forearm. Participants were randomly tested in four conditions: resting, control, static, and dynamic. The resting condition involved showing a black screen, the control condition, a mosaic patterned static videoclip; the static condition, a static videoclip of wrist flexion 0°; and the dynamic condition, a videoclip that corresponded to each participant’s closely-matched illusory wrist flexion angle and speed by vibration. Vibratory stimulation (frequency 80 Hz and duration 4 s) was applied to the distal tendon of the dominant right extensor carpi radialis (ECR) using a tendon vibrator in the control, static, and dynamic conditions. Four seconds after the vibratory stimulation (end of vibration), the primary motor cortex at the midpoint between the centers of gravity of the flexor carpi radialis (FCR) and ECR muscles was stimulated by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The ECR motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes significantly increased in the control condition compared to the resting condition, whereas the FCR MEP amplitudes did not change between the resting and control conditions. In addition, the ECR MEP amplitudes significantly increased in the static condition compared to the dynamic condition. However, the FCR MEP amplitudes significantly increased in the dynamic condition compared to the static condition. These results imply that the difference between visuo-proprioceptive information had an effect on corticospinal excitability for the muscle. In conclusion, we found that proprioceptive and visual information differentially altered the corticospinal excitability of reciprocal muscles.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01151">BAF45D Downregulation in Spinal Cord Ependymal Cells Following Spinal Cord Injury in Adult Rats and Its Potential Role in the Development of Neuronal Lesions</a></h4>

<p>The endogenous spinal cord ependymal cells (SCECs), which form the central canal (CC), are critically involved in proliferation, differentiation and migration after spinal cord injury (SCI) and represents a repair cell source in treating SCI. Previously, we reported that BAF45D is expressed in the SCECs and the spinal cord neurons in adult mice and knockdown of BAF45D fail to induce expression of PAX6, a neurogenic fate determinant, during early neural differentiation of human embryonic stem cells. However, the effects of SCI on expression of BAF45D have not been reported. The aim of this study is to explore the expression and potential role of BAF45D in rat SCI model. In this study, adult rats were randomly divided into intact, sham, and SCI groups. We first explored expression of BAF45D in the SCECs in intact adult rats. We then explored SCI-induced loss of motor neurons and lesion of neurites in the anterior horns induced by the SCI. We also investigated whether the SCI-induced lesions in SCECs are accompanied by the motor neuron lesions. Finally, we examined the effect of BAF45D knockdown on cell growth in neuro2a cells. Our data showed that BAF45D is expressed in SCECs, neurons, and oligodendrocytes but not astrocytes in the spinal cords of intact adult rats. After SCI, the structure of CC was disrupted and the BAF45D-positive SCEC-derivatives were decreased. During the early stages of SCI, when shape of CC was affected but there was no disruption in circular structure of the SCECs, it was evident that there was a significant reduction in the number of neurites and motor neurons in the anterior horns compared with those of intact rats. In comparison, a complete loss of SCECs accompanied by further loss of motor neurons but not neurites was observed at the later stage. BAF45D knockdown was also found to inhibit cell growth in neuro2a cells. These results highlight the decreased expression of BAF45D in SCI-injured SCECs and the potential role of BAF45D downregulation in development of neuronal lesion after SCI in adult rats.</p>
