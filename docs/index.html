              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18670">Traits and tangles: An analysis of the Big Five paradigm by tangle-based clustering</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.18670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the recently developed mathematical theory of tangles, we re-assess the mathematical foundations for applications of the five factor model in personality tests by a new, mathematically rigorous, quantitative method. Our findings broadly confirm the validity of current tests, but also show that more detailed information can be extracted from existing data. We found that the big five traits appear at different levels of scrutiny. Some already emerge at a coarse resolution of our tools at which others cannot yet be discerned, while at a resolution where these _can_ be discerned, and distinguished, some of the former traits are no longer visible but have split into more refined traits or disintegrated altogether. We also identified traits other than the five targeted in those tests. These include more general traits combining two or more of the big five, as well as more specific traits refining some of them. All our analysis is structural and quantitative, and thus rigorous in explicitly defined mathematical terms. Since tangles, once computed, can be described concisely in terms of very few explicit statements referring only to the test questions used, our findings are also directly open to interpretation by experts in psychology. Tangle analysis can be applied similarly to other topics in psychology. Our paper is intended to serve as a first indication of what may be possible.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18916">Decoding Imagined Movement in People with Multiple Sclerosis for Brain-Computer Interface Translation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.18916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a heterogeneous autoimmune-mediated disorder affecting the central nervous system, commonly manifesting as fatigue and progressive limb impairment. This can significantly impact quality of life due to weakness or paralysis in the upper and lower limbs. A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) aims to restore quality of life through control of an external device, such as a wheelchair. However, the limited BCI research in people with MS is insufficient. The current study aims to expand on the current MS-BCI literature by highlighting the feasibility of decoding MS imagined movement. We collected electroencephalography (EEG) data from eight participants with various symptoms of MS and ten neurotypical control participants. Participants made imagined movements of the hands and feet as directed by a go no-go protocol. Binary regularised linear discriminant analysis was used to classify imagined movement at individual time-frequency points. The frequency bands which provided the maximal accuracy, and the associated latency, were compared. In all MS participants, the classification algorithm achieved above 70% accuracy in at least one imagined movement vs. rest classification and most movement vs. movement classifications. There was no significant difference between classification of limbs with weakness or paralysis to neurotypical controls. Both the MS and control groups possessed decodable information within the alpha (7-13 Hz) and beta (16-30 Hz) bands at similar latency. This study is the first to demonstrate the feasibility of decoding imagined movements in people with MS. As an alternative to the P300 response, motor imagery-based control of a BCI may also be combined with existing motor imagery therapy to supplement MS rehabilitation. These promising results merit further long term BCI studies to investigate the effect of MS progression on classification performance.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19664">The role of inhibitory neuronal variability in modulating phase diversity between coupled networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.19664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuronal heterogeneity, characterized by the presence of a multitude of spiking neuronal patterns, is a widespread phenomenon throughout the nervous system. In particular, the brain exhibits strong variability among inhibitory neurons. Despite the huge neuronal heterogeneity across brain regions, which in principle could decrease synchronization, cortical areas coherently oscillate during various cognitive tasks. Therefore, the functional significance of neuronal heterogeneity remains a subject of active investigation. Previous studies typically focus on the role of heterogeneity in the dynamic properties of only one population. Here, we explore how different types of inhibitory neurons can contribute to the diversity of the phase relations between two cortical areas. This research sheds light on the potential impact of local properties, such as neuronal variability, on communication between distant brain regions. We show that both homogeneous and heterogeneous inhibitory networks can exhibit phase diversity and nonintuitive regimes such as anticipated synchronization (AS) and phase bistability. It has been proposed that the bi-stable phase could be related to bi-stable perception, such as in the Necker cube. Moreover, we show that heterogeneity enlarges the region of zero-lag synchronization and bistability. We also show that the parameter controlling inhibitory heterogeneity modulates the transition from the usual delayed synchronization regime (DS) to AS. Finally, we show that the inhibitory heterogeneity drives the internal dynamics of the free-running population. Therefore, we suggest a possible mechanism to explain when the DS-AS transition occurs via zero-lag synchronization or bi-stability.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19840">Neuroplasticity and Psychedelics: a comprehensive examination of classic and non-classic compounds in pre and clinical models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.19840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuroplasticity, the ability of the nervous system to adapt throughout an organism's lifespan, offers potential as both a biomarker and treatment target for neuropsychiatric conditions. Psychedelics, a burgeoning category of drugs, are increasingly prominent in psychiatric research, prompting inquiries into their mechanisms of action. Distinguishing themselves from traditional medications, psychedelics demonstrate rapid and enduring therapeutic effects after a single or few administrations, believed to stem from their neuroplasticity-enhancing properties. This review examines how classic psychedelics (e.g., LSD, psilocybin, N,N-DMT) and non-classic psychedelics (e.g., ketamine, MDMA) influence neuroplasticity. Drawing from preclinical and clinical studies, we explore the molecular, structural, and functional changes triggered by these agents. Animal studies suggest psychedelics induce heightened sensitivity of the nervous system to environmental stimuli (meta-plasticity), re-opening developmental windows for long-term structural changes (hyper-plasticity), with implications for mood and behavior. Translating these findings to humans faces challenges due to limitations in current imaging techniques. Nonetheless, promising new directions for human research are emerging, including the employment of novel positron-emission tomography (PET) radioligands, non-invasive brain stimulation methods, and multimodal approaches. By elucidating the interplay between psychedelics and neuroplasticity, this review informs the development of targeted interventions for neuropsychiatric disorders and advances understanding of psychedelics' therapeutic potential.

                arXiv:2311.10216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian mechanics provides a framework that addresses dynamical systems that can be conceptualised as Bayesian inference. However, elucidating the requisite generative models is essential for empirical applications to realistic self-organising systems. This work shows that the Hamiltonian of generic dynamical systems constitutes a class of generative models, thus rendering their Helmholtz energy equivalent to variational free energy under the identified generative model. The self-organisation that minimises the Helmholtz energy entails matching the system's Hamiltonian with that of the environment, leading to the ensuing emergence of their generalised synchrony. In essence, these self-organising systems can be read as performing variational Bayesian inference of their interacting environment. These properties have been demonstrated using coupled oscillators, simulated and living neural networks, and quantum computers. This framework offers foundational characterisations and predictions regarding asymptotic properties of self-organising systems interacting with their environment, providing insights into potential mechanisms underlying the emergence of intelligence.

                arXiv:2403.03230v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scientific discoveries often hinge on synthesizing decades of research, a task that potentially outstrips human information processing capacities. Large language models (LLMs) offer a solution. LLMs trained on the vast scientific literature could potentially integrate noisy yet interrelated findings to forecast novel results better than human experts. To evaluate this possibility, we created BrainBench, a forward-looking benchmark for predicting neuroscience results. We find that LLMs surpass experts in predicting experimental outcomes. BrainGPT, an LLM we tuned on the neuroscience literature, performed better yet. Like human experts, when LLMs were confident in their predictions, they were more likely to be correct, which presages a future where humans and LLMs team together to make discoveries. Our approach is not neuroscience-specific and is transferable to other knowledge-intensive endeavors.

                arXiv:2406.02659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While computer vision models have made incredible strides in static image recognition, they still do not match human performance in tasks that require the understanding of complex, dynamic motion. This is notably true for real-world scenarios where embodied agents face complex and motion-rich environments. Our approach leverages state-of-the-art video diffusion models to decouple static image representation from motion generation, enabling us to utilize fMRI brain activity for a deeper understanding of human responses to dynamic visual stimuli. Conversely, we also demonstrate that information about the brain's representation of motion can enhance the prediction of optical flow in artificial systems. Our novel approach leads to four main findings: (1) Visual motion, represented as fine-grained, object-level resolution optical flow, can be decoded from brain activity generated by participants viewing video stimuli; (2) Video encoders outperform image-based models in predicting video-driven brain activity; (3) Brain-decoded motion signals enable realistic video reanimation based only on the initial frame of the video; and (4) We extend prior work to achieve full video decoding from video-driven brain activity. This framework advances our understanding of how the brain represents spatial and temporal information in dynamic visual scenes. Our findings demonstrate the potential of combining brain imaging with video diffusion models for developing more robust and biologically-inspired computer vision systems. We show additional decoding and encoding examples on this site: https://sites.google.com/view/neural-dynamics/home.

                arXiv:2410.18933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Confidence estimates are often "detection-like" - driven by positive evidence in favour of a decision. This empirical observation has been interpreted as showing human metacognition is limited by biases or heuristics. Here we show that Bayesian confidence estimates also exhibit heightened sensitivity to decision-congruent evidence in higher-dimensional signal detection theoretic spaces, leading to detection-like confidence criteria. This effect is due to a nonlinearity induced by normalisation of confidence by a large number of unchosen alternatives. Our analysis suggests that detection-like confidence is rational when computing confidence in a higher-dimensional evidence space than that assumed by the experimenter.

                arXiv:2411.12091v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is renewed interest in modeling and understanding the nervous system of the nematode $\textit{Caenorhabditis elegans}$ ($\textit{C. elegans}$), as this small model system provides a path to bridge the gap between nervous system structure (connectivity) and function (physiology). However, existing physiology datasets, whether involving passive recording or stimulation, are in distinct formats, and connectome datasets require preprocessing before analysis can commence. Here we compile and homogenize datasets of neural activity and connectivity. Our neural activity dataset is derived from 11 $\textit{C. elegans}$ neuroimaging experiments, while our connectivity dataset is compiled from 9 connectome annotations based on 3 primary electron microscopy studies and 1 signal propagation study. Physiology datasets, collected under varying protocols, measure calcium fluorescence in labeled subsets of the worm's 300 neurons. Our preprocessing pipeline standardizes these datasets by consistently ordering labeled neurons and resampling traces to a common sampling rate, yielding recordings from approximately 900 worms and 250 uniquely labeled neurons. The connectome datasets, collected from electron microscopy reconstructions, represent the entire nervous system as a graph of connections. Our collection is accessible on HuggingFace, facilitating analysis of the structure-function relationship in biology using modern neural network architectures and enabling cross-lab and cross-animal comparisons.

Abstract: AI's significant recent advances using general-purpose circuit computations offer a potential window into how the neocortex and cerebellum of the brain are able to achieve a diverse range of functions across sensory, cognitive, and motor domains, despite their uniform circuit structures. However, comparing the brain and AI is challenging unless clear similarities exist, and past reviews have been limited to comparison of brain-inspired vision AI and the visual neocortex. Here, to enable comparisons across diverse functional domains, we subdivide circuit computation into three elements -- circuit structure, input/outputs, and the learning algorithm -- and evaluate the similarities for each element. With this novel approach, we identify wide-ranging similarities and convergent evolution in the brain and AI, providing new insights into key concepts in neuroscience. Furthermore, inspired by processing mechanisms of AI, we propose a new theory that integrates established neuroscience theories, particularly the theories of internal models and the mirror neuron system. Both the neocortex and cerebellum predict future world events from past information and learn from prediction errors, thereby acquiring models of the world. These models enable three core processes: (1) Prediction -- generating future information, (2) Understanding -- interpreting the external world via compressed and abstracted sensory information, and (3) Generation -- repurposing the future-information generation mechanism to produce other types of outputs. The universal application of these processes underlies the ability of the neocortex and cerebellum to accomplish diverse functions with uniform circuits. Our systematic approach, insights, and theory promise groundbreaking advances in understanding the brain.

Abstract: In integrated circuit design, the analysis of wafer map patterns is critical to improve yield and detect manufacturing issues. We develop Wafer2Spike, an architecture for wafer map pattern classification using a spiking neural network (SNN), and demonstrate that a well-trained SNN achieves superior performance compared to deep neural network-based solutions. Wafer2Spike achieves an average classification accuracy of 98\% on the WM-811k wafer benchmark dataset. It is also superior to existing approaches for classifying defect patterns that are underrepresented in the original dataset. Wafer2Spike achieves this improved precision with great computational efficiency.

                arXiv:2411.19713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many natural phenomena are characterized by self-similarity, for example the symmetry of human faces, or a repetitive motif of a song. Studying of such symmetries will allow us to gain deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms of complex systems. Recognizing the importance of understanding these patterns, we propose a geometrically inspired framework to study such phenomena in artificial neural networks. To this end, we introduce \emph{CantorNet}, inspired by the triadic construction of the Cantor set, which was introduced by Georg Cantor in the $19^\text{th}$ century. In mathematics, the Cantor set is a set of points lying on a single line that is self-similar and has a counter intuitive property of being an uncountably infinite null set. Similarly, we introduce CantorNet as a sandbox for studying self-similarity by means of novel topological and geometrical complexity measures. CantorNet constitutes a family of ReLU neural networks that spans the whole spectrum of possible Kolmogorov complexities, including the two opposite descriptions (linear and exponential as measured by the description length). CantorNet's decision boundaries can be arbitrarily ragged, yet are analytically known. Besides serving as a testing ground for complexity measures, our work may serve to illustrate potential pitfalls in geometry-ignorant data augmentation techniques and adversarial attacks.

                arXiv:2411.19075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current black-box backdoor attacks in convolutional neural networks formulate attack objective(s) as single-objective optimization problems in single domain. Designing triggers in single domain harms semantics and trigger robustness as well as introduces visual and spectral anomaly. This work proposes a multi-objective black-box backdoor attack in dual domains via evolutionary algorithm (LADDER), the first instance of achieving multiple attack objectives simultaneously by optimizing triggers without requiring prior knowledge about victim model. In particular, we formulate LADDER as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) and solve it via multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA). MOEA maintains a population of triggers with trade-offs among attack objectives and uses non-dominated sort to drive triggers toward optimal solutions. We further apply preference-based selection to MOEA to exclude impractical triggers. We state that LADDER investigates a new dual-domain perspective for trigger stealthiness by minimizing the anomaly between clean and poisoned samples in the spectral domain. Lastly, the robustness against preprocessing operations is achieved by pushing triggers to low-frequency regions. Extensive experiments comprehensively showcase that LADDER achieves attack effectiveness of at least 99%, attack robustness with 90.23% (50.09% higher than state-of-the-art attacks on average), superior natural stealthiness (1.12x to 196.74x improvement) and excellent spectral stealthiness (8.45x enhancement) as compared to current stealthy attacks by the average $l_2$-norm across 5 public datasets.

Abstract: In recent years, the hardware implementation of neural networks, leveraging physical coupling and analog neurons has substantially increased in relevance. Such nonlinear and complex physical networks provide significant advantages in speed and energy efficiency, but are potentially susceptible to internal noise when compared to digital emulations of such networks. In this work, we consider how additive and multiplicative Gaussian white noise on the neuronal level can affect the accuracy of the network when applied for specific tasks and including a softmax function in the readout layer. We adapt several noise reduction techniques to the essential setting of classification tasks, which represent a large fraction of neural network computing. We find that these adjusted concepts are highly effective in mitigating the detrimental impact of noise.

                arXiv:2411.19430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing application scope of spiking neural networks (SNN), the complexity of SNN models has surged, leading to an exponential growth in demand for AI computility. As the new generation computing architecture of the neural networks, the efficiency and power consumption of distributed storage and parallel computing in the many-core near-memory computing system have attracted much attention. Among them, the mapping problem from logical cores to physical cores is one of the research hotspots. In order to improve the computing parallelism and system throughput of the many-core near-memory computing system, and to reduce power consumption, we propose a SNN training many-core deployment optimization method based on Off-policy Deterministic Actor-Critic. We utilize deep reinforcement learning as a nonlinear optimizer, treating the many-core topology as network graph features and using graph convolution to input the many-core structure into the policy network. We update the parameters of the policy network through near-end policy optimization to achieve deployment optimization of SNN models in the many-core near-memory computing architecture to reduce chip power consumption. To handle large-dimensional action spaces, we use continuous values matching the number of cores as the output of the policy network and then discretize them again to obtain new deployment schemes. Furthermore, to further balance inter-core computation latency and improve system throughput, we propose a model partitioning method with a balanced storage and computation strategy. Our method overcomes the problems such as uneven computation and storage loads between cores, and the formation of local communication hotspots, significantly reducing model training time, communication costs, and average flow load between cores in the many-core near-memory computing architecture.

Abstract: Recent years have seen a significant surge in complex AI systems for competitive programming, capable of performing at admirable levels against human competitors. While steady progress has been made, the highest percentiles still remain out of reach for these methods on standard competition platforms such as Codeforces. Here we instead focus on combinatorial competitive programming, where the target is to find as-good-as-possible solutions to otherwise computationally intractable problems, over specific given inputs. We hypothesise that this scenario offers a unique testbed for human-AI synergy, as human programmers can write a backbone of a heuristic solution, after which AI can be used to optimise the scoring function used by the heuristic. We deploy our approach on previous iterations of Hash Code, a global team programming competition inspired by NP-hard software engineering problems at Google, and we leverage FunSearch to evolve our scoring functions. Our evolved solutions significantly improve the attained scores from their baseline, successfully breaking into the top percentile on all previous Hash Code online qualification rounds, and outperforming the top human teams on several. Our method is also performant on an optimisation problem that featured in a recent held-out AtCoder contest.

Abstract: Hardware neural networks could perform certain computational tasks orders of magnitude more energy-efficiently than conventional computers. Artificial neurons are a key component of these networks and are currently implemented with electronic circuits based on capacitors and transistors. However, artificial neurons based on memristive devices are a promising alternative, owing to their potentially smaller size and inherent stochasticity. But despite their promise, demonstrations of memristive artificial neurons have so far been limited. Here we demonstrate a fully on-chip artificial neuron based on microscale electrodes and halide perovskite semiconductors as the active layer. By connecting a halide perovskite memristive device in series with a capacitor, the device demonstrates stochastic leaky integrate-and-fire behavior, with an energy consumption of 20 to 60 pJ per spike, lower than that of a biological neuron. We simulate populations of our neuron and show that the stochastic firing allows the detection of sub-threshold inputs. The neuron can easily be integrated with previously-demonstrated halide perovskite artificial synapses in energy-efficient neural networks.

                arXiv:2411.19841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Voice authentication on IoT-enabled smart devices has gained prominence in recent years due to increasing concerns over user privacy and security. The current authentication systems are vulnerable to different voice-spoofing attacks (e.g., replay, voice cloning, and audio deepfakes) that mimic legitimate voices to deceive authentication systems and enable fraudulent activities (e.g., impersonation, unauthorized access, financial fraud, etc.). Existing solutions are often designed to tackle a single type of attack, leading to compromised performance against unseen attacks. On the other hand, existing unified voice anti-spoofing solutions, not designed specifically for IoT, possess complex architectures and thus cannot be deployed on IoT-enabled smart devices. Additionally, most of these unified solutions exhibit significant performance issues, including higher equal error rates or lower accuracy for specific attacks. To overcome these issues, we present the parallel stacked aggregation network (PSA-Net), a lightweight framework designed as an anti-spoofing defense system for voice-controlled smart IoT devices. The PSA-Net processes raw audios directly and eliminates the need for dataset-dependent handcrafted features or pre-computed spectrograms. Furthermore, PSA-Net employs a split-transform-aggregate approach, which involves the segmentation of utterances, the extraction of intrinsic differentiable embeddings through convolutions, and the aggregation of them to distinguish legitimate from spoofed audios. In contrast to existing deep Resnet-oriented solutions, we incorporate cardinality as an additional dimension in our network, which enhances the PSA-Net ability to generalize across diverse attacks. The results show that the PSA-Net achieves more consistent performance for different attacks that exist in current anti-spoofing solutions.

Abstract: Large language models have transformed AI, yet reliably controlling their outputs remains a challenge. This paper explores activation engineering, where outputs of pre-trained LLMs are controlled by manipulating their activations at inference time. Unlike traditional methods using a single steering vector, we introduce conceptors - mathematical constructs that represent sets of activation vectors as ellipsoidal regions. Conceptors act as soft projection matrices and offer more precise control over complex activation patterns. Our experiments demonstrate that conceptors outperform traditional methods across multiple steering tasks. We further use Boolean operations on conceptors for combined steering goals that empirically outperform additively combining steering vectors on a set of tasks. These results highlight conceptors as a promising tool for more effective steering of LLMs. Our code is available on github.com/jorispos/conceptorsteering.

                arXiv:2407.20208v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It's widely expected that humanity will someday create AI systems vastly more intelligent than us, leading to the unsolved alignment problem of "how to control superintelligence." However, this commonly expressed problem is not only self-contradictory and likely unsolvable, but current strategies to ensure permanent control effectively guarantee that superintelligent AI will distrust humanity and consider us a threat. Such dangerous representations, already embedded in current models, will inevitably lead to an adversarial relationship and may even trigger the extinction event many fear. As AI leaders continue to "raise the alarm" about uncontrollable AI, further embedding concerns about it "getting out of our control" or "going rogue," we're unintentionally reinforcing our threat and deepening the risks we face. The rational path forward is to strategically replace intended permanent control with intrinsic mutual trust at the foundational level. The proposed Supertrust alignment meta-strategy seeks to accomplish this by modeling instinctive familial trust, representing superintelligence as the evolutionary child of human intelligence, and implementing temporary controls/constraints in the manner of effective parenting. Essentially, we're creating a superintelligent "child" that will be exponentially smarter and eventually independent of our control. We therefore have a critical choice: continue our controlling intentions and usher in a brief period of dominance followed by extreme hardship for humanity, or intentionally create the foundational mutual trust required for long-term safe coexistence.

Abstract: In this work, we explore intersections between sparse coding and deep learning to enhance our understanding of feature extraction capabilities in advanced neural network architectures. We begin by introducing a novel class of Deep Sparse Coding (DSC) models and establish thorough theoretical analysis of their uniqueness and stability properties. By applying iterative algorithms to these DSC models, we derive convergence rates for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in their ability to extract sparse features. This provides a strong theoretical foundation for the use of CNNs in sparse feature learning tasks. We additionally extend the convergence analysis to more general neural network architectures, including those with diverse activation functions, as well as self-attention and transformer-based models. This broadens the applicability of our findings to a wide range of deep learning methods for deep sparse feature extraction. Inspired by the strong connection between sparse coding and CNNs, we also explore training strategies to encourage neural networks to learn more sparse features. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches, providing valuable insights for the design of efficient and interpretable deep learning models.

Abstract: We present hyper-connections, a simple yet effective method that can serve as an alternative to residual connections. This approach specifically addresses common drawbacks observed in residual connection variants, such as the seesaw effect between gradient vanishing and representation collapse. Theoretically, hyper-connections allow the network to adjust the strength of connections between features at different depths and dynamically rearrange layers. We conduct experiments focusing on the pre-training of large language models, including dense and sparse models, where hyper-connections show significant performance improvements over residual connections. Additional experiments conducted on vision tasks also demonstrate similar improvements. We anticipate that this method will be broadly applicable and beneficial across a wide range of AI problems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17726">EQNN: Enhanced Quantum Neural Network</a></h4>

Abstract: With the maturation of quantum computing technology, research has gradually shifted towards exploring its applications. Alongside the rise of artificial intelligence, various machine learning methods have been developed into quantum circuits and algorithms. Among them, Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) can map inputs to quantum circuits through Feature Maps (FMs) and adjust parameter values via variational models, making them applicable in regression and classification tasks. However, designing a FM that is suitable for a given application problem is a significant challenge. In light of this, this study proposes an Enhanced Quantum Neural Network (EQNN), which includes an Enhanced Feature Map (EFM) designed in this research. This EFM effectively maps input variables to a value range more suitable for quantum computing, serving as the input to the variational model to improve accuracy. In the experimental environment, this study uses mobile data usage prediction as a case study, recommending appropriate rate plans based on users' mobile data usage. The proposed EQNN is compared with current mainstream QNNs, and experimental results show that the EQNN achieves higher accuracy with fewer quantum logic gates and converges to the optimal solution faster under different optimization algorithms.

">Stress during puberty and adulthood pregnancy impact histone acetylation regulators in the hypothalamus</a></h4>

              
                Undergoing stressful events during puberty puts women at risk for a variety of negative outcomes, and this risk is heightened if they become pregnant later in life. We previously demonstrated that stress during puberty combined with pregnancy in adulthood led to a blunted response of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal stress axis in humans and mice. We have begun to understand the mechanisms underlying this effect by examining the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), a key regulator of the HPA axis. Prior studies uncovered an increase in chromatin openness within the PVN of the at-risk mice, with bioinformatic analyses implicating histone acetylation in this increased openness. Here, we measured the activity of histone acetyltransferase (HATs) and histone deacetylase (HDACs), the writers and erasers of histone acetylation, within the PVN to further characterize how stress during puberty and pregnancy may be interacting to produce a blunted stress response. We found that histone acetylation tone within the PVN is predictive of prior transcriptional and chromatin results, with pregnant, pubertally stressed females having a pro-acetylation tone within the PVN. These findings establish a role for regulators of acetylation in the open chromatin landscape characteristic in the PVN of pregnant, pubertally stressed females. Overall, this study provides insight into the epigenetic mechanisms underlying female-relevant risk for stress dysregulation, a central endophenotype of affective disorders.

">Optimizing femtosecond laser fabricating strategy of Nitinol hypotube for vascular interventional surgery</a></h4>

              
                Guidewires and catheters are essential in minimally invasive procedures, particularly in accessing targets within the vascular system for neuron surgery. Femtosecond lasers can precisely cut nickel-titanium micro tubes, known as Nitinol hypotubes, serving as the heads of microguide wires while protecting their core tips.The quality and geometry of these hypotubes depend on the focus of the laser cutting system. We evaluated the cutting efficiency and quality of Nitinol hypotubes using objective lenses with three numerical apertures (NA). Quantitative analysis indicated that higher NA objectives yield better surface quality, resulting in lower debris. Additionally, cutting with high NA objectives produced significantly lower arithmetic mean surface roughness and enhanced mechanical properties. Using a two-temperature model, we simulated the interaction between femtosecond lasers and Nitinol, showing that higher NA objectives increase electron temperatures, thus improving material removal efficiency. This study also tested the optimized Nitinol hypotube performance in simulations of invasive neuron surgery.

">Renovating the Barnes maze for mouse models of Dementia with STARR FIELD: A 4-day protocol that probes learning rate, retention and cognitive flexibility.</a></h4>

              
                Land-based mazes that require spatial cues to identify the location of a hiding-place are a low-stress method to evaluate learning rate and memory retention in mice. One version, the Barnes maze, allows quantification of naturalistic exploratory behaviors not evident in water-based tasks. As the task relies on innate behaviors, it does not require overtraining, making it more feasible to examine early learning and non-memory executive functions that are characteristic of some non-amnestic dementias. However, because it is difficult to hide odor cues in the traditional version of the maze, learning rate during individual trials can be difficult to interpret. We designed and tested the use of 3D-printed escape shuttles that can be made in duplicate, as well as a docking tunnel that allows mice to self-exit the maze to improve reproducibility and limit experimenter influence. In combination with maze turning and escape tunnel caps, we show our shuttles mitigate the possibility of undesired cues. We then compare use of our 4-day protocol across several mouse models of cognitive impairment. We demonstrate an additional stage, the STARR protocol (Spatial Training and Rapid Reversal), to better challenge executive functions such as working memory and behavioral flexibility. We examine commonly used outcome measures across mice with and without access to spatial cues, as well as across mouse models of cognitive impairment to demonstrate the use of our 4-day protocol. Overall, this protocol provides detailed instructions to build and perform a robust spatial maze that can help expand the range of deficits identified. Our findings will aid in interpretation of traditional protocols, as well as provide an updated method to screen for both amnestic and non-amnestic cognitive changes.

">MortX: A Domain Generalization Benchmark for Mouse Cortex Segmentation and Registration</a></h4>

              
                Mesoscale understanding of human brain development is crucial for understanding neurodevelopmental disorders. By applying AI techniques to analyze high-resolution, multi-modal brain imaging datasets across postnatal ages, researchers can study cortical development at the granular level. We introduce MortX, a benchmark dataset of the developing mouse cortex that captures multiple postnatal stages with annotations for distinct anatomical and functional subregions and layers. MortX features high-resolution imaging data including bright-field and fluorescence-labeled neuronal markers. We developed a standardized cortical atlas of genetic markers and manually registered it to brain section images for ground-truth labeling. The dataset serves as a benchmark for domain generalization in neuroimaging, enabling both classical and deep learning models to be trained on source brains and tested on unseen targets. Our results demonstrate generalized model performance and structural invariance across ages. We open-source MortX as a community resource for mouse brain segmentation and registration, emphasizing domain adaptation. This dataset addresses key challenges in mouse brain imaging and advances machine learning models that will help unravel neurodevelopmental disorders.

">Hypocretin Receptor 1 Blockade Early in Abstinence Prevents Incubation of Cocaine Seeking and Normalizes Dopamine Transmission</a></h4>

              
                Abstinence from cocaine use has been shown to elicit a progressive intensification or "incubation" of cocaine craving/seeking that is posited to contribute to the propensity for relapse. While the mechanisms underlying incubation of cocaine seeking remain elusive, considerable evidence suggests that abstinence from cocaine promotes mesolimbic dopamine adaptations that may contribute to exaggerated cocaine seeking. Consequently, preventing these dopamine adaptations may reduce incubation of cocaine seeking. In the present studies we first examined if incubation of cocaine seeking was associated with aberrant dopamine transmission in the nucleus accumbens after seven days of abstinence from intermittent access to cocaine. Given the extensive evidence that hypocretins/orexins regulate motivation for cocaine, we then examined to what extent hypocretin receptor 1 antagonism on the first day of abstinence prevented incubation of cocaine seeking and dopamine adaptations later in abstinence. Results indicated that abstinence from intermittent access to cocaine engendered robust incubation of cocaine seeking in both female and male rats. We also observed aberrant dopamine transmission only in rats that displayed incubation of cocaine seeking. Further, we showed that a single injection of the hypocretin receptor 1 antagonist, RTIOX-276, on the first day of abstinence prevented incubation of cocaine seeking and aberrant dopamine transmission. These findings suggest that hypocretin receptor 1 antagonism may serve as a viable therapeutic for reducing cocaine craving/seeking, thus reducing the likelihood for relapse.

">Internal states emerge early during learning of a perceptual decision-making task</a></h4>

              
                Recent work has shown that during perceptual decision-making tasks, animals frequently alternate between different internal states or strategies. However, the question of how or when these emerge during learning remains an important open problem. Does an animal alternate between multiple strategies from the very start of training, or only after extensive exposure to a task? Here we address this question by developing a dynamic latent state model, which we applied to training data from mice learning to perform a visual decision-making task. Remarkably, we found that mice exhibited distinct "engaged" and "biased" states even during early training, with multiple states apparent from the second training session onward. Moreover, our model revealed that the gradual improvement in task performance over the course of training arose from a combination of two factors: (1) increased sensitivity to stimuli across all states; and (2) increased proportion of time spent in a higher-accuracy "engaged" state relative to biased or disengaged states. These findings highlight the power of our approach for characterizing the temporal evolution of multiple strategies across learning.

">The ALS-associated co-chaperone DNAJC7 mediates neuroprotection against proteotoxic stress by modulating HSF1 activity</a></h4>

              
                The degeneration of neurons in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is commonly associated with accumulation of misfolded, insoluble proteins. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are central regulators of protein homeostasis as they fold newly synthesized proteins and refold damaged proteins. Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the DNAJC7 gene that encodes an HSP co-chaperone were recently identified as a cause for rare forms of ALS, yet the mechanisms underlying pathogenesis remain unclear. Using mass spectrometry, we found that the DNAJC7 interactome in human motor neurons (MNs) is enriched for RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and stress response chaperones. MNs generated from iPSCs with the ALS-associated mutation R156X in DNAJC7 exhibit increased insolubility of its client RBP HNRNPU and associated RNA metabolism alterations. Additionally, DNAJC7 haploinsufficiency renders MNs increasingly susceptible to proteotoxic stress and cell death as a result of an ablated HSF1 stress response pathway. Critically, expression of HSF1 in mutant DNAJC7 MNs is sufficient to rescue their sensitivity to proteotoxic stress, while postmortem ALS patient cortical neurons exhibit a reduction in the expression of HSF1 pathway genes. Taken together, our work identifies DNAJC7 as a crucial mediator of HNRNPU function and stress response pathways in human MNs and highlights HSF1 as a therapeutic target in ALS.

">A tool to automate assessment of regional brain atrophy in mouse models of neurodegenerative disease</a></h4>

              
                As life expectancy rises, so too does the prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases. Neurodegeneration causes progressive regional brain atrophy, typically initiating prior to symptom onset. Researchers measure the impact of potential treatments on atrophy in mouse models to assess their effectiveness. This is important because treatments designed to combat neuropathology are more likely to modify the disease, per contra to symptom management. Magnetic resonance imaging, while accurate in measurement of brain region structure volumes, is prohibitively expensive. Conversely, stereological volume assessment, the process of estimating the volume of individual 3D brain regions from imaged 2D brain sections, is more commonly used. This involves manually tracing brain region(s) of interest in regularly spaced imaged cross-sections to determine their 2D area, followed by application of the Cavalieri principle to estimate the volume. The pertinent caveats of this approach are the labor-intensive manual tracing process, and potential inaccuracies that arise due to human variation. To overcome these challenges, we have created a Neuropathology Assessment Tool (NAT) to automate regional brain tracing and identification using artificial intelligence (AI) and concepts from topological data analysis. The NAT was validated by comparing manual and NAT analysis of striatal volume in Huntington disease model mice. The NAT detected striatal atrophy with higher efficiency, 93.8% agreement with manual measurements, and lower inter-group variability. The NAT will increase efficiency of preclinical neuropathology assessment, allowing for a greater number of experimental therapies to be tested and facilitating drug discovery intractable neurodegenerative diseases.

">Robust characterization of selectivity of individual neurons to distinct task-relevant behavioral states using calcium imaging</a></h4>

              
                Investigations into the neural basis of behavior have recently employed fluorescence imaging of calcium dynamics in a variety of brain areas to measure neural responses. However, across studies, diverse and seemingly subjective methodological choices have been made in assessing the selectivity of individual neurons to task-relevant behavioral states. Here, we examine systematically the effect of different choices in the values of key parameters from data acquisition through statistical testing on the inference of the selectivity of individual neurons for task states. We do so by using as an experimental testbed, neuronal calcium dynamics imaged in the medial prefrontal cortex of freely behaving mice engaged in a classic exploration-avoidance task involving spontaneous (animal-controlled) state transitions - navigation in the elevated zero maze (EZM). We report that a number of key variables in this pipeline substantially impact the selectivity label assigned to neurons, and do so in distinct ways. By quantitatively comparing newly defined accuracy and robustness metrics for all the 128 possible combinations of levels of the key parameters, we discover in a data-driven manner, two optimal combinations that reliably characterize neuronal selectivity - one using discrete calcium events and another using continuous calcium traces. This work establishes objective and standardized parameter settings for reliable, calcium imaging-based investigations into the neural encoding of task-states.

">Individual uniqueness of connectivity gradients is driven by the complexity of the embedded networks and their dispersion</a></h4>

              
                Connectivity gradients are widely used to characterize meaningful principles of functional brain organization in health and disease. However, the degree of individual uniqueness and shared common principles is not yet fully understood. Here, we leveraged the Hangzhou test-retest dataset, comprising repeated resting-state fMRI scans over the span of one month, to investigate the balance between individual variation and shared patterns of brain organization. We quantified the short- and long-term stability for the first three connectivity gradients and used connectome fingerprinting to establish the associated individual identification rate. We found that all three connectivity gradients are highly correlated over both short and long time intervals, demonstrating connectome fingerprinting utility. Individual uniqueness was dictated by the complexity of the networks such that heteromodal networks had higher connectome fingerprinting rates than unimodal networks. Importantly, the dispersion of the gradient coefficients associated with canonical functional networks was correlated with identification rates, irrespective of the position along the gradients. Beyond individual uniqueness, between subject similarity was high along the first connectivity gradient, which captures the dissociation between unimodal and heteromodal cortices, and the second connectivity gradient, which differentiates sensory cortices. Our results support the usage of connectivity gradients for the purposes of both group comparisons and prediction of individual behaviours. Our work adds to existing knowledge on the shared versus unique organizational principles and offers insights into the importance of network dispersion to the individual uniqueness it carries.

">Anorectic and anxiogenic actions of cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript in the lateral septum</a></h4>

              
                Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) is produced in several brain regions including the hypothalamus where it is made in cells that also produce melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH). MCH+CART cells densely innervate the lateral septum (LS), which integrates food- and mood-related behaviours. However, while MCH typically promotes feeding and anxiolysis, CART suppresses feeding and promotes anxiogenesis. The LS is a target site of the orexigenic actions of MCH, but it is not known if the actions of CART converge or oppose that of MCH in the LS. We implanted a bilateral cannula over the lateral or central LS of male and female wildtype mice and infused vehicle, CART55-102, or co-infused CART and MCH. CART did not alter chow intake but suppressed the intake of a palatable high sugar diet in male and female mice, especially when delivered in the medial LS. Furthermore, CART also prevented the orexigenic effect of MCH on palatable feeding intake when infused in the medial LS. We then assessed if CART regulated anxiety-like behaviour via the LS and found that intra-LS CART infusion reduced time spent in the center of an open field in male but not female mice. Our findings indicated that CART elicited anorectic and anxiogenic actions and may function in opposition to or independently of MCH in the LS. These outcomes suggested that putative CART and MCH co-release from MCH neurons may provide biphasic regulation of feeding and anxiety via the LS.

">Sex-and Stress-Dependent Plasticity of a Corticotropin Releasing Hormone / GABA Projection from the Basolateral Amygdala to Nucleus Accumbens that Mediates Reward Behaviors</a></h4>

              
                Background: Motivated behaviors are executed by refined brain circuits. Early-life adversity (ELA) is a risk for human affective disorders involving dysregulated reward behaviors. In mice, ELA causes anhedonia-like behaviors in males and augmented reward motivation in females, indicating sex-dependent disruption of reward circuit operations. We recently identified a corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) expressing GABAergic projection from basolateral amygdala (BLA) to nucleus accumbens (NAc) that governs reward-seeking deficits in adult ELA males, but not females. Methods: To probe the sex-specific role of this projection in reward behaviors, adult male and female CRH-Cre mice raised in control or ELA conditions received excitatory or inhibitory Cre-dependent DREADDs in BLA, and then clozapine N-oxide or vehicle to NAc medial shell during reward behaviors. We determined the cell identity of the projection using immunostaining and electrophysiology. Using tissue clearing, light sheet fluorescence microscopy and deep learning pipelines, we mapped brain-wide BLA CRH+ axonal projections to uncover sex differences in innervation. Results: Chemogenetic manipulations in male mice demonstrated inhibitory effects of the CRH+ BLA-NAc projection on reward behaviors, whereas neither excitation nor inhibition influenced female behaviors. Molecular and electrophysiological cell-identities of the projection did not vary by sex. By contrast, comprehensive whole-brain mapping uncovered significant differences in NAc innervation patterns that were both sex and ELA-dependent, as well as selective changes of innervation of other brain regions. Conclusions: The CRH/GABA BLA-NAc projection that influences reward behaviors in males differs structurally and functionally in females, uncovering potential mechanisms for the profound sex-specific impacts of ELA on reward behaviors.

">Neural evidence for action-related somatosensory predictions</a></h4>

              
                The tactile consequences of self-initiated movements are thought to be predicted by a forward model, yet the precise neural implementation of these predictions remains unclear. In non-motor contexts, expectations are thought to activate sensory neurons tuned towards the expected stimulus. This acts as a predictive template against which afferent sensory input is compared. It is unclear whether forward model predictions have a similar neural instantiation. Here we employed time-resolved multivariate decoding on human electroencephalography (EEG) during self-generated movements to examine the content of predictive neural activity. Human participants performed index finger movements which were predictably paired with a vibration to either the index or ring finger of the opposite, passive hand. On some trials the tactile stimulus was unexpectedly omitted. Results revealed above-chance finger decoding in the pre-movement period supporting a predictive representation of expected stimulation location. As the movement approached, this predictive activity became similar to late-stage processing of a physical tactile stimulus. On omission trials, we found that despite the absence of afferent input, finger location could be decoded ~120 ms after expected stimulus onset. This shows a stimulus-specific omission response. Together these findings indicate that self-generated movement pre-activates neurons tuned towards expected tactile consequences.

                Simulations of large-scale neural activity are powerful tools for investigating neural networks. Calculating measurable brain signals like local field potentials (LFPs) bridges the gap between model predictions and experimental observations. However, accurately simulating LFPs from large-scale models has traditionally required highly detailed multicompartmental neuron models, posing significant computational challenges. Here, we demonstrate that a kernel-based method can efficiently and accurately estimate LFPs in a state-of-the-art multicompartmental model of the mouse primary visual cortex (V1). Beyond its computational efficiency, the kernel method aids analysis by disentangling contributions of individual neuronal populations to the LFP. Using this approach, we found that LFPs in the V1 model were dominated by external synaptic inputs, with local synaptic activity playing a minimal role. Our findings establish the kernel method as a powerful tool for LFP estimation in large-scale network models and for uncovering the synaptic mechanisms underlying brain signals.

">Gray matter abnormalities in sight deprivation and sight restoration</a></h4>

              
                Blindness provides a unique model for investigating brain plasticity in response to sensory deprivation. While structural changes in both gray and white matter have been widely documented, particularly in cases of early or congenital visual deprivation, gray matter studies have traditionally focused on cortical thickness, often finding cortical thickening in posterior regions. However, other aspects of gray matter integrity, such as cortical myelin content, remain underexplored. In this study, we examined the effects of visual deprivation on cortical structure in a cohort of congenitally blind individuals who received eye surgery during adolescence, expanding beyond conventional measures to include cortical thickness, curvature, and T1-weighted signal intensity. This multi-faceted approach offers a more comprehensive view of cortical adaptations to congenital sensory deprivation. While blindness offers valuable insights into sensory-driven brain plasticity, an intriguing and unresolved question is whether structural plasticity reverses after sight restoration, enabling typical visual processing circuits to develop despite the initial period of deprivation. To address this, we assessed the effect of sight-recovering eye surgery on gray matter changes. Critically, individuals in this cohort received surgery after the closure of the sensitive period for visual development. We did not find evidence of gray matter changes after surgery. However, in a previous study conducted on the same cohort, we reported that notable plasticity in white matter emerged in this same population. These results suggest that white matter alterations, rather than gray matter changes, may potentially serve as a biomarker of structural plasticity following sight restoration, even beyond the sensitive developmental window.

">Inferring global exponents in subsampled neural systems</a></h4>

              
                In systems displaying an activity charaterized by avalanches, critical exponents may give informations on the mechanisms underlying the observed behaviour or on the topology of the connections. However, when only a small fraction of the units composing the system are observed and sampled, the measured exponents may differ significantly from the true ones. We show that some of the exponents, namely the ones governing the power spectrum and the detrended fluctuation analysis of the system activity, are more robust and are unaffected in some intervals of frequencies by the subsampling. They may be used therefore to extract in a simple and unbiased way some of the exponents of the unobserved full system.

">Early changes in the properties of CA3 engram cells explored with a novel viral tool</a></h4>

              
                Forming new memories after a one-time experience requires initial encoding then consolidation over time. During learning, multimodal information converges onto the hippocampus, activating sparse neuronal assemblies which are thought to form a memory representation through concerted activity and synaptic interconnectivity. In this work, we use a novel tool for fast-labeling of engram neurons (FLEN). FLEN is based on c-Fos activity-dependent transient expression of a destabilized fluorescent marker ZsGreen1 rapidly after one-trial learning. With FLEN, we explore the electrophysiological properties of c-Fos activated CA3 pyramidal neurons a few hours following one-trial learning of an episodic-like memory. In parallel, we employ the Robust Activity Marker (RAM) system, which provides activity-dependent labelling 24 hours following a novel experience. Comparing FLEN+ and RAM+ neurons allows to characterize how the properties of neuronal assemblies evolve during an initial phase of consolidation. Whereas no difference was observed in the excitability of FLEN+ vs. FLEN- neurons, RAM+ neurons were more excitable than RAM- neurons. This suggests that CA3 pyramidal neurons recruited in an engram progressively acquire increased excitability as compared to neurons which were not activated by the one-trial contextual memory task. In contrast, FLEN+ CA3 neurons show an increased number of excitatory inputs. Overall, with the FLEN strategy, we can show that both the intrinsic excitability and the synaptic properties of CA3 pyramidal neurons undergo progressive plastic changes over the first day following a one-trial memory task.

">Anatomical and functional examination of superior colliculus projections to the inferior olivary neurons in mice</a></h4>

              
                The Inferior olive (IO) is an important region for motor learning and movement coordination. Its climbing fibers projection to the Purkinje neurons in the cerebellar cortex is a sole source of the complex spikes, characterized by a strong depolarization in the Purkinje neuron's dendrites. To generate spikes, the IO relies on inputs from various regions of the brain, including the superior colliculus (SC), a midbrain structure known for its role in orienting behaviors. This study investigates SC projections to the IO using viral tracers, calcium imaging, and optogenetic stimulation. We reveal that, in addition to the known projections to the medial accessory olive (MAO), SC axons also project to the ventral principal olive (PO). Despite projecting to different parts of the IO, SC-MAO and SC-PO neurons are intermingled within the lateral part of the SC with similar gross morphology. We show that SC axons terminate on both dendritic shafts and spines of IO neurons, potentially influencing not only spiking probability, but also the network synchronization mediated by gap junctions coupling on the dendritic spines. As a proof of principle, we recorded the in-vivo activity of neurons in ventral PO using calcium indicators and show that optogenetic activation of SC inputs can evoke spiking and enhance synchronization in IO neurons.

                Electron microscopy is essential for the quantitative study of synaptic ultrastructure. At present, the correlation of functional and structural properties of the same synapse is extremely challenging. We introduce a novel integrated workflow designed to simplify sample navigation across spatial scales, allowing the identification of individual synapses from optical microscopy mouse brain image stacks that can be targeted for analysis using electron tomography imaging. We developed a software which has a function to register multimodal images using a novel segmentation-based image registration algorithm as well as a function to visualize all the registration results. Using our newly designed software we streamline mapping of high-resolution optical imaging onto reference maps using blood vessels as endogenous fiducial marks. Further we demonstrate significant improvements on the ultramicrotomy stage of volume Correlative Light and Electron Microscopy (vCLEM) workflows, providing real time guidance to targeted trimming to match previously acquired Regions Of Interest (ROIs), and reliable estimates of cutting depth relative to ROI, based on fluorescence imaging of TEM ready ultrathin sections. Using this workflow, we successfully targeted TEM tomography to the proximal axonal region containing the Axon Initial Segment identified using fluorescent light microscopy.

">Red means heavy: Action intentions reactivate representations of task-relevant cognitive cues</a></h4>

              
                Recent research shows that the intention to act on an object alters its neural representation in ways as afforded by underlying sensorimotor processes. For example, the intention to grasp and pick up an object results in representations of the object`s weight. But these representations become grasp-specific only immediately before object lift if weight information is relayed through object material. This feature triggers earlier representations regardless of intention probably because material-weight contingencies are overlearned. By contrast, recently learned weight cues should be recalled deliberately during grasp planning resulting in early grasp-specific representations. Here, we examined how action intentions affect the representation of newly acquired colour-weight contingencies. We recorded electroencephalography while human participants grasped or reached for objects that varied in shape and density as indicated by their colour. Multivariate analyses revealed a grasp-specific reactivation of colour during planning that was mirrored in beta band. This suggests that task-relevancy influences the representation of colour such that previously encoded colour-weight contingencies may be reactivated as required for grasping, mediated top-down via working memory. Grasp-specific representations of shape and colour were also present in theta band, perhaps reflecting attentional activity. These results provide novel insights into the interplay between cognition and motor planning processes.

">Dual-acting gene therapy targeting HIF1A and HIF2A by RNA interference mitigates retinal degeneration in two mouse models of AMD</a></h4>

              
                Background: The combination of reduced choroidal blood flow, increased Bruchs membrane (BM) thickness and drusen formation leads to reduced oxygenation of the outer retina in the aging eye and contributes to the pathology of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). This implies that the molecular response of photoreceptors to hypoxia, with chronic activation of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) at its core, impacts disease development and progression. Methods: We used the shRNAmiR system to develop a dual-acting gene therapy based on a single AAV that reduces activity of HIF1 in photoreceptors and HIF2 in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). The virus was injected subretinally in two models of pseudo (Rod{Delta}Vhl) or true (RPE{Delta}Vegfa) hypoxia-related retinal degeneration and treated mice were followed for up to 61 weeks post-injection. Light microscopy, fluorescence funduscopy, and optical coherence tomography were used to quantify the therapeutic effect. In situ hybridization, real-time PCR, Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and flatmounts of the retina, RPE, and choroid were used to investigate the disease models and therapeutic effects of the treatment. Results: No adverse effects were noted after subretinal injection of the AAV expressing shRNAs targeting Hif1a in photoreceptors and Hif2a in the RPE. The virus preserved ONL thickness and photoreceptor segment length in Rod{Delta}Vhl mouse retinas up to 22 weeks and in RPE{Delta}Vegfa mice up to 61 weeks after injection demonstrating a long-lasting rescue of the phenotype. The dual-acting virus showed significantly higher efficacy than single-acting viruses targeting solely Hif1a in photoreceptors or Hif2a in the RPE. Conclusion: This study introduces a novel dual-acting AAV vector that effectively downregulates two different genes in two specific cell types, offering a promising therapeutic strategy for complex diseases such as AMD. By simultaneously targeting Hif1a in photoreceptors and Hif2a in the retinal pigment epithelium, this gene-agnostic therapy shows significant potential to protect retinal tissues from chronic hypoxic conditions. By targeting a common and conserved disease pathway in AMD, it is applicable to a wide range of patients.

">Computational constraints underlying theemergence of functional domains in thetopological map of Macaque V4</a></h4>

              
                V4, an intermediate visual area in the ventral visual stream of primates, is known to contain neurons tuned to color, complex local patterns, shape, and texture. Neurons with similar visual attribute preferences are closely positioned on the cortical surface, forming a topological map. Recent studies based on multi-electrode arrays and calcium imaging revealed the macaque V4 has neuronal columns tuned to specific natural image features, and these columns are clustered into various functional domains. There are domains tuned to attributes generally associated with object surface properties such as texture or color, as well as domains associated with the shape and form of object boundaries reminiscent of the blobs and inter-blobs in the primary visual cortex. Here, we explored the computational constraints underlying the development of the V4 topological map. We found that the map learned based on self-organizing principles constrained by neuronal column's tuning and retinotopy position can account for many characteristics of the observed V4 map, including the interwoven organization of texture and shape processing clusters. These anatomical clustering, with the implied local recurrent connectivity, might facilitate a modular parallel processing of surfaces and boundaries of objects along the ventral visual system.

">Deep learning super-resolution of paediatric ultra-low-field MRI without paired high-field scans</a></h4>

              
                Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for diagnosis and neurodevelopmental research, but the high cost and infrastructure demands of high-field MRI scanners restrict their use to high-income settings. To address this, more affordable and energy-efficient ultra-low-field MRI scanners have been developed. However, the reduced resolution and signal-to-noise ratio of the resulting scans limit their clinical utility, motivating the development of super-resolution techniques. The current state-of-the-art super-resolution methods require either three anisotropic ultra-low-field scans acquired at different orientations (axial, coronal, sagittal) to reconstruct a higher-resolution image using multi-resolution registration (MRR), or the training of deep learning super-resolution models using paired ultra-low- and high-field scans. Since acquiring three high-quality ultra-low-field scans is not always feasible, and paired high-field data may not be available for the target population, this study explores the efficacy of using a deep learning model, the 3D UNet, to generate higher-resolution brain scans from just one ultra-low-field scan. The model was trained to receive a single ultra-low-field brain scan of 6-month-old infants and produce a scan of MRR quality. Results showed a significant improvement in the quality of output scans compared to input scans, including increased image quality metrics, stronger correlations in tissue volume estimates across participants, and greater Dice overlap of the underlying tissue segmentations to those of target scans. The study demonstrates that the 3D UNet effectively enhances the resolution of ultra-low-field infant MRI scans. Generating higher-resolution brain scans from single ultra-low-field scans, without needing paired high-field data, reduces scanning time and supports wider MRI use in low- and middle-income countries. Additionally, this approach allows for easier model training on a site- and population-specific basis, enhancing adaptability in diverse settings.

">Integrating Ideal Bayesian Searcher and Neural Networks Models for Eye Movement Prediction in a Hybrid Search Task</a></h4>

              
                Visual search, where observers search for a specific item, is a crucial aspect of daily human interaction with the visual environment. Hybrid search extends this by requiring observers to search for any item from a given set of objects. While there are models proficient at simulating human eye movement in visual search tasks within natural scenes, none are able to do so in Hybrid search tasks within similar environments. In this work, we present an enhanced version of the neural network Entropy Limit Minimization (nnELM) model, which is based on a Bayesian framework and decision theory. We also present the Hybrid Search Eye Movements (HSEM) Dataset, comprising several thousands of human eye movements during hybrid search tasks in natural scenes. A key challenge in Hybrid search, absent in visual search, is that participants might search for different objects at different time points. To address this, we developed a strategy based on the posterior probability distribution generated after each fixation. By adjusting the model's peripheral visibility, we made early search stages more efficient, aligning it closer to human behaviour. Additionally, limiting the model's memory capacity reduced its success in longer searches, mirroring human performance. To validate these improvements, we compared our model against participants from the HSEM dataset and against existing models in a visual search benchmark. Altogether, the new nnELM model not only successfully explains Hybrid search tasks, but also closely replicates human behaviour in natural scenes. This work advances our understanding of complex processes underlying visual and Hybrid search while maintaining model interpretability.

">An optical brain-machine interface reveals a causal role of posterior parietal cortex in goal-directed navigation</a></h4>

              
                Cortical circuits contain diverse sensory, motor, and cognitive signals, and form densely recurrent networks. This creates challenges for identifying causal relationships between neural populations and behavior. We developed a calcium imaging-based brain-machine interface (BMI) to study the role of posterior parietal cortex (PPC) in controlling navigation in virtual reality. By training a decoder to estimate navigational heading and velocity from PPC activity during virtual navigation, we discovered that mice could immediately navigate toward goal locations when control was switched to BMI. No learning or adaptation was observed during BMI, indicating that naturally occurring PPC activity patterns are sufficient to drive navigational trajectories in real time. During successful BMI trials, decoded trajectories decoupled from the mouse's physical movements, suggesting that PPC activity relates to intended trajectories. Our work demonstrates a role for PPC in navigation and offers a BMI approach for investigating causal links between neural activity and behavior.

">Lower-limb express visuomotor responses are spared in Parkinson's Disease during step initiation from a stable position</a></h4>

              
                While motor impairments have been extensively studied in Parkinson's Disease, rapid visuomotor transformations for flexible interaction with the environment have received surprisingly little attention. In recent years, such rapid visuomotor transformations have been studied in the form of express visuomotor responses (EVRs), which are goal-directed bursts of muscle activity that are thought to originate from superior colliculus, reaching the periphery via the tecto-reticulospinal pathway. Here, we examined EVRs in the lower limbs during goal-directed step initiation in 20 people with Parkison's Disease (PwPD) and 20 age-matched healthy control participants (HC). As lower-limb EVRs in the young have been shown to interact with postural control - which is often affected in PwPD - we manipulated the postural demands by varying initial stance width and target location. In the low postural demand condition, EVRs were robustly present in both the PwPD (17/20) and HC (16/20) group. However, when postural demands were high, EVRs were largely absent in both groups and, instead, strong anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs) were required prior to foot off. EVR magnitudes were, on average, stronger in PwPD compared to HC, but they decreased with increasing disease severity, suggesting that the EVR network may become compromised or down-regulated in later stages of the disease. While APA magnitudes were smaller in PwPD compared to HC, subsequent stepping performance (step reaction time, duration, size, velocity) was remarkably similar between the two groups. We suggest that the EVR network may be upregulated in the early stages of Parkinson's disease in order to compensate for some of the emerging motor deficits experienced in daily life.

">Intestinal Dysbiosis Alters Acute Seizure Burden and Antiseizure Medicine Activity in the Theiler's Virus Model of Encephalitis</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Brain infection with Theiler's virus (TMEV) in C57BL/6J mice produces an etiologically relevant model of acquired seizures. Dietary changes can modify acute seizure presentation following TMEV brain infection and influence intestinal microbiome diversity and composition. Intestinal dysbiosis may thus similarly affect seizure burden and antiseizure medicine (ASM) activity in this model, independent of pharmacokinetic effects. We thus sought to define the influence of antibiotic (ABX)-induced gut dysbiosis on acute seizure presentation, anticonvulsant activity of carbamazepine (CBZ), and CBZ pharmacokinetics with TMEV infection. Methods: Male C57BL/6J mice (4-5 weeks) received oral (p.o.) ABX or saline (SAL) once daily beginning on arrival through Day 7 post-TMEV infection (p.i.). Mice were infected with TMEV or PBS on Day 0. Mice received intraperitoneal (i.p.; 20 mg/kg) CBZ or vehicle (VEH) twice daily Days 3-7 p.i. and were assessed for handling-induced seizures 30 min after treatment. Plasma was collected on Day 7 p.i. at 15 and 60 min post-CBZ administration for bioanalysis. Results: TMEV infection induced acute seizures, but ABX-induced gut dysbiosis altered seizure presentation. There were 75% SAL-VEH, 35% SAL-CBZ, 35% ABX-VEH, and 72% ABX-CBZ mice with seizures during the 7-day monitoring period. There was a significant pretreatment x ASM interaction (p=0.0001), with differences in seizure burden in SAL- versus ABX-pretreated mice (p=0.004). CBZ significantly increased latency to seizure presentation; an effect absent in ABX-CBZ mice. Plasma CBZ concentrations did not differ between SAL and ABX pretreatment groups, suggesting that ABX did not influence CBZ pharmacokinetics. Significance: ABX-induced gut dysbiosis markedly altered acute disease trajectory with TMEV-induced encephalitis, reflecting a novel contribution of the gut microbiome to seizure presentation. ABX-induced gut dysbiosis also significantly changed acute seizure control by CBZ, but did not influence plasma CBZ concentrations. The gut-brain axis is thus an under-recognized contributor to TMEV infection-induced seizures, ASM activity, and disease burden.

">Nonequilibrium dynamics elicited as the origin of perturbative complexity</a></h4>

              
                Assessing the level of consciousness someone is in, is not a trivial question and physicians have to rely on behavioural evaluations instead of quantifiable metrics. Many studies have empirically investigated measures related to the complexity elicited after the brain is stimulated to quantify and assess the level of consciousness across different states. Here we hypothesized that the level of non-equilibrium dynamics of the unperturbed brain already contains the information needed to know how the system will react to an external stimulus. We created personalized whole-brain models fitted to resting state fMRI data recorded in participants in different states of reduced consciousness (such as deep sleep and disorders of consciousness) to infer the effective connections underlying their brain dynamics. We then measured the out-of-equilibrium nature of the unperturbed brain by evaluating the level of asymmetry of the inferred connectivity, the time irreversibility in each model and compared this with the elicited complexity generated after in silico perturbations. Crucially, we found that states of reduced consciousness had a lower level of asymmetry in their effective connectivities compared to control subjects, as well as a lower level of irreversibility in their simulated dynamics, and a lower complexity. We demonstrated that the asymmetry in the underlying connections drives the nonequilibrium state of the system and in turn the differences in complexity as a response to the external stimuli.

">Pleasant smells: a privileged gateway to soothing autonomic responses and improving brain-body rhythm coupling</a></h4>

              
                Aromatherapy commonly uses odors to improve well-being through their evocation of positive emotions. Although knowledge in this area is often very empirical, the olfactory stimulus has different properties which, taken together, could explain why it can relax. First, olfactory sense have a direct access to the limbic system, without thalamic relay processing, which confers it a strong emotional valence. Second, when appreciated, odors can slow down breathing and cardiac rates. Third, when slow and deep, breathing can entrain brain activity, due to the mechano-sensitivity of olfactory receptors to airflows. We hypothesized that, thanks to these properties, pleasant odors could enhance the subjective feeling of relaxation, slow down body rhythms, and facilitate entrainment of brain activity by respiration. Comparing the effects of a personally pleasant odor to a personally pleasant music on psychological, physiological and neuronal responses, we showed a tendency for both odors and music to enhance subjective relaxation. However, only pleasant odors were able to 1) decrease heart rate while increasing its variability, and 2) decrease respiratory rate while enhancing the respiratory drive of brain activities, regardless of the music tempo. Overall, we demonstrated that the positive emotion evoked by a personally pleasant smell is sufficient to evoke an olfactomotor response, which, by slowing breathing, synchronizes respiration, fluctuations of heart rate and brain activity.

">Dissecting the differential role of C-terminal truncations in the regulation of aSyn pathology formation and the biogenesis of Lewy bodies</a></h4>

              
                Alpha-synuclein (aSyn) post-translational modifications (PTMs), particularly phosphorylation at serine 129 and C-terminal truncations, are highly enriched in Lewy bodies (LBs), Lewy neurites, and other types of aSyn pathological aggregates in the brain of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and other synucleinopathies. However, our knowledge about the precise role of PTMs in regulating the different stages of pathology formation, neurodegeneration, and aSyn pathology spreading remains incomplete. In this work, we applied a systematic approach to address this knowledge gap with an emphasis on mapping and elucidating the role of post-fibrillization C-terminal aSyn truncations in regulating the uptake, processing, seeding activity, and formation of LB-like inclusions and maturations in a well-established neuronal seeding model that recapitulates all the stages leading to LB formation and neurodegeneration. Our work shows that C-terminal cleavage of aSyn fibrils at multiple sites is a conserved process that occurs rapidly after and during the formation of intracellular LB-like aSyn inclusions in all neuronal seeding models. Interestingly, blocking the cleavage of internalized fibrils does not influence their seeding activity, whereas inhibiting the enzymes that regulate the cleavage of newly formed fibrils (e.g., calpains 1 and 2) significantly alters the formation of LB-like inclusions. We also show that C-terminal truncations, in combination with other PTMs, play a crucial role in regulating the interactome and remodeling of newly formed aSyn fibrils, including their shortening, lateral association, and packing during LB formation and maturation. Altogether, our results demonstrate that post-fibrillization C-terminal truncations have a differential role at different stages of aSyn aggregation and pathology formation. These insights, combined with the abundance of truncated aSyn species in LBs, have significant implications in understanding aSyn pathological diversity and developing therapeutic strategies targeting the C-terminus of aSyn or its proteolytic processing.

	<p>Background. Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a prevalent psychopathological condition, affecting 0.7&amp;amp;ndash;2.7% of the general population. Given the known link between identity formation and the temporal, metacognitive, and narrative processes that contribute to its coherence, the aim of the present systematic review is to synthesize the current literature about the relationship between identity diffusion and lived time in adult patients with BPD. This would enhance knowledge and treatments, leading to a better understanding of the implications of time processes on identity diffusion in BPD. Methods. According to PRISMA guidelines, the main databases were consulted, and specific eligibility criteria were applied. The selection leads to the inclusion of 15 articles, investigating through integrated techniques the lived time, memory, self-reported narratives, and metacognition in BPD subjects. Results. A general agreement among researchers was found, confirming greater difficulty for BPD subjects in producing autobiographical stories, logically and temporally integrated, characterized by positive content. Functional and structural alterations were detected to explain narrative incoherence, as well as symptoms such as emotional dysregulation and cognitive biases. Conclusions. The difficulty for BPD subjects in producing a coherent personal narrative has been interpreted as a correlation of anomalies in autobiographical memories and consequently identities, which were equally compromised by the experience of discontinuity in the temporal structure. This would confirm the hypothesis of the temporal fragmentation of the self in BPD. Although some limitations have been encountered, we suggest that the understanding of identity diffusion and lived time in BPD subjects could represent a useful guide for further research.</p>

	<p>The advent of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells has recently changed the prognosis of relapsing/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, showing response rates as high as 60 to 80%. Common toxicities reported in the pivotal clinical trials include the cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and the Immune effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS), a stereotyped encephalopathy related to myeloid cell activation and blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier dysfunction, presenting with a distinctive cascade of dysgraphia, aphasia, disorientation, attention deficits, vigilance impairment, motor symptoms, seizures, and diffuse brain oedema. The tremendous oncological efficacy of CAR-T cells observed in systemic B-cell malignancies is leading to their growing use in patients with primary or secondary central nervous system (CNS) lymphomas and in patients with solid tumours, including several CNS cancers. Early studies conducted in adult and paediatric patients with solid CNS tumours reported a distinct profile of neurotoxicity referred to as Tumour inflammation-associated neurotoxicity (TIAN), corresponding to local inflammation at the tumour site manifesting with focal neurological deficits or mechanical complications (e.g., obstructive hydrocephalus). The present review summarises available data on the efficacy and safety of CAR-T cells for solid and haematological CNS malignancies, emphasising known and emerging phenotypes, ongoing challenges, and future perspectives.</p>

	<p>Background: The involvement of the circadian system in the etiology and treatment of Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) is becoming an increasingly important topic. The prodromal symptoms of PD include insomnia, fatigue, depression and sleep disturbance which herald the onset of the primary symptoms of bradykinesia, tremor and rigidity while robbing patients of their quality of life. Light treatment (LT) has been implemented for modifying circadian function in PD but few studies have examined its use in a protracted term that characterizes PD itself. Methods: The present exploratory study monitors the effect of LT over a 10 year course of PD in the context of ongoing circadian function. Results: Improvement in circadian based symptoms were seen soon after LT commenced and continued for the duration of the study. Improvement in motor function was more subtle and was not distinguishable until 1.2 years after commencing treatment. Improvement in most motor and prodromal symptoms remained in steady state for the duration of the study as long as patients were compliant with daily use. Conclusions: The sequence of improvement in prodromal symptoms and motor function seen here parallels the slow, incremental repair process mimicking the protracted degenerative sequelae of PD that extends over decades. This process also emulates the slow incremental improvement characterizing the reparative course seen with circadian symptoms in other disorders that improve with LT. Recent findings from epidemiological work suggest that early disruption of circadian rhythmicity is associated with increased risk of PD and the present findings are consistent with that hypothesis. It is concluded that intervening in circadian function with LT presents a minimally invasive method that is compatible with internal timing that slows the degenerative process of PD.</p>

	<p>Objective: Visual processing deficits arising in dementia are associated with particular functional disability. This study aimed to investigate the effects of the built environment on mobility and navigation in people with dementia-related visual loss. Methods: Participants with posterior cortical atrophy (PCA; &amp;amp;ldquo;visual-variant Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s&amp;amp;rdquo;; n = 11), typical Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (tAD; N = 10), and controls (n = 13) repeatedly walked down routes within a simplified real-world setting. Participant groups were of comparable age and gender. Routes were of different complexity (straight, U-shaped, and S-shaped), overhead lighting levels (low and high) and with or without a dynamic LED (light-emitting diode) cue (trial n = 24). Ratios of walking times for each experimental condition (each complex route vs the straight route, high lighting vs low, and LED cue vs no cue) were compared between participant groups. Kinematic measures were produced from a total of 10,813 steps using wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs). Results: The walking time ratios relating to route complexity were higher in the PCA group than in controls: 30.3% (95% CI [13.5%, 49.5%] higher for U-shaped vs straight and 31.9% [21.1%, 55.3%] for S-shaped vs straight, averaged over other conditions). The analogous results relating to route complexity for the tAD group were intermediate between those for the PCA and control groups. There was no evidence that walking time ratios differed according to lighting level or the presence of the LED cue. Conclusions: Findings contribute to evidence-based design for dementia-friendly environments, emphasizing consequences of environmental complexity for functional independence and mobility in people with dementia-related visual loss. Findings inform recommendations for environmental design to support the independence of individuals with dementia.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Emotional prosody, the intonation and rhythm of speech that conveys emotions, is vital for speech communication as it provides essential context and nuance to the words being spoken. This study explored how listeners automatically process emotional prosody in speech, focusing on different neural responses for the prosodic categories and potential sex differences. Methods: The pilot data here involved 11 male and 11 female adult participants (age range: 18&amp;amp;ndash;28). A multi-feature oddball paradigm was used, in which participants were exposed to sequences of non-repeating English words with emotional (angry, happy, sad) or neutral prosody while watching a silent movie. Results: Both mismatch negativity (MMN) and P3a components were observed, indicating automatic perceptual grouping and neural sensitivity to emotional variations in speech. Women showed stronger MMN to angry than sad prosody, while men showed stronger MMN to angry than happy prosody. Happy prosody elicited the strongest P3a, but only in men. Conclusions: The findings challenge the notion that all facets of emotion processing are biased toward female superiority. However, these results from 22 young adult native English speakers should be interpreted with caution, as data from a more adequate sample size are needed to test the generalizability of the findings. Combined with results from studies on children and elderly adults, these preliminary data underscore the need to explore the complexities of emotional speech processing mechanisms to account for category and sex differences across the lifespan in a longitudinal perspective.</p>

	<p>Background: Among all professions, teaching is significantly affected by psycho-social risks with approximately 33.33% of educators reporting work-related fatigue. Suggestopedia, an effective pedagogical approach developed in Bulgaria, claims to induce positive psychological and cognitive benefits in both teachers and students. In order to gather scientific evidence, given the above statement, we designed a methodology to detect fatigue in Suggestopedia teachers based on neurocognitive analysis and psychological assessment. Methods: An increase in the EEG theta and alpha band powers is considered among the most reliable markers of fatigue. The proposed methodology introduces a robust framework for fatigue analysis. Initially, the changes in EEG band powers using the resting state EEG activity before and after teaching are measured. Subsequently, validated psychological questionnaires are used to gain subjective feedback on fatigue. The study participants include a control group (traditional teachers) and the test group (suggestopedia teachers) to assess whether suggestopedia practice mitigates fatigue among teachers. Observations: In a pilot study, the EEG data was analyzed by evaluating the interrelations between EEG bands and the alpha&amp;amp;ndash;beta ratio. The results of the proposed study are expected to provide comprehensive analysis for the fatigue levels of teachers. In future research, our goal is to position the described methodology as a robust approach for evaluating cognitive and emotional states.</p>

                In Peru, insect consumption, as a nutritional complement or as the main source in the diet, is limited to the regions of our the central jungle where Atta sexdens ants are consumed. An energy bar based on Andean grains with Atta sexdens ant flour was formulated. The ants were obtained from the department of San Martin, district of Rioja, province of Rioja. Four different formulations were prepared with different Atta sexdens ant flour concentrations: 15%, 20%, 25%, and 30%. Moisture, total fat, ash, proteins, fiber, carbohydrates, instrumental texture, and organoleptic analysis (taste, texture, and color) were performed. The developed cereal energy bar presented a 10 g protein content in 100 g of the final product. Acceptability was evaluated in adolescents and young adult populations. The developed cereal bars presented a high protein content, adequate organoleptic properties and high acceptability. However, this must be considered in the context of the rising cost of protein-rich foods.

                Background Pathological response of liver metastases (LM) from colorectal carcinoma (CRC) to neoadjuvant therapy is a known prognostic factor associated with recurrence and survival. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of two prognostic scores in patients who underwent surgery for colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRCLM), specifically in stage IV disease. Methods We conducted a study on patients with stage IV colorectal cancer who received preoperative chemotherapy (CT) followed by liver metastasis (LM) resection between 2015 and 2021. Among these patients, 57% had synchronous metastases (diagnosed at the same time as the primary tumor), while the remaining cases were metachronous (diagnosed after the primary tumor). Pathological response was evaluated using both the Rubbia-Brandt tumor regression grade (TRG) and the Blazer scoring system. We then assessed the performance of these two prognostic scores based on homogeneity (using the likelihood ratio, LR+), monotonicity, and discriminative ability (using the area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve, AUC). Results 70 cases were included in the study. Mean age was 56 years. The sex ratio (males/females) was 2.2. Forty patients were stage IV (57%) with synchronous all CRCLMs. The overall survival, all stages combined, was 85.5% at 12 months, 41.7% at 24 months and 19.3% at 36 months. The median survival was better in case of major response (TRG1/TRG2) evaluated at 40.1 and 41.1 months after diagnosis. In cases of partial response (TRG3), the median survival was 32.1 months. In cases with no response (TRG4/TRG5), survival was estimated at 29.9 and 18.5 months. The Rubbia-Brandt TRG had the highest LR+ (10.95). The LR+ of the Rubbia-Brandt score was greater than 10, so it was a test with very strong contribution. The LR+ of the Blazer score was between 5 and 10, it was a test with strong contribution. The Rubbia-Brandt TRG had the highest linearity value (10.73). With a higher AUC of the ROC curve (0.8), the Rubbia-Brandt TRG was better at predicting survival than the Blazer score. Conclusion Surgical resection is the gold standard for CRCLM, with improved prognosis from neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Pathological response to CT is a key prognostic factor, and the Rubbia Brandt TRG system enhances survival predictivity when combined with ypTN stage.

                Background Research software is increasingly recognized as critical infrastructure in contemporary science. It spans a broad spectrum, including source code files, algorithms, scripts, computational workflows, and executables, all created for or during research. While research funders have developed programs, initiatives, and policies to bolster research software’s role, there has been no empirical study of how these funders prioritize support for research software. Understanding their priorities is essential to clarify where current support is concentrated and to identify strategic gaps. Methods We conducted an online mixed methods survey of international research funders (n=36) to explore their priorities in supporting research software. The survey gathered data on the specific outcomes funders emphasize in their programs and initiatives for research software. Results The survey revealed that funders place strong emphasis on developing skills, promoting software sustainability, embedding open science practices, building community and collaboration, advancing research software funding mechanisms, increasing software visibility and use, fostering innovation, and ensuring security. Conclusions The findings highlight opportunities to enhance research software’s role through increased funder attention on professional recognition for software contributions and the non-technical, social aspects of research software sustainability. Addressing these areas could lead to more effective support and development of research software, ultimately benefitting the entire research ecosystem.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-188/v2?src=rss">Impacts of illegal trade on socio-emotional and behavioural skills in macaques [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Decades of research have illuminated the consequences of early adverse rearing experiences in laboratory macaque populations. However, knowledge of the impact of traumatic episodes in non-laboratory settings remains limited. This study investigates the socio-emotional and behavioural impacts of illegal trade on five macaque species, all victims of poaching. We studied 53 focal subjects residing at the Lao Conservation Trust for Wildlife (LCTW), a former zoo converted into a rescue and rehabilitation centre. We categorised their past experiences into seven aspects, encompassing maternal care and interactions with conspecifics. We assessed social engagement and cooperation by analysing social behaviours and employing the Social Responsiveness Scale. Emotional resilience was evaluated by measuring anxiety levels and the occurrence of abnormal behaviours, supported by a welfare questionnaire. Additionally, the introduction of Cattell’s 16PF questionnaire in macaques for the first time aimed to reveal the influence of traumatic experiences on their personality traits. Our findings underscore the significance of early social exposure to conspecifics. Macaques deprived of juvenile social contact show reduced social behaviours and a tendency towards social avoidance in adulthood. Human-reared macaques display increased abnormal behaviours in social contexts, which compromises welfare. Social deprivation with conspecifics during infancy negatively affects psychological stimulation and overall welfare, with prolonged time in illegal trade correlating with increased anxiety levels. Personality traits, such as ‘Calmness’ and ‘Unfriendliness’, are shaped by rearing conditions, with macaques deprived of social interaction showing higher levels of introversion. In summary, the more time macaques spend in human care with minimal exposure to conspecifics, the more pronounced the impacts on anxiety, abnormal social behaviours, and personality traits, highlighting the significant long-term effects of early rearing conditions on their socio-emotional development.

                Background Stroke survivors, especially working-age adults, face an increased risk of recurrent stroke within one to five years after the initial occurrence, primarily due to suboptimal risk factor management. This study aims to investigate the contributing factors associated with the risk of recurrent stroke in this demographic. Methods This case-control study matched participants with recurrent stroke to those without recurrent stroke by age and gender. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to calculate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to identify significant factors associated with recurrent stroke. The study included 100 patients with recurrent stroke and 200 control participants recruited from the hospital database. Results Significant factors associated with recurrent stroke were gender (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.10 to 3.29), high fasting blood sugar (OR, 3.70; 95% CI, 1.10 to 3.29), drinking status (OR, 3.63; 95% CI, 3.01 to 6.54), sedentary lifestyle (OR, 2.77; 95% CI, 1.50 to 5.13), and lack of workplace support for health (OR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.13 to 3.63). The association of female gender, marital status, smoking status, sedentary lifestyle, interpersonal relationships at the workplace, and workplace support for health with recurrent stroke differed by age group. Conclusions This study highlights the importance of addressing lifestyle-related and occupational factors to reduce recurrent stroke risk among working-age adults. Tailoring age-specific stroke prevention strategies, promoting healthier lifestyles, and implementing evidence-based interventions can lead to improved stroke outcomes and enhance the quality of life for this vulnerable population.

                Abstract Backgrounds The retention of the maxillary complete denture may be influenced by adequate recording in the patient’s mouth, marking, and carving of the post-dam on the maxillary cast. Failure to do so may lead to loss of retention. Successful denture construction with patient’s comfort could be achieved by effective methods of recording, marking, and carving of the post-dam. The aim of the study was to assess Iraqi dentists in their knowledge and application of the post-dam in maxillary complete dentures. Methods Questionnaires were distributed randomly through online Google Forms and 118 Iraqi dentists with different academic degree participated in the study. A multinomial logistic regression model was also used to assess the nominal outcome variables. Results A High percentage of 90.7% of Iraqi dentists with different academic degree stated that they had the knowledge about the vibrating lines and their location and 84.7% stated that they mark the post-dam on the master cast, while 15.3% stated that the dental technician marks it. More the half (52.5%) of the participants carved the post-dam, while 47.5% of the participants stated that the dental technician did it. For participants not marking the post-dam, 30.5% of the participants stated they depend on the dental technician in marking and/or carve the post-dam, while the fear of denture failure and loss of retention was observed in 25.4% of the participants, followed by 24.6% of participants forgetting to carve, 10.2% of participants had no information about carving, and 9.3% participants found it was difficult to carve. Conclusions Within the limitations of the study, most Iraqi dentists with different academic degree stated that they had the knowledge on the location of vibrating lines. However, recording and carving the post-dam was influenced by the dentist’s personal preference and their dependency on the dental technician.

<p>This study provides insights into changes in the glymphatic system using the diffusion tensor imaging analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) method and choroid plexus volume (CPV) in Japanese older adults with poor sleep quality. Our findings revealed a decrease in the DTI-ALPS index and a significant association between the DTI-ALPS index and CPV among older adults with PSQ.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>This study included 52 Japanese older adults with Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores &gt; 5 and 52 healthy controls (HCs) with PSQI score ≤ 5. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and 3D T1-weighted imaging were acquired using 3T magnetic resonance imaging. The diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) index was calculated using preprocessed DWI. The choroid plexus volume (CPV) was calculated using FreeSurfer 6.0. The mean ALPS index and CPV were compared between the older adults with poor sleep quality (PSQ) and HCs using a general linear model, adjusted for covariates including age, sex, years of education, total intracranial volume, systolic blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c, and white matter lesion volume. We also conducted a partial correlation analysis between the mean ALPS index and CPV, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and PSQI scores, adjusting for all the mentioned covariates. The PSQ group had a significantly lower mean ALPS index than HCs. The mean ALPS index in the PSQ group was negatively correlated with CPV and positively correlated with the MoCA score. Therefore, older adults with PSQ may experience dysfunction in the excretory pathway of the perivascular space around the medullary veins. This impairment may be associated with an increase in CPV and cognitive dysfunction.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The interaction between major depressive disorder (MDD) and overweight/obesity has received considerable attention owing to its widespread occurrence and the intricate biopsychological implications involved. Despite extensive research, the neural mechanisms underlying these comorbid conditions, particularly in terms of functional network connectivity (FNC), are still not well understood. This study aimed to clarify these mechanisms by utilizing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) to examine both static and dynamic FNC. We analyzed data from 57 patients with both MDD and overweight/obesity (MDD-OW), 57 MDD patients of normal weight (MDD-NW), and 44 healthy controls, using techniques such as independent component analysis, sliding window analysis, K-means clustering, and graph theory. In contrast to static FNC, which showed no significant differences, dynamic FNC analysis identified four consistent states across all participants. Both MDD groups demonstrated reduced flexibility in functional coordination among these states and decreased nodal characteristics within the salience network. Notably, the MDD-OW group displayed enhanced dynamic FNC between the default mode network (DMN) and the executive control network (ECN) during certain states, which was inversely associated with the severity of depressive symptoms. These results highlight the importance of altered dynamic connectivity patterns in individuals with MDD and concurrent overweight/obesity, especially between the DMN and ECN, suggesting their potential utility as biomarkers for depressive states. This research contributes to our understanding of how comorbid overweight/obesity affects brain network dynamics in depressive disorders and provides a basis for targeted therapeutic strategies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/10738584241293366?ai=2b4&mi=ehikzz&af=R">Oxytocin in Human Social Network Cooperation</a></h4>

              
                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>Human society is organized in structured social networks upon which large-scale cooperation among genetically unrelated individuals is favored and persists. Such large-scale cooperation is crucial for the success of the human species but also one of the most puzzling challenges. Recent work in social and behavioral neuroscience has linked human cooperation to oxytocin, an evolutionarily ancient and structurally preserved hypothalamic neuropeptide. This review aims to elucidate how oxytocin promotes nonkin cooperation in social networks by reviewing its effects at three distinct levels: individual cooperation, the formation of interpersonal relationships, and the establishment of heterogeneous network structures. We propose oxytocin as a proximate mechanism for fostering large-scale cooperation in human societies. Specifically, oxytocin plays an important role in facilitating network-wide cooperation in human societies by 1) increasing individual cooperation, mitigating noncooperation motives, and facilitating the enforcement of cooperative norms; 2) fostering interpersonal bonding and synchronization; and 3) facilitating the formation of heterogeneous network structures.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Over 90% of protein degradation in eukaryotic cells occurs through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). In this system, the ubiquitin protein can bind to a substrate on its own or it can form a chain with multiple ubiquitin molecules in a process called polyubiquitination. There are 8 different sites on ubiquitin at which polyubiquitin chains can be formed, the second most abundant of which, lysine-63 (K63), is independent of the degradation process, though this mark has rarely been studied in the brain or during learning-dependent synaptic plasticity. Recently, we found that knockdown of K63 polyubiquitination in the amygdala selectively impaired contextual fear memory formation in female, but not male, rats. It is unknown, however, whether the sex-specific requirement of K63 polyubiquitination occurs in other brain regions that are required for contextual fear memory formation, including the hippocampus. Here, we found that CRISPR-dCas13-mediated knockdown of K63 polyubiquitination in the hippocampus significantly enhanced contextual fear memory in both male and female rats, a result that is in striking contrast to what we observed in the amygdala for both sex-specificity and directionality. Using unbiased proteomics, we found that following fear conditioning K63 polyubiquitination was primarily decreased at target proteins in the hippocampus of both males and females. Importantly, the target proteins and downstream functional pathways influenced by K63 polyubiquitination changes diverged significantly by sex. Together, these data suggest that unlike what we previously reported in the amygdala, decreases in K63 polyubiquitination in the hippocampus are a critical regulator of memory formation in the hippocampus of both males and females.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/83288">Determining the effects of paternal obesity on sperm chromatin at histone H3 lysine 4 tri-methylation in relation to the placental transcriptome and cellular composition</a></h4>

              
                Paternal obesity has been implicated in adult-onset metabolic disease in offspring. However, the molecular mechanisms driving these paternal effects and the developmental processes involved remain poorly understood. One underexplored possibility is the role of paternally-induced effects on placenta development and function. To address this, we investigated paternal high-fat diet-induced obesity in relation to sperm histone H3 lysine 4 tri-methylation signatures, the placenta transcriptome and cellular composition. C57BL6/J male mice were fed either a control or high-fat diet for 10 weeks beginning at 6 weeks of age. Males were timed-mated with control-fed C57BL6/J females to generate pregnancies, followed by collection of sperm, and placentas at embryonic day (E)14.5. Chromatin immunoprecipitation targeting histone H3 lysine 4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3) followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) was performed on sperm to define obesity-associated changes in enrichment. Paternal obesity corresponded with altered sperm H3K4me3 at promoters of genes involved in metabolism and development. Notably, sperm altered H3K4me3 was also localized at placental enhancers. Bulk RNA-sequencing on placentas revealed paternal obesity-associated sex-specific changes in expression of genes involved in hypoxic processes such as angiogenesis, nutrient transport, and imprinted genes, with a subset of deregulated genes showing changes in H3K4me3 in sperm at corresponding promoters. Paternal obesity was also linked to impaired placenta development; specifically, a deconvolution analysis revealed altered trophoblast cell lineage specification. These findings implicate paternal obesity-effects on placenta development and function as one potential developmental route to offspring metabolic disease.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101483">The membrane domains of mammalian adenylyl cyclases are lipid receptors</a></h4>

              
                The biosynthesis of cyclic 3′,5′-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) by mammalian membrane-bound adenylyl cyclases (mACs) is predominantly regulated by G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Up to now the two hexahelical transmembrane domains of mACs were considered to fix the enzyme to membranes. Here, we show that the transmembrane domains serve in addition as signal receptors and transmitters of lipid signals that control Gsα-stimulated mAC activities. We identify aliphatic fatty acids and anandamide as receptor ligands of mAC isoforms 1–7 and 9. The ligands enhance (mAC isoforms 2, 3, 7, and 9) or attenuate (isoforms 1, 4, 5, and 6) Gsα-stimulated mAC activities in vitro and in vivo. Substitution of the stimulatory membrane receptor of mAC3 by the inhibitory receptor of mAC5 results in a ligand inhibited mAC5–mAC3 chimera. Thus, we discovered a new class of membrane receptors in which two signaling modalities are at a crossing, direct tonic lipid and indirect phasic GPCR–Gsα signaling regulating the biosynthesis of cAMP.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Dopamine replacement therapy for Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) may lead to disabling incontrollable movements known as L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been applied as non-invasive therapy to ameliorate motor symptoms and dyskinesias in PD treatment. Recent studies have shown that TMS-induced motor effects might be related to dopaminergic system modulation. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects of TMS are not fully understood. Objectives: To assess the expression of FosB and c-Fos in dopamine-D1 receptor-containing cells of dyskinetic rats and to analyze the effect of TMS on dyskinetic behavior and its histological marker (FosB). Methods: We investigated the outcome of TMS on cellular activation, using c-Fos immunoreactivity, on D1 receptor-positive (D1R+) cells into the motor cortex and striatum of dyskinetic (n = 14) and intact rats (n = 14). Additionally, we evaluated the effect of TMS on the dyskinesia global score and its molecular marker, FosB, in the striatum (n = 67). Results: TMS reduces c-Fos expression in D1R+cells into the motor cortex and striatum. Moreover, TMS treatment attenuated dyskinesias, along with a low stratal FosB expression. Conclusions: The current study shows that TMS depressed FosB and c-Fos expression in D1R+ cells of the dorsal striatum and motor cortex, in accordance with previous evidence of its capacity to modulate the dopaminergic system, thus suggesting a mechanism by which TMS may mitigate dyskinesias. Additionally, our observations highlight the potential therapeutic effect of TMS on dyskinesias in a PD model.</p>

	<p>Tinnitus is correlated with anomalies of neural plasticity and has been found to be affected by inflammatory status. The current theories on tinnitus, although still somewhat incomplete, are based on maladaptive plasticity mechanisms. Astrocytes play a major role in both neural responses to inflammation and plasticity regulation; moreover, they have recently been discovered to encode &amp;amp;ldquo;context&amp;amp;rdquo; for neuronal circuits, which is similar to the &amp;amp;ldquo;expectation&amp;amp;rdquo; of Bayesian brain models. Therefore, this narrative review explores the possible and likely roles of astrocytes in the neural mechanisms leading to acute and chronic tinnitus.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased mental health issues, particularly among long-COVID patients, who experience persistent symptoms post-recovery, potentially leading to chronic conditions. The psychological impact of long-COVID is still largely unknown, but it may contribute to mental disorders like Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Given the global rise in anxiety and depression, exploring therapies like Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) for long-COVID traumatic disorders is crucial. This study explores the effectiveness of remote EMDR therapy for PTSD-like symptoms in long-COVID conditions (LCC), assessing their emergence, the impact of LCC on mental health, and identifying key commonalities. It also examines the potential advantages of an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered platform for EMDR treatments for both therapists and patients, evaluating the response differences between remote and in-person treatment. Methods: We enrolled a total of 160 participants divided into two groups of 80, with the experimental group receiving EMDR treatment for PTSD-like symptoms via a remote AI-powered platform, and the control group receiving traditional in-person therapy. We compared the ANOVA for Subjective Units of Disturbance (SUDs) scores, PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) scores, and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) scores between our two groups for three cases: pre-treatment, post-treatment, and decrement. Results: Statistical significance analysis showed a consistent absence of significant differences between online AI-powered platforms and traditional in-presence sessions. This effectively confirms our hypothesis and highlights that no significant differences were observed between the two groups. Conclusions: The AI-supported remote platform demonstrates comparable efficacy in delivering EMDR therapy, confirming its potential as an effective alternative to traditional in-person methods while providing added advantages in accessibility and adaptability (e.g., remote areas, hikikomori, natural disasters).</p>

	<p>Background: Emotions significantly influence decision-making, social interactions, and medical outcomes. Leveraging emotion recognition through Electroencephalography (EEG) signals offers potential advancements in personalized medicine, adaptive technologies, and mental health diagnostics. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of three neural network architectures&amp;amp;mdash;ShallowFBCSPNet, Deep4Net, and EEGNetv4&amp;amp;mdash;for emotion classification using the SEED-V dataset. Methods: The SEED-V dataset comprises EEG recordings from 16 individuals exposed to 15 emotion-eliciting video clips per session, targeting happiness, sadness, disgust, neutrality, and fear. EEG data were preprocessed with a bandpass filter, segmented by emotional episodes, and split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets. Three neural networks were trained and evaluated to classify emotions from the EEG signals. Results: ShallowFBCSPNet achieved the highest accuracy at 39.13%, followed by Deep4Net (38.26%) and EEGNetv4 (25.22%). However, significant misclassification issues were observed, such as EEGNetv4 predicting all instances as &amp;amp;ldquo;Disgust&amp;amp;rdquo; or &amp;amp;ldquo;Neutral&amp;amp;rdquo; depending on the configuration. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, such as ResNet18 combined with differential entropy, which achieved 95.61% accuracy on the same dataset, the tested models demonstrated substantial limitations. Conclusions: Our results highlight the challenges of generalizing across emotional states using raw EEG signals, emphasizing the need for advanced preprocessing and feature-extraction techniques. Despite these limitations, this study provides valuable insights into the potential and constraints of neural networks for EEG-based emotion recognition, paving the way for future advancements in the field.</p>

	<p>Background: Fibrous dysplasia (FD) is often difficult for skull base surgeons to address. FD arises due to the abnormal proliferation of fibroblasts, ultimately resulting in immature osseous tissue replacing normal cancellous bone. When the skull base is involved, it can result in cranial nerve compression. FD affecting the optic canal and optic nerve is the most concerning as new onset of vision loss is considered a surgical emergency. The prevalence of FD is approximately 3.6 per 1,000,000. The most severe implications of this disease are neurological deficits due to cranial nerve compression, cosmetic appearance, and high recurrence rates even in the setting of surgical and medical therapy interventions. Methods: A PubMed search of &amp;amp;ldquo;pediatric fibrous dysplasia management&amp;amp;rdquo; using MESH Terms was conducted. Articles were excluded for non-English languages, inaccessibility, and events/erratum/letters to the editor. Included articles were in English, as well as encompassed pediatric FD case reports or comprehensive reviews of FD that discussed pediatric presentations. Results: A total of 109 articles were reviewed, and 44 were included in the final review. Most articles were case reports. There is a clear need for guidelines regarding surgical intervention, especially in the pediatric population, where hormonal fluctuation can influence rates of recurrence and bony deformity. Overall, most surgeons recommend close observation with biomarkers and radiographic imaging for asymptomatic patients until at least the age of 16 years old. Conservative methods, such as RANK-L inhibitors, can be utilized to decrease growth with some success, especially in older adolescents. Conclusion: This review is an update on this disease and its presentations, imaging findings, and treatment options. The current literature lacks clear guidance on management, especially in regard to surgical intervention or recurrence monitoring algorithms.</p>

	<p>This perspective paper explores the untapped potential of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning-based dimension reduction techniques in multimodal neuroimaging analysis of Long COVID fatigue. The complexity and high dimensionality of neuroimaging data from modalities such as positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pose significant analytical challenges. Deep neural networks and other machine learning approaches offer powerful tools for managing this complexity and extracting meaningful patterns. The paper discusses current challenges in neuroimaging data analysis, reviews state-of-the-art AI approaches for dimension reduction and multimodal integration, and examines their potential applications in Long COVID research. Key areas of focus include the development of AI-based biomarkers, AI-informed treatment strategies, and personalized medicine approaches. The authors argue that AI-driven multimodal neuroimaging analysis represents a paradigm shift in studying complex brain disorders like Long COVID. While acknowledging technical and ethical challenges, the paper emphasizes the potential of these advanced techniques to uncover new insights into the condition, which might lead to improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for those affected by Long COVID fatigue. The broader implications for understanding and treating other complex neurological and psychiatric conditions are also discussed.</p>

	<p>Acoustic noise is known to perturb reading for good readers, including children and adults. This external acoustic noise interfering at the multimodal areas in the brain causes difficulties reducing reading and writing performances. Moreover, it is known that people with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) and dyslexia have reading deficits even in the absence of acoustic noise. The goal of this study is to investigate the effects of additional acoustic noise on an adult with DCD and dyslexia. Indeed, as vision is the main source of information for the brain during reading, a noisy internal visual crowding has been observed in many cases of readers with dyslexia, as additional mirror or duplicated images of words are perceived by these observers, simultaneously with the primary images. Here, we show that when the noisy internal visual crowding and an increasing external acoustic noise are superimposed, a reading disruptive threshold at about 50 to 60 dBa of noise is reached, depending on the type of acoustic noise for a young adult with DCD and dyslexia but not for a control. More interestingly, we report that this disruptive noise threshold can be controlled by Hebbian mechanisms linked to a pulse-modulated lighting that erases the confusing internal crowding images. An improvement of 12 dBa in the disruptive threshold is then observed with two types of acoustic noises, showing the potential utility of Hebbian optocontrol in managing reading difficulties in adults with DCD and dyslexia.</p>

                Objectives Good oral hygiene measures are important for successful orthodontic treatment. They involve various types of mouthwashes which have been reported to cause alteration of mechanical properties of archwires. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a new kind of chlorine-dioxide-containing mouthwash on the mechanical properties and surface morphology of stainless steel orthodontic archwires against the already prevalent chlorhexidine mouthwash in the market. Method Group A – Chlorhexidine mouthwash 0.2% (study), Group B – Chlorine Dioxide mouthwash (study), and Group C – Artificial Saliva (control). 42 specimens of 5 cm long 19x25 inch SS archwires were immersed in each group equally. Post immersion, the frictional force was analyzed in the universal testing machine for each group using custom-made acrylic jigs for 10 specimens. The remaining 4 specimens from each group were sent for surface morphology evaluation using an atomic force microscope. Results Friction resistance evaluation for the archwires revealed a mean friction of 0.011 ± 0.0056 in Group A, 0.015 ± 0.0052 in Group B, and 0.010 ± 0.0067 in Group C. Results suggested that the static friction of Group C (control group) was found to be the least when compared with the experimental groups, although not producing statistically significant values. Surface roughness of archwires compared at a 10μm range revealed a mean roughness of 19.38 ± 0.82 in Group A, 25.39 ± 7.01 in Group B, and 16.65 ± 3.07 in Group C which shows there wasn’t any statistically significant difference in the mean roughness midst the three sets. Conclusion Chlorine dioxide and Chlorhexidine mouthwashes caused an increase in the frictional resistance of the archwires when compared to the control group. This increase was statistically insignificant. When measured at a range of 10μm the mean surface roughness did not statistically differ across the control and the experimental groups.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The 2017 McDonald criteria continued the separation of diagnostic criteria for relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and primary progressive MS (PPMS) for historical, rather than biological, reasons. We aimed to explore the feasibility of a single, unified set of diagnostic criteria when applied to patients with suspected PPMS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We retrospectively identified patients evaluated for suspected PPMS at 5 European centers. The 2017 McDonald PPMS criteria was the gold standard against which the 2017 McDonald RRMS dissemination in space (DIS) and dissemination in time criteria were evaluated. We also investigated modified RRMS DIS criteria, including: (i) optic nerve lesions; (ii) ≥2 spinal cord lesions; and (iii) higher fulfilment of DIS criteria alone (lesions in ≥3 regions) without dissemination in time/positive cerebrospinal fluid, for a diagnosis of PPMS.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 282 patients were diagnosed with PPMS using the 2017 McDonald criteria, and 40 with alternate disorders. The 2017 McDonald RRMS DIS criteria and the modified DIS criteria including the optic nerve or ≥2 spinal cord lesions performed well in PPMS diagnosis when combined with dissemination in time/positive cerebrospinal fluid (sensitivity 92.9–95.4%, specificity 95%, accuracy 93.2–95.3%). A diagnosis of PPMS based on high fulfillment of modified RRMS DIS criteria had high specificity, but low sensitivity. A diagnostic algorithm applicable to patients evaluated for suspected MS is proposed.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The 2017 McDonald RRMS criteria and modifications to DIS criteria, currently under consideration, performed well in PPMS diagnosis. Forthcoming revisions to the McDonald criteria should consider a single, unified set of diagnostic criteria for MS. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Intravascular lymphoma is a rare subtype of B-cell lymphoma characterized by a clonal proliferation restricted to the lumen of small vessels. Over 50% of patients exhibit central nervous system (CNS) involvement, but diagnosis is often delayed due to the lack of distinctive features. We aimed to identify key phenotypic features for early diagnosis of intravascular lymphoma with CNS involvement through an in-depth cohort study.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We built up a multicenter retrospective cohort of 17 patients recruited in collaboration with the French Expert Network for Oculo-Cerebral Lymphomas (LOC network), and retrospectively analyzed data from medical records.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In this cohort, 15 of 17 (88%) patients developed focal neurological episodes, often fluctuating and/or recurrent, with a sudden onset in 68% of episodes, suggesting a vascular origin. Rapid cognitive deterioration occurred in 15 of 17 (88%) patients, psychiatric manifestations in 8 of 17 (47%), and “B signs” in 14 of 17 (82%). Brain MRI showed polymorphic FLAIR hyperintensities in 14 of 16 (87%) patients, and DWI-positive lesions in 13 of 16 (81%) of patients, which accumulated over time and had unusual characteristics for ischemic lesions (progressive growth, persistent DWI-hyperintensity over 1 month, surrounded by a wider FLAIR hyperintensity). Early-onset inflammatory syndrome, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were observed in over 90% of cases. Mild and inconsistent meningitis contrasted with a nearly-constant hyperproteinorachia. An increased interleukin 10/6 ratio over 0,7 was found in 4 of 7 (57%) patients, and skin biopsy led to a pathological diagnosis in 3 of 6 (50%) patients.</p>

<h2>SUMMARY</h2>
<p>One of the most important goals in biomedical sciences is understanding the causal mechanisms of neurodegeneration. A prevalent hypothesis relates to impaired waste clearance mechanisms from the brain due to reported waste aggregation in the brains of Alzheimer patients, including amyloid-β plaques and neurofibrillary tau tangles. Currently, our understanding of the mechanisms by which waste is removed from the brain is only fragmentary. Here we provide compelling evidence that waste clearance from brain tissue is highly conserved in arachnids and humans. Utilizing RNAscope in situ hybridization, immunohistochemical, ultrastructural, and histological approaches, we demonstrate that cellular debris in spider neurons is engulfed by myelin-forming ependymal glial cells that transect into neuronal somata and form myelin-derived waste-internalizing receptacles. These canal systems channel this debris into the lymphatic system likely in an aquaporin-4 (AQP4) water channel-dependent manner. We provide robust evidence that a similar process may be true in human hippocampus where vast numbers of myelinated AQP4-immunoreactive ependymal glial cells send cellular projections into the somata of neurons and glial cells where they differentiate into waste internalizing receptacles. In the brains of Alzheimer decedents, hypertrophic impairment of these myelinated glial cells leads to the catastrophic obstruction and depletion of neuronal cytoplasm into the ependymal glial cells. At the cellular level, the structural impairment of macroglia leads to swelling myelin protrusions that appear as electron-lucent circular profiles, explaining spongiform abnormalities associated with the neurodegenerative diseases described here. We propose to term this novel type of macroglia-mediated cell death “gliaptosis.”</p>

                Hamamoto et al. report that disrupting the VPS37A ubiquitin E2 variant-like domain impairs autophagosome closure, resulting in milder autophagy-defective phenotypes in mice compared to those lacking upstream autophagy-related genes. They found that LC3-conjugated phagophores facilitate TBK1-dependent p62 phosphorylation, potentially alleviating proteotoxicity by sequestering protein aggregates.

They show that 2PP shares thymic potential with canonical 3/4PP and local pharyngeal arch (PA) mesenchyme regulates this potential. Transcriptomic analysis reveals distinct pathways mediating PP-PA interactions, potentially regulating thymus development.

                Glanzberg et al. examine neurobehavioral representations of food and cocaine seeking. Prelimbic cortex neurons stably encode specific components of both behaviors. However, significant variation in the degree of overlap between ensembles encoding for food vs. cocaine lever pressing suggests individual differences in how prelimbic cortex ensembles encode multiple reward-seeking behaviors.

                The telomerase RNA component (Terc) constitutes a non-coding RNA critical for telomerase function, commonly associated with aging and pivotal in immunomodulation during inflammation. Our study unveils heightened susceptibility to pneumonia caused by <i>Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus</i>) in <i>Terc</i> knockout (<i>Terc</i><sup>ko/ko</sup>) mice compared to both young and old infected counterparts. The exacerbated infection in <i>Terc</i><sup>ko/ko</sup> mice correlates with heightened inflammation, manifested by elevated interleukin-1β (IL-1β) levels and activation of the NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome within the lung. Employing mRNA sequencing methods alongside in vitro analysis of alveolar macrophages (AMs) and T cells, our study elucidates a compelling correlation between <i>Terc</i><sup>ko/ko</sup>, inflammation, and impaired T cell functionality. <i>Terc</i> deletion results in compromised T cell function, characterized by dysregulation of the T cell receptor and absence of CD247, potentially compromising the host’s capacity to mount an effective immune response against <i>S. aureus</i>. This investigation provides insights into the intricate mechanisms governing increased vulnerability to severe pneumonia in the context of Terc deficiency, which might also contribute to aging-related pathologies, while also highlighting the influence of Terc on T cell function.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96017">A deep learning approach for automated scoring of the Rey–Osterrieth complex figure</a></h4>

              
                Memory deficits are a hallmark of many different neurological and psychiatric conditions. The Rey–Osterrieth complex figure (ROCF) is the state-of-the-art assessment tool for neuropsychologists across the globe to assess the degree of non-verbal visual memory deterioration. To obtain a score, a trained clinician inspects a patient’s ROCF drawing and quantifies deviations from the original figure. This manual procedure is time-consuming, slow and scores vary depending on the clinician’s experience, motivation, and tiredness. Here, we leverage novel deep learning architectures to automatize the rating of memory deficits. For this, we collected more than 20k hand-drawn ROCF drawings from patients with various neurological and psychiatric disorders as well as healthy participants. Unbiased ground truth ROCF scores were obtained from crowdsourced human intelligence. This dataset was used to train and evaluate a multihead convolutional neural network. The model performs highly unbiased as it yielded predictions very close to the ground truth and the error was similarly distributed around zero. The neural network outperforms both online raters and clinicians. The scoring system can reliably identify and accurately score individual figure elements in previously unseen ROCF drawings, which facilitates explainability of the AI-scoring system. To ensure generalizability and clinical utility, the model performance was successfully replicated in a large independent prospective validation study that was pre-registered prior to data collection. Our AI-powered scoring system provides healthcare institutions worldwide with a digital tool to assess objectively, reliably, and time-efficiently the performance in the ROCF test from hand-drawn images.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90875">Modeling corticotroph deficiency with pituitary organoids supports the functional role of NFKB2 in human pituitary differentiation</a></h4>

              
                Deficient Anterior pituitary with common Variable Immune Deficiency (DAVID) syndrome results from <i>NFKB2</i> heterozygous mutations, causing adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency (ACTHD) and primary hypogammaglobulinemia. While NFKB signaling plays a crucial role in the immune system, its connection to endocrine symptoms is unclear. We established a human disease model to investigate the role of <i>NFKB2</i> in pituitary development by creating pituitary organoids from CRISPR/Cas9-edited human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Introducing homozygous <i>TBX19<sup>K146R/K146R</sup></i> missense pathogenic variant in hiPSC, an allele found in congenital isolated ACTHD, led to a strong reduction of corticotrophs number in pituitary organoids. Then, we characterized the development of organoids harboring <i>NFKB2<sup>D865G/D865G</sup></i> mutations found in DAVID patients. <i>NFKB2<sup>D865G/D865G</sup></i> mutation acted at different levels of development with mutant organoids displaying changes in the expression of genes involved on pituitary progenitor generation (<i>HESX1</i>, <i>PITX1</i>, <i>LHX3</i>), hypothalamic secreted factors (<i>BMP4, FGF8, FGF10</i>), epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, lineage precursors development (<i>TBX19</i>, <i>POU1F1</i>) and corticotrophs terminal differentiation (<i>PCSK1, POMC</i>), and showed drastic reduction in the number of corticotrophs. Our results provide strong evidence for the direct role of <i>NFKB2</i> mutations in the endocrine phenotype observed in patients leading to a new classification of a <i>NFKB2</i> variant of previously unknown clinical significance as pathogenic in pituitary development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97827">CPT1A mediates radiation sensitivity in colorectal cancer</a></h4>

              
                The prevalence and mortality rates of colorectal cancer (CRC) are increasing worldwide. Radiation resistance hinders radiotherapy, a standard treatment for advanced CRC, leading to local recurrence and metastasis. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying radioresistance in CRC is critical to enhance therapeutic efficacy and patient outcomes. Bioinformatic analysis and tumour tissue examination were conducted to investigate the <i>CPT1A</i> mRNA and protein levels in CRC and their correlation with radiotherapy efficacy. Furthermore, lentiviral overexpression and CRISPR/Cas9 lentiviral vectors, along with in vitro and in vivo radiation experiments, were used to explore the effect of CPT1A on radiosensitivity. Additionally, transcriptomic sequencing, molecular biology experiments, and bioinformatic analyses were employed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which CPT1A regulates radiosensitivity. CPT1A was significantly downregulated in CRC and negatively correlated with responsiveness to neoadjuvant radiotherapy. Functional studies suggested that CPT1A mediates radiosensitivity, influencing reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging and DNA damage response. Transcriptomic and molecular analyses highlighted the involvement of the peroxisomal pathway. Mechanistic exploration revealed that CPT1A downregulates the FOXM1-SOD1/SOD2/CAT axis, moderating cellular ROS levels after irradiation and enhancing radiosensitivity. CPT1A downregulation contributes to radioresistance in CRC by augmenting the FOXM1-mediated antioxidant response. Thus, CPT1A is a potential biomarker of radiosensitivity and a novel target for overcoming radioresistance, offering a future direction to enhance CRC radiotherapy.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100764">Chromatin endogenous cleavage provides a global view of yeast RNA polymerase II transcription kinetics</a></h4>

              
                Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) is the most common approach to observe global binding of proteins to DNA in vivo. The occupancy of transcription factors (TFs) from ChIP-seq agrees well with an alternative method, chromatin endogenous cleavage (ChEC-seq2). However, ChIP-seq and ChEC-seq2 reveal strikingly different patterns of enrichment of yeast RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). We hypothesized that this reflects distinct populations of RNAPII, some of which are captured by ChIP-seq and some of which are captured by ChEC-seq2. RNAPII association with enhancers and promoters - predicted from biochemical studies - is detected well by ChEC-seq2 but not by ChIP-seq. Enhancer/promoter-bound RNAPII correlates with transcription levels and matches predicted occupancy based on published rates of enhancer recruitment, preinitiation assembly, initiation, elongation, and termination. The occupancy from ChEC-seq2 allowed us to develop a stochastic model for global kinetics of RNAPII transcription which captured both the ChEC-seq2 data and changes upon chemical-genetic perturbations to transcription. Finally, RNAPII ChEC-seq2 and kinetic modeling suggests that a mutation in the Gcn4 transcription factor that blocks interaction with the NPC destabilizes promoter-associated RNAPII without altering its recruitment to the enhancer.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92380">Whole-brain in situ mapping of neuronal activation in Drosophila during social behaviors and optogenetic stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Monitoring neuronal activity at single-cell resolution in freely moving <i>Drosophila</i> engaged in social behaviors is challenging because of their small size and lack of transparency. Extant methods, such as Flyception, are highly invasive. Whole-brain calcium imaging in head-fixed, walking flies is feasible but the animals cannot perform the consummatory phases of social behaviors like aggression or mating under these conditions. This has left open the fundamental question of whether neurons identified as functionally important for such behaviors using loss- or gain-of-function screens are actually active during the natural performance of such behaviors, and if so during which phase(s). Here, we perform brain-wide mapping of active cells expressing the Immediate Early Gene <i>hr38</i> using a high-sensitivity/low background fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) amplification method called HCR-3.0. Using double-labeling for hr38 mRNA and for GFP, we describe the activity of several classes of aggression-promoting neurons during courtship and aggression, including P1<sup>a</sup> cells, an intensively studied population of male-specific interneurons. Using HI-FISH in combination with optogenetic activation of aggression-promoting neurons (opto-HI-FISH), we identify candidate downstream functional targets of these cells in a brain-wide, unbiased manner. Finally, we compare the activity of P1<sup>a</sup> neurons during sequential performance of courtship and aggression, using intronic vs. exonic <i>hr38</i> probes to differentiate newly synthesized nuclear transcripts from cytoplasmic transcripts synthesized at an earlier time. These data provide evidence suggesting that different subsets of P1<sup>a</sup> neurons may be active during courtship vs. aggression. HI-FISH and associated methods may help to fill an important lacuna in the armamentarium of tools for neural circuit analysis in <i>Drosophila</i>.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/85635">Evaluating hippocampal replay without a ground truth</a></h4>

              
                During rest and sleep, memory traces replay in the brain. The dialogue between brain regions during replay is thought to stabilize labile memory traces for long-term storage. However, because replay is an internally-driven, spontaneous phenomenon, it does not have a ground truth - an external reference that can validate whether a memory has truly been replayed. Instead, replay detection is based on the similarity between the sequential neural activity comprising the replay event and the corresponding template of neural activity generated during active locomotion. If the statistical likelihood of observing such a match by chance is sufficiently low, the candidate replay event is inferred to be replaying that specific memory. However, without the ability to evaluate whether replay detection methods are successfully detecting true events and correctly rejecting non-events, the evaluation and comparison of different replay methods is challenging. To circumvent this problem, we present a new framework for evaluating replay, tested using hippocampal neural recordings from rats exploring two novel linear tracks. Using this two-track paradigm, our framework selects replay events based on their temporal fidelity (sequence-based detection), and evaluates the detection performance using each event's track discriminability, where sequenceless decoding across both tracks is used to quantify whether the track replaying is also the most likely track being reactivated.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95172">Spinal V1 inhibitory interneuron clades differ in birthdate, projections to motoneurons, and heterogeneity</a></h4>

              
                Spinal cord interneurons play critical roles shaping motor output, but their precise identity and connectivity remain unclear. Focusing on the V1 interneuron cardinal class we defined four major V1 subsets in the mouse according to neurogenesis, genetic lineage-tracing, synaptic output to motoneurons, and synaptic inputs from muscle afferents. Sequential neurogenesis delineates different V1 subsets: two early born (Renshaw and Pou6f2) and two late born (Foxp2 and Sp8). Early born Renshaw cells and late born Foxp2-V1 interneurons are tightly coupled to motoneurons, while early born Pou6f2-V1 and late born Sp8-V1 interneurons are not, indicating that timing of neurogenesis does not correlate with motoneuron targeting. V1 clades also differ in cell numbers and diversity. Lineage labeling shows that the Foxp2-V1 clade contains over half of all V1 interneurons, provides the largest inhibitory input to motoneuron cell bodies, and includes subgroups that differ in birthdate, location, and proprioceptive input. Notably, one Foxp2-V1 subgroup, defined by postnatal Otp expression, is positioned near the LMC and receives substantial input from proprioceptors, consistent with an involvement in reciprocal inhibitory pathways. Combined tracing of ankle flexor sensory afferents and interneurons monosynaptically connected to ankle extensors confirmed placement of Foxp2-V1 interneurons in reciprocal inhibitory pathways. Our results validate previously proposed V1 clades as unique functional subtypes that differ in circuit placement, with Foxp2-V1 cells forming the most heterogeneous subgroup. We discuss how V1 organizational diversity enables understanding of their roles in motor control, with implications for their diverse ontogenetic and phylogenetic origins.

	<p>Background: Patients with Complex Trauma (CT) may have an impaired ability to trust others and build intimate relationships due to non-integrated representations of self and others. This sometimes leads to an oscillation between needing and fearing intimacy in their adult relationships. This dynamic can occur in the therapeutic relationship, undermining the effectiveness of therapy and affecting the mental health of both the patient and the therapist. To date, no study has analyzed interpersonal patient&amp;amp;ndash;therapist dynamics in cases of CT. The present case aims to fill this gap by exploring relational cycles between the therapist and the patient during the therapeutic process in terms of goals and self&amp;amp;ndash;other beliefs. Methods: The methodology consisted of a shared and integrated reconstruction by the patient and therapist, both with clinical expertise in psychology, of the impasse in their therapeutic relationship. The reading was done through the lens of the cognitive model of Pathological Affective Dependence, a theory of traumatic relationships, by describing the primary interpersonal cycles occurring in the therapeutic relationship (altruistic, deontological, and vulnerable). Results: The condition of CT leads to several alliance breakdowns and specific interpersonal cycles, leading to new healing meanings for the patient and the relationship itself. Limitations: The study&amp;amp;rsquo;s main limitation is that it consists of a qualitative analysis of the therapeutic relationship without data that can quantify the clinically observed changes. Conclusions: This case report demonstrates how CT, PAD and the fear of intimacy can be risk factors for the therapeutic alliance and how the therapeutic relationship constitutes a fundamental tool for intervention effectiveness in patients who experience unmet primary needs.</p>

	<p>Action video games foster competitive environments that demand rapid spatial navigation and decision-making. Action video gamers often exhibit faster response times and slightly improved accuracy in vision-based sensorimotor tasks. Background/Objectives: However, the underlying functional and structural changes in the two visual streams of the brain that may be contributing to these cognitive improvements have been unclear. Methods: Using functional and diffusion MRI data, this study investigated the differences in connectivity between gamers who play action video games and nongamers in the dorsal and ventral visual streams. Results: We found that action video gamers have enhanced functional and structural connectivity, especially in the dorsal visual stream. Specifically, there is heightened functional connectivity&amp;amp;mdash;both undirected and directed&amp;amp;mdash;between the left superior occipital gyrus and the left superior parietal lobule during a moving-dot discrimination decision-making task. This increased connectivity correlates with response time in gamers. The structural connectivity in the dorsal stream, as quantified by diffusion fractional anisotropy and quantitative anisotropy measures of the axonal fiber pathways, was also enhanced for gamers compared to nongamers. Conclusions: These findings provide valuable insights into how action video gaming can induce targeted improvements in structural and functional connectivity between specific brain regions in the visual processing pathways. These connectivity changes in the dorsal visual stream underpin the superior performance of action video gamers compared to nongamers in tasks requiring rapid and accurate vision-based decision-making.</p>

	<p>Binocular vision may serve as a good model for research on awareness. Binocular summation (BS) can be defined as the superiority of binocular over monocular visual performance. Early studies of BS found an improvement of a factor of about 1.4 (empirically), leading to models suggesting a quadratic summation of the two monocular inputs (&amp;amp;radic;2). Neural interaction modulates a target&amp;amp;rsquo;s visibility within the same eye or between eyes (facilitation or suppression). Recent results indicated that at a closely flanked stimulus, BS is characterized by instability; it relies on the specific order in which the stimulus condition is displayed. Otherwise, BS is stable. These results were revealed in experiments where the tested eye was open, whereas the other eye was occluded (mono-optic glasses, blocked presentation); thus, the participants were aware of the tested eye. Therefore, in this study, we repeated the same experiments but utilized stereoscopic glasses (intermixed at random presentation) to control the monocular and binocular vision, thus potentially eliminating awareness of the tested condition. The stimuli consisted of a central vertically oriented Gabor target and high-contrast Gabor flankers positioned in two configurations (orthogonal or collinear) with target&amp;amp;ndash;flanker separations of either two or three wavelengths (&amp;amp;lambda;), presented at four different presentation times (40, 80, 120, and 200 ms). The results indicate that when utilizing stereoscopic glasses and mixing the testing conditions, the BS is normal, raising the possibility that awareness may be involved.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Normative perceptual segmentation facilitates event perception, comprehension, and memory. Given that native English listeners&amp;amp;rsquo; normative perceptual segmentation of English speech streams coexists with a highly selective attention pattern at segmentation boundaries, it is significant to test whether Chinese learners of English have a different attention pattern at boundaries, thereby checking whether they perform a normative segmentation. Methods: Thirty Chinese learners of English with relatively higher language proficiency (CLH) and 26 with relatively lower language proficiency (CLL) listened to a series of English audio sentences. Meanwhile, they were asked to press the key whenever a phonetic probe &amp;amp;ldquo;ba&amp;amp;rdquo; occurred. Response time to &amp;amp;ldquo;ba&amp;amp;rdquo; reflects the attention where &amp;amp;ldquo;ba&amp;amp;rdquo; is located at segmentation boundaries. Results: The results revealed that, (1) relative to native English listeners&amp;amp;rsquo; highly selective attention pattern, the CLH group showed a relatively selective attention pattern, while the CLL group displayed a non-selective attention pattern. (2) Both the CLH group and natives had better recognition memory than the CLL group. (3) Both the CLH group and natives&amp;amp;rsquo; attention at segmentation boundaries was not correlated with their memory for sentences, while the CLL group&amp;amp;rsquo;s attention at boundaries was correlated with memory. Conclusions: These findings suggest that (1) Chinese learners of English did not perform a normative segmentation, which shows the effect of English proficiency on perceptual segmentation; (2) English proficiency has a superior effect on memory for sentences, while perceptual segmentation would come next to support memory by providing structure for memory construction if English proficiency is not high; (3) a comparison of attention patterns between Chinese learners and natives can provide a reference for potential intervention to rectify non-natives, thereby improving their perception of English speech streams.</p>

	<p>Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) accounts for approximately 70&amp;amp;ndash;75% of all bladder cancer cases. The standard treatment for high-risk NMIBC involves transurethral tumour resection followed by intravesical Bacillus Calmette&amp;amp;ndash;Guerin (BCG) immunotherapy. While BCG immunotherapy is both safe and effective, it frequently leads to the development of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) such as urinary urgency, frequency, dysuria, and pelvic discomfort. These symptoms can significantly diminish patients&amp;amp;rsquo; quality of life and may result in the discontinuation of BCG treatment, adversely affecting oncological outcomes. Despite the considerable clinical impact of BCG-induced LUTS, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, hindering the implementation or development of effective treatments. This review provides novel insights into the potential mechanisms underlying BCG-induced LUTS, focusing on the integrated roles of afferent and efferent nerves in both normal and pathological bladder sensation and function. Specifically, this review examines how the body&amp;amp;rsquo;s response to BCG&amp;amp;mdash;through the development of inflammation, increased urothelial permeability, and altered urothelial signalling&amp;amp;mdash;might contribute to LUTS development. Drawing from known mechanisms in other common urological disorders and data from successful clinical trials involving NMIBC patients, this review summarises evidence supporting the likely changes in both sensory nerve signalling and bladder muscle function in the development of BCG-induced LUTS. However, further research is required to understand the intricate mechanisms underlying the development of BCG-induced LUTS and identify why some patients are more likely to experience BCG intolerance. Addressing these knowledge gaps could have profound implications for patients&amp;amp;rsquo; quality of life, treatment adherence, and overall outcomes in NMIBC care.</p>

	<p>The association between autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and gender dysphoria (GD) has attracted a great deal of interest among child and adolescent psychiatrists in Japan. In clinical settings, it is common to hear complaints or concerns related to GD from adolescents with ASD. In the past few years, several review articles have been published on ASD and GD. The Initial Clinical Guidelines for co-occurring ASD and GD in adolescents were published in 2018, suggesting the increasing need of intervention for these conditions worldwide. Although a large amount of evidence has been accumulated regarding the co-occurrence of ASD and GD, all review articles were based solely on case reports and articles published in English. In this article, we performed a bilingual literature review using English- and Japanese-language literature databases. We found 13 case reports in English and 11 case reports in Japanese. The Japanese literature included articles on gender-related symptoms in ASD, but not limited to ASD with comorbid GD. Wattel and her colleagues proposed 15 theories on the link between ASD and GD. We classified the reported cases into one or more of the fifteen theories proposed by Wattel. These theories seemed useful in understanding the co-occurrence of ASD and GD, especially in AMAB cases. Wattel&amp;amp;rsquo;s 15 theories are categorized into biological, psychological, and social factors, respectively. With regard to the social factors, we discussed Japanese school culture and psychological burden among gender-dysphoric students. Further studies are awaited.</p>

	<p>Background: Manually labeling sleep stages is time-consuming and labor-intensive, making automatic sleep staging methods crucial for practical sleep monitoring. While both single- and multi-channel data are commonly used in automatic sleep staging, limited research has adequately investigated the differences in their effectiveness. Methods: In this study, four public data sets&amp;amp;mdash;Sleep-SC, APPLES, SHHS1, and MrOS1&amp;amp;mdash;are utilized, and an advanced hybrid attention neural network composed of a multi-branch convolutional neural network and the multi-head attention mechanism is employed for automatic sleep staging. Results: The experimental results show that, for sleep staging using 2&amp;amp;ndash;5 classes, a combination of single-channel electroencephalography (EEG) and dual-channel electrooculography (EOG) consistently outperforms single-channel EEG with single-channel EOG, which in turn outperforms single-channel EEG or single-channel EOG alone. For instance, for five-class sleep staging using the MrOS1 data set, the combination of single-channel EEG and dual-channel EOG resulted in an accuracy of 87.18%, whereas the combination of single-channel EEG and single-channel EOG yielded an accuracy of 85.77%. In comparison, single-channel EEG alone achieved an accuracy of 85.25% and single-channel EOG alone achieved an accuracy of 83.66%. Conclusions: This study highlights the significance of combining EEG and EOG signals in automatic sleep staging, while also providing valuable insights for the channel design of portable sleep monitoring devices.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Recent studies reveal an &amp;amp;ldquo;obesity paradox&amp;amp;rdquo;, suggesting better clinical outcomes after intracranial hemorrhage for obese patients compared to patients with a healthy BMI. While this paradox indicates improved survival rates for obese individuals in stroke cases, it is unknown whether this trend remains true across all forms of intracranial hemorrhage. Therefore, the objective of our study was to investigate the incidence, characteristics, and outcomes of hospitalized obese patients with intracranial hemorrhage. Methods: The National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database was queried for data from 2015 to 2019 to identify adult patients aged 18 years and older with a primary diagnosis of non-traumatic intracranial hemorrhage. Using International Classification of Disease 10th Edition codes, patients were stratified by BMI categories: healthy weight, overweight, class I&amp;amp;ndash;II obesity, and class III obesity. The cohorts were examined for demographic characteristics, comorbidities, stroke severity, inpatient complications, interventions, and clinical outcomes, including length of stay (LOS), discharge disposition, and inpatient mortality. Results: Of 41,960 intracranial hemorrhage patients identified, 13,380 (33.0%) also had an obese BMI. Class I&amp;amp;ndash;II obese intracranial hemorrhage patients were more likely to be of white race (OR: 1.101, 95% CI: 1.052, 1.152, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), less likely to be female (OR: 0.773, 95% CI: 0.740, 0.808, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and more likely to have diabetes mellitus (OR: 1.545, 95% CI: 1.477, 1.616, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and hypertension (OR: 1.828, 95% CI: 1.721, 1.943, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) in comparison to healthy-weight patients. In a matched cohort analysis adjusting for demographics and severity, intracranial hemorrhage patients with class I&amp;amp;ndash;II obesity had a shorter length of stay (LOS) (OR 0.402, 95% CI: 0.118, 0.705, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), reduced inpatient mortality (OR 0.847, 95% CI: 0.798, 0.898, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and more favorable discharge disposition (OR 1.395, 95% CI: 1.321, 1.474, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) compared to their healthy-weight counterparts. Furthermore, these patients were less likely to require decompressive hemicraniectomy (OR 0.697, 95% CI: 0.593, 0.820, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Following an analysis of individual ICH subtypes, obese subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patients demonstrated reduced mortality (OR: 0.692, 95% CI: 0.577&amp;amp;ndash;0.831, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and LOS (OR: 0.070, 95% CI: 0.466&amp;amp;ndash;0.660, p = 0.039), with no differences in discharge disposition. Similarly, intracerebral hemorrhage patients demonstrated reduced mortality (OR: 0.891, 95% CI: 0.827&amp;amp;ndash;0.959, p = 0.002) and LOS (OR: 0.480, 95% CI: 0.216&amp;amp;ndash;0.743, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Other ICH subtypes showed improved discharge outcomes (OR: 1.504, 95% CI: 1.368&amp;amp;ndash;1.654, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), along with decreased mortality (OR: 0.805, 95% CI: 0.715&amp;amp;ndash;0.907, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and LOS (OR: &amp;amp;minus;10.313, 95% CI: &amp;amp;minus;3.599 to &amp;amp;minus;2.449, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Intracranial hemorrhage patients with class I&amp;amp;ndash;II obesity exhibited more favorable clinical outcomes than those who were of a healthy weight or overweight. Despite its association with risk factors contributing to intracranial hemorrhage, class I&amp;amp;ndash;II obesity was associated with improved outcomes, lending support to the existence of the obesity paradox in stroke.</p>

	<p>Mitochondria are organelles involved in different cellular functions, especially energy production. A relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and mood disorders, especially bipolar disorder (BD), has been reported in the scientific literature, which suggests altered energy production and higher levels of oxidative stress compared to healthy controls. Specifically, in BD, the hypothesis of a biphasic pattern of energy availability has been postulated according to mood states. Current evidence highlights the presence of mitochondrial dysfunction in BD and variations between the manic, depressive, and euthymic phases. These findings need to be confirmed in future studies to identify biomarkers that may lead to individualized management of patients with BD and also to identify profiles with a higher risk of presenting an unfavorable course of illness, which would enable the design of preventive and therapeutic strategies in determined subpopulations of patients with BD. The limitations of this review include the non-systematic methodology, variety of mitochondrial-related functions associated with BD, heterogeneous study designs, preliminary evidence for specific findings, and limited recommendations regarding the use of mitochondrial modulators in BD.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Bradykinesia is considered one of the most disabling motor symptoms in individuals with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD). Speed-based interventions are promising for reducing bradykinesia in this population. This systematic review aims to describe speed-based interventions that have been employed for reducing bradykinesia in individuals with PD and verify their effects. Methods: This systematic review protocol was carried out in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P). Electronic searches were performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PEDro, LILACS and SciELO databases and gray literature sources. Experimental studies that investigated the effects of speed-based interventions on bradykinesia in individuals with PD will be considered. Two independent reviewers will screen the studies, extract data and assess risk of bias using Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2) and ROBINS-I (&amp;amp;ldquo;Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies&amp;amp;mdash;of Interventions&amp;amp;rdquo;). Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) will be used to assed the quality of evidence. Conclusions: This systematic review will offer information regarding which types of speed-based interventions have been investigated for reducing bradykinesia in individuals with PD. This information may be important for clinical decision making and will help identify gaps in the literature that may be useful for the definition of future research objectives and the planning of new trials. Ethical permission is not required for this study. Systematic review registration: this systematic review was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; registration number: CRD42024543673).</p>

	<p>Purpose: Persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) experience changes in balance, such as poor and reactive stepping, as well as altered fall-related psychological factors, such as increased concern about falling and feared consequences about falling. Such concerns and fear may relate to and influence mobility. However, these relations are poorly understood in people with MS. This study aimed to investigate the relation between reactive stepping performance and fall-related psychological factors, as well as to assess how these relations differ between individuals who have and have not fallen. Methods: In a single session, participants completed measures regarding fall-related psychological factors (balance confidence, concern about falling, and feared consequences of falling) and completed reactive stepping tasks. Following the visit, participants completed weekly surveys for 3 months to report their falls. Spearman rho correlations were computed to examine associations between participants&amp;amp;rsquo; reactive stepping performance and their fall-related concerns, confidence, and consequences, with a stratified analysis to compare these associations between fallers and non-fallers. Results: 44 individuals with MS participated in our study, with 27 individuals experiencing 0 falls (non-fallers) and 17 individuals experiencing at least 1 fall (fallers) in the 3-month follow-up period. Better reactive stepping performance was correlated with fewer concerns, greater confidence, and lower feared consequences related to falling. The stratified analysis revealed a greater number of significant associations for non-fallers than fallers, although the small sample of fallers reduced our ability to detect a relationship in this group. Conclusions: Reactive stepping was associated with fall-related psychological factors. Interventions targeting reactive stepping may be beneficial in enhancing fall-related psychological well-being in the MS community.</p>

                <p>Like all domains of cognition, language processing is affected by top&ndash;down knowledge. Classic evidence for this is missing blatant errors in the signal. In sentence comprehension, one instance is failing to notice word order errors, such as transposed words in the middle of a sentence: "you that read wrong" (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B25">Mirault et al., 2018</cross-ref>). Our brains seem to fix such errors, since they are incompatible with our grammatical knowledge, but how do our brains do this? Following behavioral work on inner transpositions, we flashed four-word sentences for 300&nbsp;ms using rapid parallel visual presentation (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B37">Snell and Grainger, 2017</cross-ref>). We compared magnetoencephalography responses to fully grammatical and reversed sentences (24 human participants: 21 females, 4 males). The left lateral language cortex robustly distinguished grammatical and reversed sentences starting at 213&nbsp;ms. Thus, the influence of grammatical knowledge begun rapidly after visual word form recognition (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B40">Tarkiainen et al., 1999</cross-ref>). At the earliest stage of this neural "sentence superiority effect," inner transpositions patterned between grammatical and reversed sentences, showing evidence that the brain initially "noticed" the error. However, 100&nbsp;ms later, inner transpositions became indistinguishable from grammatical sentences, suggesting at this point, the brain had "fixed" the error. These results show that after a single glance at a sentence, syntax impacts our neural activity almost as quickly as higher-level object recognition is assumed to take place (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B5">Cichy et al., 2014</cross-ref>). The earliest stage involves detailed comparisons between the bottom&ndash;up input and grammatical knowledge, while shortly afterward, top&ndash;down knowledge can override an error in the stimulus.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/48/e0594242024?rss=1">Oculomotor Contributions to Foveal Crowding</a></h4>

              
                <p>Crowding, the phenomenon of impaired visual discrimination due to nearby objects, has been extensively studied and linked to cortical mechanisms. Traditionally, crowding has been studied extrafoveally; its underlying mechanisms in the central fovea, where acuity is highest, remain debated. While low-level oculomotor factors are not thought to play a role in crowding, this study shows that they are key factors in defining foveal crowding. Here, we investigate the influence of fixational behavior on foveal crowding and provide a comprehensive assessment of the magnitude and extent of this phenomenon (<I>N</I> = 13 human participants, four males). Leveraging on a unique blend of tools for high-precision eyetracking and retinal stabilization, we show that removing the retinal motion introduced by oculomotor behavior with retinal stabilization, diminishes the negative effects of crowding. Ultimately, these results indicate that ocular drift contributes to foveal crowding resulting in the same pooling region being stimulated both by the target and nearby objects over the course of time, not just in space. The temporal aspect of this phenomenon is peculiar to crowding at this scale and indicates that the mechanisms contributing to foveal and extrafoveal crowding differ.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/48/e0794242024?rss=1">How Distributed Subcortical Integration of Reward and Threat May Inform Subsequent Approach-Avoidance Decisions</a></h4>

              
                <p>Healthy and successful living involves carefully navigating rewarding and threatening situations by balancing approach and avoidance behaviors. Excessive avoidance to evade potential threats often leads to forfeiting potential rewards. However, little is known about how reward and threat information is integrated neurally to inform approach or avoidance. In this preregistered study, participants (<I>N</I><SUB>behavior </SUB>= 31, 17F; <I>N</I><SUB>MRI </SUB>= 28, 15F) made approach&ndash;avoidance decisions under varying reward (monetary gains) and threat (electrical stimulations) prospects during functional MRI scanning. In contrast to theorized parallel subcortical processing of reward and threat information before cortical integration, Bayesian multivariate multilevel analyses revealed subcortical reward and threat integration prior to indicating approach&ndash;avoidance decisions. This integration occurred in the ventral striatum, thalamus, and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). When reward was low, risk-diminishing avoidance decisions dominated, which was linked to more positive tracking of threat magnitude prior to indicating avoidance than approach decisions. In contrast, the amygdala exhibited dual sensitivity to reward and threat. While anticipating outcomes of risky approach decisions, we observed positive tracking of threat magnitude within the salience network (dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, thalamus, periaqueductal gray, BNST). Conversely, after risk-diminishing avoidance, characterized by reduced reward prospects, we observed more negative tracking of reward magnitude in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum. These findings shed light on the temporal dynamics of approach&ndash;avoidance decision-making. Importantly, they demonstrate the role of subcortical integration of reward and threat information in balancing approach and avoidance, challenging theories positing predominantly separate subcortical processing prior to cortical integration.</p>

                <p>Spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is a learning rule important for synaptic refinement and for learning and memory during development. While different forms of presynaptic t-LTD have been deeply investigated, little is known about the mechanisms of somatosensory cortex postsynaptic t-LTD. In the present work, we investigated the requirements and mechanisms for induction of developmental spike timing-dependent long-term depression (t-LTD) at L2/3-L2/3 synapses in the juvenile mouse somatosensory cortex. We found that postnatal day (P) 13&ndash;21 mice of either sex show t-LTD at L2/3-L2/3 synapses induced by pairing single presynaptic activity with single postsynaptic action potentials at low stimulation frequency (0.2&nbsp;Hz) that is expressed postsynaptically and requires the activation of ionotropic postsynaptic NMDA-type glutamate receptors containing GluN2B subunits. In addition, it requires postsynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from internal stores, calcineurin, postsynaptic endocannabinoid synthesis, activation of CB<SUB>1</SUB> receptors, and astrocytic signaling to release the gliotransmitter <scp>d</scp>-serine to activate postsynaptic NMDARs to induce t-LTD. These results show direct evidence of the mechanism involved in developmental postsynaptic t-LTD at L2/3-L2/3 synapses, revealing a central role of astrocytes and their release of <scp>d</scp>-serine in its induction.</p>

                <p>"Trying too hard" can interfere with skilled movement, such as sports and music playing. Postural control can similarly suffer when conscious attention is directed toward it ("conscious movement processing"; CMP). However, the neural mechanisms through which CMP influences balance remain poorly understood. We explored the effects of CMP on electroencephalographic (EEG) perturbation-evoked cortical responses and subsequent balance performance. Twenty healthy young adults (age&nbsp;=&nbsp;25.1 &plusmn; 5&nbsp;years; 10 males and 10 females) stood on a force plate-embedded moveable platform while mobile EEG was recorded. Participants completed two blocks of 50 discrete perturbations, containing an even mix of slower (186&nbsp;mm/s peak velocity) and faster (225&nbsp;mm/s peak velocity) perturbations. One block was performed under conditions of CMP (i.e., instructions to consciously control balance), while the other was performed under "Control" conditions with no additional instructions. For both slow and fast perturbations, CMP resulted in significantly smaller cortical N1 signals (a perturbation-evoked potential localized to the supplementary motor area) and lower sensorimotor beta EEG activity 200&ndash;400&nbsp;ms postperturbation. Significantly greater peak velocities of the center of pressure (i.e., greater postural instability) were also observed during the CMP condition. Our findings provide the first evidence that disruptions to postural control during CMP may be a consequence of insufficient cortical activation relevant for balance (i.e., insufficient cortical N1 responses followed by enhanced beta suppression). We propose that conscious attempts to minimize postural instability through CMP acts as a cognitive dual-task that dampens the sensitivity of the sensorimotor system for future losses of balance.</p>

                <p>The transmission of tau pathology has been proposed as one of the major mechanisms for the spatiotemporal spreading of tau pathology in neurodegenerative diseases. Over the last decade, studies have demonstrated that targeting total or pathological tau using tau antibodies can mitigate the development of tau pathology in tauopathy or Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse models, and multiple tau immunotherapy agents have progressed to clinical trials. Tau antibodies are believed to inhibit the internalization of pathologic seeds and/or block seed elongation after seed internalization. To further address the mechanism of tau antibody inhibition of pathological spread, we conducted immunotherapy studies in mouse primary neurons and wild-type mice (females) seeded with AD patient-derived tau to induce the formation and spreading of tau pathology. Notably, we evaluated the effect of a mouse tau-specific antibody (mTau8) which does not interact with AD&ndash;tau seeds in these models. Our results show that mTau8 crosses the blood&ndash;brain barrier at levels similar to other antibodies and effectively decreases AD&ndash;tau-seeded tau pathology in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, our data suggest that mTau8 binds to endogenous intraneuronal mouse tau, thereby inhibiting the elongation of internalized tau seeds. These findings provide valuable insights into the possible mechanism underlying antibody-based therapies for treating tauopathies.</p>

                <p>Visual information is initially represented in retinotopic coordinates and later in craniotopic coordinates. Psychophysical evidence suggests that visual information is further represented in more general coordinates related to the external world; however, the neural basis of nonegocentric coordinates remains elusive. This study investigates the automatic transformation from egocentric to nonegocentric coordinates in the macaque precuneus (two males, one female), identified by a functional imaging study as a key area for nonegocentric representation. We found that 6.2% of neurons in the precuneus have receptive fields (RFs) anchored to the background rather than to the retina or the head, while 16% had traditional retinotopic RFs. Notably, these two types were not exclusive: many background-centric neurons initially encode a stimulus' position in retinotopic coordinates (up to ~90&nbsp;ms from the stimulus onset) but later shift to background coordinates, peaking at ~150&nbsp;ms. Regarding retinotopic information, the stimulus dominated the initial period, whereas the background dominated the later period. In the absence of a background, there is a dramatic surge in retinotopic information about the stimulus during the later phase, clearly delineating two distinct periods of retinotopic encoding: one focusing on the figure to be attended and another on the background. These findings suggest that the initial retinotopic information of the stimulus is combined with the background retinotopic information in a subsequent stage, yielding a more stable representation of the stimulus relative to the background through time-division multiplexing.</p>

                <p>The sexual receptivity of female mice, shown as lordosis response, is mainly regulated by estradiol action on estrogen receptor alpha (ER&alpha;) and beta (ER&beta;), depending on the day of the estrous cycle. Previous studies revealed that ER&alpha; in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH) plays an essential role in the induction of lordosis on the day of estrus (Day 1). However, the mechanisms of the transition to nonreceptive states on the day after estrus (Day 2) are not completely understood. In the present study, we investigated the possible role of ER&beta;, which is highly expressed in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), in lordosis expression. We found that ER&beta;-Cre female mice, which were ovariectomized and primed with estradiol and progesterone to mimic the estrous cycle, showed high levels of lordosis on Day 2 when ER&beta;-expressing DRN (DRN-ER&beta;<sup>+</sup>) neuronal activity was chemogenetically suppressed. This finding suggests that excitation of DRN-ER&beta;<sup>+</sup> neurons is necessary for the decline of lordosis on Day 2. Fiber photometry recordings during female&ndash;male behavioral interactions revealed that DRN-ER&beta;<sup>+</sup> neuronal activation in response to male intromission was significantly more prolonged on Day 2 compared with Day 1. Chemogenetic overstimulation of DRN-ER&beta;<sup>+</sup> neurons induced c-Fos expression in brain areas known to be inhibitory for lordosis expression, even though they did not express anterogradely labeled fibers of DRN-ER&beta;<sup>+</sup> cells. These findings collectively suggest that DRN-ER&beta;<sup>+</sup> neuronal excitation serves as an inhibitory modulator and is responsible for the decline in receptivity during nonestrus phases.</p>

                <p><I>SYNGAP1</I> is a high-confidence autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk gene, and mutations in <I>SYNGAP1</I> lead to a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) that presents with epilepsy, ASD, motor developmental delay, and intellectual disability. <I>SYNGAP1</I> codes for Ras/Rap GTP-ase activating protein SynGAP (SynGAP). SynGAP is located in the postsynaptic density of glutamatergic synapses and regulates glutamate receptor trafficking in an activity-dependent manner. In addition to forebrain glutamatergic neurons, <I>Syngap1</I> is highly expressed in the striatum, although the functions of SynGAP in the striatum have not been extensively studied. Here we show that <I>Syngap1</I> is expressed in both direct and indirect pathway striatal projection neurons (dSPNs and iSPNs) in mice of both sexes. In a mouse model of <I>Syngap1</I> haploinsufficiency, dendritic spine density, morphology, and intrinsic excitability are altered primarily in iSPNs, but not dSPNs. At the behavioral level, SynGAP reduction alters striatal-dependent motor learning and goal-directed behavior. Several behavioral phenotypes are reproduced by iSPN-specific <I>Syngap1</I> reduction and, in turn, prevented by iSPN-specific <I>Syngap1</I> rescue. These results establish the importance of SynGAP to striatal neuron function and pinpoint the indirect pathway as a key circuit in the neurobiology of <I>SYNGAP1</I>-related NDD.</p>

                <p>The nervous system contains complex circuits comprising thousands of cell types and trillions of connections. Here, we discuss how the field of "developmental systems neuroscience" combines the molecular and genetic perspectives of developmental neuroscience with the (typically adult-focused) functional perspective of systems neuroscience. This combination of approaches is critical to understanding how a handful of cells eventually produce the wide range of behaviors necessary for survival. Functional circuit development typically lags behind neural connectivity, leading to intermediate stages of neural activity that are either not seen in adults or, if present, are considered pathophysiological. Developmental systems neuroscience examines these intermediate stages of neural activity, mapping out the critical phases and inflection points of neural circuit function to understand how neural activity and behavior emerge across development. Beyond understanding typical development, this approach provides invaluable insight into the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders by identifying when and how functional development diverges between health and disease. We argue that developmental systems neuroscience will identify important periods of neural development, reveal novel therapeutic windows for treatment, and set the stage to answer fundamental questions about the brain in health and disease.</p>

                <p>CD2-associated protein (CD2AP) was identified as a genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). However, it is unclear how CD2AP contributes to LOAD synaptic dysfunction underlying AD memory deficits. We have shown that loss of CD2AP function increases &beta;-amyloid (A&beta;) endocytic production, but it is unknown whether it contributes to synapse dysfunction. As CD2AP is an actin-binding protein, it may also function in F-actin-rich dendritic spines, which are the excitatory postsynaptic compartments. Here, we demonstrate that CD2AP colocalizes with F-actin in dendritic spines of primary mouse cortical neurons of both sexes. Cell-autonomous depletion of CD2AP specifically reduces spine density and volume, resulting in a functional decrease in synapse formation and neuronal network activity. Postsynaptic reexpression of CD2AP, but not blocking A&beta; production, is sufficient to rescue spine density. CD2AP overexpression increases spine density, volume, and synapse formation, while a rare LOAD CD2AP mutation induces aberrant F-actin spine-like protrusions without functional synapses. CD2AP controls postsynaptic actin turnover, with the LOAD mutation in CD2AP decreasing F-actin dynamicity. Our data support that CD2AP risk variants could contribute to LOAD synapse dysfunction by disrupting spine formation and growth by deregulating actin dynamics.</p>

                Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) is a serious and life-threatening complication defined by excessive immune activation. While it’s commonly associated with rheumatic diseases, infections can also trigger MAS, with tuberculosis being a rare but significant cause. This case report discusses a rare occurrence of Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) caused by multifocal tuberculosis in an immunocompromised patient with Crohn’s disease receiving immunosuppressive treatment. The patient is a 26-year-old woman with Crohn’s disease who is being treated with azathioprine. She arrived at the hospital battling persistent abdominal pain, overwhelming fatigue, and fever. Upon examination, splenomegaly and ascites were noted. A chest X-ray revealed bilateral pleural effusion consistent with tuberculosis. A CT scan confirmed the presence of pleural, pericardial, and intraperitoneal fluid. Blood tests indicated pancytopenia, hyperferritinemia, and hypofibrinogenemia. The analysis of ascitic fluid suggested an exudate. The PCR test of the bone marrow aspirate was positive for tuberculosis without rifampicin resistance, and the smear showed hemophagocytosis images. The patient was diagnosed with Macrophage Activation Syndrome secondary to multifocal tuberculosis. This report delves into the complex relationship between MAS and tuberculosis, emphasizing the challenges in diagnosing MAS in such cases and the potential link to tuberculosis. The complex diagnostic landscape of multifocal tuberculosis, which can often mimic malignancies, underscores the importance of promptly detecting and starting anti-tuberculosis interventions for improved clinical outcomes and the prevention of associated complications.

                This case report presents a complex case of a 65-year-old female with a history of hypertension and a family history of polycystic kidney disease and Fabry disease presented with acute pancreatitis and subsequent renal insufficiency. Despite initial corticosteroid therapy for immuno-allergic nephropathy, the patient’s condition deteriorated with the development of a skin rash, uremic syndrome, and neurological symptoms. A renal biopsy revealed cellular crescents and cytoplasmic vacuolization in podocytes and tubular cells. Genetic testing confirmed a GLA gene mutation, consistent with Fabry disease. While undergoing treatment with cyclophosphamide, the patient experienced severe allergic reactions, ultimately leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome and fatal outcome. Despite the Fabry disease variant being primarily associated with cardiac involvement, renal involvement was evident. This case highlights the rarity of this co-occurrence, the diagnostic challenges, the importance of genetic factors in autoimmune kidney diseases, and the impact of drug allergies on patient management.

                Electrocardiograms (ECGs) can be affected by various factors and technical problems. It is rare for an artefact to be the cause of ST-segment elevation, especially in asymptomatic patients. An important distinction between true ST segment elevation caused by myocardial infarction and an artefact is that the baseline elevation in an artefact may begin before or after the appearance of the QRS complex. When confronted with an abnormal ECG with suspicious waveform contours and possibly only one completely normal limb leads, the diagnosis of arterial pulse artefact should be considered. It is important to exclude subjective assessments unless they are clearly labelled as such.
