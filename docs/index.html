              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08303">Explainable Metrics for the Assessment of Neurodegenerative Diseases through Handwriting Analysis</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.08303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motor changes are early signs of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), but are often difficult to detect, especially in the early stages. In this work, we examine the behavior of a wide array of explainable metrics extracted from the handwriting signals of 113 subjects performing multiple tasks on a digital tablet. The aim is to measure their effectiveness in characterizing and assessing multiple NDs, including AD and PD. To this end, task-agnostic and task-specific metrics are extracted from 14 distinct tasks. Subsequently, through statistical analysis and a series of classification experiments, we investigate which metrics provide greater discriminative power between NDs and healthy controls and among different NDs. Preliminary results indicate that the various tasks at hand can all be effectively leveraged to distinguish between the considered set of NDs, specifically by measuring the stability, the speed of writing, the time spent not writing, and the pressure variations between groups from our handcrafted explainable metrics, which shows p-values lower than 0.0001 for multiple tasks. Using various classification algorithms on the computed metrics, we obtain up to 87% accuracy to discriminate AD and healthy controls (CTL), and up to 69% for PD vs CTL.

                arXiv:2409.08868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have proved in both human-based and computer-based tests that natural concepts generally `entangle' when they combine to form complex sentences, violating the rules of classical compositional semantics. In this article, we present the results of an innovative video-based cognitive test on a specific conceptual combination, which significantly violates the Clauser--Horne--Shimony--Holt version of Bell's inequalities (`CHSH inequality'). We also show that collected data can be faithfully modelled within a quantum-theoretic framework elaborated by ourselves and a `strong form of entanglement' occurs between the component concepts. While the video-based test confirms previous empirical results on entanglement in human cognition, our ground-breaking empirical approach surpasses language barriers and eliminates the need for prior knowledge, enabling universal accessibility. Finally, this transformative methodology allows one to unravel the underlying connections that drive our perception of reality. As a matter of fact, we provide a novel explanation for the appearance of entanglement in both physics and cognitive realms.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08892">Exploring Action-Centric Representations Through the Lens of Rate-Distortion Theory</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.08892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Organisms have to keep track of the information in the environment that is relevant for adaptive behaviour. Transmitting information in an economical and efficient way becomes crucial for limited-resourced agents living in high-dimensional environments. The efficient coding hypothesis claims that organisms seek to maximize the information about the sensory input in an efficient manner. Under Bayesian inference, this means that the role of the brain is to efficiently allocate resources in order to make predictions about the hidden states that cause sensory data. However, neither of those frameworks accounts for how that information is exploited downstream, leaving aside the action-oriented role of the perceptual system. Rate-distortion theory, which defines optimal lossy compression under constraints, has gained attention as a formal framework to explore goal-oriented efficient coding. In this work, we explore action-centric representations in the context of rate-distortion theory. We also provide a mathematical definition of abstractions and we argue that, as a summary of the relevant details, they can be used to fix the content of action-centric representations. We model action-centric representations using VAEs and we find that such representations i) are efficient lossy compressions of the data; ii) capture the task-dependent invariances necessary to achieve successful behaviour; and iii) are not in service of reconstructing the data. Thus, we conclude that full reconstruction of the data is rarely needed to achieve optimal behaviour, consistent with a teleological approach to perception.

Abstract: Response to a poll can be manipulated by means of a series of leading questions. We show that such phenomena cannot be explained by use of classical probability theory, whereas quantum probability theory admits a possibility of offering an explanation. Admissible transformation rules in quantum probability, however, do impose some constraints on the modelling of cognitive behaviour, which are highlighted here. Focusing on a recent poll conducted by Ipsos on a set of questions posed by Sir Humphrey Appleby in an episode of the British political satire \textit{Yes, Prime Minister}, we show that the resulting data cannot be explained quite so simply using quantum rules, although it seems not impossible.

Abstract: Identical systems, or entities, are indistinguishable in quantum mechanics (QM), and the symmetrization postulate rules the possible statistical distributions of a large number of identical quantum entities. However, a thorough analysis on the historical development of QM attributes the origin of quantum statistics, in particular, Bose-Einstein statistics, to a lack of statistical independence of the micro-states of identical quantum entities. We have recently identified Bose-Einstein statistics in the combination of words in large texts, as a consequence of the entanglement created by the meaning carried by words when they combine in human language. Relying on this investigation, we put forward the hypothesis that entanglement, hence the lack of statistical independence, is due to a mechanism of contextual updating, which provides deeper reasons for the appearance of Bose-Einstein statistics in human language. However, this investigation also contributes to a better understanding of the origin of quantum mechanical statistics in physics. Finally, we provide new insights into the intrinsically random behaviour of microscopic entities that is generally assumed within classical statistical mechanics.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05161">Motion Capture Analysis of Verb and Adjective Types in Austrian Sign Language</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2405.05161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Across a number of sign languages, temporal and spatial characteristics of dominant hand articulation are used to express semantic and grammatical features. In this study of Austrian Sign Language (\"Osterreichische Geb\"ardensprache, or \"OGS), motion capture data of four Deaf signers is used to quantitatively characterize the kinematic parameters of sign production in verbs and adjectives. We investigate (1) the difference in production between verbs involving a natural endpoint (telic verbs; e.g. arrive) and verbs lacking an endpoint (atelic verbs; e.g. analyze), and (2) adjective signs in intensified vs. non-intensified (plain) forms. Motion capture data analysis using linear-mixed effects models (LME) indicates that both the endpoint marking in verbs, as well as marking of intensification in adjectives, are expressed by movement modulation in \"OGS. While the semantic distinction between verb types (telic/atelic) is marked by higher peak velocity and shorter duration for telic signs compared to atelic ones, the grammatical distinction (intensification) in adjectives is expressed by longer duration for intensified compared to non-intensified adjectives. The observed individual differences of signers might be interpreted as personal signing style.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12927">Emergent mechanisms for long timescales depend on training curriculum and affect performance in memory tasks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2309.12927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in the brain and in silico excel at solving tasks with intricate temporal dependencies. Long timescales required for solving such tasks can arise from properties of individual neurons (single-neuron timescale, $\tau$, e.g., membrane time constant in biological neurons) or recurrent interactions among them (network-mediated timescale). However, the contribution of each mechanism for optimally solving memory-dependent tasks remains poorly understood. Here, we train RNNs to solve $N$-parity and $N$-delayed match-to-sample tasks with increasing memory requirements controlled by $N$ by simultaneously optimizing recurrent weights and $\tau$s. We find that for both tasks RNNs develop longer timescales with increasing $N$, but depending on the learning objective, they use different mechanisms. Two distinct curricula define learning objectives: sequential learning of a single-$N$ (single-head) or simultaneous learning of multiple $N$s (multi-head). Single-head networks increase their $\tau$ with $N$ and are able to solve tasks for large $N$, but they suffer from catastrophic forgetting. However, multi-head networks, which are explicitly required to hold multiple concurrent memories, keep $\tau$ constant and develop longer timescales through recurrent connectivity. Moreover, we show that the multi-head curriculum increases training speed and network stability to ablations and perturbations, and allows RNNs to generalize better to tasks beyond their training regime. This curriculum also significantly improves training GRUs and LSTMs for large-$N$ tasks. Our results suggest that adapting timescales to task requirements via recurrent interactions allows learning more complex objectives and improves the RNN's performance.

                arXiv:2404.03708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are at the core of most Deep learning (DL) algorithms that successfully tackle complex problems like image recognition, autonomous driving, and natural language processing. However, unlike biological brains who tackle similar problems in a very efficient manner, DL algorithms require a large number of trainable parameters, making them energy-intensive and prone to overfitting. Here, we show that a new ANN architecture that incorporates the structured connectivity and restricted sampling properties of biological dendrites counteracts these limitations. We find that dendritic ANNs are more robust to overfitting and outperform traditional ANNs on several image classification tasks while using significantly fewer trainable parameters. These advantages are likely the result of a different learning strategy, whereby most of the nodes in dendritic ANNs respond to multiple classes, unlike classical ANNs that strive for class-specificity. Our findings suggest that the incorporation of dendritic properties can make learning in ANNs more precise, resilient, and parameter-efficient and shed new light on how biological features can impact the learning strategies of ANNs.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08290">Reconsidering the energy efficiency of spiking neural networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.08290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are generally regarded as more energy-efficient because they do not use multiplications. However, most SNN works only consider the counting of additions to evaluate energy consumption, neglecting other overheads such as memory accesses and data movement operations. This oversight can lead to a misleading perception of efficiency, especially when state-of-the-art SNN accelerators operate with very small time window sizes. In this paper, we present a detailed comparison of the energy consumption of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and SNNs from a hardware perspective. We provide accurate formulas for energy consumption based on classical multi-level memory hierarchy architectures, commonly used neuromorphic dataflow architectures, and our proposed improved spatial-dataflow architecture. Our research demonstrates that to achieve comparable accuracy and greater energy efficiency than ANNs, SNNs require strict limitations on both time window size T and sparsity s. For instance, with the VGG16 model and a fixed T of 6, the neuron sparsity rate must exceed 93% to ensure energy efficiency across most architectures. Inspired by our findings, we explore strategies to enhance energy efficiency by increasing sparsity. We introduce two regularization terms during training that constrain weights and activations, effectively boosting the sparsity rate. Our experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset, using T of 6, show that our SNNs consume 69% of the energy used by optimized ANNs on spatial-dataflow architectures, while maintaining an SNN accuracy of 94.18%. This framework, developed using PyTorch, is publicly available for use and further research.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08765">Cross-Country Comparative Analysis of Climate Resilience and Localized Mapping in Data-Sparse Regions</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.08765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate resilience across sectors varies significantly in low-income countries (LICs), with agriculture being the most vulnerable to climate change. Existing studies typically focus on individual countries, offering limited insights into broader cross-country patterns of adaptation and vulnerability. This paper addresses these gaps by introducing a framework for cross-country comparative analysis of sectoral climate resilience using meta-analysis and cross-country panel data techniques. The study identifies shared vulnerabilities and adaptation strategies across LICs, enabling more effective policy design. Additionally, a novel localized climate-agriculture mapping technique is developed, integrating sparse agricultural data with high-resolution satellite imagery to generate fine-grained maps of agricultural productivity under climate stress. Spatial interpolation methods, such as kriging, are used to address data gaps, providing detailed insights into regional agricultural productivity and resilience. The findings offer policymakers tools to prioritize climate adaptation efforts and optimize resource allocation both regionally and nationally.

Abstract: While models in audio and speech processing are becoming deeper and more end-to-end, they as a consequence need expensive training on large data, and are often brittle. We build on a classical model of human hearing and make it differentiable, so that we can combine traditional explainable biomimetic signal processing approaches with deep-learning frameworks. This allows us to arrive at an expressive and explainable model that is easily trained on modest amounts of data. We apply this model to audio processing tasks, including classification and enhancement. Results show that our differentiable model surpasses black-box approaches in terms of computational efficiency and robustness, even with little training data. We also discuss other potential applications.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03493">A Methodology to Study the Impact of Spiking Neural Network Parameters considering Event-Based Automotive Data</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2404.03493v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems are considered as the future of human mobility and transportation. Solving computer vision tasks such as image classification and object detection/segmentation, with high accuracy and low power/energy consumption, is highly needed to realize AD systems in real life. These requirements can potentially be satisfied by Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). However, the state-of-the-art works in SNN-based AD systems still focus on proposing network models that can achieve high accuracy, and they have not systematically studied the roles of SNN parameters when used for learning event-based automotive data. Therefore, we still lack understanding of how to effectively develop SNN models for AD systems. Toward this, we propose a novel methodology to systematically study and analyze the impact of SNN parameters considering event-based automotive data, then leverage this analysis for enhancing SNN developments. To do this, we first explore different settings of SNN parameters that directly affect the learning mechanism (i.e., batch size, learning rate, neuron threshold potential, and weight decay), then analyze the accuracy results. Afterward, we propose techniques that jointly improve SNN accuracy and reduce training time. Experimental results show that our methodology can improve the SNN models for AD systems than the state-of-the-art, as it achieves higher accuracy (i.e., 86%) for the NCARS dataset, and it can also achieve iso-accuracy (i.e., ~85% with standard deviation less than 0.5%) while speeding up the training time by 1.9x. In this manner, our research work provides a set of guidelines for SNN parameter enhancements, thereby enabling the practical developments of SNN-based AD systems.

Abstract: Autonomous embedded systems (e.g., robots) typically necessitate intelligent computation with low power/energy processing for completing their tasks. Such requirements can be fulfilled by embodied neuromorphic intelligence with spiking neural networks (SNNs) because of their high learning quality (e.g., accuracy) and sparse computation. Here, the employment of event-based data is preferred to ensure seamless connectivity between input and processing parts. However, state-of-the-art SNNs still face a long training time to achieve high accuracy, thereby incurring high energy consumption and producing a high rate of carbon emission. Toward this, we propose FastSpiker, a novel methodology that enables fast SNN training on event-based data through learning rate enhancements targeting autonomous embedded systems. In FastSpiker, we first investigate the impact of different learning rate policies and their values, then select the ones that quickly offer high accuracy. Afterward, we explore different settings for the selected learning rate policies to find the appropriate policies through a statistical-based decision. Experimental results show that our FastSpiker offers up to 10.5x faster training time and up to 88.39% lower carbon emission to achieve higher or comparable accuracy to the state-of-the-art on the event-based automotive dataset (i.e., NCARS). In this manner, our FastSpiker methodology paves the way for green and sustainable computing in realizing embodied neuromorphic intelligence for autonomous embedded systems.

                arXiv:2406.01829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a neuro-symbolic transformer-based model that converts flat, segmented facade structures into procedural definitions using a custom-designed split grammar. To facilitate this, we first develop a semi-complex split grammar tailored for architectural facades and then generate a dataset comprising of facades alongside their corresponding procedural representations. This dataset is used to train our transformer model to convert segmented, flat facades into the procedural language of our grammar. During inference, the model applies this learned transformation to new facade segmentations, providing a procedural representation that users can adjust to generate varied facade designs. This method not only automates the conversion of static facade images into dynamic, editable procedural formats but also enhances the design flexibility, allowing for easy modifications.

	<p>Abstract: Previous research has established that bilinguals automatically activate lexical items in both of their languages in a nonselectivemanner, even when processing linguistic information in the second language (L2) alone. However, whether this co-activation extends to the sub-lexical level remains debated. In this study, we investigate whether bilinguals access sub-lexical information while processing in their L2. Thirty-two Chinese&amp;amp;ndash;English bilinguals and thirty-one English monolinguals completed an EEG-based semantic relatedness task, during which they judged whether pairs of English words were related in meaning or not (&amp;amp;plusmn;S). Unbeknownst to the participants, the form (&amp;amp;plusmn;F) of the Chinese translations in half of the pairs shared a sub-lexical semantic radical. This leads to four conditions: +S+F, +S&amp;amp;minus;F, &amp;amp;minus;S+F, and &amp;amp;minus;S&amp;amp;minus;F. This design, along with the comparison to English monolinguals, allows us to examine if bilinguals&amp;amp;rsquo; native language is activated at the sub-lexical level when they are exposed only to L2. The results revealed that both groups showed sensitivity to semantic relatedness, as evidenced by a greater N400 for semantic unrelated pairs than related pairs, with monolinguals eliciting a more pronounced difference. Bilinguals, on the other hand, exhibited a greater P200 difference compared to monolinguals, indicating greater sensitivity to the hidden Chinese radical/form manipulation. These results suggest that highly proficient bilinguals automatically engage in lexical co-activation of their native language during L2 processing. Crucially, this co-activation extends to the sub-lexical semantic radical level.</p>

">Comparative study on the effects of different types of acute exercise on cortisol levels and cognitive functions</a></h4>

              
                This study examines the different effects of dual-task and single-task exercises on cortisol levels and cognitive performance. Seventeen male college students participated, performing each exercise on separate days. Salivary samples were taken before and after exercise to assess cortisol levels. Cognitive functions were measured using the 2-Back Test, Bells Test, and Mental Rotation Test. Results showed that both exercises significantly improved reaction times across cognitive tests. However, dual-task exercise caused a more notable increase in cortisol levels (p=0.002) than the single-task. A negative correlation between post-exercise cortisol levels and reaction times suggests that higher cortisol levels might enhance cognitive processing speed. Cognitive performance ac-curacy remained unchanged across both exercises. These findings indicate that while both exercise types enhance cognitive speed, dual-task exercise triggers a greater cortisol response, potentially offering more benefits for cognitive processing speed without affecting accuracy. This research highlights the complex interaction between acute exercise, stress hormones, and cognitive function, providing insights into how different exercise types influence cognitive performance through hormonal pathways.

">Connectomic analysis of taste circuits in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Our sense of taste is critical for regulating food consumption. The fruit fly Drosophila represents a highly tractable model to investigate mechanisms of taste processing, but taste circuits beyond sensory neurons are largely unidentified. Here, we use a whole-brain connectome to investigate the organization of Drosophila taste circuits. We trace pathways from four populations of sensory neurons that detect different taste modalities and project to the subesophageal zone (SEZ). We find that second-order taste neurons are primarily located within the SEZ and largely segregated by taste modality, whereas third-order neurons have more projections outside the SEZ and more overlap between modalities. Taste projections out of the SEZ innervate regions implicated in feeding, olfactory processing, and learning. We characterize interconnections between taste pathways, identify modality-dependent differences in taste neuron properties, and use computational simulations to relate connectivity to predicted activity. These studies provide insight into the architecture of Drosophila taste circuits.

">Spike Count Analysis for MultiPlexing Inference (SCAMPI)</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how neurons encode multiple simultaneous stimuli is a fundamental question in neuroscience. We have previously introduced a novel theory of stochastic encoding patterns wherein a neuron's spiking activity dynamically switches among its constituent single-stimulus activity patterns when presented with multiple stimuli (Groh et al., 2024). Here, we present an enhanced, comprehensive statistical testing framework for such "multiplexing" or "code juggling". Our new approach evaluates whether dual-stimulus responses can be accounted for as mixtures of Poissons either anchored to or bounded by single-stimulus benchmarks. Our enhanced framework improves upon previous methods in two key ways. First, it introduces a stronger set of foils for multiplexing, including an "overreaching" category that captures overdispersed activity patterns unrelated to the single-stimulus benchmarks, reducing false detection of multiplexing/code-juggling. Second, it detects faster fluctuations - i.e. at sub-trial timescales - that would have been overlooked before. We utilize a Bayesian inference framework, considering the hypothesis with the highest posterior probability as the winner, and employ predictive recursion marginal likelihood method for the involving nonparametric density estimation. Reanalysis of previous findings confirms the general observation of "code juggling" and indicates that such juggling may well occur on faster timescales than previously suggested. We further confirm that juggling is more prevalent in (a) the inferotemporal face patch system for combinations of face stimuli than for faces and non-face objects; and (b) the primary visual cortex for distinct vs fused objects.

Phylogenetically distinct corticospinal pathways are involved in hand control: "newer" direct corticomotoneuronal (CM) pathways and "older" indirect corticospinal pathways mediated by spinal premotor interneurons (PreM-INs). However, the functional differences of these pathways remain unclear. Here we show that CM cells and PreM-INs have distinct physiological properties for the activation of hand muscles and provide different types of movement control signals while monkeys perform a precision grip task. Spike-triggered averaging of electromyographic activity indicated that PreM-INs coactivate a larger number of muscles, whereas CM cells more selectively control fewer muscles. The firing activity of PreM-INs was tightly correlated with their target muscle activity and had a greater contribution to generating hand muscle activity. In contrast, CM cell activity diverged temporally from the target muscle activity and had a smaller contribution to its generation. On the basis of these results, we hypothesize that PreM-INs produce gross muscle activity by activating synergistic muscles, whereas CM cells fine-tune target muscle activity. This idea was supported by dimensional reduction analyses of hand muscle activity, as PreM-IN activity was specifically correlated with lower dimensional control of muscle activity, and CM cell activity was correlated with higher dimensional control. These results indicate that the two pathways have distinct functions, synergistic control and fine tuning of hand muscle activity, both of which are essential for the development of dexterous hand movement in primates.

">Exploiting correlations across trials and behavioral sessions to improve neural decoding</a></h4>

              
                Traditional neural decoders model the relationship between neural activity and behavior within individual trials of a single experimental session, neglecting correlations across trials and sessions. However, animals exhibit similar neural activities when performing the same behavioral task, and their behaviors are influenced by past experiences from previous trials. To exploit these informative correlations in large datasets, we introduce two complementary models: a multi-session reduced-rank model that shares similar behaviorally-relevant statistical structure in neural activity across sessions to improve decoding, and a multi-session state-space model that shares similar behavioral statistical structure across trials and sessions. Applied across 433 sessions spanning 270 brain regions in the International Brain Laboratory public mouse Neuropixels dataset, our decoders demonstrate improved decoding accuracy for four distinct behaviors compared to traditional approaches. Unlike existing deep learning approaches, our models are interpretable and efficient, uncovering latent behavioral dynamics that govern animal decision-making, quantifying single-neuron contributions to decoding behaviors, and identifying different activation timescales of neural activity across the brain.

">Evaluating and Comparing Measures of Aperiodic Neural Activity</a></h4>

              
                Neuro-electrophysiological recordings contain prominent aperiodic activity - meaning irregular activity, with no characteristic frequency - which has variously been referred to as 1/f (or 1/f-like activity), fractal, or 'scale-free' activity. Previous work has established that aperiodic features of neural activity is dynamic and variable, relating (between subjects) to healthy aging and to clinical diagnoses, and also (within subjects) tracking conscious states and behavioral performance. There are, however, a wide variety of conceptual frameworks and associated methods for the analyses and interpretation of aperiodic activity - for example, time domain measures such as the autocorrelation, fractal measures, and/or various complexity and entropy measures, as well as measures of the aperiodic exponent in the frequency domain. There is a lack of clear understanding of how these different measures relate to each other and to what extent they reflect the same or different properties of the data, which makes it difficult to synthesize results across approaches and complicates our overall understanding of the properties, biological significance, and demographic, clinical, and behavioral correlates of aperiodic neural activity. To address this problem, in this project we systematically survey the different approaches for measuring aperiodic neural activity, starting with an automated literature analysis to curate a collection of the most common methods. We then evaluate and compare these methods, using statistically representative time series simulations. In doing so, we establish consistent relationships between the measures, showing that much of what they capture reflects shared variance - though with some notable idiosyncrasies. Broadly, frequency domain methods are more specific to aperiodic features of the data, whereas time domain measures are more impacted by oscillatory activity. We extend this analysis by applying the measures to a series of empirical EEG and iEEG datasets, replicating the simulation results. We conclude by summarizing the relationships between the multiple methods, emphasizing opportunities for re-examining previous findings and for future work.

">Sleep-wake states are encoded across emotion-regulation regions of the mouse brain</a></h4>

              
                Emotional dysregulation is highly comorbid with sleep disturbances. Sleep is comprised of unique physiological states that are reflected by conserved brain oscillations. Though the role of these state-dependent oscillations in cognitive function has been well established, less is known regarding the nature of state-dependent oscillations across brain regions that strongly contribute to emotional function. To characterize these dynamics, we recorded local field potentials simultaneously from multiple cortical and subcortical regions implicated in sleep and emotion-regulation and characterize widespread patterns of spectral power and synchrony between brain regions during sleep/wake states. First, we showed that these brain regions encode sleep state, albeit to various degrees of accuracy. We then identified network-based classifiers of sleep based on the combination of features from all recorded brain regions. Spectral power and synchrony from brain networks allowed for automatic, accurate and rapid discrimination of wake, non-REM sleep (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. When we examined the impact of commonly prescribed sleep promoting medications on neural dynamics across these regions, we found disparate alterations to both cortical and subcortical activity across all three states. Finally, a we found that a stress manipulation that disrupts circadian rhythm produced increased sleep fragmentation without altering the underlying average brain dynamics across sleep-wake states. Thus, we characterized state dependent brain dynamics across regions canonically associated with emotions.

">A brainstem circuit controls cough-like airway defensive behaviors in mice</a></h4>

              
                The respiratory tract is subject to complex neural control for eupneic breathing and distinct airway defensive reflexes. Growing evidence has revealed a large heterogeneity of airway-innervating vagal sensory neurons in mediating various respiratory functions, but the central neuronal pathways and neural circuits involved in the airway regulation remain less understood. Combining whole-body plethysmography (WBP), audio, and video tracking to access breathing and airway defensive behaviors in conscious animals, we developed a quantitative paradigm implementing the mouse as a suitable model to study cough-like defensive behaviors. Using TRAP2 transgenic mice and in vivo fiber photometry, we found that the neural activity in the caudal spinal trigeminal nucleus (SP5C) is strongly correlated with tussigen-evoked cough-like responses. Impairing synaptic outputs or chemogenetic inhibition of the SP5C effectively abolished cough-like reflexes. Optogenetic stimulation of SP5C excitatory neurons or their projections to the rostral ventral respiratory group (rVRG) triggered robust cough-like behaviors in the absence of tussive stimuli. Remarkably, tonic elevation of SP5C excitability caused spontaneous cough-like activities chronically in mice. Together, our data provide strong evidence for a brainstem circuit controlling cough-like defensive behaviors in mice.

">Attentional Information Routing in The Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                Brain-wide communication supports behaviors that require coordination between sensory and associative regions. However, how large-scale brain networks route sensory information at fast timescales to guide upcoming actions remains unclear. Using spiking neural networks and human intracranial electrophysiology during spatial attention tasks, where participants detected a target at cued locations, we show that high-frequency activity bursts (HFAb) serve as information-carrying events, facilitating fast and long-range communications. HFAbs emerged as bouts of neural population spiking and were coordinated brain-wide through low-frequency rhythms. At the network-level, HFAb coordination identified distinct cue- and target-activated subnetworks. HFAbs following the cue onset in cue-subnetworks predicted successful target detection and preceded the information in target-subnetworks following target onset. Our findings suggest HFAbs as a neural mechanism for fast brain-wide information routing that supports attentional performance.

">Phase-Dependent Stimulation of the Hippocampus: A Computational Modeling Approach</a></h4>

              
                Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) between brain oscillations of different frequencies plays a fundamental role in neural processing, and phase-dependent neuromodulation has emerged as a promising strategy to modulate PAC. In the hippocampus, theta-gamma PAC is critically involved in memory-related functions and information propagation. Computational models provide a valuable platform for investigating the neurobiological mechanisms underlying phase-dependent effects, bypassing the limitations of in vivo and in vitro experiments. In this study, we extended a previously published computational model of the hippocampal CA3 region using the NEURON and Python environments. A closed-loop autoregressive (AR) forward prediction model was employed to sample the network's local field potential (LFP) in real time, enabling the precise calculation of phase-locked stimulus time points. Our results demonstrated the successful delivery of phase-locked current injections to all neuronal populations at both the peak and trough of theta oscillations. Phase-specific alterations in the theta band were observed during stimulation, along with enhanced theta-gamma coupling induced by peak-phase stimulation. Single neuron activity analysis highlighted the critical role of oriens lacunosum-moleculare (OLM) cells in modulating phase-dependent network dynamics. These findings underscore the potential of closed-loop stimulation systems to modulate PAC, with significant implications for the treatment of neurological disorders characterized by abnormal oscillatory activity, such as Alzheimer's disease and other memory-related disorders.

">Practice Reshapes the Geometry and Dynamics of Task-tailored Representations</a></h4>

              
                Extensive practice makes task performance more efficient and precise, leading to automaticity. However, theories of automaticity differ on which levels of task representations (e.g., low-level features, stimulus-response mappings, or high-level conjunctive memories of individual events) change with practice, despite predicting the same pattern of improvement (e.g., power law of practice). To resolve this controversy, we built on recent theoretical advances in understanding computations through neural population dynamics. Specifically, we hypothesized that practice optimizes the neural representational geometry of task representations to minimally separate the highest- level task contingencies needed for successful performance. This involves efficiently reaching conjunctive neural states that integrate task-critical features nonlinearly while abstracting over non-critical dimensions. To test this hypothesis, human participants (n = 40) engaged in extensive practice of a simple, context-dependent action selection task over 3 days while recording EEG. During initial rapid improvement in task performance, representations of the highest-level, context-specific conjunctions of task- features were enhanced as a function of the number of successful episodes. Crucially, only enhancement of these conjunctive representations, and not lower-order representations, predicted the power-law improvement in performance. Simultaneously, over sessions, these conjunctive neural states became more stable earlier in time and more aligned, abstracting over redundant task features, which correlated with offline performance gain in reducing switch costs. Thus, practice optimizes the dynamic representational geometry as task-tailored neural states that minimally tesselate the task space, taming their high-dimensionality.

">Converging effects of cannabis and psychosis on the dopamine system: A longitudinal neuromelanin-sensitive MRI study in cannabis use disorder and first episode schizophrenia.</a></h4>

              
                Importance: Despite evidence that individuals who use cannabis early in life are at elevated risk of psychosis and that the neurotransmitter dopamine has a role in both conditions, the mechanism linking the two conditions remains unclear. Objective: To use neuromelanin-sensitive MRI (neuromelanin-MRI), a practical, proxy measure of dopamine function, to assess whether a common alteration in the dopamine system may be implicated in cannabis use and psychosis and whether this alteration can be observed in cannabis users whether or not they have a diagnosis of first-episode schizophrenia. Design, Setting, and Participants: This longitudinal observational study recruited participants from 2019 to 2023 from an early intervention service for psychosis in London, Ontario, Canada. The sample consisted of 25 participants with cannabis use disorder (CUD) and 36 participants without CUD (nCUD), of which 28 had first-episode schizophrenia (FES). One-year follow-up was completed for 12 CUD and 25 nCUD participants. Main Outcomes and Measures: Neuromelanin-MRI contrast within the substantia nigra (SN) and within a subregion previously linked to psychosis severity (a priori psychosis region of interest) and diagnoses of schizophrenia-spectrum disorder and cannabis use disorder derived from the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5. Linear mixed effects analyses were performed relating neuromelanin-MRI contrast to clinical measures. Results: We found that CUD was associated with elevated neuromelanin-MRI signal in a cluster of ventral SN voxels (387 of 2060 SN voxels, pcorrected=0.027, permutation test). Furthermore, CUD was associated with elevated neuromelanin-MRI signal in an SN subregion previously documented to have elevated signal in relation to untreated psychotic symptoms (t92 =2.12, p=0.037). In contrast, FES was not associated with a significant alteration in neuromelanin-MRI signal (241 SN voxels had elevated signal, pcorrected=0.094). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that elevated dopamine function in a critical SN subregion may contribute to the risk of psychosis in people with CUD. Thus, cannabis affects the long-suspected 'final common pathway' for the clinical expression of psychotic symptoms. Imaging the dopamine system with neuromelanin-MRI may index long-term dopamine turnover.

                Proprioception is essential for planning and executing precise movements. Muscle spindles, the key mechanoreceptors for proprioception, are the principle sensory neurons enabling this process. Emerging evidence suggests spindles act as adaptable processors, modulated by gamma motor neurons to meet task demands. Yet, the specifics of this modulation remain unknown. Here, we present a novel, physics-informed neural network model that integrates biomechanics and neural dynamics to capture spindle function with high fidelity and efficiency, while maintaining computational tractability. Through validation across multiple experimental datasets and species, our model not only outperforms existing approaches but also reveals key drivers of variability in spindle responses, offering new insights into proprioceptive mechanisms.

">Endogenous Regulator of G protein Signaling 14 (RGS14) suppresses cocaine-induced emotionally motivated behaviors in female mice</a></h4>

              
                Addictive drugs hijack the neuronal mechanisms of learning and memory in motivation and emotion processing circuits to reinforce their own use. Regulator of G-protein Signaling 14 (RGS14) is a natural suppressor of post-synaptic plasticity underlying learning and memory in the hippocampus. The present study used immunofluorescence and RGS14 knockout mice to assess the role of RGS14 in behavioral plasticity and reward learning induced by chronic cocaine in emotional-motivational circuits. We report that RGS14 is strongly expressed in discrete regions of the ventral striatum and extended amygdala in wild-type mice, and is co-expressed with D1 and D2 dopamine receptors in neurons of the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Of note, we found that RGS14 is upregulated in the NAc in mice with chronic cocaine history following acute cocaine treatment. We found significantly increased cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization, as well as enhanced conditioned place preference and conditioned locomotor activity in RGS14-deficient mice compared to wild-type littermates. Together, these findings suggest that endogenous RGS14 suppresses cocaine-induced plasticity in emotional-motivational circuits, implicating RGS14 as a protective agent against the maladaptive neuroplastic changes that occur during addiction.

">Age-related decline of PKA-RIIβ level in SNc dopaminergic neurons underlies PD pathogenesis</a></h4>

              
                The cyclic-AMP dependent protein kinase A (Protein kinase A, PKA) regulates dopaminergic function in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). However, whether PKA is involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) is unknown. Here, by collecting and analyzing the current worldwide SNc transcriptomic datasets of PD patients, we found a decline of PKA-RIIbeta subunit level in the SNc of PD patients. The decreased PKA-RIIbeta subunit level was positively correlated with decreased dopamine synthesis and increased oxidative stress in the SNc of PD patients. PKA-RIIbeta subunit is expressed in the striatum and the SNc. PKA-RIIbeta gene knockout mice (RIIbeta-KO) showed a age-related parkinsonism at 12 months of age. Using Cre-LoxP system, we observed that RIIbeta; re-expression in the SNc dopaminergic neurons rescued parkinsonism of RIIbeta-KO mice. RIIbeta re-expression in striatal neurons did not affect parkinsonism of RIIbeta-KO mice. The spontaneous parkinsonism could be developed in 12-month-old SNc dopaminergic neuron-specific RIIbeta-deficient mice. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed decreased PKA activity, reduced dopamine synthesis and raised oxidative stress in the SNc dopaminergic neurons of RIIbeta-KO mice. Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene therapy targeting PKA-RIIbeta in the SNc dopaminergic neurons rescued parkinsonism in PD mouse model. Taken together, these findings indicate that PKA-RIIbeta may be a key factor of human genetic etiologies of PD. The therapy targeting PKA-RIIbeta in the SNc dopaminergic neurons may be promising for PD treatment.

">Egocentric anchoring-and-adjustment of social knowledge in the hippocampal formation</a></h4>

              
                Recent work suggests the hippocampal formation(HF) assimilates relational social knowledge similar to how it transforms egocentric spatial cues into map-like representations. Yet whether hippocampal map-like representations of social knowledge still represent lingering egocentric biases is unclear. We test if a prominent egocentric bias involving an implicit reliance on self-knowledge when rating others, anchoring-and-adjustment, is present when the relative attributes of different social entities are assimilated by the HF. Participants provided likelihood ratings of partaking in everyday activities for themselves, fictitious individuals, and familiar social groups. Adapting a functional neuroimaging task from Kaplan and Friston, participants then learned a stranger's preference for an activity relative to one of the fictitious individuals and inferred how the stranger's preference related to the groups' preferences. Egocentric anchoring-and-adjustment was present when participants rated the other entities. Isolating the neural representation of egocentric anchoring-and-adjustment when flexibly comparing different social entities, the HF and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex(dmPFC) represented group-self rating discrepancy. Furthermore, the HF also reflected how well group preferences were remembered, where memory for group preferences correlates with task performance. We found the HF selectively represented group identity over other learned entities, confirming that the HF was primarily engaged by social comparisons in a more ample frame of reference. Taken together, these results imply that self-knowledge influences how the HF assimilates map-like knowledge about others.

">Combined transcriptomic, connectivity, and activity profiling of the medial amygdala using highly amplified multiplexed in situ hybridization (hamFISH)</a></h4>

              
                In situ transcriptomic technologies provide a promising avenue to link gene expression, connectivity, and physiological properties of neural cell types. Commercialized methods that allow the detection of hundreds of genes in situ, however, are expensive and therefore typically used for generating unimodal reference data rather than for resource-intensive multimodal analyses. A major bottleneck is the lack of a routine means to efficiently generate cell type data. Here, we have developed hamFISH (highly amplified multiplexed in situ hybridization), which enables the sequential detection of 32 genes using multiplexed branched DNA amplification. We used hamFISH to profile the projection, activity, and transcriptomic diversity of the medial amygdala (MeA), a critical node for innate social and defensive behaviors. In total, we profiled 643,834 cells and classified neurons into 16 inhibitory and 10 excitatory types, many of which were found to be spatially clustered. We then examined the organization of outputs of these cells and activation profiles during different social contexts. Therefore, by facilitating multiplexed detection of single molecule RNAs, hamFISH provides a streamlined and versatile platform for multimodal profiling of specific brain nuclei.

">Contribution of amygdala to dynamic model arbitration under uncertainty</a></h4>

              
                Intrinsic uncertainty in the reward environment requires the brain to run multiple models simultaneously to predict outcomes based on preceding cues or actions, commonly referred to as stimulus- and action-based learning. Ultimately, the brain also must adopt appropriate choice behavior using reliability of these models. Here, we combined multiple experimental and computational approaches to quantify concurrent learning in monkeys performing tasks with different levels of uncertainty about the model of the environment. By comparing behavior in control monkeys and monkeys with bilateral lesions to the amygdala or ventral striatum, we found evidence for dynamic, competitive interaction between stimulus-based and action-based learning, and for a distinct role of the amygdala. Specifically, we demonstrate that the amygdala adjusts the initial balance between the two learning systems, thereby altering the interaction between arbitration and learning that shapes the time course of both learning and choice behaviors. This novel role of the amygdala can account for existing contradictory observations and provides testable predictions for future studies into circuit-level mechanisms of flexible learning and choice under uncertainty.

                Children's caregiving experiences impact the internal models they use to process new emotional events. Examining inter-subject functional correlation in 7- to 15-year-olds during narrative movies depicting separation and reunion, we find that secure attachment to current caregivers plays a larger role than early adversity in shaping prefrontal-amygdala connectivity. Secure attachment also decreased the emphasis in later memory on separation elements in the narrative.

">Thermosensory behaviors of the free-living life stages of Strongyloides species support parasitism in tropical environments</a></h4>

              
                Soil-transmitted parasitic nematodes infect over 1 billion people worldwide and are a common source of neglected disease. Strongyloides stercoralis is a potentially fatal skin-penetrating human parasite that is endemic to tropical and subtropical regions around the world. The complex life cycle of Strongyloides species is unique among human-parasitic nematodes in that it includes a single free-living generation featuring soil-dwelling, bacterivorous adults whose progeny all develop into infective larvae. The sensory behaviors that enable free-living Strongyloides adults to navigate and survive soil environments are unknown. S. stercoralis infective larvae display parasite-specific sensory-driven behaviors, including robust attraction to mammalian body heat. In contrast, the free-living model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans displays thermosensory behaviors that guide adult worms to stay within a physiologically permissive range of environmental temperatures. Do S. stercoralis and C. elegans free-living adults, which experience similar environmental stressors, display common thermal preferences? Here, we characterize the thermosensory behaviors of the free-living adults of S. stercoralis as well as those of the closely related rat parasite, Strongyloides ratti. We find that Strongyloides free-living adults are exclusively attracted to near-tropical temperatures, despite their inability to infect mammalian hosts. We further show that lifespan is shorter at higher temperatures for free-living Strongyloides adults, similar to the effect of temperature on C. elegan's lifespan. However, we also find that the reproductive potential of the free-living life stage is enhanced at warmer temperatures, particularly for S. stercoralis. Together, our results reveal a novel role for thermotaxis to maximize the infectious capacity of obligate parasites and provide insight into the biological adaptations that may contribute to their endemicity in tropical climates.

">Opponent visuospatial coding structures responses during memory recall and visual perception in medial parietal cortex</a></h4>

              
                The mechanisms linking perceptual and memory representations in the brain are not yet fully understood. In early visual cortex, perception and memory are known to share similar neural representations, but how they interact beyond early visual cortex is less clear. Recent work identified that scene-perception and scene-memory areas on the lateral and ventral surfaces of the brain are linked via a shared but opponent visuospatial coding scheme, suggesting that shared visuospatial coding might provide a framework for perceptual-memory interactions. Here, we test whether the pattern in visuospatial coding within category-selective memory areas of medial parietal cortex structures responses during memory recall and visual perception. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we observe signatures of visuospatial coding in the form of population receptive fields (pRFs) with both positive and negative response profiles within medial parietal cortex. Crucially, the more dissimilar the timeseries of a pair of positive/negative pRFs within a region, the more dissimilar their responses during both memory recall and visual perception - tasks that place very different demands on these regions: internally oriented memory recall versus externally oriented visual perception. These data extend recent work to suggest that the interplay between pRFs with opponent visuospatial coding may play a vital role in integrating information across different representational spaces.

">Neurovascular Impulse Response Function (IRF) during spontaneous activity differentially reflects intrinsic neuromodulation across cortical regions</a></h4>

              
                Ascending neuromodulatory projections from deep brain nuclei generate internal brain states that differentially engage specific neuronal cell types. Because neurovascular coupling is cell-type specific and neuromodulatory transmitters have vasoactive properties, we hypothesized that the impulse response function (IRF) linking spontaneous neuronal activity with hemodynamics would depend on neuromodulation. To test this hypothesis, we used optical imaging to measure (1) release of neuromodulatory transmitters norepinephrine (NE) or acetylcholine (ACh), (2) Ca2+ activity of local cortical neurons, and (3) changes in hemoglobin concentration and oxygenation across the dorsal surface of cerebral cortex during spontaneous neuronal activity in awake mice. A canonical convolution model with a stationary IRF (e.g., the convolution kernel) describing evolution of total hemoglobin (HbT, reflective of dilation dynamics) with respect to Ca2+, resulted in a poor fit to the data. However, the HbT time-course was well predicted, pixel-by-pixel, by a weighted sum of Ca2+ and NE time-courses. The weighting coefficients, calculated using linear regression, varied smoothly across the cortical space. Consistent with this result, modeling HbT as a weighted sum of stationary Ca2+- and NE-specific IRFs convolved with the respective time-courses dramatically improved the fit compared to the invariant IRF. In both the linear regression and the Double-IRF convolution models, Ca2+ and NE weighting was positive and negative, respectively. In contrast to NE, ACh was largely redundant with Ca2+ and therefore did not improve HbT estimation. Because NE covaried with arousal, we observed instances of the diminished hemodynamic coherence between cortical regions during high arousal despite coherent behavior of the underlying neuronal Ca2+ activity. We conclude that while neurovascular coupling with respect to neuronal Ca2+ is a dynamic and seemingly complex phenomenon, hemodynamic fluctuations can be captured by a simple linear model with stationary IRFs with respect to the underlying dilatory and constrictive forces. In the current study, these forces were captured by the positive Ca2+ (dilation) and negative NE (constriction) coefficients. Without accounting for NE neuromodulation and the associated vasoconstriction, diminished hemodynamic coherence, commonly referred to as ''functional (dys)connectivity'' in BOLD fMRI studies, can be falsely interpreted as neuronal desynchronizations.

">Mindfulness-based Neurofeedback: A Systematic Review of EEG and fMRI studies</a></h4>

              
                Neurofeedback concurrent with mindfulness meditation may reveal meditation effects on the brain and facilitate improved mental health outcomes. Here, we systematically reviewed EEG and fMRI studies of mindfulness meditation with neurofeedback (mbNF) and followed PRISMA guidelines. We identified 10 fMRI reports, consisting of 177 unique participants, and 9 EEG reports, consisting of 242 participants. Studies of fMRI focused primarily on downregulating the default-mode network (DMN). Although studies found decreases in DMN activations during neurofeedback, there is a lack of evidence for transfer effects, and the majority of studies did not employ adequate controls, e.g. sham neurofeedback. Accordingly, DMN decreases may have been confounded by general task-related deactivation. EEG studies typically examined alpha, gamma, and theta frequency bands, with the most robust evidence supporting the modulation of theta band activity. Both EEG and fMRI mbNF have been implemented with high fidelity in clinical populations. However, the mental health benefits of mbNF have not been established. In general, mbNF studies would benefit from sham-controlled RCTs, as well as clear reporting (e.g. CRED-NF).

">Muscle spindles provide flexible sensory feedback for movement sequences</a></h4>

              
                Sensory feedback is essential for motor performance and must adapt to task demands. Muscle spindle afferents (MSAs) are a major primary source of feedback about movement, and their responses are readily modulated online by gain-controller fusimotor neurons and other mechanisms. They are therefore a powerful site for implementing flexible sensorimotor control. We recorded from MSAs innervating the jaw musculature during performance of a directed lick sequence task. Jaw MSAs encoded complex jaw-tongue kinematics. However, kinematic encoding alone accounted for less than half of MSA spiking variability. MSA representations of kinematics changed based on sequence progression (beginning, middle, or end of the sequence, or reward consumption), suggesting that MSAs are flexibly tuned across the task. Dynamic control of incoming feedback signals from MSAs may be a strategy for adaptable sensorimotor control during performance of complex behaviors.

">Ndufs4 inactivation in glutamatergic neurons reveals swallow-breathing discoordination in a mouse model of Leigh Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Swallowing, both nutritive and non-nutritive, is highly dysfunctional in children with Leigh Syndrome (LS) and contributes to the need for both gastrostomy and tracheostomy tube placement. Without these interventions aspiration of food, liquid, and mucus occur resulting in repeated bouts of respiratory infection. No study has investigated whether mouse models of LS, a neurometabolic disorder, exhibit dysfunctions in neuromuscular activity of swallow and breathing integration. We used a genetic mouse model of LS in which the NDUFS4 gene is knocked out (KO) specifically in Vglut2 or Gad2 neurons. We found increased variability of the swallow motor pattern, disruption in breathing regeneration post swallow, and water-induced apneas only in Vglut2 KO mice. These physiological changes likely contribute to weight loss and premature death seen in this mouse model. Following chronic hypoxia (CH) exposure, swallow motor pattern, breathing regeneration, weight, and life expectancy were not changed in the Vglut2-Ndufs4-KO CH mice compared to control, indicating a rescue of phenotypes. These findings show that like patients with LS, Ndufs4 mouse models of LS exhibit swallow impairments as well as swallow-breathing dyscoordination alongside the other phenotypic traits described in previous studies. Understanding this aspect of LS will open roads for the development of future more efficacious therapeutic intervention for this illness.

">Visually-evoked activity and variable modulation of auditory responses in the macaque inferior colliculus</a></h4>

              
                How multisensory cues affect processing in early sensory brain areas is not well understood. The inferior colliculus (IC) is an early auditory structure that is visually responsive (Porter et al., 2007; Bulkin & Groh, 2012b, 2012a), but little is known about how visual signals affect the IC's auditory representation. We explored how visual cues affect both spiking and local field potential (LFP) activity in the IC of two monkeys performing a task involving saccades to auditory, visual, or combined audiovisual stimuli. We confirm that LFPs are sensitive to the onset of fixation lights as well as the onset of visual targets presented during steady fixation. The LFP waveforms evoked by combined audiovisual stimuli differed from those evoked by sounds alone. In single-unit spiking activity, responses were weak when visual stimuli were presented alone, but visual stimuli could modulate the activity evoked by sounds in a stronger way. Such modulations could involve either increases or decreases in activity, and whether increases or decreases were observed was variable and not obviously correlated with the responses evoked by visual or auditory stimuli alone. These findings indicate that visual stimuli shape the IC's auditory representation in flexible ways that differ from those observed previously in multisensory areas.

">SMN deficiency induces an early non-atrophic myopathy with alterations in the contractile and excitatory coupling machinery of skeletal myofibers in the SMN{triangleup}7 mouse model of spinal muscular atrophy</a></h4>

              
                Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by a deficiency of the ubiquitously expressed survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. The main pathological hallmark of SMA is the degeneration of lower motor neurons (MNs) with subsequent denervation and atrophy of skeletal muscle. However, increasing evidence indicates that low SMN levels not only are detrimental to the central nervous system but also directly affect other peripheral tissues and organs, including skeletal muscle. To better understand the potential primary impact of SMN deficiency in muscle, we explored the cellular, ultrastructural, and molecular basis of SMA myopathy in the SMN{Delta}7 mouse model of severe SMA at an early postnatal period (P0-7) prior to muscle denervation and MN loss (preneurodegenerative [PND] stage). This period contrasts with the neurodegenerative (ND) stage (P8-14), in which MN loss and muscle atrophy occur. At the PND stage, we found that SMN{triangleup}7 mice displayed early signs of motor dysfunction with overt myofiber alterations in the absence of atrophy. Focal and segmental lesions in the myofibrillar contractile apparatus were noticed in myofibers. These lesions were observed in association with specific myonuclear domains and included abnormal accumulations of actin-thin myofilaments, sarcomere disruption, and the formation of minisarcomeres. The sarcoplasmic reticulum and triads also exhibited ultrastructural alterations, suggesting decoupling during the excitation-contraction process. Finally, changes in intermyofibrillar mitochondrial organization and dynamics, indicative of mitochondrial biogenesis overactivation, were also found. Overall, our results demonstrated that SMN deficiency induces early and MN loss-independent alterations in myofibers that essentially contribute to SMA myopathy. This strongly supports the view of an intrinsic alteration of skeletal muscle in SMA, suggesting that this peripheral tissue is a key therapeutic target for the disease.

">Cross-sectional brain age assessments are limited in predicting future brain change</a></h4>

              
                The concept of brain age (BA) describes an integrative imaging marker of brain health, often suggested to reflect ageing processes. However, the degree to which cross-sectional MRI features, including BA, reflect past, ongoing and future brain changes across different tissue types from macro- to microstructure remains controversial. Multimodal imaging data of 39,325 UK Biobank participants, aged 44-82 years at baseline and 2,520 follow-ups within 1.12-6.90 years, provide insufficient evidence that BA reflects the rate of brain ageing.

">Isotonic and minimally invasive optical clearing media for live cell imaging ex vivo and in vivo</a></h4>

              
                Tissue clearing has been widely used for fluorescence imaging of fixed tissues, but not for live tissues due to its toxicity. Here we develop minimally invasive optical clearing media for fluorescence imaging of live mammalian tissues. Light scattering is minimized by adding spherical polymers with low osmolarity to the extracellular medium. A clearing medium containing bovine serum albumin (SeeDB-Live) is minimally invasive to live cells, allowing for structural and functional imaging of live tissues, such as spheroids, organoids, acute brain slices, and the mouse brain in vivo. SeeDB-Live minimally affects the electrophysiological properties and sensory responses of neurons. We demonstrate its utility for widefield imaging of subcellular voltage dynamics, such as backpropagating action potentials, in acute brain slices. We also utilize SeeDB-Live for widefield voltage imaging of dozens of dendrites in vivo, demonstrating population dynamics. Thus, SeeDB-Live expands the scale and modalities of fluorescence imaging of live mammalian tissues.

">Intracortical injection of immune checkpoint inhibitor promotes monocyte/macrophage infiltration and restores microglial function and neuronal activity in an AD mouse model</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the intricate interplay among immune responses and homeostatic cell function in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains challenging. Here, we present a novel strategy to mitigate AD pathology by directly modulating the immune checkpoint PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway in the brain, where elevated levels of microglial PD-1 and astrocytic PD-L1 have been observed. We found that a single intracortical injection of anti-PD-L1 antibody facilitates the infiltration of peripheral immune cells into the brain, including IL-10-secreting Ly6C+ monocytes. Subsequently, this leads to the restoration of microglial homeostatic functions including an increase in P2RY12 expression, which enhances microglial process extension. This cascade of events following anti-PD-L1 injection is crucial for regulating abnormally hyperactive neurons and reducing amyloid-beta plaques. These findings suggest that the direct application of immune checkpoint blockade in the brain could offer a new approach to managing the delicate cell-cell interactions among neurons, glial cells, and peripheral immune cells in the AD brain.

	<p>Background/Objectives: The objective of this study was to assess the connection between the systemic inflammation response index (SIRI) values and failure patterns of patients with IDH wild-type glioblastoma (GB) who underwent radiotherapy (RT) with FLAIR-based gross tumor volume (GTV) delineation. Methods: Seventy-one patients who received RT at a dose of 60 Gy to the GTV and 50 Gy to the clinical target volume (CTV) and had documented recurrence were retrospectively analyzed. Each patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s maximum distance of recurrence (MDR) from the GTV was documented in whichever plane it extended the farthest. The failure patterns were described as intra-GTV, in-CTV/out-GTV, distant, and intra-GTV and distant. For analytical purposes, the failure pattern was categorized into two groups, namely Group 1, intra-GTV or in-CTV/out-GTV, and Group 2, distant or intra-GTV and distant. The SIRI was calculated before surgery and corticosteroid administration. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to determine the optimal SIRI cut-off that distinguishes between the different failure patterns. Results: Failure occurred as follows: intra-GTV in 40 (56.3%), in-CTV/out-GTV in 4 (5.6%), distant in 18 (25.4%), and intra-GTV + distant in 9 (12.7%) patients. The mean MDR was 13.5 mm, and recurrent lesions extended beyond 15 mm in only seven patients. Patients with an SIRI score &amp;amp;ge; 3 demonstrated a significantly higher incidence of Group 1 failure patterns than their counterparts with an SIRI score &amp;amp;lt; 3 (74.3% vs. 50.0%; p = 0.035). Conclusions: The present results show that using the SIRI with a cut-off value of &amp;amp;ge;3 significantly predicts failure patterns. Additionally, the margin for the GTV can be safely reduced to 15 mm when using FLAIR-based target delineation in patients with GB.</p>

<p>One adverse social experience in adulthood such as social defeat promotes vulnerability. Two adverse social experiences during development (maternal separation + social defeat) foster resilience. Activity-dependent plasticity in the mPFC seems to be crucial for resilience to social adversity.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Individuals considered resilient can overcome adversity, achieving normal physical and psychological development, while those deemed vulnerable may not. Adversity promotes structural and functional alterations in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus. Moreover, activity-dependent synaptic plasticity is intricately linked to neuronal shaping resulting from experiences. We hypothesize that this plasticity plays a crucial role in resilience processes. However, there is a notable absence of studies investigating this plasticity and behavioral changes following social adversity at different life stages. Consequently, we evaluated the impact of social adversity during early postnatal development (maternal separation [MS]), adulthood (social defeat [SD]), and a combined exposure (MS + SD) on behavioral outcomes (anxiety, motivation, anhedonia, and social interaction). We also examined cFos expression induced by social interaction in mPFC and hippocampus of adult male rats. Behavioral analyses revealed that SD-induced anhedonia, whereas MS + SD increased social interaction and mitigated SD-induced anhedonia. cFos evaluation showed that social interaction heightened plasticity in the prelimbic (PrL) and infralimbic (IL) cortices, dentate gyrus (DG), CA3, and CA1. Social interaction-associated plasticity was compromised in IL and PrL cortices of the MS and SD groups. Interestingly, social interaction-induced plasticity was restored in the MS + SD group. Furthermore, plasticity was impaired in DG by all social stressors, and in CA3 was impaired by SD. Our findings suggest in male rats (i) two adverse social experiences during development foster resilience; (ii) activity-dependent plasticity in the mPFC is a foundation for resilience to social adversity; (iii) plasticity in DG is highly susceptible to social adversity.</p>

                The cis interaction between CD80 and PD-L1 disrupts PD-L1 function. Robinson et al. show that CTLA-4 restores PD-L1 activity, but this requires rigid bivalent binding of CTLA-4 to CD80. The unusual angle of the PD-L1-CD80 interaction indicates that PD-L1 release occurs via a physical reorientation of CD80, which is then unfavorable for PD-L1 binding.

	<p>Study Objectives: The Federal Interagency Traumatic Brain Injury Research (FITBIR) Informatics System contains individual-patient-level traumatic brain injury (TBI) data, which when combined, allows for the examination of rates and outcomes for key subpopulations at risk for developing sleep disturbance. Methods: This proof-of-concept study creates a model system for harmonizing data (i.e., combining and standardizing data) across FITBIR studies for participants with and without a history of TBI to estimate rates of sleep disturbance and identify risk factors. Results: Three studies were eligible for harmonization (N = 1753). Sleep disturbance was common among those with a history of mild TBI (63%). Individuals with mild TBI were two to four times more likely to have sleep disturbance compared to those with no history of TBI. Conclusions: This study established methods, harmonization code, and meta-databases that are publicly available on the FITBIR website. We demonstrated how the harmonization of FITBIR studies can answer TBI research questions, showing that associations between TBI and sleep disturbance may be influenced by demographic factors.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Fragile-X Syndrome (FXS) is the leading monogenetic cause of intellectual disability among children but remains without a cure. Using the <i>Fmr1</i>
<i>KO</i> mouse model of FXS, much work has been done to understand FXS hippocampus dysfunction. Purinergic signaling, where ATP and its metabolites are used as signaling molecules, participates in hippocampus development, but it is unknown if purinergic signaling is affected in the developing <i>Fmr1</i>
<i>KO</i> hippocampus. In our study, we characterized the purinergic receptor P2X7. We first found that P2X7 was reduced in <i>Fmr1 KO</i> whole hippocampus tissue at P14 and P21, corresponding to the periods of neurite outgrowth and synaptic refinement in the hippocampus. We then evaluated the cell-specific expression of P2X7 with immunofluorescence and found differences between WT and <i>Fmr1</i>
<i>KO</i> mice in P2X7 colocalization with hippocampal microglia and neurons. P2X7 colocalized more with microglia at P14 and P21, but there was a sex-specific reduction in P2X7 colocalization with neurons. In contrast, male mice at P14 and P21 showed reduced neuronal P2X7 colocalization compared to females, but only females showed reduced absolute neuronal P2X7 expression across the dorsal hippocampal formation. Together, our results suggest that P2X7 expression is altered during <i>Fmr1</i>-KO hippocampal development, potentially influencing several developmental processes in the <i>Fmr1-</i>KO hippocampus formation.</p>

                <p>Astrocytes are essential for the formation and maintenance of neural networks. However, a major technical challenge for investigating astrocyte function and disease-related pathophysiology has been the limited ability to obtain functional human astrocytes. Despite recent advances in human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) techniques, primary rodent astrocytes remain the gold standard in coculture with human neurons. We demonstrate that a combination of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and bone morphogenetic protein-4 (BMP4) directs hPSC-derived neural precursor cells to a highly pure population of astroglia in 28&nbsp;d. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we confirm the astroglial identity of these cells and highlight profound transcriptional adaptations in cocultured hPSC-derived astrocytes and neurons, consistent with their further maturation. In coculture with human neurons, multielectrode array recordings revealed robust network activity of human neurons in a coculture with hPSC-derived or rat astrocytes [3.63 &plusmn; 0.44&nbsp;min<sup>&ndash;1</sup> (hPSC-derived), 2.86 &plusmn; 0.64&nbsp;min<sup>&ndash;1</sup> (rat); <I>p </I>= 0.19]. In comparison, we found increased spike frequency within network bursts of human neurons cocultured with hPSC-derived astrocytes [56.31 &plusmn; 8.56&nbsp;Hz (hPSC-derived), 24.77 &plusmn; 4.04&nbsp;Hz (rat); <I>p </I>&lt; 0.01], and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings revealed an increase of postsynaptic currents [2.76 &plusmn; 0.39&nbsp;Hz (hPSC-derived), 1.07 &plusmn; 0.14&nbsp;Hz (rat); <I>p </I>&lt; 0.001], consistent with a corresponding increase in synapse density [14.90 &plusmn; 1.27/100&nbsp;&mu;m<sup>2</sup> (hPSC-derived), 8.39 &plusmn; 0.63/100&nbsp;&mu;m<sup>2</sup> (rat); <I>p </I>&lt; 0.001]. Taken together, we show that hPSC-derived astrocytes compare favorably with rat astrocytes in supporting human neural network activity and maturation, providing a fully human platform for investigating astrocyte function and neuronal-glial interactions.</p>

                <p>Much of what has been discovered concerning neurophysiological mechanisms can be credited to ex vivo biomedical experiments. Beyond these discoveries, ex vivo research techniques have enhanced the global understanding of human physiology and pathology in almost every biomedical specialty. Naturally, ex vivo experiments are among the most desired methods of research, particularly in the field of neuroscience. Ex vivo experiment platforms may be purchased commercially. However, their substantial cost and sometimes limited availability can render them inaccessible to many research labs. Moreover, these manufactured systems are often rigid in function with no possibility of customization, severely narrowing their capabilities. However, developing essential components for ex vivo laboratory systems with a fused deposition modeling printer provides a practical solution to each of these obstacles. Here, we provide the designs and construction process for an easily accessible, highly adaptable recording stage with modifiable submersion chambers using a 3D printer for a total cost under $15.00. With the versatility afforded by the exchangeable custom chambers, the system may be used to conduct research on a variety of ex vivo tissue preparations, paving the way for novel research.</p>

                Background Indonesia is one of the countries that is endemic to avian influenza virus subtype H9N2. This study aims to compare the molecular characteristics of avian influenza virus (AIV) subtype H9N2 from West Java. Methods Specific pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs were used to inoculate samples. RNA extraction and RT–qPCR confirmed the presence of H9 and N2 genes in the samples. RT–PCR was employed to amplify the H9N2-positive sample. Nucleotide sequences were obtained through Sanger sequencing and analyzed using MEGA 7. Homology comparison and phylogenetic tree analysis, utilizing the neighbor-joining tree method, assessed the recent isolate’s similarity to reference isolates from GenBank. Molecular docking analysis was performed on the HA1 protein of the recent isolate and the A/Layer/Indonesia/WestJava-04/2017 isolate, comparing their interactions with the sialic acids Neu5Ac2-3Gal and Neu5Ac2-6Gal. Results RT–qPCR confirmed the isolate samples as AIV subtype H9N2. The recent virus exhibited 11 amino acid residue differences compared to the A/Layer/Indonesia/WestJava-04/2017 isolate. Phylogenetically, the recent virus remains within the h9.4.2.5 subclade. Notably, at antigenic site II, the recent isolate featured an amino acid N at position 183, unlike A/Layer/Indonesia/WestJava-04/2017. Molecular docking analysis revealed a preference of HA1 from the 2017 virus for Neu5Ac2-3Gal, while the 2023 virus displayed a tendency to predominantly bind with Neu5Ac2-6Gal. Conclusion In summary, the recent isolate displayed multiple mutations and a strong affinity for Neu5Ac2-6Gal, commonly found in mammals.

                Background The current report describes a unimodular thyroid goiter (TGo), identified unilaterally in a female cadaver, causing displacement or compression effects in the adjacent neck structures (common carotid artery (CCA) and internal jugular vein (IJV),). Methods Routine dissection of the neck of an 86-year-old female donated a Greek cadaver. Results A thyroid gland variant was identified coexisting with a TGo originating from the left thyroid lobe. The variant is a pyramidal lobe located on the left side of the isthmus. Owing to the presence of the TGo, the left CCA, along with the left IJV, deviated 50.6 mm ipsilaterally from the midline of the neck. The right CCA had a minor deviation of 30.8 mm, from the midline to the right side due to the proximity of the shifted trachea and esophagus with the CCA origin. The trachea and esophagus deviated contralaterally to the TGo, 24.4 mm from the midline. Conclusions CCA compression, stenosis, and angulation may cause dizziness, weakness, and hypomnesia. The potential outcomes were worse with IJV compression. Atherosclerosis tends to occur more often in arteries with inclined (angulated) parts.

                Background In this paper we analyse the novel The End of Eddy by Édouard Louis. The motivation for this paper is Bourdeau’s (2020) observation that Louis’s book explores working class politics, sexuality, and masculinity. Methods We analysed the amendment through narrative content analysis, the application of which allows us to answer the following question: Édouard Louis’s novel The End of Eddy: A representation of hegemonic masculinity? Results We conclude that this narrative is built on contradictions that can be summarized as a conflict between a socio-cultural norm anchored in a French village and a person who does not fulfil this concept, who is outside of it. We believe that hegemonic masculinity, that is, one part of the cultural norm of a given village, causes Eddy’s inclination or consciousness of homonationalism. Thus, on the one hand, hegemonic masculinity is undoubtedly present in this novel; on the other hand, it forms a kind of background or socio-cultural environment which, although it defines itself against the given, unconsciously causes the “birth of the conscious homosexual”. Conclusions Thus, we dare to claim that the narrative under analysis is not only a representation of hegemonic masculinity, but also an accentuation of its external and internal influence on one’s own perception of (sexual) difference.

                Background Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a prevalent condition caused by weakened pelvic floor support structures. Extracellular matrix alterations, including changes in collagen type I, collagen type III, and matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1), contribute to the pathogenesis of this condition. Human platelet-rich fibrin lysate (hPRF-L) is a novel regenerative treatment that has shown beneficial results in treating structural weaknesses related to various pelvic floor diseases, including POP. Methods This study protocol aims to investigate the effects of hPRF-L injection on collagen I, III, and MMP-1 in the vaginal mucosa of a rat POP model. POP will be induced in female Sprague-Dawley rats, which will be randomly assigned to control, sham, and hPRF-L treatment groups. The hPRF-L group will receive weekly injections of hPRF-L (25, 50, or 75 μL) into the vaginal mucosa for 4 weeks. Vaginal tissue samples will be collected, and collagen type I, collagen type III, and MMP-1 expression will be evaluated using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical analyses. Data analysis will be performed with ANOVA and post-hoc tests. Discussion The findings from this study protocol are expected to provide valuable insights into the mechanisms by which hPRF-L impacts the structural integrity of the pelvic floor. By elucidating these mechanisms, this study aims to inform future POP treatment strategies. The anticipated results are an increase in collagen type I and III expression and a reduction in MMP-1 levels in the hPRF-L treatment group compared to the control and sham groups. These outcomes could support the use of hPRF-L as a regenerative therapy for managing POP, offering a potential alternative to more invasive surgical interventions. Conclusion The expected results will contribute to the development of less invasive treatments for POP, improving patient outcomes and quality of life.

In this study we characterize ten CSNK1A1 commercial antibodies for western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. This study is part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While the use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

                Background Monitoring and strict control of anticoagulation therapy reduces the risk of thromboembolic or hemorrhagic events. The objective of this research was to explore the association of the quality of anticoagulation control with the occurrence of stroke, thrombotic or hemorrhagic events, or death during follow-up in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) on vitamin K antagonists. Methods A retrospective and observational study was carried out in clinical practice (real world data). Data were collected on age, sex, income level, occupational status, ischemic stroke, thrombotic and hemorrhagic events, death, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index. Time in therapeutic range (TTR) was measured using TAONet software and TTR ≥60% was considered indicative of good anticoagulation control. Survival analysis was carried out using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression models to compare time-to-event by quality of anticoagulation control. Determinants of anticoagulation quality were identified using logistic regression. Results Of 856 patients recruited, only 286 (33%) had a TTR ≥60%. Cox models including sociodemographic and clinical variables showed that the risk of all four events was much higher in the subsample with TTR <60% and the differences were statistically significant. Specifically, the hazard ratios (HRs) for this group were 1.94 (confidence interval [CI]: 1.13-3.30) for stroke, 1.60 (CI: 1.10-2.33) for thrombotic events, 1.61 (CI: 1.08-2.42) for hemorrhagic events and 2.97 (CIs: 1.86-4.75) for death. Conclusions The positive conclusion of the study was the markedly lower rate of events associated with TTR ≥60% and the negative conclusion was the low percentage of patients achieving good anticoagulation control. This implies that despite being “protected”, they continue to have a high risk of stroke, embolism, hemorrhagic complications and death. We believe it is necessary to develop and implement strategies to tackle this problem.

                Background Industry 4.0 is a significant technical revolution that combines big data analytics, the Internet of Things (IoT), and cyber-physical systems to improve manufacturing productivity. This study investigates the impact of digital trust and sustainable attitude on perceived value and the intention to adopt Industry 4.0 technologies. It also examines the moderating role of uncertainty avoidance in these relationships. Methods Data were collected from 189 employees of leading manufacturing companies in Indonesia that are recognized for their Industry 4.0 practices. The data were analyzed using Partial Least Squares (PLS) methodology with SmartPLS software to test the proposed hypotheses and explore the moderating effects. Results The findings reveal that both digital trust and sustainable attitude significantly influence perceived value. However, these factors do not directly affect the intention to adopt Industry 4.0 technologies. Uncertainty avoidance moderates the relationship between digital trust and adoption intention. Specifically, in environments with high uncertainty avoidance, digital trust becomes a critical factor influencing the decision to adopt Industry 4.0 technologies. Conclusions The study provides valuable insights for organizations aiming to implement Industry 4.0 initiatives. It highlights the importance of fostering digital trust and considering cultural dimensions, such as uncertainty avoidance, in their technology adoption strategies.

                <p>by Brian C. O’Meara, Jeremy M. Beaulieu</p>

Across a variety of biological datasets, from genomes to conservation to the fossil record, evolutionary rates appear to increase toward the present or over short time scales. This has long been seen as an indication of processes operating differently at different time scales, even potentially as an indicator of a need for new theory connecting macroevolution and microevolution. Here we introduce a set of models that assess the relationship between rate and time and demonstrate that these patterns are statistical artifacts of time-independent errors present across ecological and evolutionary datasets, which produce hyperbolic patterns of rates through time. We show that plotting a noisy numerator divided by time versus time leads to the observed hyperbolic pattern; in fact, randomizing the amount of change over time generates patterns functionally identical to observed patterns. Ignoring errors can not only obscure true patterns but create novel patterns that have long misled scientists.

                <p>by Israel Luis, Maarten Afschrift, Friedl De Groote, Elena M. Gutierrez-Farewik</p>

The metabolic energy rate of individual muscles is impossible to measure without invasive procedures. Prior studies have produced models to predict metabolic rates based on experimental observations of isolated muscle contraction from various species. Such models can provide reliable predictions of metabolic rates in humans if muscle properties and control are accurately modeled. This study aimed to examine how muscle-tendon model individualization and metabolic energy models influenced estimation of muscle-tendon states and time-series metabolic rates, to evaluate the agreement with empirical data, and to provide predictions of the metabolic rate of muscle groups and gait phases across walking speeds. Three-dimensional musculoskeletal simulations with prescribed kinematics and dynamics were performed. An optimal control formulation was used to compute muscle-tendon states with four levels of individualization, ranging from a scaled generic model and muscle controls based on minimal activations, inclusion of calibrated muscle passive forces, personalization of Achilles and quadriceps tendon stiffnesses, to finally informing muscle controls with electromyography. We computed metabolic rates based on existing models. Simulations with calibrated passive forces and personalized tendon stiffness most accurately estimate muscle excitations and fiber lengths. Interestingly, the inclusion of electromyography did not improve our estimates. The whole-body average metabolic cost was better estimated with a subset of metabolic energy models. We estimated metabolic rate peaks near early stance, pre-swing, and initial swing at all walking speeds. Plantarflexors accounted for the highest cost among muscle groups at the preferred speed and were similar to the cost of hip adductors and abductors combined. Also, the swing phase accounted for slightly more than one-quarter of the total cost in a gait cycle, and its relative cost decreased with walking speed. Our prediction might inform the design of assistive devices and rehabilitation treatment. The code and experimental data are available online.

In recent decades, field and semi-field studies of malaria transmission have gathered geographic-specific information about mosquito ecology, behaviour and their sensitivity to interventions. Mathematical models of malaria transmission can incorporate such data to infer the likely impact of vector control interventions and hence guide malaria control strategies in various geographies. To facilitate this process and make model predictions of intervention impact available for different geographical regions, we developed AnophelesModel. AnophelesModel is an online, open-access R package that quantifies the impact of vector control interventions depending on mosquito species and location-specific characteristics. In addition, it includes a previously published, comprehensive, curated database of field entomological data from over 50 <i>Anopheles</i> species, field data on mosquito and human behaviour, and estimates of vector control effectiveness. Using the input data, the package parameterizes a discrete-time, state transition model of the mosquito oviposition cycle and infers species-specific impacts of various interventions on vectorial capacity. In addition, it offers formatted outputs ready to use in downstream analyses and by other models of malaria transmission for accurate representation of the vector-specific components. Using AnophelesModel, we show how the key implications for intervention impact change for various vectors and locations. The package facilitates quantitative comparisons of likely intervention impacts in different geographical settings varying in vector compositions, and can thus guide towards more robust and efficient malaria control recommendations. The AnophelesModel R package is available under a GPL-3.0 license at https://github.com/SwissTPH/AnophelesModel.

An understanding of human brain individuality requires the integration of data on brain organization across people and brain regions, molecular and systems scales, as well as healthy and clinical states. Here, we help advance this understanding by leveraging methods from computational genomics to integrate large-scale genomic, transcriptomic, neuroimaging, and electronic-health record data sets. We estimated genetically regulated gene expression (gr-expression) of 18,647 genes, across 10 cortical and subcortical regions of 45,549 people from the UK Biobank. First, we showed that patterns of estimated gr-expression reflect known genetic–ancestry relationships, regional identities, as well as inter-regional correlation structure of directly assayed gene expression. Second, we performed transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) to discover 1,065 associations between individual variation in gr-expression and gray-matter volumes across people and brain regions. We benchmarked these associations against results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of the same sample and found hundreds of novel associations relative to these GWAS. Third, we integrated our results with clinical associations of gr-expression from the Vanderbilt Biobank. This integration allowed us to link genes, via gr-expression, to neuroimaging and clinical phenotypes. Fourth, we identified associations of polygenic gr-expression with structural and functional MRI phenotypes in the Human Connectome Project (HCP), a small neuroimaging-genomic data set with high-quality functional imaging data. Finally, we showed that estimates of gr-expression and magnitudes of TWAS were generally replicable and that the <i>p</i>-values of TWAS were replicable in large samples. Collectively, our results provide a powerful new resource for integrating gr-expression with population genetics of brain organization and disease.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Despite bilateral hippocampal damage dating to the perinatal or early childhood period and severely impaired episodic memory, patients with developmental amnesia continue to exhibit well-developed semantic memory across the developmental trajectory. Detailed information on the extent and focality of brain damage in these patients is needed to hypothesize about the neural substrate that supports their remarkable capacity for encoding and retrieval of semantic memory. In particular, we need to assess whether the residual hippocampal tissue is involved in this preservation, or whether the surrounding cortical areas reorganize to rescue aspects of these critical cognitive memory processes after early injury. We used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis, automatic (FreeSurfer) and manual segmentation to characterize structural changes in the brain of an exceptionally large cohort of 23 patients with developmental amnesia in comparison with 32 control subjects. Both the VBM and the FreeSurfer analyses revealed severe structural alterations in the hippocampus and thalamus of patients with developmental amnesia. Milder damage was found in the amygdala, caudate, and parahippocampal gyrus. Manual segmentation demonstrated differences in the degree of atrophy of the hippocampal subregions in patients. The level of atrophy in CA-DG subregions and subicular complex was more than 40%, while the atrophy of the uncus was moderate (−24%). Anatomo-functional correlations were observed between the volumes of residual hippocampal subregions in patients and selective aspects of their cognitive performance, viz, intelligence, working memory, and verbal and visuospatial recall. Our findings suggest that in patients with developmental amnesia, cognitive processing is compromised as a function of the extent of atrophy in hippocampal subregions. More severe hippocampal damage may be more likely to promote structural and/or functional reorganization in areas connected to the hippocampus. In this hypothesis, different levels of hippocampal function may be rescued following this variable reorganization. Our findings document not only the extent, but also the limits of circuit reorganization occurring in the young brain after early bilateral hippocampal damage.</p>

     alt="Covariation of Skull and Brain Morphology in Domestic Dogs"/>
<p>Using T2-weighted MRI studies of 79 dogs, we find that skull shape covaries with brain morphology. Dogs with extreme skull shapes – brachycephaly and dolichocephaly – show regional reductions in relative gray matter volume.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Despite their distinct embryonic origins, the skull and brain are highly integrated. Understanding the covariation between the skull and brain can shed light on anatomical, cognitive, and behavioral traits in extant and extinct species. Domestic dogs offer a unique opportunity to investigate skull–brain covariation due to their diverse skull morphologies and neural anatomy. To assess this question, we examined <i>T</i>2-weighted MRI studies of 62 dogs from 33 breeds, plus an additional 17 dogs of mixed or unknown breeds. Scans were opportunistically collected from a veterinary teaching hospital of dogs that were referred for neurological examination but did not have grossly observable structural brain abnormalities. As the neurocrania of dogs become broader and shorter, there is a significant decrease in the gray matter volume of the right olfactory bulb, frontal cortex, marginal gyrus, and cerebellum. On the other hand, as the neurocrania of dogs become narrower and longer, there is a significant decrease in the gray matter volume of the olfactory bulb, frontal cortex, temporal cortex, amygdala, hypothalamus, hippocampus, periaqueductal gray, cerebellum, and brainstem. Selective breeding for specific skull shapes may impact canine brain anatomy and function.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/8-1394/v7?src=rss">Are adverse effects of cannabidiol (CBD) products caused by tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) contamination? [version 7; peer review: 3 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Cannabidiol (CBD)-containing products are widely marketed as over the counter products. Adverse effects reported in anecdotal consumer reports or during clinical studies were first assumed to be due to acid-catalysed cyclization of CBD to psychotropic Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) in the stomach after oral consumption. However, research of pure CBD solutions stored in simulated gastric juice or subjected to various storage conditions such as heat and light with specific liquid chromatographic/tandem mass spectrometric (LC/MS/MS) and ultra-high pressure liquid chromatographic/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometric (UPLC-QTOF) analyses was unable to confirm THC formation. Another hypothesis for the adverse effects of CBD products may be residual Δ9-THC concentrations in the products as contamination, because most of them are based on hemp extracts containing the full spectrum of cannabinoids besides CBD. Analyses of 413 hemp-based products of the German market (mostly CBD oils) confirmed this hypothesis: 48 products (12%) contained Δ9-THC above the lowest observed adverse effect level (2.5 mg/day). Hence, it may be assumed that the adverse effects of some commercial CBD products are based on a low-dose effect of Δ9-THC, with the safety of CBD itself currently being unclear with significant uncertainties regarding possible liver and reproductive toxicity. The safety, efficacy and purity of commercial CBD products is highly questionable, and all of the products in our sample collection showed various non-conformities to European food law such as unsafe Δ9-THC levels, hemp extracts or CBD isolates as non-approved novel food ingredients, non-approved health claims, and deficits in mandatory food labelling requirements. In view of the growing market for such lifestyle products, the effectiveness of the instrument of food business operators' own responsibility for product safety and regulatory compliance must obviously be challenged, and a strong regulatory framework for hemp products needs to be devised.

                Caggiano et al. report that short-term U2 snRNP inhibition elicits transient splicing defects while inducing long-lasting depletion of DNA repair factors, causing persistent DNA damage in genomically unstable triple-negative breast cancer. Pulsed inhibition of splicing mimics a sustained BRCAness condition and is a promising therapeutic strategy to overcome chemotherapy resistance.

                Woo et al. developed and implemented a computational and experimental platform to identify and characterize non-coding driver regulatory regions in metastatic prostate cancer patient data. They find that the enhancer region GH22I030351 acts on a bidirectional promoter that simultaneously regulates the previously uncharacterized genes SF3A1 and CCDC157 in a tumor-promoting manner.

                Zhang et al. discovered that bookmarking factor FOXA1 undergoes dynamic phosphorylation at Serine 221 by Aurora B during mitosis, orchestrating its different DNA binding patterns and the periodic FOXA1 condensate formation during the cell cycle. Moreover, this phosphorylation regulates the target gene reactivation post-mitosis and cancer cell proliferation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91636">Language experience shapes predictive coding of rhythmic sound sequences</a></h4>

              
                Perceptual systems heavily rely on prior knowledge and predictions to make sense of the environment. Predictions can originate from multiple sources of information, including contextual short-term priors, based on isolated temporal situations, and context-independent long-term priors, arising from extended exposure to statistical regularities. While the effects of short-term predictions on auditory perception have been well-documented, how long-term predictions shape early auditory processing is poorly understood. To address this, we recorded magnetoencephalography data from native speakers of two languages with different word orders (Spanish: functor-initial vs Basque: functor-final) listening to simple sequences of binary sounds alternating in duration with occasional omissions. We hypothesized that, together with contextual transition probabilities, the auditory system uses the characteristic prosodic cues (duration) associated with the native language’s word order as an internal model to generate long-term predictions about incoming non-linguistic sounds. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that the amplitude of the mismatch negativity elicited by sound omissions varied orthogonally depending on the speaker’s linguistic background and was most pronounced in the left auditory cortex. Importantly, listening to binary sounds alternating in pitch instead of duration did not yield group differences, confirming that the above results were driven by the hypothesized long-term ‘duration’ prior. These findings show that experience with a given language can shape a fundamental aspect of human perception – the neural processing of rhythmic sounds – and provides direct evidence for a long-term predictive coding system in the auditory cortex that uses auditory schemes learned over a lifetime to process incoming sound sequences.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87935">Vangl2 suppresses NF-κB signaling and ameliorates sepsis by targeting p65 for NDP52-mediated autophagic degradation</a></h4>

              
                Van Gogh-like 2 (Vangl2), a core planar cell polarity component, plays an important role in polarized cellular and tissue morphology induction, growth development, and cancer. However, its role in regulating inflammatory responses remains elusive. Here, we report that Vangl2 is upregulated in patients with sepsis and identify Vangl2 as a negative regulator of The nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) signaling by regulating the protein stability and activation of the core transcription component p65. Mice with myeloid-specific deletion of Vangl2 (<i>Vangl2</i><sup>ΔM</sup>) are hypersusceptible to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced septic shock. Vangl2-deficient myeloid cells exhibit enhanced phosphorylation and expression of p65, therefore, promoting the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines after LPS stimulation. Mechanistically, NF-κB signaling-induced-Vangl2 recruits E3 ubiquitin ligase PDLIM2 to catalyze K63-linked ubiquitination on p65, which serves as a recognition signal for cargo receptor NDP52-mediated selective autophagic degradation. Taken together, these findings demonstrate Vangl2 as a suppressor of NF-κB-mediated inflammation and provide insights into the crosstalk between autophagy and inflammatory diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95888">TMC7 deficiency causes acrosome biogenesis defects and male infertility in mice</a></h4>

              
                Transmembrane channel-like (TMC) proteins are a highly conserved ion channel family consisting of eight members (TMC1–TMC8) in mammals. TMC1/2 are components of the mechanotransduction channel in hair cells, and mutations of TMC1/2 cause deafness in humans and mice. However, the physiological roles of other TMC proteins remain largely unknown. Here, we show that <i>Tmc7</i> is specifically expressed in the testis and that it is required for acrosome biogenesis during spermatogenesis. <i>Tmc7</i><sup>−/−</sup> mice exhibited abnormal sperm head, disorganized mitochondrial sheaths, and reduced number of elongating spermatids, similar to human oligo-astheno-teratozoospermia. We further demonstrate that TMC7 is colocalized with GM130 at the <i>cis</i>-Golgi region in round spermatids. TMC7 deficiency leads to aberrant Golgi morphology and impaired fusion of Golgi-derived vesicles to the developing acrosome. Moreover, upon loss of TMC7 intracellular ion homeostasis is impaired and ROS levels are increased, which in turn causes Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Taken together, these results suggest that TMC7 is required to maintain pH and ion homeostasis, which is needed for acrosome biogenesis. Our findings unveil a novel role for TMC7 in acrosome biogenesis during spermiogenesis.

                Burden of stroke differs by region, which could be attributed to differences in comorbid conditions and ethnicity. Genomewide variation acts as a proxy marker for ethnicity, and comorbid conditions. We present an integrated approach to understand this variation by considering prevalence and mortality rates of stroke and its comorbid risk for 204 countries from 2009 to 2019, and Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) risk variant for all these conditions. Global and regional trend analysis of rates using linear regression, correlation, and proportion analysis, signifies ethnogeographic differences. Interestingly, the comorbid conditions that act as risk drivers for stroke differed by regions, with more of metabolic risk in America and Europe, in contrast to high systolic blood pressure in Asian and African regions. GWAS risk loci of stroke and its comorbid conditions indicate distinct population stratification for each of these conditions, signifying for population-specific risk. Unique and shared genetic risk variants for stroke, and its comorbid and followed up with ethnic-specific variation can help in determining regional risk drivers for stroke. Unique ethnic-specific risk variants and their distinct patterns of linkage disequilibrium further uncover the drivers for phenotypic variation. Therefore, identifying population- and comorbidity-specific risk variants might help in defining the threshold for risk, and aid in developing population-specific prevention strategies for stroke.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97568">The bacterial quorum sensing signal 2’-aminoacetophenone rewires immune cell bioenergetics through the Ppargc1a/Esrra axis to mediate tolerance to infection</a></h4>

              
                How bacterial pathogens exploit host metabolism to promote immune tolerance and persist in infected hosts remains elusive. To achieve this, we show that <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (<i>PA</i>)<i>,</i> a recalcitrant pathogen, utilizes the quorum sensing (QS) signal 2’-aminoacetophenone (2-AA). Here, we unveil how 2-AA-driven immune tolerization causes distinct metabolic perturbations in murine macrophages’ mitochondrial respiration and bioenergetics. We present evidence indicating that these effects stem from decreased pyruvate transport into mitochondria. This reduction is attributed to decreased expression of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (<i>Mpc1</i>), which is mediated by diminished expression and nuclear presence of its transcriptional regulator, estrogen-related nuclear receptor alpha (Esrra). Consequently, Esrra exhibits weakened binding to the <i>Mpc1</i> promoter. This outcome arises from the impaired interaction between Esrra and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (Ppargc1a). Ultimately, this cascade results in diminished pyruvate influx into mitochondria and, consequently reduced ATP production in tolerized murine and human macrophages. Exogenously added ATP in infected macrophages restores the transcript levels of <i>Mpc1</i> and <i>Esrra and</i> enhances cytokine production and intracellular bacterial clearance. Consistent with the in vitro findings, murine infection studies corroborate the 2-AA-mediated long-lasting decrease in ATP and acetyl-CoA and its association with <i>PA</i> persistence, further supporting this QS signaling molecule as the culprit of the host bioenergetic alterations and <i>PA</i> persistence. These findings unveil 2-AA as a modulator of cellular immunometabolism and reveal an unprecedented mechanism of host tolerance to infection involving the Ppargc1a/Esrra axis in its influence on Mpc1/OXPHOS-dependent energy production and <i>PA</i> clearance. These paradigmatic findings pave the way for developing treatments to bolster host resilience to pathogen-induced damage. Given that QS is a common characteristic of prokaryotes, it is likely that 2-AA-like molecules with similar functions may be present in other pathogens.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91619">Conserved regulatory motifs in the juxtamembrane domain and kinase N-lobe revealed through deep mutational scanning of the MET receptor tyrosine kinase domain</a></h4>

              
                MET is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) responsible for initiating signaling pathways involved in development and wound repair. MET activation relies on ligand binding to the extracellular receptor, which prompts dimerization, intracellular phosphorylation, and recruitment of associated signaling proteins. Mutations, which are predominantly observed clinically in the intracellular juxtamembrane and kinase domains, can disrupt typical MET regulatory mechanisms. Understanding how juxtamembrane variants, such as exon 14 skipping (METΔEx14), and rare kinase domain mutations can increase signaling, often leading to cancer, remains a challenge. Here, we perform a parallel deep mutational scan (DMS) of the MET intracellular kinase domain in two fusion protein backgrounds: wild-type and METΔEx14. Our comparative approach has revealed a critical hydrophobic interaction between a juxtamembrane segment and the kinase ⍺C-helix, pointing to potential differences in regulatory mechanisms between MET and other RTKs. Additionally, we have uncovered a β5 motif that acts as a structural pivot for the kinase domain in MET and other TAM family of kinases. We also describe a number of previously unknown activating mutations, aiding the effort to annotate driver, passenger, and drug resistance mutations in the MET kinase domain.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98579">Engineering PEG10assembled endogenous virus-like particles with genetically encoded neoantigen peptides for cancer vaccination</a></h4>

              
                Tumor neoantigen peptide vaccines hold potential for boosting cancer immunotherapy, yet efficiently co-delivering peptides and adjuvants to antigen-presenting cells in vivo remains challenging. Virus-like particle (VLP), which is a kind of multiprotein structure organized as virus, can deliver therapeutic substances into cells and stimulate immune response. However, the weak targeted delivery of VLP in vivo and its susceptibility to neutralization by antibodies hinder their clinical applications. Here, we first designed a novel protein carrier using the mammalian-derived capsid protein PEG10, which can self-assemble into endogenous VLP (eVLP) with high protein loading and transfection efficiency. Then, an engineered tumor vaccine, named ePAC, was developed by packaging genetically encoded neoantigen into eVLP with further modification of CpG-ODN on its surface to serve as an adjuvant and targeting unit to dendritic cells (DCs). Significantly, ePAC can efficiently target and transport neoantigens to DCs, and promote DCs maturation to induce neoantigen-specific T cells. Moreover, in mouse orthotopic liver cancer and humanized mouse tumor models, ePAC combined with anti-TIM-3 exhibited remarkable antitumor efficacy. Overall, these results support that ePAC could be safely utilized as cancer vaccines for antitumor therapy, showing significant potential for clinical translation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95289">Limited column formation in the embryonic growth plate implies divergent growth mechanisms during pre- and postnatal bone development</a></h4>

              
                Chondrocyte columns, which are a hallmark of growth plate architecture, play a central role in bone elongation. Columns are formed by clonal expansion following rotation of the division plane, resulting in a stack of cells oriented parallel to the growth direction. In this work, we analyzed hundreds of Confetti multicolor clones in growth plates of mouse embryos using a pipeline comprising 3D imaging and algorithms for morphometric analysis. Surprisingly, analysis of the elevation angles between neighboring pairs of cells revealed that most cells did not display the typical stacking pattern associated with column formation, implying incomplete rotation of the division plane. Morphological analysis revealed that although embryonic clones were elongated, they formed clusters oriented perpendicular to the growth direction. Analysis of growth plates of postnatal mice revealed both complex columns, composed of ordered and disordered cell stacks, and small, disorganized clusters located in the outer edges. Finally, correlation between the temporal dynamics of the ratios between clusters and columns and between bone elongation and expansion suggests that clusters may promote expansion, whereas columns support elongation. Overall, our findings support the idea that modulations of division plane rotation of proliferating chondrocytes determines the formation of either clusters or columns, a multifunctional design that regulates morphogenesis throughout pre- and postnatal bone growth. Broadly, this work provides a new understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying growth plate activity and bone elongation during development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96394">Lymphoid origin of intrinsically activated plasmacytoid dendritic cells in mice</a></h4>

              
                We identified a novel mouse plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) lineage derived from the common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs) that is dependent on expression of <i>Bcl11a</i>. These CLP-derived pDCs, which we refer to as ‘B-pDCs’, have a unique gene expression profile that includes hallmark B cell genes, normally not expressed in conventional pDCs. Despite expressing most classical pDC markers such as SIGLEC-H and PDCA1, B-pDCs lack IFN-α secretion, exhibiting a distinct inflammatory profile. Functionally, B-pDCs induce T cell proliferation more robustly than canonical pDCs following Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) engagement. B-pDCs, along with another homogeneous subpopulation of myeloid-derived pDCs, display elevated levels of the cell surface receptor tyrosine kinase AXL, mirroring human AXL<sup>+</sup> transitional DCs in function and transcriptional profile. Murine B-pDCs therefore represent a phenotypically and functionally distinct CLP-derived DC lineage specialized in T cell activation and previously not described in mice.

	<p>Social withdrawal in rodents is a measure of asociality, an important negative symptom of schizophrenia. The Roman high- (RHA) and low-avoidance (RLA) rat strains have been reported to exhibit differential profiles in schizophrenia-relevant behavioral phenotypes. This investigation was focused on the study of social and non-social behavior of these two rat strains following acute administration of dizocilpine (MK801, an NMDA receptor antagonist), a pharmacological model of schizophrenia-like features used to produce asociality and hyperactivity. Also, since oxytocin (OXT) has been proposed as a natural antipsychotic and a potential adjunctive therapy for social deficits in schizophrenia, we have evaluated the effects of OXT administration and its ability to reverse the MK801-impairing effects on social and non-social behavior and MK801-induced hyperactivity. MK801 administration produced hyperlocomotion and a decrease in social and non-social behavior in both rat strains, but these drug effects were clearly more marked in RHA rats. OXT (0.04 mg/kg and 0.2 mg/kg) attenuated MK801-induced hyperlocomotion in both rat strains, although this effect was more marked in RHA rats. The MK801-decreasing effect on exploration of the &amp;amp;ldquo;social hole&amp;amp;rdquo; was moderately but significantly attenuated only in RLA rats. This study is the first to demonstrate the differential effects of OXT on MK801-induced impairments in the two Roman rat strains, providing some support for the potential therapeutic effects of OXT against schizophrenia-like symptoms, including both a positive-like symptom (i.e., MK801-induced hyperlocomotion) and a negative-like symptom (i.e., MK801 decrease in social behavior), while highlighting the importance of the genetic background (i.e., the rat strain) in influencing the effects of both MK801 and oxytocin.</p>

	<p>Background: Developing and testing methods for reliably measuring the state of consciousness of individuals is important for both basic research and clinical purposes. In recent years, several promising measures of consciousness, grounded in theoretical developments, have been proposed. However, the degrees to which these measures are affected by changes in brain activity that are not related to changes in the degree of consciousness has not been well tested. In this study, we examined whether several of these measures are modulated by the loading of cognitive resources. Methods: We recorded electroencephalography (EEG) from 12 participants in two conditions: (1) while passively attending to sensory stimuli related to the measures and (2) during increased cognitive load consisting of a demanding working memory task. We investigated whether a set of proposed objective EEG-based measures of consciousness differed between the passive and the cognitively demanding conditions. Results: The P300b event-related potential (sensitive to conscious awareness of deviance from an expected pattern in auditory stimuli) was significantly affected by concurrent performance on a working memory task, whereas various measures based on signal diversity of spontaneous and perturbed EEG were not. Conclusion: Because signal diversity-based measures of spontaneous or perturbed EEG are not sensitive to the degree of cognitive load, we suggest that these measures may be used in clinical situations where attention, sensory processing, or command following might be impaired.</p>

	<p>This research aimed to investigate the effectiveness of the Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) method on chronic subjective tinnitus. The research was planned as an observational study. The study group comprises individuals who applied to the training and research hospital in Ankara between 2019 and 2020 and were aged between 15 and 60 years old. They were identified as having tinnitus. The study samples were determined as 36 participants selected through purposeful sampling. The samples of the 36 participants included in the study. 12 were assigned to the 1st Group EMDR and Masking Group, 12 to the 2nd Group Masking and EMDR Group, and 12 to the 3rd Control Group. The study&amp;amp;rsquo;s dependent variable was the tinnitus levels of the participants, and the independent variable was EMDR and the Masking method. The dependent variable data of the study was collected with the Visual Analog Scale and Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI). EMDR and Masking methods used as independent variables in the study were conducted in eight sessions for two months. As a result of the Wilcoxon Sign test used to determine whether the EMDR Method is effective on tinnitus severity level, the difference between tinnitus severity level pretest and post-test median scores of tinnitus patients was found to be statistically significant. Our research findings show that the EMDR method reduces and improves chronic subjective tinnitus, and further studies with a larger sample size could confirm our results.</p>

	<p>Background: As one of the leading causes of disability in the world, stroke can determine a reduction of balance performance with a negative impact on daily activity and social life. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of sensor-based balance training with exergaming feedback on balance skills in chronic stroke patients. Methods: 21 individuals (11F, 57.14 &amp;amp;plusmn; 13.82 years) with a single event of ischemic stroke were randomly assigned to the sensor-based balance training group (SB-group) or the usual care balance training group (UC-group). Both groups received 10 add-on sessions with exergaming feedback (SB-group) or conventional training (UC-group). Clinical and instrumental evaluation was performed before (t0), after (t1), and after one month (t2) from intervention. Participation level was assessed using the Pittsburgh Rehabilitation Participation Scale at the end of each session. Results: The SB-group showed an improvement in postural stability (p = 0.02) when compared to the UC-group. In the evaluation of motivational level, the score was statistically higher in the SB-group with respect to the UC-group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). Conclusion: Except for the improvement in postural stability, no difference was recorded in clinical score, suggesting a comparable gain in both groups. However, patients undergoing sensor-based training exhibited a higher participation score, ultimately indicating the use of this training to improve the adherence to rehabilitation settings, especially in patients with lower compliance.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/9/ENEURO.0243-24.2024?rss=1">Presaccadic Attention Enhances and Reshapes the Contrast Sensitivity Function Differentially around the Visual Field</a></h4>

              
                <p>Contrast sensitivity (CS), which constrains human vision, decreases from fovea to periphery, from the horizontal to the vertical meridian, and from the lower vertical to the upper vertical meridian. It also depends on spatial frequency (SF), and the contrast sensitivity function (CSF) depicts this relation. To compensate for these visual constraints, we constantly make saccades and foveate on relevant objects in the scene. Already before saccade onset, presaccadic attention shifts to the saccade target and enhances perception. However, it is unknown whether and how it modulates the interplay between CS and SF, and if this effect varies around polar angle meridians. CS enhancement may result from a horizontal or vertical shift of the CSF, increase in bandwidth, or any combination. In addition, presaccadic attention could enhance CS similarly around the visual field, or it could benefit perception more at locations with poorer performance (i.e., vertical meridian). Here, we investigated these possibilities by extracting key attributes of the CSF of human observers. The results reveal that presaccadic attention (1) increases CS across SF, (2) increases the most preferred and the highest discernable SF, and (3) narrows the bandwidth. Therefore, presaccadic attention helps bridge the gap between presaccadic and postsaccadic input by increasing visibility at the saccade target. Counterintuitively, this CS enhancement was more pronounced where perception is better&mdash;along the horizontal than the vertical meridian&mdash;exacerbating polar angle asymmetries. Our results call for an investigation of the differential neural modulations underlying presaccadic perceptual changes for different saccade directions.</p>

                <p>When presented shortly after another, discrete pictures are naturally perceived as continuous. The neuronal mechanism underlying such continuous or discrete perception is not well understood. While continuous alpha oscillations are a candidate for orchestrating such neuronal mechanisms, recent evidence is mixed. In this study, we investigated the influence of prestimulus alpha oscillation on visual temporal perception. Specifically, we were interested in whether prestimulus alpha phase modulates neuronal and perceptual processes underlying discrete or continuous perception. Participants had to report the location of a missing object in a visual temporal integration task, while simultaneously MEG data were recorded. Using source reconstruction, we evaluated local phase effects by contrasting phase angle values between correctly and incorrectly integrated trials. Our results show a phase opposition cluster between &ndash;0.8 and &ndash;0.5&nbsp;s (relative to stimulus presentation) and between 6 and 20&nbsp;Hz. These momentary phase angle values were correlated with behavioral performance and event-related potential amplitude. There was no evidence that frequency defined a window of temporal integration.</p>

                Background Case detection for Tuberculosis remains low in high-burden communities. Community Health Workers (CHWs) are the first point of contact for many rural Nigerians and have been useful in active case finding. This study assessed the effectiveness of cash incentives and training on tuberculosis case detection by CHWs in six Local Government Areas in Nigeria. Materials and Methods A cluster randomized control trial with three arms was conducted. Arm A received cash incentives and training, Arm B received only training, and the control arm (C) received neither. CHWs already working in the communities participated. TB case notification and number of community outreaches held were used to assess intervention effects. Data were analyzed using STATA (v.13) and GraphPad Prism (v.8). Effect sizes were calculated using odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Associations were tested using Chi-square (χ²) tests, with significance set at P=0.05. Results Arm A had a 14.4% increase in case notification, Arm B showed a 7.4% increase, and the control arm showed a 39.7% increase from the previous year. Arms A and B had lower odds of TB case notification post-intervention, compared to the control (OR = 0.819 and 0.769, respectively), with no significant difference between them. Arm A also saw a 144.8% increase in community outreaches, compared to 46.7% in Arm B and 22.7% in Control Arm C. Arms A and B had higher odds of carrying out community outreaches post-intervention compared to the control (OR = 1.995 and 1.195, respectively), but no significant differences were found between the groups regarding community outreach. Conclusion While the interventions resulted in an increased number of community outreaches compared to the control, case notification improved more in the control arm than in the intervention arms. Nevertheless, the findings highlight the potential of combining cash incentives with training to improve TB control efforts at the community level. Further exploration of the implementation process may shed light on the observed outcomes and guide future intervention strategies.

                Background The process of preparing a scientific manuscript is intricate, encompassing several critical stages, including pre-writing, research development, drafting, peer review, editing, publication, dissemination, and access. Among these, the peer review process (PRP) stands out as a pivotal component requiring seamless collaboration among editors, reviewers, and authors. Reviewers play a crucial role in assessing the manuscript’s quality and providing constructive feedback, which authors must adeptly navigate to enhance their work and meet journal standards. This process can often appear daunting and time-consuming, as authors are required to address numerous comments and requested changes. Authors are encouraged to perceive reviewers as consultants rather than adversaries, viewing their critiques as opportunities for improvement rather than personal attacks. Methods Opinion article. Aim To equip authors with practical strategies for engaging effectively in the PRP and improving their publication acceptance rates. Results Key guidelines include thoroughly understanding and prioritizing feedback, maintaining professionalism, and systematically addressing each comment. In cases of significant disagreement or misunderstanding, authors have the option to refer the issue to the editor. Crafting a well-organized and scientific “response to reviews” along with the revised manuscript can substantially increase the likelihood of acceptance. Best practices for writing an effective response to reviews include expressing gratitude, addressing major revisions first, seeking opinions from co-authors and colleagues, and adhering strictly to journal guidelines. Emphasizing the importance of planning responses, highlighting changes in the revised manuscript, and conducting a final review ensures all corrections are properly documented. Conclusion By following these guidelines, authors can enhance their manuscripts’ quality, foster positive relationships with reviewers, and ultimately contribute to scholarly advancement.

                Background In acute settings around the globe, renal/ureteric colic remains one of the most common diagnoses for patients presenting with loin-to-groin pain. Even though management spans from medical expulsive therapies to surgical options, pain as a significant component of a patient’s presentation must be dealt with quickly, decisively, and safely, as it can be excruciating and its effects on overall health are dire. This study aimed to explore compliance with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for pain management in patients with suspected renal/ureteric colic. It includes the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), intravenous paracetamol, and opioids as first-, second-, and third-line analgesics, respectively, and does not offer antispasmodics. In the event of deviations from the standard, the aim was to put in corrective measures, followed by re-exploration of compliance with patient care. Methods This study involved a single healthcare facility with the study type being retrospective before interventions and prospective after interventions. In the first cycle, we retrieved and analysed 78 patients records whom had been suspected to have renal/ureteric colic between July and September 2022. The inclusion criteria were documented complaints of “flank/loin-to-groin pain” and diagnosis prior to performing diagnostic tests. We surveyed the first-, second-, and third-line painkillers issued, and whether an antispasmodic was given. We collected and entered data into a Microsoft Excel file and correlated it with NICE standards. Having found deviations from the standard, we conducted interventions, allowed time for clinicians to adapt, and re-explored compliance using patient case records [n=58] between February and May 2023. Results In the 1st cycle, 78 patients were suspected of having renal/ureteric colic. M: F = 1.2:1. Non-contrast computerized tomography of the kidney ureters and bladder (NC-CTKUB) confirmed 87% of patients with stones and 3% had no stones. NC-CTKUB was not performed in 9% of patients because they were young, and urinalysis showed no microscopic hematuria. One patient had discharged against medical advise before the NC-CTKUB was performed. Compliance with the NICE pain management guidelines for suspected renal/ureteric colic was full in 23% of cases but unsatisfactory in 78% of cases. In the 2nd cycle, M: F = 1.5:1, NC-CTKUB was not re-audited, as the first cycle study yielded excellent results, and our action plan resulted in an NICE pain management compliance rate of 56%. Although our interventions resulted in improvements of more than twice the initial results, work still needs to be performed. Conclusion Clinicians’ ability to correctly diagnose renal/ureteric colic is remarkable. However, the pain management compliance rate indicates room for improvement. This may be due to the limited awareness of the NICE guideline or the fact that the clinical team has an affinity for certain analgesics compared to others. We propose the need to consider select variables to existing standard guidelines to enhance compliance for improved patient care.

                Background: With the tremendous increase in the usage of smart meters for industrial/ household purposes, their implementation is considered a crucial challenge in the Internet of Things (IoT) world, leading to a demand for emerging 5G technology. In addition, a large amount of data has to be communicated by smart meters efficiently, which needs a significant enhancement in bandwidth. The power amplifier (PA) plays a major role in deciding the efficiency and bandwidth of the entire communication system. Among the various modes of PAs, a newly developed Class-J mode PA has been proven to achieve high efficiency over a wide bandwidth by maintaining linearity. Methods: This paper proposes a Class-J mode PA design methodology using a CGH40010F-GaN device that operates at a 3.5 GHz frequency to meet the requirements of 5G wireless communication technology for the replacement of existing 4G/LTE technology used for advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) in smart grids. This research's main objective is to design the proper matching networks (M.Ns) to achieve Class-J mode operation that satisfies the bandwidth requirements of 5G smart grid applications. With the target impedances obtained using the load-pull simulation, lumped element matching networks are analyzed and designed in 3 ways using the ADS EDA tool. Results: The simulation results reveal that the proposed Class-J PA provides a maximum drain efficiency (D.E) of 82%, power added efficiency (PAE) of 67% with 13 dB small-signal gain at 3.5 GHz, and output power of 40 dBm (41.4 dBm peak) with a power gain of approximately 7 dB over a bandwidth of approximately 400 MHz with a 28 V power supply into a 50 Ω load. Conclusion: The efficiency and bandwidth of the proposed Class-J PA can be enhanced further by fine-tuning the matching network design to make it more suitable for 5G smart meter/grid applications.

                Background Sudden and unexpected deaths are increasing drastically. The main cause of sudden death is cardiovascular disease, out of which coronary artery disease predominates forming 80% of the cases. Most of the time, detecting early changes in myocardial infarction during the autopsy is challenging since gross infarct changes do not appear until after 24 to 48 hours of myocardial ischemia injury. So, the aim of this study was to compare two test to detect early changes of Myocardial Infarction one by using Triphenyl Tetrazolium Chloride (TTC) staining of the myocardial tissue, during autopsy and other by histopathological examination. Methods The sample size of 60 hearts taken from all the sudden deaths cases brought to Mortuary with suspected cause of death due to cardiac origin. The heart was obtained from the deceased by standard post-mortem technique. Serial full-thickness transverse sections of the heart were taken at 2 cm intervals from the apex to the atrioventricular groove. All the serial slices of heart are taken for histochemical staining and TTC staining. Results In histopathological examination 34 hearts were diagnosed with myocardial infarction and 26 hearts reported non myocardial infarction. With TTC 40 hearts remained unstained suggestive of myocardial infarction and 20 hearts were stained suggestive of non-infarcted hearts. TTC staining in our study shows an accuracy of 88.33%. Conclusion The result of this study shows that the Triphenyl Tetrazolium Chloride test, a histochemical staining technique of heart, is reliable approach for forensic pathologists to diagnose early myocardial infarction during the post-mortem examination.

                <p>by Constance Creux, Farida Zehraoui, François Radvanyi, Fariza Tahi</p>

The involvement of non-coding RNAs in biological processes and diseases has made the exploration of their functions crucial. Most non-coding RNAs have yet to be studied, creating the need for methods that can rapidly classify large sets of non-coding RNAs into functional groups, or classes. In recent years, the success of deep learning in various domains led to its application to non-coding RNA classification. Multiple novel architectures have been developed, but these advancements are not covered by current literature reviews. We present an exhaustive comparison of the different methods proposed in the state-of-the-art and describe their associated datasets. Moreover, the literature lacks objective benchmarks. We perform experiments to fairly evaluate the performance of various tools for non-coding RNA classification on popular datasets. The robustness of methods to non-functional sequences and sequence boundary noise is explored. We also measure computation time and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. With regard to these results, we assess the relevance of the different architectural choices and provide recommendations to consider in future methods.

Cyanobacteria hold great potential to revolutionize conventional industries and farming practices with their light-driven chemical production. To fully exploit their photosynthetic capacity and enhance product yield, it is crucial to investigate their intricate interplay with the environment including the light intensity and spectrum. Mathematical models provide valuable insights for optimizing strategies in this pursuit. In this study, we present an ordinary differential equation-based model for the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 to assess its performance under various light sources, including monochromatic light. Our model can reproduce a variety of physiologically measured quantities, e.g. experimentally reported partitioning of electrons through four main pathways, O<sub>2</sub> evolution, and the rate of carbon fixation for ambient and saturated CO<sub>2</sub>. By capturing the interactions between different components of a photosynthetic system, our model helps in understanding the underlying mechanisms driving system behavior. Our model qualitatively reproduces fluorescence emitted under various light regimes, replicating Pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) fluorometry experiments with saturating pulses. Using our model, we test four hypothesized mechanisms of cyanobacterial state transitions for ensemble of parameter sets and found no physiological benefit of a model assuming phycobilisome detachment. Moreover, we evaluate metabolic control for biotechnological production under diverse light colors and irradiances. We suggest gene targets for overexpression under different illuminations to increase the yield. By offering a comprehensive computational model of cyanobacterial photosynthesis, our work enhances the basic understanding of light-dependent cyanobacterial behavior and sets the first wavelength-dependent framework to systematically test their producing capacity for biocatalysis.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012427">Calibrating dimension reduction hyperparameters in the presence of noise</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Justin Lin, Julia Fukuyama</p>

The goal of dimension reduction tools is to construct a low-dimensional representation of high-dimensional data. These tools are employed for a variety of reasons such as noise reduction, visualization, and to lower computational costs. However, there is a fundamental issue that is discussed in other modeling problems that is often overlooked in dimension reduction—overfitting. In the context of other modeling problems, techniques such as feature-selection, cross-validation, and regularization are employed to combat overfitting, but rarely are such precautions taken when applying dimension reduction. Prior applications of the two most popular non-linear dimension reduction methods, t-SNE and UMAP, fail to acknowledge data as a combination of signal and noise when assessing performance. These methods are typically calibrated to capture the entirety of the data, not just the signal. In this paper, we demonstrate the importance of acknowledging noise when calibrating hyperparameters and present a framework that enables users to do so. We use this framework to explore the role hyperparameter calibration plays in overfitting the data when applying t-SNE and UMAP. More specifically, we show previously recommended values for perplexity and n_neighbors are too small and overfit the noise. We also provide a workflow others may use to calibrate hyperparameters in the presence of noise.

Background <p>In the modern era, the growth of scientific literature presents a daunting challenge for researchers to keep informed of advancements across multiple disciplines.</p> Objective <p>We apply natural language processing (NLP) and embedding learning concepts to design PubDigest, a tool that combs PubMed literature, aiming to pinpoint potential drugs that could be repurposed.</p> Methods <p>Using NLP, especially term associations through word embeddings, we explored unrecognized relationships between drugs and diseases. To illustrate the utility of PubDigest, we focused on chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), a rare disease with an overall limited number of scientific publications.</p> Results <p>Our literature analysis identified key clinical features linked to CTEPH by applying term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) scoring, a technique measuring a term’s significance in a text corpus. This allowed us to map related diseases. One standout was venous thrombosis (VT), which showed strong semantic links with CTEPH. Looking deeper, we discovered potential repurposing candidates for CTEPH through large-scale neural network-based contextualization of literature and predictive modeling on both the CTEPH and the VT literature corpora to find novel, yet unrecognized associations between the two diseases. Alongside the anti-thrombotic agent caplacizumab, benzofuran derivatives were an intriguing find. In particular, the benzofuran derivative amiodarone displayed potential anti-thrombotic properties in the literature. Our <i>in vitro</i> tests confirmed amiodarone’s ability to reduce platelet aggregation significantly by 68% (p = 0.02). However, real-world clinical data indicated that CTEPH patients receiving amiodarone treatment faced a significant 15.9% higher mortality risk (p<0.001).</p> Conclusions <p>While NLP offers an innovative approach to interpreting scientific literature, especially for drug repurposing, it is crucial to combine it with complementary methods like <i>in vitro</i> testing and real-world evidence. Our exploration with benzofuran derivatives and CTEPH underscores this point. Thus, blending NLP with hands-on experiments and real-world clinical data can pave the way for faster and safer drug repurposing approaches, especially for rare diseases like CTEPH.</p>

                <p>by Seema B. Plaisier, Danielle O. Alarid, Joelle A. Denning, Sara E. Brownell, Kenneth H. Buetow, Katelyn M. Cooper, Melissa A. Wilson</p>

As genomics technologies advance, there is a growing demand for computational biologists trained for genomics analysis but instructors face significant hurdles in providing formal training in computer programming, statistics, and genomics to biology students. Fully online learners represent a significant and growing community that can contribute to meet this need, but they are frequently excluded from valuable research opportunities which mostly do not offer the flexibility they need. To address these opportunity gaps, we developed an asynchronous course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) for computational genomics specifically for fully online biology students. We generated custom learning materials and leveraged remotely accessible computational tools to address 2 novel research questions over 2 iterations of the genomics CURE, one testing bioinformatics approaches and one mining cancer genomics data. Here, we present how the instructional team distributed analysis needed to address these questions between students over a 7.5-week CURE and provided concurrent training in biology and statistics, computer programming, and professional development. Scores from identical learning assessments administered before and after completion of each CURE showed significant learning gains across biology and coding course objectives. Open-response progress reports were submitted weekly and identified self-reported adaptive coping strategies for challenges encountered throughout the course. Progress reports identified problems that could be resolved through collaboration with instructors and peers via messaging platforms and virtual meetings. We implemented asynchronous communication using the Slack messaging platform and an asynchronous journal club where students discussed relevant publications using the Perusall social annotation platform. The online genomics CURE resulted in unanticipated positive outcomes, including students voluntarily discussing plans to continue research after the course. These outcomes underscore the effectiveness of this genomics CURE for scientific training, recruitment and student-mentor relationships, and student successes. Asynchronous genomics CUREs can contribute to a more skilled, diverse, and inclusive workforce for the advancement of biomedical science.

                <p>by Peter S. Back, Vignesh Senthilkumar, Charles P. Choi, Justin J. Quan, Qing Lou, Anne K. Snyder, Andrew M. Ly, Justin G. Lau, Z. Hong Zhou, Gary E. Ward, Peter J. Bradley</p>

Apicomplexan parasites possess several specialized structures to invade their host cells and replicate successfully. One of these is the inner membrane complex (IMC), a peripheral membrane-cytoskeletal system underneath the plasma membrane. It is composed of a series of flattened, membrane-bound vesicles and a cytoskeletal subpellicular network (SPN) comprised of intermediate filament-like proteins called alveolins. While the alveolin proteins are conserved throughout the Apicomplexa and the broader Alveolata, their precise functions and interactions remain poorly understood. Here, we describe the function of one of these alveolin proteins in <i>Toxoplasma</i>, IMC6. Disruption of IMC6 resulted in striking morphological defects that led to aberrant invasion and replication but surprisingly minor effects on motility. Deletion analyses revealed that the alveolin domain alone is largely sufficient to restore localization and partially sufficient for function. As this highlights the importance of the IMC6 alveolin domain, we implemented unnatural amino acid photoreactive crosslinking to the alveolin domain and identified multiple binding interfaces between IMC6 and 2 other cytoskeletal IMC proteins—IMC3 and ILP1. This provides direct evidence of protein–protein interactions in the alveolin domain and supports the long-held hypothesis that the alveolin domain is responsible for filament formation. Collectively, our study features the conserved alveolin proteins as critical components that maintain the parasite’s structural integrity and highlights the alveolin domain as a key mediator of SPN architecture.

Transitions between the fed and fasted state are common in mammals. The liver orchestrates adaptive responses to feeding/fasting by transcriptionally regulating metabolic pathways of energy usage and storage. Transcriptional and enhancer dynamics following cessation of fasting (refeeding) have not been explored. We examined the transcriptional and chromatin events occurring upon refeeding in mice, including kinetic behavior and molecular drivers. We found that the refeeding response is temporally organized with the early response focused on ramping up protein translation while the later stages of refeeding drive a bifurcated lipid synthesis program. While both the cholesterol biosynthesis and lipogenesis pathways were inhibited during fasting, most cholesterol biosynthesis genes returned to their basal levels upon refeeding while most lipogenesis genes markedly overshoot above pre-fasting levels. Gene knockout, enhancer dynamics, and ChIP-seq analyses revealed that lipogenic gene overshoot is dictated by LXRα. These findings from unbiased analyses unravel the mechanism behind the long-known phenomenon of refeeding fat overshoot.

                Background Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that has a significant impact on quality of life. The immune response and allergy symptoms in AD are triggered by the recognition of specific allergens by IgE antibodies. Cross-reactivity can lead to auto-IgE responses, potentially worsening AD symptoms. Our research aimed to enhance our understanding of allergenic sources, including A. fumigatus, and their role in AD. We focused on molecular mimicry between human AQP3 and A. fumigatus aquaporin. Methods In our in-silico analysis, we compared the amino acid sequences of human aquaporin 3 (AQP3) and A. fumigatus aquaporin with 25 aquaporins from various allergenic sources, sourced from the UniProt and NCBI databases. Phylogenetic relationship analysis and homology-based modeling were conducted. We identified conserved antigenic regions located within the 3D structures. Results The global identity levels among the studied aquaporins averaged 32.6%. One antigenic site exhibited a remarkable local region, with a conserved identity of 71.4%. We categorized the aquaporins into five monophyletic clades (A–E), with group B showing the highest identity (95%), including six mammalian aquaporins, including AQP3. When comparing A. fumigatus aquaporins, the highest identity was observed with Malassezia sympodialis at 35%. Both human and A. fumigatus aquaporins have three linear and three discontinuous epitopes. Conclusions We identified potential linear and conformational epitopes of AQP3, indicating a possible molecular mimicry between humans and A. fumigatus aquaporins. This suggests autoreactivity and potential cross-reactivity, although further validation using in vitro and in vivo experiments is required.

                We present the results of the human genomic small variant calling benchmarking initiative of the German Research Foundation (DFG) funded Next Generation Sequencing Competence Network (NGS-CN) and the German Human Genome-Phenome Archive (GHGA). In this effort, we developed NCBench, a continuous benchmarking platform for the evaluation of small genomic variant callsets in terms of recall, precision, and false positive/negative error patterns. NCBench is implemented as a continuously re-evaluated open-source repository. We show that it is possible to entirely rely on public free infrastructure (Github, Github Actions, Zenodo) in combination with established open-source tools. NCBench is agnostic of the used dataset and can evaluate an arbitrary number of given callsets, while reporting the results in a visual and interactive way. We used NCBench to evaluate over 40 callsets generated by various variant calling pipelines available in the participating groups that were run on three exome datasets from different enrichment kits and at different coverages. While all pipelines achieve high overall quality, subtle systematic differences between callers and datasets exist and are made apparent by NCBench.These insights are useful to improve existing pipelines and develop new workflows. NCBench is meant to be open for the contribution of any given callset. Most importantly, for authors, it will enable the omission of repeated re-implementation of paper-specific variant calling benchmarks for the publication of new tools or pipelines, while readers will benefit from being able to (continuously) observe the performance of tools and pipelines at the time of reading instead of at the time of writing.

                Project planning and scheduling are essential parts of project management. While project planning and scheduling tools are already available to support traditional project management approaches, flexible project management approaches, such as agile, extreme, and hybrid project planning, are less well supported by software tools, especially freely available software packages. To our knowledge, no existing R package for project planning and scheduling can support flexible projects. This paper aims to fill this gap by introducing and describing the R package mfpp for matrix-based flexible project planning/scheduling. This package includes a comprehensive set of tools for project managers to schedule both traditional and flexible project plans. The use of the package is illustrated through examples.

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We compiled a series of patients with SCA27B, recruited from 5 academic centers across the United States. Clinical manifestations and patient demographics were collected retrospectively from clinical records in an unblinded approach using a standardized form. Post-mortem analysis was done on 4 brains of patients with genetically confirmed SCA27B.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In our cohort of 102 patients with SCA27B, we found that SCA27B was a late-onset (57 ± 12.5 years) slowly progressive ataxia with an episodic component in 51% of patients. Balance and gait impairment were almost always present at disease onset. The principal finding on post-mortem examination of 4 brain specimens was loss of Purkinje neurons that was most severe in the vermis most particularly in the anterior vermis. Similar to European populations, a high percent of patients 21/28 (75%) reported a positive treatment response with 4-aminopyridine.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our study further estimates prevalence and further expands the clinical, imaging and pathological features of SCA27B, while looking at treatment response, disease progression, and survival in patients with this disease. Testing for SCA27B should be considered in all undiagnosed ataxia patients, especially those with episodic onset. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1049/v1?src=rss">A guide to selecting high-performing antibodies for STING1 (Uniprot ID: Q86WV6) for use in western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                STING1 is an immune adaptor protein which promotes innate immune defense mechanisms against pathogens. Its role in modulating inflammation links STING1 to various pathologic conditions, positioning it as a key target for therapeutic interventions aimed at regulating immune responses. To advance our understanding of STING1-associated diseases, it is essential to make high-performing antibodies readily accessible to the scientific community. This study aims to improve reliability of STING1 research as we have characterized sixteen STING1 commercial antibodies for western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

                Migraine is highly prevalent and debilitating. The persistent headaches in this condition are thought to arise from the activation and sensitization of the trigeminovascular pathway. Both clinical and animal model studies have suggested that neuroimmune interactions contribute to the pathophysiology of migraine headache. In this review, we first summarize the findings from human studies implicating the dysregulation of the immune system in migraine, including genetic analyses, measurement of circulatory factors, and neuroimaging data. We next discuss recent advances from rodent studies aimed at elucidating the neuroimmune interactions that manifest at various levels of the trigeminovascular pathway and lead to the recruitment of innate and adaptive immune cells as well as immunocompetent glial cells. These cells reciprocally modulate neuronal activity via multiple pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators, thereby regulating peripheral and central sensitization. Throughout the discussions, we highlight the potential clinical and translational implications of the findings.

                Why do we “choke under pressure,” underperforming when we want to succeed the most? Smoulder et al. identify a neural basis of this paradoxical phenomenon in the motor cortex, where greater rewards influence movement preparatory neural states to be closer to, then farther from, an optimal zone for upcoming movements.

This circuit ensures robust force transmission from the actin cytoskeleton to the membrane and may represent a universal mechanism to synergize catch bonds and protein condensates at the membrane.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95412">Altered firing output of VIP interneurons and early dysfunctions in CA1 hippocampal circuits in the 3xTg mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer’s disease (AD) leads to progressive memory decline, and alterations in hippocampal function are among the earliest pathological features observed in human and animal studies. GABAergic interneurons (INs) within the hippocampus coordinate network activity, among which type 3 interneuron-specific (I-S3) cells expressing vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and calretinin play a crucial role. These cells provide primarily disinhibition to principal excitatory cells (PCs) in the hippocampal CA1 region, regulating incoming inputs and memory formation. However, it remains unclear whether AD pathology induces changes in the activity of I-S3 cells, impacting the hippocampal network motifs. Here, using young adult 3xTg-AD mice, we found that while the density and morphology of I-S3 cells remain unaffected, there were significant changes in their firing output. Specifically, I-S3 cells displayed elongated action potentials and decreased firing rates, which was associated with a reduced inhibition of CA1 INs and their higher recruitment during spatial decision-making and object exploration tasks. Furthermore, the activation of CA1 PCs was also impacted, signifying early disruptions in CA1 network functionality. These findings suggest that altered firing patterns of I-S3 cells might initiate early-stage dysfunction in hippocampal CA1 circuits, potentially influencing the progression of AD pathology.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95549">Fine-scale tracking reveals visual field use for predator detection and escape in collective foraging of pigeon flocks</a></h4>

              
                During collective vigilance, it is commonly assumed that individual animals compromise their feeding time to be vigilant against predators, benefiting the entire group. One notable issue with this assumption concerns the unclear nature of predator ‘detection’, particularly in terms of vision. It remains uncertain how a vigilant individual utilizes its high-acuity vision (such as the fovea) to detect a predator cue and subsequently guide individual and collective escape responses. Using fine-scale motion-capture technologies, we tracked the head and body orientations of pigeons (hence reconstructed their visual fields and foveal projections) foraging in a flock during simulated predator attacks. Pigeons used their fovea to inspect predator cues. Earlier foveation on a predator cue was linked to preceding behaviors related to vigilance and feeding, such as head-up or down positions, head-scanning, and food-pecking. Moreover, earlier foveation predicted earlier evasion flights at both the individual and collective levels. However, we also found that relatively long delay between their foveation and escape responses in individuals obscured the relationship between these two responses. While our results largely support the existing assumptions about vigilance, they also underscore the importance of considering vision and addressing the disparity between detection and escape responses in future research.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89470">Improved inference of population histories by integrating genomic and epigenomic data</a></h4>

              
                With the availability of high-quality full genome polymorphism (SNPs) data, it becomes feasible to study the past demographic and selective history of populations in exquisite detail. However, such inferences still suffer from a lack of statistical resolution for recent, for example bottlenecks, events, and/or for populations with small nucleotide diversity. Additional heritable (epi)genetic markers, such as indels, transposable elements, microsatellites, or cytosine methylation, may provide further, yet untapped, information on the recent past population history. We extend the Sequential Markovian Coalescent (SMC) framework to jointly use SNPs and other hyper-mutable markers. We are able to (1) improve the accuracy of demographic inference in recent times, (2) uncover past demographic events hidden to SNP-based inference methods, and (3) infer the hyper-mutable marker mutation rates under a finite site model. As a proof of principle, we focus on demographic inference in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> using DNA methylation diversity data from 10 European natural accessions. We demonstrate that segregating single methylated polymorphisms (SMPs) satisfy the modeling assumptions of the SMC framework, while differentially methylated regions (DMRs) are not suitable as their length exceeds that of the genomic distance between two recombination events. Combining SNPs and SMPs while accounting for site- and region-level epimutation processes, we provide new estimates of the glacial age bottleneck and post-glacial population expansion of the European <i>A. thaliana</i> population. Our SMC framework readily accounts for a wide range of heritable genomic markers, thus paving the way for next-generation inference of evolutionary history by combining information from several genetic and epigenetic markers.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94302">S-acylation of NLRP3 provides a nigericin sensitive gating mechanism that controls access to the Golgi</a></h4>

              
                NLRP3 is an inflammasome seeding pattern recognition receptor activated in response to multiple danger signals which perturb intracellular homeostasis. Electrostatic interactions between the NLRP3 polybasic (PB) region and negatively charged lipids on the trans-Golgi network (TGN) have been proposed to recruit NLRP3 to the TGN. In this study, we demonstrate that membrane association of NLRP3 is critically dependant on S-acylation of a highly conserved cysteine residue (Cys-130), which traps NLRP3 in a dynamic S-acylation cycle at the Golgi, and a series of hydrophobic residues preceding Cys-130 which act in conjunction with the PB region to facilitate Cys-130 dependent Golgi enrichment. Due to segregation from Golgi localised thioesterase enzymes caused by a nigericin induced breakdown in Golgi organisation and function, NLRP3 becomes immobilised on the Golgi through reduced de-acylation of its Cys-130 lipid anchor, suggesting that disruptions in Golgi homeostasis are conveyed to NLRP3 through its acylation state. Thus, our work defines a nigericin sensitive S-acylation cycle that gates access of NLRP3 to the Golgi.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98181">Upregulated expression of ubiquitin ligase TRIM21 promotes PKM2 nuclear translocation and astrocyte activation in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis</a></h4>

              
                Reactive astrocytes play critical roles in the occurrence of various neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Activation of astrocytes is often accompanied by a glycolysis-dominant metabolic switch. However, the role and molecular mechanism of metabolic reprogramming in activation of astrocytes have not been clarified. Here, we found that PKM2, a rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, displayed nuclear translocation in astrocytes of EAE (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis) mice, an animal model of multiple sclerosis. Prevention of PKM2 nuclear import by DASA-58 significantly reduced the activation of mice primary astrocytes, which was observed by decreased proliferation, glycolysis and secretion of inflammatory cytokines. Most importantly, we identified the ubiquitination-mediated regulation of PKM2 nuclear import by ubiquitin ligase TRIM21. TRIM21 interacted with PKM2, promoted its nuclear translocation and stimulated its nuclear activity to phosphorylate STAT3, NF-κB and interact with c-myc. Further single-cell RNA sequencing and immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that TRIM21 expression was upregulated in astrocytes of EAE. TRIM21 overexpressing in mice primary astrocytes enhanced PKM2-dependent glycolysis and proliferation, which could be reversed by DASA-58. Moreover, intracerebroventricular injection of a lentiviral vector to knockdown TRIM21 in astrocytes or intraperitoneal injection of TEPP-46, which inhibit the nuclear translocation of PKM2, effectively decreased disease severity, CNS inflammation and demyelination in EAE. Collectively, our study provides novel insights into the pathological function of nuclear glycolytic enzyme PKM2 and ubiquitination-mediated regulatory mechanism that are involved in astrocyte activation. Targeting this axis may be a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of astrocyte-involved neurological disease.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96907">Dysfunction of Calcyphosine-Like gene impairs retinal angiogenesis through the MYC axis and is associated with familial exudative vitreoretinopathy</a></h4>

              
                Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR) is a severe genetic disorder characterized by incomplete vascularization of the peripheral retina and associated symptoms that can lead to vision loss. However, the underlying genetic causes of approximately 50% of FEVR cases remain unknown. Here, we report two heterozygous variants in calcyphosine-like gene (<i>CAPSL</i>) that is associated with FEVR. Both variants exhibited compromised CAPSL protein expression. Vascular endothelial cell (EC)-specific inactivation of <i>Capsl</i> resulted in delayed radial/vertical vascular progression, compromised endothelial proliferation/migration, recapitulating the human FEVR phenotypes. <i>CAPSL</i>-depleted human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRECs) exhibited impaired tube formation, decreased cell proliferation, disrupted cell polarity establishment, and filopodia/lamellipodia formation, as well as disrupted collective cell migration. Transcriptomic and proteomic profiling revealed that <i>CAPSL</i> abolition inhibited the MYC signaling axis, in which the expression of core MYC targeted genes were profoundly decreased. Furthermore, a combined analysis of <i>CAPSL</i>-depleted HRECs and <i>c-MYC</i>-depleted human umbilical vein endothelial cells uncovered similar transcription patterns. Collectively, this study reports a novel FEVR-associated candidate gene, <i>CAPSL</i>, which provides valuable information for genetic counseling of FEVR. This study also reveals that compromised CAPSL function may cause FEVR through MYC axis, shedding light on the potential involvement of MYC signaling in the pathogenesis of FEVR.

	<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system with unknown etiology, resulting in various impairments that necessitate continuous rehabilitation to enhance functionality, quality of life, and motor function, including through Virtual Reality (VR) therapy. Comparing tasks in virtual environments and their potential skill transfer to real-world settings could aid in optimizing treatment programs to improve motor performance in individuals with MS. This study aimed to determine whether practicing acquisition and retention phases using two distinct interfaces (concrete&amp;amp;mdash;Touch Screen or abstract&amp;amp;mdash;Kinect system) affects performance in a subsequent task using a different interface (transfer phase). A randomized clinical trial was conducted with 56 volunteers with MS and 41 controls. Participants engaged in a computer game where they burst as many bubbles as possible within 10 s per attempt. After the acquisition and retention phases, all participants switched interfaces (e.g., those using Kinect switched to Touchscreen and vice versa). Significant performance improvements were observed in both groups during the acquisition phase, which were maintained in the retention phase. Although the abstract interface was more challenging for both groups, only the MS group that practiced with the abstract interface successfully transferred their improvements to the concrete interface. Thus, despite the increased difficulty of the abstract task during practice, it led to better performance transfer when required to complete a subsequent concrete task, suggesting that abstract devices may be beneficial in clinical practice for improving motor function in people with MS.</p>

                <p>The neural mechanisms of motor planning have been extensively studied in rodents. Preparatory activity in the frontal cortex predicts upcoming choice, but limitations of typical tasks have made it challenging to determine whether the spatial information is in a self-centered direction reference frame or a world-centered position reference frame. Here, we trained male rats to make delayed visually guided orienting movements to six different directions, with four different target positions for each direction, which allowed us to disentangle direction versus position tuning in neural activity. We recorded single unit activity from the rat frontal orienting field (FOF) in the secondary motor cortex, a region involved in planning orienting movements. Population analyses revealed that the FOF encodes two separate 2D maps of space. First, a 2D map of the planned and ongoing movement in a self-centered direction reference frame. Second, a 2D map of the animal&rsquo;s current position on the port wall in a world-centered reference frame. Thus, preparatory activity in the FOF represents self-centered upcoming movement directions, but FOF neurons multiplex both self- and world-reference frame variables at the level of single neurons. Neural network model comparison supports the view that despite the presence of world-centered representations, the FOF receives the target information as self-centered input and generates self-centered planning signals.</p>

                <p>The act of recalling memories can paradoxically lead to the forgetting of other associated memories, a phenomenon known as retrieval-induced forgetting (RIF).

In this study, we examined whether stimulating the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) with transcranial direct current stimulation modulates RIF and investigated the associated electrophysiological correlates. In a randomized study, 50 participants (27 males and 23 females) received either real or sham stimulation before performing retrieval practice on target memories. After retrieval practice, a final memory test to assess RIF was administered. We found that stimulation selectively increased the retrieval accuracy of competing memories, thereby decreasing RIF, while the retrieval accuracy of target memories remained unchanged. The reduction in RIF was associated with a more pronounced beta desynchronization within the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (left-DLPFC), in an early time window (&lt;500&nbsp;ms) after cue onset during retrieval practice. This led to a stronger beta desynchronization within the parietal cortex in a later time window, an established marker for successful memory retrieval. Together, our results establish the causal involvement of the mPFC in actively suppressing competing memories and demonstrate that while forgetting arises as a consequence of retrieving specific memories, these two processes are functionally independent. Our findings suggest that stimulation potentially disrupted inhibitory control processes, as evidenced by reduced RIF and stronger beta desynchronization in fronto-parietal brain regions during memory retrieval, although further research is needed to elucidate the specific mechanisms underlying this effect.</p>
