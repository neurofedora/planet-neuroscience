                <p>Neurodevelopmental disorders disproportionately affect males compared with females. The biological mechanisms of this male susceptibility or female protection have not been identified. There is evidence that fetal/neonatal gonadal hormones, which play a pivotal role in many aspects of development, may contribute. Here, we investigate the effects of excess testosterone (T) during a critical period of sex-specific brain organization on social approach and fear learning behaviors in C57BL/6J wild-type mice. Male, but not female, mice treated with T on the day of birth (Postnatal Day 0; PN0) exhibited decreased social approach as juveniles and decreased contextual fear memory as adults, compared with vehicle (veh)-treated controls. These deficits were not driven by anxiety-like behavior or changes in locomotion or body weight. Mice treated with the same dose of T on PN18, which is outside of the critical period of brain masculinization, did not demonstrate impairments compared with the veh group. These findings indicate that excess T during a critical period of early development, but not shortly after, induces long-term deficits relevant to the male sex bias in neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

                <p>by Shugang Zhang, Yuntong Li, Wenjian Ma, Qing Cai, Jing Qin, Xiangpeng Bi, Huasen Jiang, Xiaoyu Huang, Zhiqiang Wei</p>

Understanding the functions of proteins is of great importance for deciphering the mechanisms of life activities. To date, there have been over 200 million known proteins, but only 0.2% of them have well-annotated functional terms. By measuring the contacts among residues, proteins can be described as graphs so that the graph leaning approaches can be applied to learn protein representations. However, existing graph-based methods put efforts in enriching the residue node information and did not fully exploit the edge information, which leads to suboptimal representations considering the strong association of residue contacts to protein structures and to the functions. In this article, we propose SuperEdgeGO, which introduces the supervision of edges in protein graphs to learn a better graph representation for protein function prediction. Different from common graph convolution methods that uses edge information in a plain or unsupervised way, we introduce a <i>supervised</i> attention to encode the residue contacts <i>explicitly</i> into the protein representation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SuperEdgeGO achieves state-of-the-art performance on all three categories of protein functions. Additional ablation analysis further proves the effectiveness of the devised edge supervision strategy. The implementation of edge supervision in SuperEdgeGO resulted in enhanced graph representations for protein function prediction, as demonstrated by its superior performance across all the evaluated categories. This superior performance was confirmed through ablation analysis, which validated the effectiveness of the edge supervision strategy. This strategy has a broad application prospect in the study of protein function and related fields.

                <p>by Viktoria Zemliak, Gordon Pipa, Pascal Nieters</p>

Familiarity memory enables recognition of previously encountered inputs as familiar without recalling detailed stimuli information, which supports adaptive behavior across various timescales. We present a spiking neural network model with lateral connectivity shaped by unsupervised spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) that encodes familiarity via local plasticity events. We show that familiarity can be decoded from network activity using both frequency (spike count) and temporal (spike synchrony) characteristics of spike trains. Temporal coding demonstrates enhanced performance under sparse input conditions, consistent with the principles of sparse coding observed in the brain. We also show how connectivity structure supports each decoding strategy, revealing different plasticity regimes. Our approach outperforms LSTM in temporal generalizability on the continual familiarity detection task, with input stimuli being naturally encoded in the recurrent connectivity without a separate training stage.

                <p>by Gaurav Mendiratta, Kodye Abbott, Yao-Cheng Li, Jingting Yu, Peter Carlip, Melinda Tong, Jianfeng Huang, Maxim N. Shokhirev, Thomas McFall, Geoffrey M. Wahl, Edward C. Stites</p>

RAF inhibitor “paradoxical activation” (PA) is a phenomenon where RAF kinase inhibitors increase RAF kinase signaling. Through mathematical modeling and experimental data analysis, we recently demonstrated that the combination of conformational autoinhibition (CA) with the disruption of CA by RAF inhibitors plays an important role in PA. 14-3-3 proteins are known to modulate RAF CA and RAF dimerization. We here extend our mathematical model to include both roles of 14-3-3 proteins, and we derive rigorous analytical expressions of RAF signal regulation as modulated by 14-3-3 proteins. We then use the model to investigate how 14-3-3 proteins may modulate PA. We mathematically show 14-3-3 protein stabilization of the autoinhibited form of RAF should potentiate PA, while 14-3-3 protein stabilization of the active RAF dimer should reduce PA. Our analysis suggests that the net-effect will often be a potentiation of PA, and that 14-3-3 proteins may be capable of inducing PA for RAF inhibitors that normally show little to no PA. We test model-based insights experimentally with two different approaches: forced increases in 14-3-3 expression (which we find amplifies PA) and evolved resistance assays (which suggest increased 14-3-3 expression may contribute to resistance to RAF inhibitors). Overall, this work supports a role for 14-3-3 in modulating RAF-inhibitor mediated paradoxical activation.

                Kines et al. find the pro-tumorigenic protein SEMA7A is upregulated in the aged environment and may be a downstream target of TGF-β signaling. The aged environment accelerates tumor growth and a mesenchymal phenotype, and this depends on SEMA7A host expression. SEMA7A overexpression accelerates metastasis, which is attenuated by inhibiting SEMA7A.

                Using the epitope maps of 121 DENV antibodies, Grinyo-Escuer et al. identify seven key residues driving DENV-ZIKV cross-reactivity. They engineer a ZIKV E protein variant, “ZIKVm10,” that minimizes DENV cross-reactivity, reduces ADE risk, and protects against lethal ZIKV challenge in mice, offering a pathway for safer, more targeted ZIKV vaccines.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104918">Trained immunity in the lung</a></h4>

              
                Trained immunity represents a recent concept that elucidates the long-term reprogramming of innate immune cells, enabling them to adapt and respond more effectively to subsequent encounters with diverse pathogens. Initially recognized through the Bacillus Calmette–Guérin vaccine, <i>Candida albicans</i> infection, and β-glucan administration, this phenomenon challenges the traditional view that immune memory is exclusive to the adaptive immune system. Trained immunity is characterized by epigenetic and metabolic modifications in innate immune cells that facilitate enhanced responses to infections through mechanisms like chromatin remodeling and altered gene expression. This review focuses on the implications of trained immunity within the lung environment, which is constantly exposed to a plethora of pathogens and environmental irritants. We discuss the roles of various immune cell types, including alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells, in mediating trained immunity and how these adaptations may influence pulmonary insults and disease. Furthermore, we highlight the potential for leveraging trained immunity to enhance vaccine efficacy and develop novel therapeutic strategies for immune-related lung conditions. As research progresses, understanding trained immunity in the lung could pave the way for innovative interventions that improve lung health and resilience against infections.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98843">Srs2 binding to proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and its sumoylation contribute to replication protein A (RPA) antagonism during the DNA damage response</a></h4>

              
                Activation of the DNA damage checkpoint upon genotoxin treatment induces a multitude of cellular changes to cope with genome stress. After prolonged genotoxin treatment, the checkpoint can be downregulated to allow cell cycle and growth resumption. In yeast, downregulation of the DNA damage checkpoint requires the Srs2 DNA helicase, which removes the ssDNA binding complex replication protein A (RPA) and the associated Mec1 checkpoint kinase from DNA, thus dampening Mec1-mediated checkpoint. However, it is unclear whether the ‘anti-checkpoint’ role of Srs2 is temporally and spatially regulated to allow timely checkpoint termination while preventing superfluous RPA removal. Here we address this question by examining regulatory elements of Srs2, such as its phosphorylation, sumoylation, and protein-interaction sites. Our genetic analyses and checkpoint level assessment suggest that the RPA countering role of Srs2 is promoted by Srs2 binding to proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), which recruits Srs2 to a subset of ssDNA containing regions. RPA antagonism is further fostered by Srs2 sumoylation, which we found depends on the Srs2-PCNA interaction and Mec1, and peaks after Mec1 activity reaches maximal levels. These data support a model in which Srs2 recruitment to PCNA adjacent to ssDNA-RPA filaments, followed by Mec1-dependent sumoylation, modulates RPA-mediated checkpoint signaling, while Srs2 action is limited at ssDNA regions lacking proximal PCNA, thereby favoring RPA-mediated ssDNA protection and repair.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105430">Meteorins regulate the formation of the left-right organizer and the establishment of vertebrate body asymmetry</a></h4>

              
                While the exterior of vertebrate bodies appears bilaterally symmetrical, internal organ positioning and morphology frequently exhibit left-right (L-R) asymmetries. In several vertebrates, including human, mouse, frog, and zebrafish, left-right symmetry-breaking during embryonic development is initiated by a ciliated organ called the Node or left-right organizer. Within the Node, a leftward flow of extraembryonic fluid named the Nodal flow mediates the asymmetric expressions of Nodal factors. Although downstream Nodal pathway components leading to the establishment of the embryonic left-right axis are well known, less is known about the development and formation of the embryonic Node itself. Here, we reveal a novel role for the Meteorin protein family in the establishment of the left-right axis and in the formation of Kupffer’s vesicle, the Node equivalent structure in zebrafish. We show that the genetic inactivation of each or all three members of the zebrafish Meteorin family (<i>metrn</i>, <i>metrn-like a,</i> and <i>metrn-like b</i>) leads to defects in properties of the Kupffer’s vesicle, caused by impaired assembly and migration of the Kupffer’s vesicle forming dorsal forerunner cells. In addition, we demonstrate that Meteorins genetically interact with integrins ItgαV and Itgβ1b, regulating the dorsal forerunner cell clustering, and that <i>meteorins</i> loss-of-function results in disturbed Nodal factor expression and consequently in randomized or symmetric heart looping and jogging. These results identify a new role for the Meteorin protein family in the left-right asymmetry patterning during embryonic vertebrate development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105585">Loss of olfaction reduces caterpillar performance and increases susceptibility to a natural enemy</a></h4>

              
                Insect herbivores such as caterpillars are under strong selection pressure from natural enemies, especially parasitoid wasps. Although the role of olfaction in host-plant seeking has been investigated in great detail in parasitoids and adult lepidopterans, the caterpillar olfactory system and its significance in tri-trophic interactions remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the olfactory system of <i>Pieris brassicae</i> caterpillars and the importance of olfactory information in the interactions among this herbivore, its host-plant <i>Brassica oleracea</i>, and its primary natural enemy <i>Cotesia glomerata</i>. To examine the role of olfaction, we utilized CRISPR/Cas9 to knockout (KO) the odorant receptor co-receptor (<i>Orco</i>). This KO impaired olfactory detection and primary processing in the brain. <i>Orco</i> KO caterpillars exhibited reduced weight and lost preference for their optimal food plants. Interestingly, the KO caterpillars also experienced reduced weight when challenged by the parasitoid <i>C. glomerata</i> whose ovipositor had been removed, and the mortality of the KO caterpillars under the attack of unmanipulated parasitoids increased. We then investigated the behavior of <i>P. brassicae</i> caterpillars in response to volatiles from plants attacked by conspecific caterpillars and volatiles from plants on which the caterpillars were themselves attacked by <i>C. glomerata</i>. After analyzing the volatile compounds involved in these interactions, we concluded that olfactory information enables caterpillars to locate suitable food sources more efficiently as well as to select enemy-free spaces. Our results reveal the crucial role of olfaction in caterpillar feeding and natural-enemy avoidance, highlighting the significance of chemoreceptor genes in shaping ecological interactions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106657">Conserved and unique features of terminal telomeric sequences in ALT-positive cancer cells</a></h4>

              
                A significant portion of human cancers utilize a recombination-based pathway, alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT), to maintain telomere length. Targeting the ALT is of growing interest as a cancer therapy, yet a substantial knowledge gap remains regarding the basic features of telomeres in ALT-positive cells. To address this, we adopted END-seq, an unbiased sequencing-based approach, to define the identity and regulation of the terminal sequences of chromosomes in ALT cells. Our data reveal that the terminal portions of chromosomes in ALT cells contain canonical telomeric sequences with the same terminus bias (-ATC) observed in non-ALT cells. Furthermore, as reported for non-ALT cells, POT1 is required to preserve the precise regulation of the 5′ end in cells that maintain telomere length using the ALT pathway. Thus, the regulation of the terminal 5′ of chromosomes occurs independently of the mechanism of telomere elongation. Additionally, we employed an S1 endonuclease-based sequencing method to determine the presence and origin of single-stranded regions within ALT telomeres. These data shed light on conserved and unique features of ALT telomeres.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105087">Interleukin-4 induces CD11c+ microglia leading to amelioration of neuropathic pain in mice</a></h4>

              
                Neuropathic pain, a debilitating chronic pain condition, is a major clinical challenge. The pleiotropic cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4) has been shown to suppress neuropathic pain in rodent models, but its underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we show that intrathecal administration of IL-4 to mice with spinal nerve transection (SpNT) increased the number of CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia (a microglia subset important for pain remission) in the spinal dorsal horn (SDH) and that this effect of IL-4 was essential for its ameliorating effect on SpNT-induced pain hypersensitivity. Furthermore, in mice with spared nerve injury (SNI), another model in which pain remission does not occur, the emergence of CD11c<sup>+</sup> SDH microglia was curtailed, but intrathecal IL-4 increased their emergence and ameliorated pain hypersensitivity in a CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia-dependent manner. Our study reveals a mechanism by which intrathecal IL-4 ameliorates pain hypersensitivity after nerve injury and provides evidence that IL-4 increases CD11c<sup>+</sup> microglia with a function that ameliorates neuropathic pain.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105955">Separable dorsal raphe dopamine projections mimic the facets of a loneliness-like state</a></h4>

              
                Affiliative social connections facilitate well-being and survival in numerous species. Engaging in social interactions requires positive or negative motivational drive, elicited through coordinated activity across neural circuits. However, the identity, interconnectivity, and functional encoding of social information within these circuits remains poorly understood. Here, we focus on downstream projections of dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) dopamine neurons (DRN<sup>DAT</sup>) in mice, which we previously implicated in social motivation alongside an aversive affective state. We show that three prominent DRN<sup>DAT</sup> projections – to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), central amygdala (CeA), and posterior basolateral amygdala (BLP) – play separable roles in behavior, despite substantial collateralization. Photoactivation of the DRN<sup>DAT</sup>-CeA projection promoted social behavior and photostimulation of the DRN<sup>DAT</sup>-BNST projection promoted exploratory behavior, while the DRN<sup>DAT</sup>-BLP projection supported place avoidance, suggesting a negative affective state. Downstream regions showed diverse receptor expression, poising DRN<sup>DAT</sup> neurons to act through dopamine, neuropeptide, and glutamate transmission. Furthermore, we show ex vivo that the effect of DRN<sup>DAT</sup> photostimulation on downstream neuron excitability depended on region and baseline cell properties, resulting in excitatory responses in BNST cells and diverse responses in CeA and BLP. Finally, in vivo microendoscopic cellular-resolution recordings in the CeA with DRN<sup>DAT</sup> photostimulation revealed a correlation between social behavior and neurons excited by social stimuli, suggesting that increased dopamine tone may recruit different CeA neurons to social ensembles. Collectively, these circuit features may facilitate a coordinated, but flexible, response in the presence of social stimuli that can be flexibly guided based on the internal social homeostatic need state of the individual.

                Nanobodies, single-domain antibodies derived from camelid heavy-chain antibodies, are known for their high affinity, stability, and small size, which make them useful in biological research and therapeutic applications. However, traditional nanobody generation methods rely on camelid immunization, which can be costly and time-consuming, restricting their practical feasibility. In this study, we present a phage-displayed synthetic library for nanobody discovery. To validate this approach, we screened nanobodies targeting various <i>Drosophila</i> secreted proteins. The nanobodies identified were suitable for applications such as immunostaining and immunoblotting, supporting the phage-displayed synthetic library as a versatile platform for nanobody development. To address the challenge of limited accessibility to high-quality synthetic libraries, this library is openly available for non-profit use.

">Shank3 establishes AMPA receptor subunit composition at cerebellar mossy fiber-granule cell synapses and shapes regional microglia activation.</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in Shank3 are the primary genetic cause of Phelan-McDermid Syndrome (PMS), a neurodevelopmental disorder frequently comorbid with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). As a key scaffolding protein in the postsynaptic site, SHANK3 is critical for excitatory glutamatergic synapse function by interacting with AMPARs, NMDARs, and mGluRs. While Shank3 deficiency has been extensively studied in forebrain regions, its role in the cerebellum, a brain area increasingly implicated in ASD pathobiology, remains comparatively underexplored. Cerebellar granule cells (CGCs) exhibit high Shank3 expression. However, its role in cerebellar glutamatergic synapses is poorly understood. This study aims to investigate how Shank3 loss affects mossy fiber-CGC glutamatergic synaptic function. Whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiological recordings from CGCs in ex vivo cerebellar brain slices from adult (4-6 months old) wild type (WT) and homozygous Shank3{triangleup}ex4-22 KO were performed to record miniature, evoked, and glutamate uncaged responses. Similarly, the current-voltage (I-V) relationship was analyzed with intracellular spermine and pharmacological validation of calcium-permeable AMPARs (CP-AMPARs) was done by IEM-1460. Immunofluorescence staining was performed for microglia using IBA1 labeling. We found a significant increase in mEPSC amplitude and AMPAR-mediated response to glutamate uncaging, which indicates that the loss of Shank3 enhances postsynaptic AMPAR function. Furthermore, the KO group showed faster AMPAR decay kinetics, inward rectification, and increased sensitivity to IEM-1460, suggesting that a high proportion of CP-AMPARs with distinct biophysical properties are present at the MF-CGC synapse. Furthermore, KO mice showed less ramified microglia suggesting the possible presence of activated microglia in the cerebellar cortex. Together, these findings highlight a critical role of Shank3 in maintaining the balance between CP- and CI-AMPARs at the MF-CGC synapse, which is essential for synapse maturation and proper cerebellar circuitry function. Dysregulation of this balance, with possible presence of activated microglia in the cerebellum, may underscore cerebellar-related behavioral deficits in Shank3 KO mice and may suggest a potential mechanism contributing to ASD pathophysiology.

">CaNetiCs - An Open-Source Toolbox for Standardized Dimensionality Reduction of Neuronal Calcium Activity</a></h4>

              
                The widespread use of calcium imaging has produced large-scale datasets capturing neuronal population activity across diverse experimental contexts, posing challenges for analyzing complex, high-dimensional data. Dimensionality reduction (DR) methods have been pivotal in addressing these challenges by simplifying data into interpretable, low-dimensional structures, while capturing essential network dynamics. Among DR methods, Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) can produce biologically meaningful representations through its nonnegativity constraint and parts-based decomposition, making it especially suited for analyzing neuronal calcium signals. To enhance accessibility and standardization in the analysis of state-dependent neuronal dynamics, we introduce Calcium Network dynamiCs (CaNetiCs), an open-source toolbox centered on NMF, integrating standardized DR methods (PCA, ICA, UMAP), geometric low-dimensional component space analyses, and neuronal network simulation modules. We validate our toolbox by applying it to two diverse experimental datasets that describe responses to graded anesthesia: whole-ganglion cellular calcium imaging of C. elegans, and two-photon imaging of murine somatosensory cortex. Our analyses recapitulate previously observed trends, such as network suppression and decorrelation with anesthesia, while uncovering novel insights into neuronal activity under differing contexts. CaNetiCs provides an accessible, modular, and interpretable framework, facilitating broader adoption of standardized dimensionality reduction methodologies for deeper exploration of neuronal network dynamics across experimental paradigms. The open-source code, along with documentation, is available at https://github.com/dannycarbonero/CaNetiCs.

">Corrective sub-movements link feedback to feedforward control in the cerebellum</a></h4>

              
                The ability to execute accurate movements is thought to rely on both anticipatory feedforward commands and rapid feedback corrections, yet how these control systems are integrated within cerebellar circuits remains unclear. Here, we show that corrective sub-movements (CSMs) -- structured, feedback-driven adjustments occurring spontaneously during naturalistic mouse reaching -- are not only encoded in anterior interposed (IntA) output neurons, but also act as instructive signals for feedforward learning. Closed-loop perturbations that trigger CSMs lead to learned shifts in the timing of future corrections, even in the absence of further perturbation. Strikingly, this learning depends on the timing of corrective responses, rather than the timing of the error itself, and is accompanied by physiological adaptation in cerebellar output neuronal firing rates. These findings reveal a cerebellar mechanism by which feedback responses train future anticipatory control signals, bridging the gap between reactive and anticipatory motor control in the cerebellum.

">Transdiagnostic electrophysiological subtypes reveal brain-behavior dimensions in youth psychiatry</a></h4>

              
                Conventional psychiatric diagnoses often fail to reflect the underlying neurobiological and behavioral complexity of mental health conditions. Here, we propose a transdiagnostic, data-driven framework for stratifying youth based on large-scale multisite electroencephalography (EEG) data from 1,707 individuals aged 5-18 years, including healthy controls and individuals diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), anxiety disorders (ANX), and learning disabilities (LD), along with their common comorbidities. By applying normative modeling to quantify individual deviations from typical brain functional maturation, and integrating multidimensional EEG features across spectral, temporal, complexity, and dynamical domains via similarity network fusion clustering, we identified three robust neurophysiological biotypes. These biotypes showed distinct electrophysiological and behavioral profiles, and captured meaningful brain-behavior relationships. Our findings suggest that biologically informed subtypes capture meaningful neuropsychiatric heterogeneity in youth, challenging conventional diagnostic boundaries in psychiatric nosology.

">Noninvasive detection of bacterial biofilms using an insect olfactory brain-based gas sensor</a></h4>

              
                Bacteria emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can be targeted for disease detection. Biological olfactory systems have keen senses of smell, can detect VOCs at low concentrations, and are naturally adapted to classifying mixtures of VOCs as odors. Here, we employed locust (Schistocerca americana) olfactory neural circuitry to differentiate biofilm and planktonic cultures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus using their odors. In vivo extracellular neural recordings were taken from the second-order olfactory processing center (antennal lobe) of locusts. The VOCs from biofilm cultures evoked distinct spiking responses compared to the planktonic cultures for both bacterial species. By analyzing the population neuronal responses, we classified individual bacterial biofilm vs. planktonic odors with up to 96% accuracy. The neural responses were highly discriminatory within the first couple of seconds of odor presentation and our analysis was conducted on less than five seconds of data, highlighting the potential of our biological sensor for real-time biofilm detection.

">GFAP Proteolysis in TBI: Linking Novel Modified Cleavage Products to Astrocyte Pathology and Patient Outcomes</a></h4>

              
                Monitoring patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) is essential for mitigating secondary complications. TBI disrupts proteostasis, leading to increased protein degradation and proteinopathy, which heighten the risk of neurodegeneration and underscore the need for early detection via noninvasive biomarkers. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an astroglial intermediate filament, is a well-established TBI biomarker, yet pathomechanisms and proteoforms of GFAP release are incompletely understood. This translational study defined the GFAP degradome in TBI through mass spectrometry (MS) sequencing of immunopurified GFAP breakdown products (BDPs) from patient biofluids. The TBI-GFAP fragments differed from those of Alzheimers and Alexander Diseases, revealing novel coil1/coil2-harboring cleavage products in TBI CSF, while TBI serum samples had only coil1-products. Trauma-specific citrullinations and acetylations were validated via MS spectra. Epitope mapping identified a novel trauma-specific cleavage site and revealed coil1-BDPs as selectively released into fluid, while coil2 fragments remained intracellular in a human trauma culture model. Citrullinated GFAP-specific antibodies exhibited distinct binding patterns from those of unmodified, native GFAP in TBI patients CSF and detected unique granular aggregates in dystrophic astrocytes without staining filamentous GFAP. TBI-GFAP fragments were produced by stepwise trauma-activated calpain and caspase activities shown by in vitro inhibitor studies. Live cell imaging with fluorescent protease reporters demonstrates coexisting calpain and caspase activities, along with membrane disruption jointly identifying distinct astrocyte injury states. The trajectory of GFAP proteolysis was analyzed in CSF samples from 24 TBI patients over 10PIDs, via calibrated, band-specific scaled immunoblot densitometry. These profiles covaried with patient age and body temperature. Full-length GFAP and 45-49kDa fragments peaked on injury day and declined over time, whereas calpain-generated 37-39kDa BDPs remained elevated. Small BDPs exhibited either delayed rises or remained undetected. Compared to the 20-26kDa BDPs, 15-19kDa products were notably underrepresented, consistent with coil1-BDPs preferred release and coil2-BDPs selective cellular retainment. Fluid levels of calpain-generated GFAP fragment were time and severity-dependent in the trauma culture model. TBI CSF trajectories of GFAP-BDPs differentiated TBI patients with poor versus those with good outcomes on the extended Glasgow Outcome scale (GOSE), whereas uncleaved GFAP trajectories failed in early prediction of patient outcome at six months. These findings define trauma-specific GFAP degradome dynamics and highlight novel longitudinal proteolysis profiles for patient monitoring and stratification. This work is significant as it supports GFAP fragment profiling for potential context of use (COU) in neurocritical care TBI monitoring, and offers preliminary insights into diagnosing astroglial proteinopathy-linked neurodegeneration after TBI.

">A sustained Hox program delineates brainstem neurons essential for breathing</a></h4>

              
                Respiratory neurons in the brainstem must diversify and acquire unique properties during development to enable breathing at birth. Dbx1-expressing progenitors give rise to functionally and molecularly distinct excitatory respiratory populations, including rhythm-generating pre-Botzinger complex (preBotC) neurons and phrenic motor neuron (MN)-projecting rostral Ventral Respiratory Group (rVRG) neurons. These neurons are organized rostrocaudally within the ventral respiratory column (VRC) but, despite their critical functions in breathing, the mechanisms that control their organization and diversification are not well understood. Here, we generate a novel genetic tool to label brainstem neurons within the VRC. We find that rVRG neurons selectively express Hox5 genes through postnatal stages. Selective deletion of all Hox5 paralogs from Dbx1-derived neurons leads to respiratory dysfunction, perinatal death, and changes in the pattern and amplitude of phrenic MN firing. We show that Hox5 inactivation leads to a caudal expansion of putative preBotC neurons, likely at the expense of the rVRG. Collectively, our findings indicate that Hox5 proteins are required for the delineation and functional specialization of excitatory brainstem neurons essential for breathing.

">Cortical α-synuclein pathology induces cell autonomous neuronal hypoactivity and compensatory circuit changes in a model of early Lewy Body Dementia</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive impairment is a common non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) and a defining feature of Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). Although many cognitive domains can be affected, impairments in visuospatial/perceptual function are relatively specific for PD and DLB compared to other dementias. Across populations, cognitive impairments correlate with the presence of -synuclein (-syn) pathology in limbic and neocortical brain regions. However, the specific role that -syn pathology plays in driving cortical circuit dysfunction and cognitive impairment remains controversial. We hypothesized that inducing -syn pathology in visual cortex in mice would impair neuronal activity and encoding of visual information, leading to visuoperceptual impairments. To test this hypothesis, we injected -syn pre-formed fibrils (PFF) into primary visual cortex (V1) to seed endogenous -syn pathology. Using longitudinal in vivo two-photon (2P) calcium imaging over 6 months, we recorded visually evoked activity of pyramidal cells in layer 2/3 (L2/3) and quantified -syn pathology using C05-05, a fluorescent ligand that binds aggregated -syn. Injection of PFFs led to the formation of sparse Lewy-like pathology in V1 and other anatomically connected regions. Measuring population activity, we found a greater percentage of neurons in PFF-injected mice were responsive to visual stimuli with lower direction selectivity compared to controls at 4-5 months post-injection (MPI). Within PFF-injected mice, neurons with large somatic Lewy-like inclusions had significantly lower visually evoked activity compared to neighboring neurons without inclusions. Conversely, the activity of neurons without somatic inclusions showed increased activity, positively correlated with the nearby burden of -syn pathology. Measuring visuoperceptual function using a head-fixed coherent motion discrimination task, we found no impairments in visuoperceptual ability in PFF-injected mice up to 6 MPI. Our results demonstrate, for the first time in vivo, that -syn pathology leads to cell autonomous reductions in neuronal activity and reciprocal changes in local population activity that may be compensatory, helping to preserve visuoperceptual function. Reflecting the early stages of neocortical -syn pathology, our model provides a framework for future studies incorporating risk factors for dementia in PD to better understand the heterogeneity of cognitive symptoms and -syn pathology across patients.

">CCB79 is a primate-specific cilium initiation factor essential to maintain neural progenitor diversity in developing brain tissue.</a></h4>

              
                Identifying the genes that regulate the accurate diversity of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) helps understand the mechanisms of human neocortex expansion. In primate brains, an additional intermediate progenitor layer, the outer subventricular zone (oSVZ) facilitates the expansion of the neocortex. Here, we identify an uncharacterized gene, KIAA0408, and show that its expression is enriched in intermediate progenitors. Removing KIAA0408 in human-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived brain organoids results in an impaired cortical organization characterized by abnormal cell fate and patterning defects, including the depletion of intermediate and ventral progenitors. Molecularly, KIAA0408 is a 79-kilodalton centriolar distal appendage protein (DAP) that controls cilium biogenesis (hereafter CCB79). CCB79 forms a complex with other DAP components and specifically localizes in the DAP at the onset of ciliogenesis, and its absence blocks ciliogenesis. Mechanistically, progenitors in 3D brain tissues are unable to form cilia, which induces aberrant hedgehog signaling and causes premature differentiation. Finally, human CCB79, rather than the mouse ortholog, rescues cilia defects, suggesting that CCB79 has undergone rapid evolution from rodents to primates to fine-tune ciliogenesis for proper brain development.

">Differential Bioenergetic Profile of Human Glioblastoma following Transplantation of Myocyte-derived Mitochondria</a></h4>

              
                Glioblastoma (GBM) exhibits profound plasticity, enabling adaptation to fluctuating microenvironmental stressors such as hypoxia and nutrient deprivation. However, this metabolic rewiring also creates subtype-specific vulnerabilities that may be exploited therapeutically. Here, we investigate whether mitochondrial transplantation using non-neoplastic, human myocyte-derived mitochondria alters the metabolic architecture of GBM cells and modulates their response to ionizing radiation. Using a cell-penetrating peptide-mediated delivery system, we successfully introduced mitochondria into two mesenchymal-subtype GBM cell lines, U3035 and U3046. Transplanted cells exhibited enhanced mitochondrial polarization and respiratory function, particularly in the metabolically flexible U3035 line. Bioenergetic profiling revealed significant increases in basal respiration, spare respiratory capacity, and glycolytic reserve in U3035 cells post-transplantation, whereas U3046 cells showed minimal bioenergetic augmentation. Transcriptomic analyses using oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis gene sets confirmed these functional findings. At baseline, U3035 cells expressed high levels of both glycolytic and OXPHOS genes, while U3046 cells were metabolically suppressed. Following radiation, U3035 cells downregulated key OXPHOS and glycolysis genes, suggesting metabolic collapse. In contrast, U3046 cells transcriptionally upregulated both pathways, indicating compensatory adaptation. These results identify and establish mitochondrial transplantation as a metabolic priming strategy that sensitizes adaptable GBM subtypes like U3035 to therapeutic stress by inducing bioenergetic overextension. Conversely, rigid subtypes like U3046 may require inhibition of post-radiation metabolic compensation for effective targeting. Our findings support a novel stratified approach to GBM treatment which integrates metabolic subtype profiling with bioenergetic modulation.

">Fast voxel and structural MRI realignment to mitigate inter-acquisition motion for spectroscopy</a></h4>

              
                Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) non-invasively measures the biochemical composition within a predefined brain region, enabling quantification of neurochemicals with biological and clinical relevance, such as N-acetylaspartate, creatine, choline, glutamate, and gamma-aminobutyric acid. However, accurate MRS quantification is compromised by subject motion displacing the prescribed location, a common problem during long scans or with motion-prone populations such as children and patients. Furthermore, displacement into bone tissue contaminates MRS data with noisy artifacts, often rendering them unusable. While promising solutions exist to address motion-related issues, many rely on specialized infrastructure and expertise available only at a limited number of research centers. We propose a fast and straightforward method that acquires a head scout (18 s) MRI sequence following potential motion, automatically repositions the prescribed voxel with the scanner's built-in AutoAlign function, and realigns the T1-weighted image to the updated position for anatomical segmentation. Using voxels prescribed in the prefrontal cortex, thalamus, and left superior temporal gyrus, we demonstrated that this realignment method successfully restored displaced voxels to their intended locations, eliminating bone contamination while improving voxel targeting through greater overlap with intended regions and more consistent voxel placement across subjects. This solution offers a quick and practical way for correcting subject motion between scans by combining available tools that are readily accessible even to new users, while more sophisticated motion correction technologies continue to develop towards broader adoption.

">How individual differences shape ERP responses to visual statistical learning</a></h4>

              
                Statistical learning (SL) enables the extraction of regularities from sensory input, yet the neural dynamics supporting this process--particularly in the visual modality--remain incompletely understood. Sixty-seven adults were familiarized with a continuous stream of shape sequences containing statistical structure that defined shape triplets. We recorded EEG to familiar sequences (presented in isolation) and unfamiliar foils. Both early (N100) and late (N400) event related potential (ERP) components were significantly more negative for unfamiliar than familiar sequences, reflecting robust neural sensitivity to learned structure. Notably, these familiarity effects were evident in both high- and low-performing participants and were not predicted by overall behavioral sensitivity, suggesting that neural indices of learning can emerge independently of explicit recognition. Follow-up analyses incorporating trial-level accuracy revealed a striking crossover interaction: for sensitive participants, ERP familiarity effects were stronger on correct trials, whereas for insensitive participants, effects were larger on incorrect trials. These findings highlight a dissociation between neural and behavioral measures of statistical learning and underscore the value of ERPs in capturing latent learning processes that may elude conscious awareness.

">Serotonin modulates neural dynamics in a subspace orthogonal to the choice space</a></h4>

              
                Serotonin (5-HT) is a central neuromodulator which is implicated in, amongst other functions, cognitive flexibility. 5-HT is released from the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) throughout nearly the entire forebrain. Little is known, however, about how serotonin affects downstream populations of neurons and how this modulation might support its cognitive functions. Here, we optogenetically stimulated serotonergic neurons in the DRN while recording large parts of the brain with Neuropixels during quiet wakefulness and performance of a perceptual decision-making task. During quiet wakefulness, 5-HT stimulation induced a rapid switch in internal state, as indicated by dilation of the pupil, suppression of hippocampal sharp wave ripples, and increased exploratory behaviors, such as whisking. To elucidate the brain-wide effect of serotonin release we performed acute Neuropixel recordings in seven target locations, a total of 7,478 neurons were recorded across 17 mice. We found that 5-HT stimulation significantly modulated neural activity in all the recorded brain regions, both during quiet wakefulness and task performance. During task performance, however, we observed no change in behavior when stimulating 5-HT. We found that the 5-HT modulation of high-dimensional neural dynamics is confined to a subspace which is orthogonal relative to the choice axis. These observations describe a possible mechanism for the induction of state-dependent stimulus representations, suggesting a neural basis for neuromodulatory effects on brain-wide circuits to flexible decision-making.

">Distinct inhibitory connectivity motifs trigger distinct forms of anticipation in the retinal network</a></h4>

              
                Motion is an important feature of visual scenes and retinal neuronal circuits selectively signal different motion features. It has been shown that the retina can extrapolate the position of a moving object, thereby compensating sensory transmission delays and enabling signal processing in real-time. Amacrine cells, the inhibitory interneurons of the retina, play essential roles in such computations although their precise function remain unclear. Here, we computationally explore the effect of two different inhibitory connectivity motifs on the retinas response to moving objects: feed-forward and recurrent feed-back inhibition. We show that both can account for motion anticipation with two different mechanisms. Feed-forward inhibition truncates motion responses and shifts peak responses forward via subtractive inhibition, whereas recurrent feedback coupling evokes, via divisive inhibition, excitatory and inhibitory waves with different phases that add up and shift the response peak. A key difference between the two mechanisms is how the peak response scales with the speed of a moving object. Motion prediction with feed-forward circuits monotonically decreases with increasing speeds, while recurrent feedback coupling induces tuning curves that exhibit a preferred speed for which motion prediction is maximal.

">Concerted actions of distinct serotonin neurons orchestrate female pup care behavior</a></h4>

              
                In many mammalian species, female behavior towards infant conspecifics changes across reproductive stages. Sexually naive females interact minimally or aggressively with infants, whereas the same animals exhibit extensive care behavior, even towards unrelated infants, after parturition1-6. Here, we discovered that two distinct sets of serotonin neurons collectively mediate this dramatic transition in maternal behavior--serotonin neurons projecting to the medial preoptic area (mPOA) promote pup care in mothers, whereas those projecting to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) suppress pup interaction in virgin female mice. Disrupting serotonin synthesis in either of these subpopulations or stimulating either subpopulation is sufficient to toggle pup-directed behavior between that displayed by virgin females and that of lactating mothers. In virgin female mice, the first pup interaction triggers an increase in serotonin release in BNST but a decrease in mPOA. In mothers, serotonin activity becomes greatly elevated in mPOA during pup interactions. Acute interruption of serotonin signaling locally in either mPOA or BNST disrupts the stage-dependent switch in pup care. Together, these results highlight how functionally distinct serotonin subpopulations orchestrate social behaviors appropriate for a given reproductive state, and suggest a circuit logic for how a neuromodulator coordinates adaptive behavioral changes across life stages.

">Mitochondrial Response to Psychological Stress and Its Medial Prefrontal Biomarker Correlates</a></h4>

              
                Background: Stress response obligates increased mitochondrial activities to meet stress induced high energy requirement. This stress mitochondrial response process involves glucocorticoid but also multiple alternative pathways that are top down regulated by the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). These pathways are important for many neuropsychiatric conditions that are sensitive to stress. However, the field lacks a reliable, clinically accessible stress mitochondrial response paradigm to study the process in humans. Method: We used an established psychological stress challenge combined with assaying salivary cell-free mitochondrial DNA (cf mtDNA), thought to reflect heightened mitochondrial changes or disruptions, in 35 healthy individuals (21 males). We also explored if these stress induced cf mtDNA marker elevations were associated brain metabolites as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), as well as high resolution brain imaging based cortical thickness focusing on the mPFC. Results: We found that salivary cf mtDNA was significant elevated immediately after the stress challenge (p=2.0x10-7) and gradually declined after. Exploratory causal analysis showed that this cf mtDNA response was not primarily driven by cortisol response. Instead, individuals with higher baseline dACC lactate+ levels, thought to in part reflect mitochondrial dysfunctions, was significantly associated with the cf mtDNA response (r=0.80, p<0.001). Higher mtDNA response was also significantly associated with thinner dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (r=-0.52, p=0.01). Age had a U-shape effect such that cf mtDNA response trended lower in earlier adulthood but higher in older people, explaining 33.8% of the ct mtDNA response variance (p=0.003). Conclusion: This stress challenge-salivary cf mtDNA assay paradigm may offer a new, noninvasive approach to evaluate the stress-mitochondrial pathway functioning in aging, psychopharmacology, and neuropsychiatric conditions where psychological stress plays a role.

">Human tau compromises neuronal structural integrity in C. elegans promoted by age, stress and phosphorylation</a></h4>

              
                Tauopathies are a group of progressive neurodegenerative diseases amongst which Alzheimer's disease is the most prevalent. They typically have a late age of onset and lead to cognitive decline. Tau is a highly soluble, intrinsically disordered microtubule binding protein that aggregates in these diseases. The mechanisms by which age-associated changes alter tau functionality and compromise neuronal structural integrity remain poorly understood. Here, we show with the use of single-copy gene insertion Caenorhabditis elegans models that human tau preferentially localises to neuronal processes in the nematode, consistent with its function of binding to microtubules. The expression of tau in the nervous system leads to age-associated changes in neuronal structural integrity. The observed "buckling" phenotype was exacerbated by exposure of the animals to different stressors which are known to enhance tau phosphorylation. Expressing phosphomimic tau or co-expressing human kinases both severely worsened the buckling phenotype. Kinase expression additionally induced tau inclusions in a small proportion of animals. These results point to an interplay between ageing, stress and phosphorylation leading to structural changes in neuronal processes prior to widespread tau aggregation.

">Amyloidogenic proteolysis of APP regulates glutamatergic presynaptic function</a></h4>

              
                Disease causing mutations of Alzheimer[s] disease (AD) point to dysregulations of APP proteolysis. During asymptomatic and early stages of AD, brain recordings revealed hyperexcitation reverting into over-inhibition as dementia progresses. Here, we show that endogenous APP and its proteolytic product APP-CTF{beta}, the precursors of A{beta}, accumulate preferentially at excitatory synapses. Using pharmacological treatments to modulate physiological concentrations of APP-CTF{beta} and A{beta}, we identify APP-CTF{beta} as a key regulator of glutamatergic synaptic transmission. Accumulation of APP-CTF{beta} increases the probability of synaptic vesicles. Strickingly, monomeric A{beta} counteracts this APP-CTF{beta}-driven hyperexcitability. This suggests that therapeutic strategies clearing monomeric A{beta}, could be detrimental during the early hyperexcitability phase of AD.

">Hunchback functions in the post-mitotic larval MDN to restrict axon outgrowth, synapse formation, and backward locomotion</a></h4>

              
                During neurodevelopment, a single progenitor cell can generate many different neuron types. As these neurons mature, they form unique morphologies, integrate into neural circuits, and contribute to behavior. However, the integration of these developmental events is understudied. Here, we show that the same transcription factor is important for both the generation of neuronal diversity and maintaining mature neuronal identity, providing novel insights on how the generation of neuronal identity and morphology are coordinated. We utilized a previously characterized larval locomotor circuit in Drosophila, where activation of the Moonwalker Descending Neuron (MDN) triggers backward locomotion via its presynaptic connection with the premotor neuron A18b. MDN expresses the temporal transcription factor Hunchback (Hb), which has a well-characterized role in neural progenitors. Loss of Hb in the post-mitotic MDN increases axon/dendrite branching, leading to additional functional synapses on A18b and increasing backward locomotion. We conclude that the endogenous function of Hb is to restrain axon/dendrite outgrowth, including limiting MDN-A18b synapses, thereby dampening backward locomotion. Our work provides insights on how a transcription factor can have different functions throughout life - i.e. Hb generates neuronal diversity in the progenitor and regulates neuronal connectivity in the mature neuron to generate an appropriately tuned behavior.

">Human neurons undergo protracted functional maturation into adulthood</a></h4>

              
                Human cognitive development is uniquely prolonged, reflecting the extended postnatal maturation of the cerebral cortex where cell-type differentiation, synaptogenesis, myelination8 and transcriptional regulation all follow protracted developmental timelines. However, when human cortical neurons reach functional electrophysiological maturity and how their developmental trajectory compares to other species remains unknown. Here we show through patch-clamp recordings of human temporal cortex from infancy to adulthood that supragranular pyramidal neurons exhibit pronounced neoteny of their functional properties, with physiological maturation continuing well into adulthood. Comparing human and mouse developmental trajectories reveals human neurons are on a much slower developmental timeline, maturing physiologically hundreds of times slower than mouse and 2-6 times slower than would be predicted from anatomical brain growth differences between species. This reflects a fundamentally different allometric relationship between physiological and anatomical maturation; while mouse neuronal physiology closely tracks brain growth, human physiological development follows its own extended timeline. This slow maturation results in different stages of cognitive development being supported by functionally distinct neuronal populations, with the progression from infancy to middle age characterized by specific electrophysiological profiles. Notably, a neuronal subtype thought to be human-specific, with electrophysiological traits that enhance computational capacity, appears only in late adolescence or early adulthood. This extreme protraction of neurophysiological development provides a cellular basis for prolonged human cognitive maturation, demonstrating that neuronal physiological neoteny represents a fundamental evolutionary adaptation in human brain development.

">The effects of chronic social stress on cognitive flexibility in adult female macaques</a></h4>

              
                Chronic social subordination stress in macaques, particularly when it begins early in life, is associated with negative health and cognitive aging outcomes. Utilizing a longitudinal, translational monkey model of early life stress, we report the cognitive performance of adult female Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) that had received social subordination stress associated with Low Social Status (LSS) since birth. Social subordination stress is the means by which macaque social groups establish their hierarchical organization. Higher ranked monkeys maintain their rank by aggression towards lower ranked animals, that in order to avoid harassment, engage in submissive behaviors. This chronic social stress in lower ranked monkeys produces physiological stress responses that over time can accelerate biological and cognitive aging. For this study, we compared 25 adult female Rhesus monkeys, 14 of which were of Low Birth Rank and had received higher levels of social subordination stress since infancy resulting in higher chronic stress. The remaining 11 were of High Birth Rank, and had committed, rather than received, social aggression/harassment on lower ranked subjects. These two groups have been followed longitudinally from birth to adolescence to assess long-term behavioral, physiological, and neural consequences of social stress. Now as they reached adulthood (ages 7-8 years), we assessed their cognitive abilities, focusing on executive function/cognitive flexibility, as a first assessment to map the trajectory of cognitive decline with aging. We trained subjects on the Intra-/Extra-dimensional shift task (ID/ED), which is a Wisconsin Card Sort analog using visual stimuli. This task is relevant for age-related cognitive decline, particularly in executive function, and cognitive flexibility. Cognitive results indicated only mild differences between High and Low ranking subjects on the simple discrimination, and the reversal learning stages of the task. We did find an interaction between High Birth Rank and performance across the three dimensional-shift stages, but no main effect of Rank. Thus, at this first age, we detected no performance differences indicating accelerated cognitive decline. We discuss other factors impacting performance, such as social housing and temperament measures and comparisons with neuroimaging data on these subjects.

                MIR-9-2 is a broadly and highly expressed microRNA in the developing brain and is frequently deleted in 5q14.3 Microdeletion Syndrome, a rare but severe neurodevelopmental disorder. Despite this, little attention has been paid to the unique contributions of MIR-9-2 to neurodevelopment and disease. We find that deletion of this microRNA leads to embryonic cerebral hemorrhages and severe hydrocephalus, while disrupting gene networks across a wide range of cell types in the developing brain, thus revealing underappreciated and non-redundant molecular, cellular, and system-wide functions for MIR-9-2 in neurodevelopment.

While the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) is traditionally associated with abstract, schematic representations, emerging theories suggest it may also contribute to constructing vivid, visual mental content. To test this, we developed a novel 7T fMRI experiment varying imagery demands across conditions: Prior to scanning, participants memorized richly detailed scenarios, more constrained, stationary objects, and finally semantic definitions for each of three abstract German words (e.g., hope). During fMRI and eye-tracking, the same word was presented across trials, but participants vividly re-engaged with one of three distinct representations (i.e., scenarios, objects, and definitions), allowing for comparison across richly different cognitive modes triggered by identical visual input. Univariate analyses confirmed previous findings; highlighting the roles of the vmPFC, hippocampus, parahippocampal cortex, and visual- perceptual cortex in imagery-rich scenario construction. We further performed multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to examine distributed neural representations, which can reveal the informational content of mental imagery beyond activation magnitude. Critically, the vmPFC was the only brain region where MVPA classifier accuracy was higher for scenario construction than for object and abstract conditions, directly supporting our hypothesis that the vmPFC encodes imagery-rich details rather than solely abstract, schematic information. Eye movement variability also distinguished between conditions. These findings advance our understanding of vmPFC function, emphasising its role in representing vivid mental content.

">Dynamic Graphs Analysis of EEG</a></h4>

              
                In this study, we investigate the use of temporal dynamics in brain connectivity for the classification of electroencephalography (EEG) signals using dynamic Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Our methods are applied to several large-scale EEG datasets focused on abnormality and epilepsy detection. The implemented models demonstrate competitive performance on unseen test subjects across all three datasets, outperforming previous graph-based baselines in terms of accuracy and F1 score. We explore multiple architectures designed to capture temporal variations in graph-structured data, demonstrating their effectiveness in modeling dynamic brain activity. In addition to classification, we employ graph-theoretical metrics to analyze temporal changes in brain networks, such as network efficiency and node degree, across time windows of EEG recordings. The goal is to characterize differences between pathological and healthy groups at both the node and network levels. We particularly examine epilepsy and healthy subject groups to highlight differences in local network efficiency and node degrees, with statistical significance confirmed via F-tests.

">Artificially induced torpor during pregnancy impairs fetal growth in mice</a></h4>

              
                Fetal development in endothermic mammals relies on a tightly regulated maternal body temperature. In animal models, deviations from normothermia during gestation cause fetal developmental abnormalities. However, the direct and physiological manipulation of the maternal core temperature has been technologically challenging, as traditional methods involve the imposition of external thermal stress. Recent advances in the identification of thermoregulatory neurons in the mouse preoptic area have allowed precise control of maternal body temperature without altering environmental conditions. Here we show that the activation of excitatory neurons in the medial preoptic area (MPO) induces a torpor-like hypothermic state in pregnant mice. When induced during early gestation, this state resulted in pregnancy loss, likely due to implantation failure. Hypothermia in mid- and late-gestation reduced fetal liver and kidney size and caused severe growth retardation. Similar outcomes were observed following pyroglutamylated RFamide peptide (Qrfp)-expressing neuron activation in the MPO, whereas inhibitory neuron activation had minimal effect. Furthermore, activating MPO excitatory neurons projecting to the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus reproduced both the torpor-like state and fetal growth retardation. These results underscore the importance of a stable maternal body temperature in fetal development and establish a new model for studying the effects of altered maternal temperature on embryogenesis.

">Age-Related Alterations in the Expression of Mesencephalic Astrocyte-derived Neurotrophic Factor in the Brain and Their Impact on Neurobehavioral Functions</a></h4>

              
                Mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) is a neurotrophic protein localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and pivotally involved in maintaining ER homeostasis. MANF plays an important role in mitigating neurodegenerative processes. Aging, the primary risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), is associated with significant alterations in ER function. The ER, central to protein synthesis, folding, degradation and secretion (proteostasis), experiences considerable stress in NDDs, which activates the unfolded protein response (UPR). We hypothesized that MANF and UPR is crucial for maintaining proteostasis during aging, but their efficacy declines with age, therefore increasing vulnerability to NDDs. We measured MANF levels in the brain and plasma of 1-, 4-, 11-, and 22-month-old male and female mice. A progressive decline of MANF levels was observed, with the lowest levels detected in 22 months. Reduced MANF expression was found in aged mice across several brain areas, including the cerebral cortex, olfactory bulb, thalamus, hypothalamus, hippocampus, and cerebellum. There was a sex difference in MANF levels in aged mice. Aging also altered the expression of UPR and MANF interacting proteins. Using cerebellar Purkinje cell (PC)-specific MANF deficient mice, we showed that MANF deficiency impaired motor coordination in female, but not male mice. MANF deficiency weakened spatial learning and memory in both male and female mice. Male MANF deficient mice displayed increased sociability, whereas female mice exhibit social withdrawal. Taken together, MANF expression in the brain declined with age and MANF deficiency impacted neurobehaviors in the aging animal in a sex-specific manner.

">Improved Sleep Spindle Detection Using the BOSC Method: A Comparison with Traditional Approaches</a></h4>

              
                Sleep spindles are brief bursts of 6 - 20 Hz local field potential (LFP/EEG) activity that occur during non-rapid eye movement sleep. Traditional spindle detection methods rely on manually set amplitude and duration thresholds, but this approach can be vulnerable to false detections and could miss low-amplitude spindles due to the inflexible nature of the thresholding technique. The Better OSCillation (BOSC) detection method offers a more robust alternative by applying frequency-specific power thresholds calibrated to the signal itself and requiring a minimum number of oscillation cycles. In this study, we compared traditional and BOSC methods for spindle detection in a variety of ways. First, we created two synthetic datasets: one with synthetic spindles modelled on previous data and one with single wave pulses that had a period consistent with the spindle frequency band. These datasets were used to demonstrate each method's performance when given events that should be detected (synthetic spindles) and those that should not (single wave pulses). Second, we analyzed cortical local field potentials from recordings of rats during natural sleep using both methods to determine their relative effectiveness given biological LFP data. BOSC consistently outperformed the traditional approach in all situations, identifying more valid spindles while minimizing false (or likely false) detections. These findings validate BOSC as a superior method of spindle detection due to its better calibration to the actual signal.

">Behavioural and physiological evidence for the development of cardiac-exteroceptive integration during the first year of life</a></h4>

              
                Continuous integration of environmental exteroceptive and internal interoceptive signals is fundamental for perception and adaptive behaviours, yet its developmental trajectory remains poorly understood. Here, we introduced a modified 'iBEATs' paradigm, based on prior work, to investigate cardiac-exteroceptive integration in 3- to 8-month-old infants. Using behavioural measures of looking time and physiological measures of pupillometry, we found that the ability to detect cardiac-exteroceptive synchrony emerges during the first year of life. Critically, this was evident only when stimuli coincided with systole, the baroreceptor-active phase of the cardiac cycle, supporting central multimodal integration interpretable within a predictive coding framework. Furthermore, individual differences in behavioural sensitivity were accounted for by the degree of autonomic maturation. These findings provide the first evidence for the developmental emergence and mechanisms of cardiac-exteroceptive integration, and establish the modified iBEATs paradigm as a promising tool for assessing interoceptive development in early life.

">Network dynamics for sensory prioritization: Functional connectivity related to individual sensory weighting of vision versus proprioception during upper limb control</a></h4>

              
                Precise control of the hand requires the dynamic integration of visual and proprioceptive (body position sense) sensory cues with internal models, task goals, and motor plans. Individual differences in how visual and proprioceptive cues are weighted have been related to neural substrates, such as posterior parietal regions, yet the underlying neural dynamics are unclear. This study investigated the relationship between visuo-proprioceptive perception during a bimanual pointing task and the whole-brain network dynamics using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) with both atlas-based and individually-localized ROI seeds. Our results confirm the existence of individual sensory biases, and find they have systematic influences on functional connectivity. Activity between sensorimotor regions and default mode network (DMN) nodes was related to sensory weighting (e.g. individual degree of reliance on vision versus proprioception) and may reflect updating of internal models. The ventral premotor cortex (PMv) emerged as an important node with functional connections suggesting its role for integrating motor plans, internal models, and sensory percepts. Connections from multisensory integration regions like the middle temporal gyrus (MTG) and the superior parietal lobule (SPL), and motor coordination regions in the cerebellum, were related to increased reliance on visual versus proprioceptive information. These findings suggest that individual sensory biases during sensorimotor behavior may be characterized by specific and specialized patterns of neural activity. This research establishes a foundational exploration of the neural systems underlying sensorimotor processing, supporting theories suggesting that learning in either the sensory or motor system may also cause plasticity in the other.

">Selective Observation Under Limited Resources Biases Social Inference Through Hysteresis</a></h4>

              
                Despite limited access to others' actions and outcomes, humans excel at inferring hidden intentions. Given only partial access, how do they decide what to observe, and how does selective observation shape inference? Here, we examined how choosing what to observe can bias the inference about others' intentions. Participants played a game where they pursued a fleeing target while a computerized opponent acted competitively or cooperatively. Participants overestimated the opponent's competitiveness after the opponent acted more competitively than expected, whereas no such bias occurred when the opponent was more cooperative than expected. This asymmetry depended on the sequence of events, resembling hysteresis, a form of path dependence observed in physical systems. We found that these biases became stronger when participants chose to observe the opponent instead of their own avatar, and this choice came at the cost of losing precise control over their avatar. Our findings highlight the trade-off in selecting what to observe, as the resulting inference biases propagate differently depending on the interaction history.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Loneliness has been recognized as a major public health concern affecting individuals’ everyday social functioning. Although hypothesized, the association between chronic loneliness, neural responses, and parasympathetic regulation during social information processing remains underexplored. This study aimed to compare parasympathetic and neural responses to affective social content in well-powered samples of participants with different chronic loneliness levels. In this study, 104 (52 females) healthy young adults were recruited based on their chronic loneliness levels to form groups of lonely and nonlonely individuals. Participants underwent a functional magnetic resonance imaging session in which they passively viewed social and nonsocial images of negative, positive, and neutral valence. Both groups showed similar task-related vagal changes and responses across predefined regions associated with key social brain areas. However, an exploratory whole-brain activity analysis revealed between-group differences in two distinct fusiform face area subregions. Furthermore, the lonely individuals group showed decreased connectivity between one of the fusiform face area subregions and right temporoparietal junction compared to the nonlonely individuals group. These results suggest that trait-like loneliness is associated with distinct processing of social content in fusiform face area subregions, potentially linking loneliness to differences in effective social information integration.</span>

                <p>by Agastya Mondal, Rushil Anirudh, Prashanth Selvaraj</p>

Agent-based models of malaria transmission are useful tools for understanding disease dynamics and planning interventions, but they can be computationally intensive to calibrate. We present a multitask deep learning approach for emulating and calibrating a complex agent-based model of malaria transmission. Our neural network emulator was trained on a large suite of simulations from the EMOD malaria model, an agent-based model of malaria transmission dynamics, capturing relationships between immunological parameters and epidemiological outcomes such as age-stratified incidence and prevalence across eight sub-Saharan African study sites. We then use the trained emulator in conjunction with parameter estimation techniques to calibrate the underlying model to reference data. Taken together, this analysis shows the potential of machine learning-guided emulator design for complex scientific processes and their comparison to field data.

                <p>by Sofie Verhees, Chandrasekhar Venkataraman, Mariya Ptashnyk</p>

We derive and simulate a mathematical model for mechanotransduction related to the Rho GTPase signalling pathway. The model addresses the bidirectional coupling between signalling processes and cell mechanics. A numerical method based on bulk-surface finite elements is proposed for the approximation of the coupled system of nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations, defined inside the cell and on the cell membrane, and the equations of elasticity. Our simulation results illustrate novel emergent features such as the strong dependence of the dynamics on cell shape, a threshold-like response to changes in substrate stiffness, and the fact that coupling mechanics and signalling can lead to the robustness of cell deformation to larger changes in substrate stiffness, ensuring mechanical homeostasis in agreement with experiments.

We present q2-fmt, a QIIME 2 plugin that provides diverse methods for assessing the extent of microbiome engraftment following fecal microbiota transplant. The methods implemented here were informed by a recent literature review on approaches for assessing FMT engraftment, and cover aspects of engraftment including Community Coalescence, Indicator Features, and Resilience. q2-fmt is free for all use, and detailed documentation illustrating worked examples on a real-world data set are provided in the project’s documentation.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Among all upper extremity nerves, the ulnar nerve is both the most commonly injured and notoriously difficult to regenerate. Despite this, ulnar nerve injuries remain understudied. Nonhuman primates (NHPs) offer an ideal model for the human upper extremity, but existing NHP nerve trauma literature is biased towards median and radial injury models. To address this, a nonhuman primate ulnar nerve injury model was developed and regeneration assessed following sural nerve autografting using electrophysiological and histological techniques. Unilateral 4 cm ulnar nerve injuries were created at the mid-forearm level, sural nerve autografts were sutured into resulting defects (<i>n</i> = 3), and animals were survived for 6 months. At the terminal time point, intraoperative electrophysiological testing, tissue harvest, and tissue processing were performed. Naïve nerves (<i>n</i> = 5) served as controls. Animals appeared clinically normal throughout the study period, other than an expected decrease in fine hand muscle function. After 6 months, histological and electrophysiological evidence suggested that axons crossed the graft and reached distal muscle targets. However, regenerating nerves exhibited a reduced motor nerve conduction velocity, reduced compound action muscle potential (CMAP) amplitude and area under the curve, increased latency, and increased duration versus naïve controls as expected. Histological analysis revealed reduced axon diameters, thinner myelin sheaths, and smaller muscle fiber cross-sectional areas as compared to controls. At 6 months post-injury, 4 cm ulnar defects bridged with sural autografts show signs of ongoing regeneration and nascent reinnervation. Specific electrophysiological and histological benchmarks for ulnar nerve recovery following clinically relevant autografting are presented.</p>

                In the brain, maintaining the appropriate levels of excitation and inhibition is required for proper cognitive function. Inhibitory neurons, essential for maintaining this balance and implicated in various neurodevelopmental diseases, are generated during embryonic development from the ganglionic eminences (GEs). This review discusses the importance of inhibitory neuronal subtypes generated from the most posterior GE subregion, the caudal ganglionic eminence (CGE), highlighting what is known about their developmental origins, diversity, and functions in mice, humans, and non-human primates. By reviewing the molecular composition and patterning of the CGE, we discuss how technological advances have provided insights into the spatial heterogeneity of progenitor populations and the distinctive molecular characteristics and functions of CGE-derived neurons.

                Acosta et al. find that ADP-ribosylation of the lipoic acid carrier protein GcvH-L promotes Staphylococcus aureus resistance to oxidative burst and facilitates infection. ADP-ribosylation leads to a structural shift within GcvH-L that safeguards lipoic acid sulfhydryls from detrimental oxidation and regulates its transfer to enzyme complexes required for growth.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/86899">Trophic eggs affect caste determination in the ant Pogonomyrmex rugosus</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how a single genome creates distinct phenotypes remains a fundamental challenge for biologists. Social insects provide a striking example of polyphenism, with queen and worker castes exhibiting morphological, behavioral, and reproductive differences. Here, we show that trophic eggs, which do not contain an embryo and are primarily regarded as a source of food, play a role in the process of caste determination in the harvester ant <i>Pogonomyrmex rugosus</i>. When first instar larvae were given access to trophic eggs, they mostly developed into workers. By contrast, larvae without access to trophic eggs developed into queens. We found that trophic eggs differ in many ways from viable eggs, including texture, morphology, and their contents of protein, triglycerides, glycogen, sugar, and small RNAs. Moreover, comparison of miRNA fragment size distributions suggests differences in the composition of miRNAs between the two egg types. This is the first demonstration of trophic eggs playing a role in caste determination in social insects.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103331">Effects of parental care on skin microbial community composition in poison frogs</a></h4>

              
                 Parent-offspring interactions constitute the first contact of many newborns with their environment, priming community assembly of microbes through priority effects and shaping host health and disease. Microbe acquisition during parental care is well studied in humans and agriculturally relevant species but remains poorly understood in other vertebrate groups, such as amphibians. Here, we investigate vertical transmission of skin microbiota in poison frogs (<i>Dendrobatidae</i>), where fathers transport tadpoles piggyback-style from terrestrial clutches to aquatic nurseries. We found that substantial bacterial colonization of embryos begins after hatching, suggesting that the vitelline envelope acts as a microbial barrier. A cross-foster experiment demonstrated that poison frogs performing tadpole transport serve as a source of skin microbes for tadpoles on their back. To study how transport impacts skin communities of tadpoles in an ecologically relevant setting, we sampled sympatric species that do or do not exhibit tadpole transport in their natural habitat. We did not find a higher degree of similarity between microbial communities of tadpoles and adults in species that transport their offspring compared to those that do not. Similarly, communities of tadpoles were no more similar to their caregiver than to unrelated adults, indicating that most caregiver-associated microbes do not remain in tadpole communities long-term. Nonetheless, some taxa persisted on tadpoles over development. This study is the first to demonstrate that offspring transport facilitates transmission of parental skin microbes in anurans.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103945">Elevated ubiquitin phosphorylation by PINK1 contributes to proteasomal impairment and promotes neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                Ubiquitin (Ub), a central regulator of protein turnover, can be phosphorylated by PINK1 (PTEN-induced putative kinase 1) to generate S65-phosphorylated ubiquitin (pUb). Elevated pUb levels have been observed in aged human brains and in Parkinson’s disease, but the mechanistic link between pUb elevation and neurodegeneration remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that pUb elevation is a common feature under neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease, aging, and ischemic injury. We show that impaired proteasomal activity leads to the accumulation of sPINK1, the cytosolic form of PINK1 that is normally proteasome-degraded rapidly. This accumulation increases ubiquitin phosphorylation, which then inhibits ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal activity by interfering with both ubiquitin chain elongation and proteasome-substrate interactions. Specific expression of sPINK1 in mouse hippocampal neurons induced progressive pUb accumulation, accompanied by protein aggregation, proteostasis disruption, neuronal injury, neuroinflammation, and cognitive decline. Conversely, Pink1 knockout mitigated protein aggregation in both mouse brains and HEK293 cells. Furthermore, the detrimental effects of sPINK1 could be counteracted by co-expressing Ub/S65A phospho-null mutant but exacerbated by over-expressing Ub/S65E phospho-mimic mutant. Together, these findings reveal that pUb elevation, triggered by reduced proteasomal activity, inhibits proteasomal activity and forms a feedforward loop that drives progressive neurodegeneration.

Neuroimaging studies suggest that this process engages dynamic interactions across canonical brain networks. However, the precise dynamic brain mechanisms underlying inhibitory control and their relationship to individual differences remain poorly understood. To address this gap, we applied a novel state-space model to a large-scale fMRI dataset to investigate latent brain states and their dynamics during a gender-Stroop task. Our study revealed four distinct latent brain states, each characterized by unique functional connectivity patterns. Temporal properties of latent brain states, such as occupancy rates (OR) and mean lifetimes (ML), were significant predictors of the Stroop effect. Specifically, the ML of state S1 showed negative association with the Stroop effect, suggesting that prolonged engagement in this state facilitated inhibitory control. State-specific connectivity patterns also predicted Stroop effects. Compared to S2, S1 showed stronger within- and between-network connectivity. These findings suggest that S1 represents an optimal brain state for resolving conflicts and promoting inhibitory control. Together, our findings shed light on the neural dynamics involved in overcoming sensory-motor conflicts triggered by automatic responses and highlight their potential implications for cognitive interventions.</span>

                <p>Recent evidence highlights the importance of glutamatergic neurons in the basal forebrain (BF) in promoting cortical activity; however, whether BF glutamatergic neurons are involved in regulating general anesthesia and the underlying neural circuits remains unclear. Here, we showed that the activity of BF glutamatergic neurons decreased during the induction of isoflurane anesthesia and restored during the emergence in mice. Optogenetic activation of these neurons significantly enhanced cortical activation, accelerated behavioral emergence, and improved physiological indicators in both male and female mice under isoflurane anesthesia. Specifically, activation of BF glutamatergic neurons shortened emergence time from isoflurane anesthesia, decreased isoflurane sensitivity, and increased arousal scores of mice. Moreover, optogenetic activation of BF glutamatergic neurons decreased EEG delta power and burst suppression ratio, while increasing pupil size and respiration rate in mice during isoflurane anesthesia. Similar results were observed during the optogenetic activation of BF glutamatergic terminals in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Additionally, we found that the activity of BF glutamatergic neurons and VTA glutamatergic neurons synchronously fluctuated during isoflurane anesthesia, and optogenetic activation of BF glutamatergic terminals in the VTA potently increased the calcium signals in VTA glutamatergic neurons during isoflurane anesthesia. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that BF glutamatergic neurons promote emergence from isoflurane anesthesia by activating VTA glutamatergic neurons.</p>

                <p>In daily life, we frequently encounter items within emotional contexts through repeated exposure. However, it remains unclear how emotion influences the memory of items learned across multiple repetitions and how neural representations during repeated learning are associated with subsequent memory performance. In the current study, participants learned meaningless squiggles, each followed by an emotional image (positive, neutral, or negative), with each squiggle&ndash;image pair presented three times during encoding. After a 24&nbsp;h delay, a recognition memory test for the squiggles was performed. The results indicated that behaviorally squiggles were more accurately retrieved in the positive condition compared with the negative condition. An old/new ERP effect was observed between 400 and 1,200&nbsp;ms at the midparietal cluster, specific to the positive condition, and correlated with memory performance. Notably, greater EEG representational similarity of neural patterns across repeated learning was observed for subsequently remembered items compared with forgotten items in the positive condition, specifically at the right frontal region between 380 and 600&nbsp;ms. These findings suggest that positive emotion enhances memory of neutral items across repeated learning through neural representational reinstatement, offering insights into how emotional differences in episodic memory retrieval are linked to neural patterns established during repeated learning.</p>

                <p>When we encounter people in real life, increased visual experience with their face is accompanied by an accumulation of conceptual knowledge about them. This conceptual knowledge has been shown to play an important role in face recognition. However, the extent to which conceptual knowledge influences neural responses to faces in visual or non-visual regions of the brain is not clear. To address this question, participants (male and female) learned faces in a naturalistic viewing paradigm in which conceptual information was modulated by presenting a movie to participants in either its original sequence or a scrambled sequence. Although participants in both groups had the same overall perceptual experience, this manipulation had a significant effect on the conceptual understanding of events. After a delay, participants viewed a new movie featuring the previously learned faces while neural activity was measured using fMRI. No significant differences were observed between the Original and Scrambled groups in core face-selective regions of the visual brain. This aligns with the fact that overall exposure to faces was consistent across groups, ensuring that our manipulation did not impact visual processing of faces. In contrast, differences between the groups were evident within a network of regions that are typically associated with processing person knowledge. This network of regions was also able to discriminate the identity of the key characters based on the response to the faces. These findings provide important insights into the level of neural processing at which conceptual knowledge influences familiar face recognition during natural viewing.</p>

                <p>Music can effectively induce emotional arousal, which is associated with the release of stress hormones that are important for the emotional modulation of memory. Thus, music may serve as a powerful modulator of memory and mood, making it a promising therapeutic tool for memory and mood disorders such as Alzheimer's disease or depression. However, music's impact on memory depends on its features, timing, and ability to elicit emotional arousal. In the current study, we manipulated various features of music played during post-encoding memory consolidation to elicit emotional arousal and impact subsequent memory in men and women. We found that larger increases and moderate decreases in post-encoding music-induced emotional arousal from baseline resulted in gist versus detail trade-offs in memory, with improved general memory but impaired detailed memory, while moderate increases in arousal from baseline corresponded to improved detailed memory, but impaired general memory. Importantly, relative to controls, music-induced emotional arousal demonstrated unique impacts on detailed memory that are crucial in supporting episodic memory. These findings suggest that music intervention does not uniformly impact memory and has important implications in developing personalized music-related interventions for those with memory and mood impairments.</p>

                <p>Cortical beta band oscillations (13&ndash;30&nbsp;Hz) are associated with sensorimotor control, but their precise role remains unclear. Evidence suggests that for low-threshold motor neurons (MNs), these oscillations are conveyed to muscles via the fastest corticospinal fibers. However, their transmission to MNs of different sizes may vary due to differences in the relative strength of corticospinal and reticulospinal projections across the MN pool. Consequently, it remains uncertain whether corticospinal beta transmission follows similar pathways and maintains consistent strength across the entire MN pool. To investigate this, we examined beta activity in MNs innervating the tibialis anterior muscle across the full range of recruitment thresholds in a study involving 12 participants of both sexes. We characterized beta activity at both the cortical and motor unit (MU) levels, while participants performed contractions from mild to submaximal levels. Corticomuscular coherence remained unchanged across contraction forces after normalizing for the net MU spike rate, suggesting that beta oscillations are transmitted with similar strength to MNs, regardless of size. To further explore beta transmission, we estimated corticospinal delays using the cumulant density function, identifying peak correlations between cortical and muscular activity. Once compensated for variable peripheral axonal propagation delay across MNs, the corticospinal delay remained stable, and its value (~14&nbsp;ms) indicated projections through the fastest corticospinal fibers for all MNs. These findings demonstrate that corticospinal beta band transmission is determined by the fastest pathway connecting in the corticospinal tract, projecting similarly across the entire MN pool.</p>

                <p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease characterized by death of lower and upper motor neurons. Although the mechanism behind the selective neuron loss is still unclear, several heterogeneous genes have been causally linked to ALS. <I>KIF5A</I> encodes for a neuronally enriched kinesin involved in protein transport, and mutations within this gene have been causally linked to different motor neuron diseases. The mutations identified in ALS patients are mostly predicted to alter its mRNA splicing, leading to a frameshift mutation and an aberrant 39-aa-long sequence in the C-terminal domain of KIF5A. Here we found that ALS-related KIF5A mutations induce the accumulation of the mutant form of the protein in human motoneurons, which are also characterized by the cytosolic mislocalization of TDP-43. This ALS hallmark was even exacerbated upon overexpression of the ALS-KIF5A protein in cells differentiated from healthy controls and primary neurons, suggesting a pathological connection between the cellular load of the mutant protein and TDP-43 pathology. While the terminal domain of the WT isoform is characterized by an acid isoelectric point (pI), the ALS variant presents a basic pI due to the altered aminoacidic composition of this sequence. We thus generated a KIF5A-ALS isoform that retained part of the aberrant sequence but with lower pI. The overexpression of this mutated variant led to significantly lower protein aggregation and TDP-43 mislocalization than the ALS mutant. Our data show that re-establishing the correct pI rescues KIFA aggregation and significantly reduces the cytoplasmic mislocalization of TDP-43.</p>

                <p>Patients with idiopathic/isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) are in the prodromal stage of alpha-synucleinopathies. Neurodegeneration early affects subcortical structures, including the substantia nigra, in iRBD patients. However, it remains unclear whether there is also an early neurodegeneration process affecting the cerebral cortex. We investigated whether EEG-derived metrics for aberrant cortical dynamics and imbalanced excitation&ndash;inhibition (E/I) correlate with disease severity in iRBD patients, aiming to better understand the pathophysiology progression from the prodromal to the overt stage of alpha-synucleinopathies. We retrospectively analyzed resting-state EEG recordings, as a marker of cortical function, and presynaptic dopaminergic imaging, a marker of subcortical function from 59 iRBD patients (9 female) who underwent longitudinal clinical evaluation alongside 46 age-matched healthy controls (22 female). We assessed power-law scaling in long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs), neuronal bistability, and functional E/I balance from the resting-state sensor EEG data and then correlated these to large-scale synchrony, nigrostriatal dopaminergic function, and clinical data. Compared with the control group, patients showed higher LRTCs and bistability in 2&ndash;7&nbsp;Hz oscillations. Patients who developed parkinsonism/dementia exhibited hyperexcitability in 5&ndash;7&nbsp;Hz compared with those who did not. This was also correlated with stronger phase synchrony. Both hyperexcitability in 5&ndash;7&nbsp;Hz and bistability in 2&ndash;4&nbsp;Hz negatively associated with nigrostriatal dopaminergic impairment. The iRBD patients, especially those closer to phenoconversion to parkinsonism or dementia, show clear aberrant cortical dynamics and hyperexcitability alongside substantia nigra impairment, suggesting that neurodegeneration in the prodromal stages affects both subcortical structures and cortical dynamics.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/31/e1913242025?rss=1">Online Movements Reflect Ongoing Deliberation</a></h4>

              
                <p>From navigating a crowded hallway to skiing down a treacherous hill, humans are constantly making decisions while moving. Insightful past work has provided a glimpse of decision deliberation at the moment of movement onset. Yet it is unknown whether ongoing deliberation can be expressed during movement, following movement onset and prior to any decision. Here we tested the idea that an ongoing deliberation continually influences motor processes&mdash;prior to a decision&mdash;directing online movements. The deliberation process was manipulated by having humans of either sex observe tokens that moved into a left or right target. Supporting our hypothesis, we found that lateral hand movements reflected deliberation, prior to a decision. We also found that a deliberation urgency signal, which more heavily weighs later evidence, was fundamental to predicting decisions and explains past movement behavior in a new light. Our paradigm promotes the expression of ongoing deliberation through movement, providing a powerful new window to understand the interplay between decision and action.</p>

                <p>Repeated social defeat (RSD) in mice causes sensitization of hippocampal neurons associated with enhanced contextual fear memory. Because enhanced fear memory is an integral component of posttraumatic stress disorder, the physiological basis of neuronal sensitization in the hippocampus after social defeat was investigated in male mice using two interventions: microglia depletion (CSF1R antagonist, PLX5622) and neuronal (Vglut2<sup>+</sup>) IL-1R1<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice. Here, two single-nuclei (sn) RNAseq data sets using these interventions were integrated and compared. Social defeat altered the transcriptional profiles of CA1 (Satb2<sup>+</sup>), dentate gyrus (DG, Prox1<sup>+</sup>), and inhibitory (Pval<sup>+</sup>) neurons, and these stress profiles were influenced by nIL-1R1, microglia, or both. In DG neurons, differentially expressed genes and canonical pathways related to cAMP response element (CREB), calcium/calmodulin kinases, bassoon, and glutamatergic signaling were robustly increased by RSD, and these were selectively dependent on nIL-1R1. Based on the snRNAseq data, neuronal stability and plasticity within the hippocampus were assessed. For instance, social defeat increased perineuronal nets around inhibitory (Pval<sup>+</sup>) neurons in the DG, and these were influenced by both nIL-1R1 and microglia. In addition, RNAscope confirmed that bassoon RNA was amplified after social defeat in the CA1 and DG, and these increases were selectively dependent on nIL-1R1. Last, electrophysiological analyses showed that both spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic current amplitudes in the DG were influenced by social defeat in a nIL-1R1-dependent manner. Collectively, sensitization of dentate gyrus neurons after social defeat requires neuronal IL-1R1 and is associated with enhanced CREB-bassoon signaling and disruption of the excitatory/inhibitory input balance.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/31/e2426242025?rss=1">Incorporation of a Cost of Deliberation Time in Perceptual Decision Making</a></h4>

              
                <p>Many decisions benefit from the accumulation of evidence obtained sequentially over time. In such circumstances, the decision-maker must balance speed against accuracy, while considering the cost associated with the passage of time. A neural mechanism to achieve this balance is to accumulate evidence and to terminate the deliberation when enough evidence has accrued. To accommodate time costs, it has been hypothesized that the criterion to terminate a decision may become lax as a function of time. Here we tested this hypothesis by manipulating the cost of time in a perceptual choice&ndash;reaction time (RT) task. Human participants (both sexes) discriminated the direction of motion in a dynamic random-dot display, which varied in difficulty across trials. Unbeknownst to the participants, halfway through the experiment, we increased the time pressure by canceling a small fraction of trials, mimicking a broken fixation, if they had not made a decision by a provisional deadline. This subtle manipulation led participants to make faster but less accurate decisions. Choice and RT were well explained by a bounded evidence-accumulation process. We developed a novel computational method to estimate the time-dependent changes in the stopping bounds directly from the participants&rsquo; RT and choice data. Our analysis revealed that the bounds decline as a function of time, and that this decline is steeper following the time&ndash;cost manipulation. The time-varying decision bounds approximate an optimal stopping policy, although the specific bound shape is idiosyncratic across individuals.</p>
