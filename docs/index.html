	<p>Driver&amp;amp;rsquo;s stress affects decision-making and the probability of risk occurrence, and it is therefore a key factor in road safety. This suggests the need for continuous stress monitoring. This work aims at validating a stress neurophysiological measure&amp;amp;mdash;a Neurometric&amp;amp;mdash;for out-of-the-lab use obtained from lightweight EEG relying on two wet sensors, in real-time, and without calibration. The Neurometric was tested during a multitasking experiment and validated with a realistic driving simulator. Twenty subjects participated in the experiment, and the resulting stress Neurometric was compared with the Random Forest (RF) model, calibrated by using EEG features and both intra-subject and cross-task approaches. The Neurometric was also compared with a measure based on skin conductance level (SCL), representing one of the physiological parameters investigated in the literature mostly correlated with stress variations. We found that during both multitasking and realistic driving experiments, the Neurometric was able to discriminate between low and high levels of stress with an average Area Under Curve (AUC) value higher than 0.9. Furthermore, the stress Neurometric showed higher AUC and stability than both the SCL measure and the RF calibrated with a cross-task approach. In conclusion, the Neurometric proposed in this work proved to be suitable for out-of-the-lab monitoring of stress levels.</p>

	<p>Long-term depression at parallel fibers-Purkinje cells (PF-PC LTD) is essential for cerebellar motor learning and motor control. Recent progress in ataxiology has identified dysregulation of PF-PC LTD in the pathophysiology of certain types of immune-mediated cerebellar ataxias (IMCAs). Auto-antibodies towards voltage-gated Ca channel (VGCC), metabotropic glutamate receptor type 1 (mGluR1), and glutamate receptor delta (GluR delta) induce dysfunction of PF-PC LTD, resulting in the development of cerebellar ataxias (CAs). These disorders show a good response to immunotherapies in non-paraneoplastic conditions but are sometimes followed by cell death in paraneoplastic conditions. On the other hand, in some types of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), dysfunction in PF-PC LTD, and impairments of PF-PC LTD-related adaptive behaviors (including vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) and prism adaptation) appear during the prodromal stage, well before the manifestations of obvious CAs and cerebellar atrophy. Based on these findings and taking into account the findings of animal studies, we re-assessed the clinical concept of LTDpathy. LTDpathy can be defined as a clinical spectrum comprising etiologies associated with a functional disturbance of PF-PC LTD with concomitant impairment of related adaptative behaviors, including VOR, blink reflex, and prism adaptation. In IMCAs or degenerative CAs characterized by persistent impairment of a wide range of molecular mechanisms, these disorders are initially functional and are followed subsequently by degenerative cell processes. In such cases, adaptive disorders associated with PF-PC LTD manifest clinically with subtle symptoms and can be prodromal. Our hypothesis underlines for the first time a potential role of LTD dysfunction in the pathogenesis of the prodromal symptoms of CAs. This hypothesis opens perspectives to block the course of CAs at a very early stage.</p>

                <p>A surprising finding of recent studies in mouse is the dominance of widespread movement-related activity throughout the brain, including in early sensory areas. In awake subjects, failing to account for movement risks misattributing movement-related activity to other (e.g., sensory or cognitive) processes. In this article, we (1) review task designs for separating task-related and movement-related activity, (2) review three "case studies" in which <I>not</I> considering movement would have resulted in critically different interpretations of neuronal function, and (3) discuss functional couplings that may prevent us from ever fully isolating sensory, motor, and cognitive-related activity. Our main thesis is that neural signals related to movement are ubiquitous, and therefore ought to be considered first and foremost when attempting to correlate neuronal activity with task-related processes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Novel Layer 4 Corticofugal Cell Type/Projection Involved in Thalamo-Cortico-Striatal Sensory Processing</a></h4>

              
                <p>In sensory cortices, the information flow has been thought to be processed vertically across cortical layers, with layer 4 being the major thalamo-recipient which relays thalamic signals to layer 2/3, which in turn transmits thalamic information to layer 5 and 6 to then leave the cortex to reach subcortical and cortical long-range structures. Although several exceptions to this model have been described, neurons in layer 4 are still considered to establish only local (i.e., interlaminar and short-range) connections. Here, taking advantage of anatomic, electrophysiological, and optogenetic techniques, we describe, for the first time, a long-range corticostriatal class of pyramidal neurons in layer 4 (CS-L4) of the mouse auditory cortex that receive direct thalamic inputs. The CS-L4 neurons are embedded in a feedforward inhibitory circuit involving local parvalbumin neurons and establish connections in the posterior striatum in yet another feedforward inhibitory thalamo-&gt;cortico(L4)-&gt;striatal circuit which potentially contributes in controlling control the output of striatal spiny projection neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The assumption has been that layer 4 neurons are the main thalamic recipient layer, projecting to the upper cortical layer 2/3. However, no study has revealed a detailed understanding of the circuit mechanisms by which layer 4 sends a projection to a subcortical structure, such as the striatum, and differentially innervate the spiny projection neurons (SPNs) and intrastriatal parvalbumin-expressing neurons. For the first time, our results demonstrate that the auditory cortex projects to the posterior part of the dorsal striatum via pyramidal neurons located in layer 4 (CS-L4 neurons). Here we propose a new wiring diagram that implemented the old one, in which layer 4 is not only involved in the transfer of thalamic input to the upper layer 2/3, but can also exert a direct top-down control, bypassing intracortical processing of subcortical structures, such as the posterior part of the dorsal striatum. This poses a new conceptual cell element (CS-L4 neurons) for experimental and theoretical work of the cortical function.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Mlc1-Expressing Perivascular Astrocytes Promote Blood-Brain Barrier Integrity</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the mammalian brain, perivascular astrocytes (PAs) closely juxtapose blood vessels and are postulated to have important roles in the control of vascular physiology, including regulation of the blood&ndash;brain barrier (BBB). Deciphering specific functions for PAs in BBB biology, however, has been limited by the ability to distinguish these cells from other astrocyte populations. In order to characterize selective roles for PAs <I>in vivo</I>, a new mouse model has been generated in which the endogenous megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts 1 (Mlc1) gene drives expression of Cre fused to a mutated estrogen ligand-binding domain (Mlc1-T2A-CreERT2). This knock-in mouse model, which we term MLCT, allows for selective identification and tracking of PAs in the postnatal brain. We also demonstrate that MLCT-mediated ablation of PAs causes severe defects in BBB integrity, resulting in premature death. PA loss results in aberrant localization of Claudin 5 and -VE-Cadherin in endothelial cell junctions as well as robust microgliosis. Collectively, these data reveal essential functions for Mlc1-expressing PAs in regulating endothelial barrier integrity in mice and indicate that primary defects in astrocytes that cause BBB breakdown may contribute to human neurologic disorders.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Interlaced among the billions of neurons and glia in the mammalian brain is an elaborate network of blood vessels. Signals from the brain parenchyma control the unique permeability properties of cerebral blood vessels known as the blood&ndash;brain barrier (BBB). However, we understand very little about the relative contributions of different neural cell types in the regulation of BBB functions. Here, we show that a specific subpopulation of astrocyte is essential for control of BBB integrity, with ablation of these cells leading to defects in endothelial cell junctions, BBB breakdown, and resulting neurologic deficits.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Bayesian Mapping of the Striatal Microcircuit Reveals Robust Asymmetries in the Probabilities and Distances of Connections</a></h4>

              
                <p>The striatum's complex microcircuit is made by connections within and between its D1- and D2-receptor expressing projection neurons and at least five species of interneuron. Precise knowledge of this circuit is likely essential to understanding striatum's functional roles and its dysfunction in a wide range of movement and cognitive disorders. We introduce here a Bayesian approach to mapping neuron connectivity using intracellular recording data, which lets us simultaneously evaluate the probability of connection between neuron types, the strength of evidence for it, and its dependence on distance. Using it to synthesize a complete map of the mouse striatum, we find strong evidence for two asymmetries: a selective asymmetry of projection neuron connections, with D2 neurons connecting twice as densely to other projection neurons than do D1 neurons, but neither subtype preferentially connecting to another; and a length-scale asymmetry, with interneuron connection probabilities remaining non-negligible at more than twice the distance of projection neuron connections. We further show that our Bayesian approach can evaluate evidence for wiring changes, using data from the developing striatum and a mouse model of Huntington's disease. By quantifying the uncertainty in our knowledge of the microcircuit, our approach reveals a wide range of potential striatal wiring diagrams consistent with current data.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> To properly understand a neuronal circuit's function, it is important to have an accurate picture of the rate of connection between individual neurons and how this rate changes with the distance separating pairs of neurons. We present a Bayesian method for extracting this information from experimental data and apply it to the mouse striatum, a subcortical structure involved in learning and decision-making, which is made up of a variety of different projection neurons and interneurons. Our resulting statistical map reveals not just the most robust estimates of the probability of connection between neuron types, but also the strength of evidence for them, and their dependence on distance.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Cortical Granularity Shapes the Organization of Afferent Paths to the Amygdala and Its Striatal Targets in Nonhuman Primate</a></h4>

              
                <p>The prefrontal cortex (PFC) and insula, amygdala, and striatum form interconnected networks that drive motivated behaviors. We previously found a connectional trend in which granularity of the ventromedial and orbital PFC/insula predicted connections to the amygdala, and also the breadth of amygdalo-striatal efferents, including projections beyond the "classic" ventral striatum. To further interrogate connectional relationships among the cortex, amygdala, and striatum, and to further define the "limbic" (amygdala-recipient) striatum, we conducted tract tracing studies in two cohorts of macaques (male <I>n</I> = 14, female <I>n</I> = 1). We focused on the cortico-amygdalo-striatal (indirect) and cortico-"limbic" striatal (direct) paths originating in the entire PFC and insula. Larger datasets and a quantitative approach revealed "cortical rules" in which cortical granularity predicts the complexity and location of projections to both the basal nucleus of the amygdala and striatum. Remarkably, projections from "cortical-like" basal nucleus to the striatum followed similar patterns. In both "direct" and "indirect" paths to the "limbic" striatum, agranular cortices formed a "foundational," broad projection, and were joined by inputs from progressively more differentiated cortices. In amygdalo-striatal paths, the ventral basal nucleus was the "foundational" input, with progressively more dorsal basal nucleus regions gradually adding inputs as the "limbic" striatum extended caudally. Together, the "indirect" and "direct" paths followed consistent principles in which cortical granularity dictated the strength and complexity of projections at their targets. Cluster analyses independently confirmed these connectional trends, and also highlighted connectional features that predicted termination in specific subregions of the basal nucleus and "limbic" striatum.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The "limbic" system broadly refers to brain circuits that coordinate emotional responses. Here, we investigate circuits of the amygdala, which are involved in coding the emotional value of external cues, and their influence on the striatum. Regions of prefrontal cortex (PFC) and insula form gradients of overlapping inputs to the amygdala's basal nucleus, which feed forward to the striatum. Direct cortical inputs to these "amygdala-recipient" striatal areas are surprisingly organized according to similar principles but subtly shift from the "classic" ventral striatum to the caudal ventral striatum. Together, these distinct subsystems, cortico-amygdalo-striatal circuits and direct cortico-striatal circuits, provide substantial opportunity for different levels of internal, sensory, and external experiences to be integrated within the striatum, a major motor-behavioral interface.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Earliest Experience of a Relatively Rare Sound But Not a Frequent Sound Causes Long-Term Changes in the Adult Auditory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sensory experience during a critical period alters sensory cortical responses and organization. We find that the earliest sound-driven activity in the mouse auditory cortex (ACX) starts before ear-canal opening (ECO). The effects of auditory experience before ECO on ACX development are unknown. We find that in mouse ACX subplate neurons (SPNs), crucial in thalamocortical maturation, respond to sounds before ECO showing oddball selectivity. Before ECO, SPNs are more selective to oddball sounds in auditory streams than thalamo-recipient layer 4 (L4) neurons and not after ECO. We hypothesize that SPN's oddball selectivity can direct the development of L4 responses before ECO. Exposing mice, of either sex, before ECO to a rarely occurring tone in a stream of another tone occurring frequently leads to strengthening the adult cortical representation of the rare tone, but not that of the frequent tone. Results of control exposure experiments at multiple developmental windows that also use only a single tone corroborate the observations. We further explain the strengthening of deviant inputs before ECO and not after ECO using a binary network model mimicking the hierarchical structure of subplate and L4 neurons and response properties derived from our data, with synapses following Hebbian spike time-dependent plasticity learning rule. Information-theoretic analysis with sparse coding assumptions also predicts the observations. Thus, relatively salient low probability sounds in the earliest auditory environment cause long-term changes in the ACX.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Early auditory experience can change the organization and responses of the auditory cortex in adulthood. However, little is known about how auditory experience at prenatal ages changes neural circuits and response properties. In mice at equivalent early developmental stages, we find that auditory experience of a particular kind, with a less frequently occurring sound in a stream of another sound, alters adult cortical responsiveness, specifically of the less frequent sound. However, at the previously known critical period of development, the opposite is observed, where the more frequent sound's representation is strengthened in the adult compared with the less frequent sound. We thus show that a specific type of auditory environment can influence adult auditory processing at the earliest ages.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Distorted Tonotopy Severely Degrades Neural Representations of Connected Speech in Noise following Acoustic Trauma</a></h4>

              
                <p>Listeners with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) struggle to understand speech, especially in noise, despite audibility compensation. These real-world suprathreshold deficits are hypothesized to arise from degraded frequency tuning and reduced temporal-coding precision; however, peripheral neurophysiological studies testing these hypotheses have been largely limited to in-quiet artificial vowels. Here, we measured single auditory-nerve-fiber responses to a connected speech sentence in noise from anesthetized male chinchillas with normal hearing (NH) or noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Our results demonstrated that temporal precision was not degraded following acoustic trauma, and furthermore that sharpness of cochlear frequency tuning was not the major factor affecting impaired peripheral coding of connected speech in noise. Rather, the loss of cochlear tonotopy, a hallmark of NH, contributed the most to both consonant-coding and vowel-coding degradations. Because distorted tonotopy varies in degree across etiologies (e.g., noise exposure, age), these results have important implications for understanding and treating individual differences in speech perception for people suffering from SNHL.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Difficulty understanding speech in noise is the primary complaint in audiology clinics and can leave people with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) suffering from communication difficulties that affect their professional, social, and family lives, as well as their mental health. We measured single-neuron responses from a preclinical SNHL animal model to characterize salient neural-coding deficits for naturally spoken speech in noise. We found the major mechanism affecting neural coding was not a commonly assumed factor, but rather a disruption of tonotopicity, the systematic mapping of acoustic frequency to cochlear place that is a hallmark of normal hearing. Because the degree of distorted tonotopy varies across hearing-loss etiologies, these results have important implications for precision audiology approaches to diagnosis and treatment of SNHL.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Excitable Axonal Domains Adapt to Sensory Deprivation in the Olfactory System</a></h4>

              
                <p>The axon initial segment (AIS), nodes of Ranvier, and the oligodendrocyte-derived myelin sheath have significant influence on the firing patterns of neurons and the faithful, coordinated transmission of action potentials (APs) to downstream brain regions. In the olfactory bulb (OB), olfactory discrimination tasks lead to adaptive changes in cell firing patterns, and the output signals must reliably travel large distances to other brain regions along highly myelinated tracts. Whether myelinated axons adapt to facilitate olfactory sensory processing is unknown. Here, we investigate the morphology and physiology of mitral cell (MC) axons in the olfactory system of adult male and female mice and show that unilateral sensory deprivation causes system-wide adaptations in axonal morphology and myelin thickness. MC spiking patterns and APs also adapted to sensory deprivation. Strikingly, myelination and MC physiology were altered on both the deprived and nondeprived sides, indicating system level adaptations to reduced sensory input. Our work demonstrates a previously unstudied mechanism of plasticity in the olfactory system.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Successful transmission of information from the olfactory bulb (OB) to piriform cortex through the lateral olfactory tract (LOT) relies on synchronized arrival of action potentials (APs). The coincident arrival of APs is dependent on reliable generation of APs in the axon initial segment (AIS) and fast conduction mediated by axon myelination. Here, we studied changes in mitral cell (MC) firing and AIS structure as well as changes in myelination of the LOT on unilateral olfactory deprivation in the adult mouse. Strikingly, myelination and MC physiology were altered on both the deprived and nondeprived sides, indicating system level adaptations to reduced sensory input. Our work demonstrates a previously unstudied mechanism of plasticity in the olfactory system.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Reward Value Revealed by Auction in Rhesus Monkeys</a></h4>

              
                <p>Economic choice is thought to involve the elicitation of the subjective values of the choice options. Thus far, value estimation in animals has relied on stochastic choices between multiple options presented in repeated trials and expressed from averages of dozens of trials. However, subjective reward valuations are made moment-to-moment and do not always require alternative options; their consequences are usually felt immediately. Here, we describe a Becker&ndash;DeGroot&ndash;Marschak (BDM) auction-like mechanism that provides more direct and simple valuations with immediate consequences. The BDM encourages agents to truthfully reveal their true subjective value in individual choices ("incentive compatibility"). Male monkeys reliably placed well-ranked BDM bids for up to five juice volumes while paying from a water budget. The bids closely approximated the average subjective values estimated with conventional binary choices (BCs), thus demonstrating procedural invariance and aligning with the wealth of knowledge acquired with these less direct estimation methods. The feasibility of BDM bidding in monkeys paves the way for an analysis of subjective neuronal value signals in single trials rather than from averages; the feasibility also bridges the gap to the increasingly used BDM method in human neuroeconomics.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The subjective economic value of rewards cannot be measured directly but must be inferred from observable behavior. Until now, the estimation method in animals was rather complex and required comparison between several choice options during repeated choices; thus, such methods did not respect the imminence of the outcome from individual choices. However, human economic research has developed a simple auction-like procedure that can reveal in a direct and immediate manner the true subjective value in individual choices [Becker&ndash;DeGroot&ndash;Marschak (BDM) mechanism]. The current study implemented this mechanism in rhesus monkeys and demonstrates its usefulness for eliciting meaningful value estimates of liquid rewards. The mechanism allows future neurophysiological assessment of subjective reward value signals in single trials of controlled animal tasks.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Emotional Context Sculpts Action Goal Representations in the Lateral Frontal Pole</a></h4>

              
                <p>Emotional states provide an ever-present source of contextual information that should inform behavioral goals. Despite the ubiquity of emotional signals in our environment, the neural mechanisms underlying their influence on goal-directed action remains unclear. Prior work suggests that the lateral frontal pole (FPl) is uniquely positioned to integrate affective information into cognitive control representations. We used pattern similarity analysis to examine the content of representations in FPl and interconnected mid-lateral prefrontal and amygdala circuitry. Healthy participants (<I>n</I> = 37; <I>n</I> = 21 females) were scanned while undergoing an event-related Affective Go/No-Go task, which requires goal-oriented action selection during emotional processing. We found that FPl contained conjunctive emotion&ndash;action goal representations that were related to successful cognitive control during emotional processing. These representations differed from conjunctive emotion&ndash;action goal representations found in the basolateral amygdala. While robust action goal representations were present in mid-lateral prefrontal cortex, they were not modulated by emotional valence. Finally, converging results from functional connectivity and multivoxel pattern analyses indicated that FPl emotional valence signals likely originated from interconnected subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (BA25), which was in turn functionally coupled with the amygdala. Thus, our results identify a key pathway by which internal emotional states influence goal-directed behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Optimal functioning in everyday life requires behavioral regulation that flexibly adapts to dynamically changing emotional states. However, precisely how emotional states influence goal-directed action remains unclear. Unveiling the neural architecture that supports emotion&ndash;goal integration is critical for our understanding of disorders such as psychopathy, which is characterized by deficits in incorporating emotional cues into goals, as well as mood and anxiety disorders, which are characterized by impaired goal-based emotion regulation. Our study identifies a key circuit through which emotional states influence goal-directed behavior. This circuitry comprised the lateral frontal pole (FPl), which represented integrated emotion&ndash;goal information, as well as interconnected amygdala and subgenual ACC, which conveyed emotional signals to FPl.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Hyper-Rigid Phasic Organization of Hippocampal Activity But Normal Spatial Properties of CA1 Place Cells in the Ts65Dn Mouse Model of Down Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                <p>Down syndrome (DS) in humans is caused by trisomy of chromosome 21 and is marked by prominent difficulties in learning and memory. Decades of research have demonstrated that the hippocampus is a key structure in learning and memory, and recent work with mouse models of DS has suggested differences in hippocampal activity that may be the substrate of these differences. One of the primary functional differences in DS is thought to be an excess of GABAergic innervation from medial septum to the hippocampus. In these experiments, we probe in detail the activity of region CA1 of the hippocampus using <I>in vivo</I> electrophysiology in male Ts65Dn mice compared with their male nontrisomic 2N littermates. We find the spatial properties of place cells in CA1 are normal in Ts65Dn animals. However, we find that the phasic relationship of both CA1 place cells and gamma rhythms to theta rhythm in the hippocampus is profoundly altered in these mice. Since the phasic organization of place cell activity and gamma oscillations on the theta wave are thought to play a critical role in hippocampal function, the changes we observe agree with recent findings that organization of the hippocampal network is potentially of more relevance to its function than the spatial properties of place cells.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Recent evidence has disrupted the view that spatial deficits are associated with place cell abnormalities. In these experiments, we record hippocampal place cells and local field potential from the Ts65Dn mouse model of Down syndrome, and find phenomenologically normal place cells, but profound changes in the association of place cells and gamma rhythms with theta rhythm, suggesting that the overall network state is critically important for hippocampal function. These findings also agree with evidence suggesting that excess inhibitory control is the cause of hippocampal dysfunction in Down syndrome. The findings also confirm new avenues for pharmacological treatment of Down syndrome.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Collagen VI Regulates Motor Circuit Plasticity and Motor Performance by Cannabinoid Modulation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Collagen VI is a key component of muscle basement membranes, and genetic variants can cause monogenic muscular dystrophies. Conversely, human genetic studies recently implicated collagen VI in central nervous system function, with variants causing the movement disorder dystonia. To elucidate the neurophysiological role of collagen VI, we generated mice with a truncation of the dystonia-related collagen &alpha;3 VI (COL6A3) C-terminal domain (CTD). These <I>Col6a3</I><sup>CTT</sup> mice showed a recessive dystonia-like phenotype in both sexes. We found that COL6A3 interacts with the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) complex in a CTD-dependent manner. <I>Col6a3</I><sup>CTT</sup> mice of both sexes have impaired homeostasis of excitatory input to the basal pontine nuclei (BPN), a motor control hub with dense COL6A3 expression, consistent with deficient endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling. Aberrant synaptic input in the BPN was normalized by a CB1R agonist, and motor performance in <I>Col6a3</I><sup>CTT</sup> mice of both sexes was improved by CB1R agonist treatment. Our findings identify a readily therapeutically addressable synaptic mechanism for motor control.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Dystonia is a movement disorder characterized by involuntary movements. We previously identified genetic variants affecting a specific domain of the COL6A3 protein as a cause of dystonia. Here, we created mice lacking the affected domain and observed an analogous movement disorder. Using a protein interaction screen, we found that the affected COL6A3 domain mediates an interaction with the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R). Concordantly, our COL6A3-deficient mice showed a deficit in synaptic plasticity linked to a deficit in cannabinoid signaling. Pharmacological cannabinoid augmentation rescued the motor impairment of the mice. Thus, cannabinoid augmentation could be a promising avenue for treating dystonia, and we have identified a possible molecular mechanism mediating this.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Presenilin Is Essential for ApoE Secretion, a Novel Role of Presenilin Involved in Alzheimer's Disease Pathogenesis</a></h4>

              
                <p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating dementia characterized by progressive memory loss and aggregation of amyloid-&beta; (A&beta;) protein into amyloid plaques in patient brains. Mutations in presenilin (PS) lead to abnormal generation of A&beta;, which is the major cause of familial AD (FAD), and apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) is the major genetic risk factor for sporadic AD (SAD) onset. However, whether dysfunction of PS is involved in the pathogenesis of SAD is largely unknown. We found that ApoE secretion was completely abolished in PS-deficient cells and markedly decreased by inhibition of -secretase activity. Blockade of -secretase activity by a -secretase inhibitor, DAPT, decreased ApoE secretion, suggesting an important role of -secretase activity in ApoE secretion. Reduced ApoE secretion is also observed in nicastrin-deficient cells with reduced -secretase activity. PS deficiency enhanced nuclear translocation of ApoE and binding of ApoE to importin &alpha;4, a nuclear transport receptor. Moreover, the expression of PS mutants in PS-deficient cells suppressed the restoration effects on ApoE secretion compared with the expression of wild-type PS. Plasma ApoE levels were lower in FAD patients carrying PS1 mutations compared with normal control subjects. Our findings suggest a novel role of PS contributing to the pathogenesis of SAD by regulating ApoE secretion.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Familial AD (FAD) typically results from mutations in the genes encoding amyloid precursor protein, presenilin 1 (PS1), or PS2. Many PS mutants have been found to exert impaired -secretase activity and increased amyloid-&beta; 42 (A&beta;42)/A&beta;40 ratio, which induce early amyloid deposition and FAD. On the other hand, apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) is the major genetic risk factor for sporadic AD (SAD) and contributes to AD pathogenesis because it has reduced A&beta; clearance capability compared with ApoE3 and ApoE2. FAD and SAD have long been considered to be caused by these two independent mechanisms; however, for the first time, we demonstrated that PS is essential for ApoE secretion and PS mutants affected ApoE secretion <I>in vitro</I> and in human samples, suggesting a novel mechanism by which PS is also involved in SAD pathogenesis.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Human Astrocytes Exhibit Tumor Microenvironment-, Age-, and Sex-Related Transcriptomic Signatures</a></h4>

              
                <p>Astrocytes are critical for the development and function of synapses. There are notable species differences between human astrocytes and commonly used animal models. Yet, it is unclear whether astrocytic genes involved in synaptic function are stable or exhibit dynamic changes associated with disease states and age in humans, which is a barrier in understanding human astrocyte biology and its potential involvement in neurologic diseases. To better understand the properties of human astrocytes, we acutely purified astrocytes from the cerebral cortices of over 40 humans across various ages, sexes, and disease states. We performed RNA sequencing to generate transcriptomic profiles of these astrocytes and identified genes associated with these biological variables. We found that human astrocytes in tumor-surrounding regions downregulate genes involved in synaptic function and sensing of signals in the microenvironment, suggesting involvement of peritumor astrocytes in tumor-associated neural circuit dysfunction. In aging, we also found downregulation of synaptic regulators and upregulation of markers of cytokine signaling, while in maturation we identified changes in ionic transport with implications for calcium signaling. In addition, we identified subtle sexual dimorphism in human cortical astrocytes, which has implications for observed sex differences across many neurologic disorders. Overall, genes involved in synaptic function exhibit dynamic changes in the peritumor microenvironment and aging. These data provide powerful new insights into human astrocyte biology in several biologically relevant states that will aid in generating novel testable hypotheses about homeostatic and reactive astrocytes in humans.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Astrocytes are an abundant class of cells playing integral roles at synapses. Astrocyte dysfunction is implicated in a variety of human neurologic diseases. Yet our knowledge of astrocytes is largely based on mouse studies. Direct knowledge of human astrocyte biology remains limited. Here, we present transcriptomic profiles of human cortical astrocytes, and we identified molecular differences associated with age, sex, and disease state. We found that peritumor and aging astrocytes downregulate genes involved in astrocyte&ndash;synapse interactions. These data provide necessary insight into human astrocyte biology that will improve our understanding of human disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Impaired Oligodendrocyte Maturation Is an Early Feature in SCA3 Disease Pathogenesis</a></h4>

              
                <p>Spinocerebellar ataxia Type 3 (SCA3), the most common dominantly inherited ataxia, is a polyglutamine neurodegenerative disease for which there is no disease-modifying therapy. The polyglutamine-encoding CAG repeat expansion in the <I>ATXN3</I> gene results in expression of a mutant form of the ATXN3 protein, a deubiquitinase that causes selective neurodegeneration despite being widely expressed. The mechanisms driving neurodegeneration in SCA3 are unclear. Research to date, however, has focused almost exclusively on neurons. Here, using equal male and female age-matched transgenic mice expressing full-length human mutant <I>ATXN3</I>, we identified early and robust transcriptional changes in selectively vulnerable brain regions that implicate oligodendrocytes in disease pathogenesis. We mapped transcriptional changes across early, mid, and late stages of disease in two selectively vulnerable brain regions: the cerebellum and brainstem. The most significant disease-associated module through weighted gene coexpression network analysis revealed dysfunction in SCA3 oligodendrocyte maturation. These results reflect a toxic gain-of-function mechanism, as <I>ATXN3</I> KO mice do not exhibit any impairments in oligodendrocyte maturation. Genetic crosses to reporter mice revealed a marked reduction in mature oligodendrocytes in SCA3-disease vulnerable brain regions, and ultrastructural microscopy confirmed abnormalities in axonal myelination. Further study of isolated oligodendrocyte precursor cells from SCA3 mice established that this impairment in oligodendrocyte maturation is a cell-autonomous process. We conclude that SCA3 is not simply a disease of neurons, and the search for therapeutic strategies and disease biomarkers will need to account for non-neuronal involvement in SCA3 pathogenesis.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Despite advances in spinocerebellar ataxia Type 3 (SCA3) disease understanding, much remains unknown about how the disease gene causes brain dysfunction ultimately leading to cell death. We completed a longitudinal transcriptomic analysis of vulnerable brain regions in SCA3 mice to define the earliest and most robust changes across disease progression. Through gene network analyses followed up with biochemical and histologic studies in SCA3 mice, we provide evidence for severe dysfunction in oligodendrocyte maturation early in SCA3 pathogenesis. Our results advance understanding of SCA3 disease mechanisms, identify additional routes for therapeutic intervention, and may provide broader insight into polyglutamine diseases beyond SCA3.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">FMRP Sustains Presynaptic Function via Control of Activity-Dependent Bulk Endocytosis</a></h4>

              
                <p>Synaptic vesicle (SV) recycling is essential for the maintenance of neurotransmission, with a number of neurodevelopmental disorders linked to defects in this process. Fragile X syndrome (FXS) results from a loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) encoded by the <I>FMR1</I> gene. Hyperexcitability of neuronal circuits is a key feature of FXS, therefore we investigated whether SV recycling was affected by the absence of FMRP during increased neuronal activity. We revealed that primary neuronal cultures from male <I>Fmr1</I> knock-out (KO) rats display a specific defect in activity-dependent bulk endocytosis (ADBE). ADBE is dominant during intense neuronal activity, and this defect resulted in an inability of <I>Fmr1</I> KO neurons to sustain SV recycling during trains of high-frequency stimulation. Using a molecular replacement strategy, we also revealed that a human FMRP mutant that cannot bind BK channels failed to correct ADBE dysfunction in KO neurons, however this dysfunction was corrected by BK channel agonists. Therefore, FMRP performs a key role in sustaining neurotransmitter release via selective control of ADBE, suggesting intervention via this endocytosis mode may correct the hyperexcitability observed in FXS.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) results in fragile X syndrome (FXS), however whether its loss has a direct role in neurotransmitter release remains a matter of debate. We demonstrate that neurons lacking FMRP display a specific defect in a mechanism that sustains neurotransmitter release during intense neuronal firing, called activity-dependent bulk endocytosis (ADBE). This discovery provides key insights into mechanisms of brain communication that occur because of loss of FMRP function. Importantly it also reveals ADBE as a potential therapeutic target to correct the circuit hyperexcitability observed in FXS.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Multi-omics data integration reveals metabolome as the top predictor of the cervicovaginal microenvironment</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nicholas A. Bokulich, Pawe≈Ç ≈Åaniewski, Anja Adamov, Dana M. Chase, J. Gregory Caporaso, Melissa M. Herbst-Kralovetz</p>

Emerging evidence suggests that host-microbe interaction in the cervicovaginal microenvironment contributes to cervical carcinogenesis, yet dissecting these complex interactions is challenging. Herein, we performed an integrated analysis of multiple ‚Äúomics‚Äù datasets to develop predictive models of the cervicovaginal microenvironment and identify characteristic features of vaginal microbiome, genital inflammation and disease status. Microbiomes, vaginal pH, immunoproteomes and metabolomes were measured in cervicovaginal specimens collected from a cohort (n = 72) of Arizonan women with or without cervical neoplasm. Multi-omics integration methods, including neural networks (mmvec) and Random Forest supervised learning, were utilized to explore potential interactions and develop predictive models. Our integrated analyses revealed that immune and cancer biomarker concentrations were reliably predicted by Random Forest regressors trained on microbial and metabolic features, suggesting close correspondence between the vaginal microbiome, metabolome, and genital inflammation involved in cervical carcinogenesis. Furthermore, we show that features of the microbiome and host microenvironment, including metabolites, microbial taxa, and immune biomarkers are predictive of genital inflammation status, but only weakly to moderately predictive of cervical neoplastic disease status. Different feature classes were important for prediction of different phenotypes. Lipids (e.g. sphingolipids and long-chain unsaturated fatty acids) were strong predictors of genital inflammation, whereas predictions of vaginal microbiota and vaginal pH relied mostly on alterations in amino acid metabolism. Finally, we identified key immune biomarkers associated with the vaginal microbiota composition and vaginal pH (MIF), as well as genital inflammation (IL-6, IL-10, MIP-1Œ±).

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Comparative analyses of parasites with a comprehensive database of geno-scale metabolic models</a></h4>

Protozoan parasites cause diverse diseases with large global impacts. Research on the pathogenesis and biology of these organisms is limited by economic and experimental constraints. Accordingly, studies of one parasite are frequently extrapolated to infer knowledge about another parasite, across and within genera. Model <i>in vitro</i> or <i>in vivo</i> systems are frequently used to enhance experimental manipulability, but these systems generally use species related to, yet distinct from, the clinically relevant causal pathogen. Characterization of functional differences among parasite species is confined to <i>post hoc</i> or single target studies, limiting the utility of this extrapolation approach. To address this challenge and to accelerate parasitology research broadly, we present a functional comparative analysis of 192 genomes, representing every high-quality, publicly-available protozoan parasite genome including <i>Plasmodium</i>, <i>Toxoplasma</i>, <i>Cryptosporidium</i>, <i>Entamoeba</i>, <i>Trypanosoma</i>, <i>Leishmania</i>, <i>Giardia</i>, and other species. We generated an automated metabolic network reconstruction pipeline optimized for eukaryotic organisms. These metabolic network reconstructions serve as biochemical knowledgebases for each parasite, enabling qualitative and quantitative comparisons of metabolic behavior across parasites. We identified putative differences in gene essentiality and pathway utilization to facilitate the comparison of experimental findings and discovered that phylogeny is not the sole predictor of metabolic similarity. This knowledgebase represents the largest collection of genome-scale metabolic models for both pathogens and eukaryotes; with this resource, we can predict species-specific functions, contextualize experimental results, and optimize selection of experimental systems for fastidious species.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Bayesian data assimilation for estimating instantaneous reproduction numbers during epidemics: Applications to COVID-19</a></h4>

Estimating the changes of epidemiological parameters, such as instantaneous reproduction number, <i>R</i><sub>t</sub>, is important for understanding the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases. Current estimates of time-varying epidemiological parameters often face problems such as lagging observations, averaging inference, and improper quantification of uncertainties. To address these problems, we propose a Bayesian data assimilation framework for time-varying parameter estimation. Specifically, this framework is applied to estimate the instantaneous reproduction number <i>R</i><sub>t</sub> during emerging epidemics, resulting in the state-of-the-art ‚ÄòDARt‚Äô system. With DARt, time misalignment caused by lagging observations is tackled by incorporating observation delays into the joint inference of infections and <i>R</i><sub>t</sub>; the drawback of averaging is overcome by instantaneously updating upon new observations and developing a model selection mechanism that captures abrupt changes; the uncertainty is quantified and reduced by employing Bayesian smoothing. We validate the performance of DARt and demonstrate its power in describing the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. The proposed approach provides a promising solution for making accurate and timely estimation for transmission dynamics based on reported data.

                <p>by Jannes Jegminat, Simone Carlo Surace, Jean-Pascal Pfister</p>

Most normative models in computational neuroscience describe the task of learning as the optimisation of a cost function with respect to a set of parameters. However, learning as optimisation fails to account for a time-varying environment during the learning process and the resulting point estimate in parameter space does not account for uncertainty. Here, we frame learning as filtering, i.e., a principled method for including time and parameter uncertainty. We derive the filtering-based learning rule for a spiking neuronal network‚Äîthe Synaptic Filter‚Äîand show its computational and biological relevance. For the computational relevance, we show that filtering improves the weight estimation performance compared to a gradient learning rule with optimal learning rate. The dynamics of the mean of the Synaptic Filter is consistent with spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) while the dynamics of the variance makes novel predictions regarding spike-timing dependent changes of EPSP variability. Moreover, the Synaptic Filter explains experimentally observed negative correlations between homo- and heterosynaptic plasticity.

                Development of silver (Ag) modified titanium (Ti) as an antibacterial dental implant has recently been growing. Ag demonstrated an excellent antibacterial property without the risk of bacterial resistance. Hydrothermal treatment using AgNO3 solution is one of the facile and promising methods to modify Ti surface with Ag. However, the effect of high AgNO3 concentration and the absent of a toxic reduction agent has not been clearly studied. In this study, Ti surface was hydrothermally treated in 0.01 mol/L and 0.1 mol/L AgNO3 solutions at 150oC for 24 hours. Analysis of surface morphology using scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray analysis suggested the formation of non-homogenous Ag coating with a tendency to be aggregated and thicken with the increase of AgNO3 concentration. The Ag coating deposited on Ti surface were composed of mainly metallic and some oxide forms. Surface roughness of all AgNO3 treated Ti surface was comparable based on the analysis of surface roughness parameter. In conclusion, hydrothermal treatment of Ti surface in solely AgNO3 solution at high concentration produced non-homogenous Ag coating on its surface without significantly changed surface roughness.

                Adequate adoption of evidence-based practice is deeply rooted in accessing methodological quality and completeness of systematic reviews and meta-analyses reporting. Nonetheless, this assumption might be flawed if the methodological quality assessment has not been properly conducted. Taking the former statement into consideration, this correspondence article encourages the improvement of future tertiary manuscripts, especially in the field of restorative dentistry. Thus, this article addresses an overview of reviews in restorative dentistry¬†as an example of evaluating tertiary evidence for increasing the awareness of reviewers, authors, and readers.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The effect of a siamese pumpkin and tuna-based powder (CHAGURO) diet in improving chol/HDL ratios in prediabetes individuals with dyslipidemia: a randomised trial [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The study aimed to examine the effect of administering CHAGURO (a product of the combination of siamese pumpkin and tuna-based powder) on the lipid profile in prediabetes individuals with dyslipidemia. Methods: The experimental trial was conducted with two intervention groups, with each group receiving a dose of 7.5g/70kg body weight (BW)/day (low dose) and 15g/70kg BW/day (high dose) for 60 days. Respondents were randomized into intervention groups using simple randomization. Before and after the intervention, pre-test and post-test examinations were performed, factors examined included hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), lipid profile, blood pressure, food intake with the SQ-FFQ (Semi Quantitative-Food Frequency Questionnaire) interview, body mass index (BMI), and physical activity using International Physical Activity Questionnaires-Short Form (IPAQ-SF). During the intervention, blood pressure and BMI data were taken before and after the study. Statistical analysis included descriptive tests, independent and paired T-tests, and analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: Compared to the baseline, HbA1c, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides in the two groups did not improve significantly by 60 days. For lipid variables, a significant improvement in the cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein (chol/HDL) ratios were observed when compared against the baseline for the two groups. When comparing the changes between groups, 7.5 g of CHAGURO showed a larger improvement in HDL-C (mean differences: 1.86 mg/dL; 95% CI: -0.86-4.59), compared to 15 g of CHAGURO (mean differences: -3.62 mg/dL; 95% CI: -7.53-0.28). A significant (p<0.05) decrease in the chol/HDL ratio was observed in the 7.5 g CHAGURO group (mean differences: -0.20 mg/dL; 95% CI: -0.39-(-0.01)). Conclusions: CHAGURO can be a functional food alternative to improve the condition of prediabetes people with dyslipidemia.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Coffee by-products as the source of antioxidants: a systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Solid waste from coffee depulping process threatens the organism in environment as it produces organic pollutants. Evidence suggested that coffee by-product could valorize owing to its potential as antioxidant sources. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate antioxidant activity of coffee by-products obtained from different coffee variants (arabica and robusta) and processing methods. Methods: The systematic review was conducted as of May 29, 2021 for records published within the last ten years (2011‚Äì2021) using seven databases: Embase, Medline, BMJ, Web of Science, Science Direct, Cochrane, and PubMed. Data on type of specimen, processing methods, and antioxidant activities were collected based on PRISMA guidelines. Results: Our data suggested that aqueous extract was found to be the most common processing method used to obtain the antioxidant from various coffee by-products, followed by methanol and ethanol extract. A variety of antioxidant properties ranging from strong to low activity was found depending on the variety, type of coffee by-products (cascara, pulp, husk, silverskin, and parchment), and processing technique. Fermentation employing proper bacteria was found effective in improving the yield of bioactive compounds resulting in higher antioxidant capacity. Applications in feedstuffs, foods, beverages, and topical formulation are among the potential utilization of coffee by-products. Conclusion: Coffee by-products contain bioactive compounds possessing antioxidant properties which could be used as additives in foods, beverages, and cosmetics. In particular, their benefits in skin care products require further investigation.

                The ethics of compulsive treatment (CT) is a medical, social and legal discussion that reemerged after the ratification by 181 countries of the 2007 United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD). The optional protocol of the UN-CRPD was ratified by 86 countries aiming to promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights. It also determined the need to review mental health laws as under this light treatment of persons with disabilities, particularly those with mental disorders, cannot accept the use of CT. This selective review of literature aims to clarify inputs from clinical psychiatry adding evidence to the multi-disciplinary¬†discussion. It focuses on how patients experience CT and its impact on their mental health and treatment programs, the reasons for the use of CT versus voluntary treatment and what efforts have been made to reduce, replace and refine the presence of CT in psychiatry.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Eye image effect in the context of pedestrian safety: a French questionnaire study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Human behavior is influenced by the presence of others, which scientists also call ‚Äòthe audience effect‚Äô. The use of social control to produce more cooperative behaviors may positively influence road use and safety. This study uses an online questionnaire to test how eyes images affect the behavior of pedestrians when crossing a road. Different eyes images of men, women and a child with different facial expressions -neutral, friendly and angry- were presented to participants who were asked what they would feel by looking at these images before crossing a signalized road. Participants completed a questionnaire of 20 questions about pedestrian behaviors (PBQ). The questionnaire was received by 1,447 French participants, 610 of whom answered the entire questionnaire. Seventy-one percent of participants were women, and the mean age was 35 ¬± 14 years. Eye images give individuals the feeling they are being observed at 33%, feared at 5% and surprised at 26%, and thus seem to indicate mixed results about avoiding crossing at the red light. The expressions shown in the eyes are also an important factor: feelings of being observed increased by about 10-15% whilst feelings of being scared or inhibited increased by about 5% as the expression changed from neutral to friendly to angry. No link was found between the results of our questionnaire and those of the Pedestrian Behavior Questionnaire (PBQ). This study shows that the use of eye images could reduce illegal crossings by pedestrians, and is thus of key interest as a practical road safety tool. However, the effect is limited and how to increase this nudge effect needs further consideration.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Identification of potential biological targets of oxindole scaffolds via in silico repositioning strategies [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Drug repurposing is an alternative strategy to traditional drug discovery that aims at predicting new uses for already existing drugs or clinical candidates. Drug repurposing has many advantages over traditional drug development, such as reduced attrition rates, time and costs. This is especially the case considering that most drugs investigated for repurposing have already been assessed for their safety in clinical trials. Repurposing campaigns can also be designed for libraries of already synthesized molecules at different levels of biological experimentation, from null to in vitro and in vivo. Such an extension of the ‚Äúrepurposing‚Äù concept is expected to provide significant advantages for the identification of novel drugs, as the synthetic accessibility of the desired compounds is often one of the limiting factors in the traditional drug discovery pipeline. Methods: In this work, we performed a computational repurposing campaign on a library of previously synthesized oxindole-based compounds, in order to identify potential new targets for this versatile scaffold. To this aim, ligand-based approaches were firstly applied to evaluate the similarity degree of the investigated compound library, with respect to ligands extracted from the DrugBank, Protein Data Bank (PDB) and ChEMBL databases. In particular, the 2D fingerprint-based and 3D shape-based similarity profiles were evaluated and compared for the oxindole derivates. Results: The analyses predicted a set of potential candidate targets for repurposing, some of them emerging by consensus of different computational analyses. One of the identified targets, i.e., the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) kinase, was further investigated by means of docking calculations, followed by biological testing of one candidate. Conclusions: While the compound did not show potent inhibitory activity towards VEGFR-2, the study highlighted several other possibilities of therapeutically relevant targets that may be worth of consideration for drug repurposing.

                Background: The purpose of this research was to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice of dental auxiliaries related to oral health care for pregnant patients in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. Methods:¬†A cross-sectional study using a questionnaire survey was conducted. The knowledge, attitude, and practice were rated using the Likert scale out of 5. Knowledge and practice were categorized using Bloom‚Äôs cut off point methods (‚â•80% is good, and <80% is bad). Concerning attitude, (‚â•80% is positive, and <80% is negative). The questionnaires were sent to all dental hygienists and assistants (N=358), and responses were collected from 218. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software was utilixed to conduct statistical analysis. Results:¬†Out of the 358, 218 responded (response rate = 61%).¬†More than half of the respondents showed relatively good knowledge (57.3%). Most respondents had a positive attitude (89.4%). Regarding practice, approximately two-thirds had a good practice (67.4%). The knowledge score of hygienists was significantly higher than dental assistants, and respondents with experience in treating pregnant patients had significantly higher knowledge scores than others who did not have experience in treating pregnant patients. There is a statistically significant positive correlation between practice scores and education. Conclusions:¬†The findings suggest the need to establish continuous education programs and for dental hygienists and dental assistants to adopt the best practice guidelines on perinatal oral health.

<p>The conventional letter n-back task elicited stronger activation in the mild‚Äìmoderate TBI participants than the guided letter n-back. In TBI, there was a right dominance for working memory (WM) in the prefrontal cortex and precentral gyrus. Meanwhile, the load-dependent processing of WM was localized to the left middle frontal gyrus.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Working memory (WM) encompasses crucial cognitive processes or abilities to retain and manipulate temporary information for immediate execution of complex cognitive tasks in daily functioning such as reasoning and decision-making. The WM of individuals sustaining traumatic brain injury (TBI) was commonly compromised, especially in the domain of WM. The current study investigated the brain responses of WM in a group of participants with mild‚Äìmoderate TBI compared to their healthy counterparts employing functional magnetic resonance imaging. All consented participants (healthy: <i>n</i>¬†=¬†26 and TBI: <i>n</i>¬†=¬†15) performed two variations of the n-back WM task with four load conditions (0-, 1-, 2-, and 3-back). The respective within-group effects showed a right hemisphere-dominance activation and slower reaction in performance for the TBI group. Random-effects analysis revealed activation difference between the two groups in the right occipital lobe in the guided n-back with cues, and in the bilateral occipital lobe, superior parietal region, and cingulate cortices in the n-back without cues. The left middle frontal gyrus was implicated in the load-dependent processing of WM in both groups. Further group analysis identified that the notable activation changes in the frontal gyri and anterior cingulate cortex are according to low and high loads. Though relatively smaller in scale, this study was eminent as it clarified the neural alterations in WM in the mild‚Äìmoderate TBI group compared to healthy controls. It confirmed the robustness of the phenomenon in TBI with the reproducibility of the results in a heterogeneous non-Western sample.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">The cerebellum on the epilepsy frontline</a></h4>

              
                In a recent study, Streng and colleagues revealed that targeted activation of a specific fastigial output of the cerebellum can powerfully inhibit hippocampal seizures in mice. This study provides insights into how the cerebellum impacts hippocampal activity and opens the way to possible applications for treating temporal lobe epilepsy.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Unsupervised learning of haptic material properties</a></h4>

              
                When touching the surface of an object, its spatial structure translates into a vibration on the skin. The perceptual system evolved to translate this pattern into a representation that allows to distinguish between different materials. Here, we show that perceptual haptic representation of materials emerges from efficient encoding of vibratory patterns elicited by the interaction with materials. We trained a deep neural network with unsupervised learning (Autoencoder) to reconstruct vibratory patterns elicited by human haptic exploration of different materials. The learned compressed representation (i.e., latent space) allows for classification of material categories (i.e., plastic, stone, wood, fabric, leather/wool, paper, and metal). More importantly, classification performance is higher with perceptual category labels as compared to ground truth ones, and distances between categories in the latent space resemble perceptual distances, suggesting a similar coding. Crucially, the classification performance and the similarity between the perceptual and the latent space decrease with decreasing compression level. We could further show that the temporal tuning of the emergent latent dimensions is similar to properties of human tactile receptors.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Environmental enrichment enhances patterning and remodeling of synaptic nanoarchitecture as revealed by STED nanoscopy</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic plasticity underlies long-lasting structural and functional changes to brain circuitry and its experience-dependent remodeling can be fundamentally enhanced by environmental enrichment. It is however unknown, whether and how the environmental enrichment alters the morphology and dynamics of individual synapses. Here, we present a virtually crosstalk-free two-color <i>in vivo</i> STED microscope to simultaneously superresolve the dynamics of endogenous PSD95 of the post-synaptic density and spine geometry in the mouse cortex. In general, the spine head geometry and PSD95 assemblies were highly dynamic, their changes depended linearly on their original size but correlated only mildly. With environmental enrichment, the size distributions of PSD95 and spine head sizes were sharper than in controls, indicating that synaptic strength is set more uniformly. The topography of the PSD95 nanoorganization was more dynamic after environmental enrichment; changes in size were smaller but more correlated than in mice housed in standard cages. Thus, two-color <i>in vivo</i> time-lapse imaging of synaptic nanoorganization uncovers a unique synaptic nanoplasticity associated with the enhanced learning capabilities under environmental enrichment.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Spatial transcriptomic and single-nucleus analysis reveals heterogeneity in a gigantic single-celled syncytium</a></h4>

              
                In multicellular organisms, the specification, coordination, and compartmentalization of cell types enable the formation of complex body plans. However, some eukaryotic protists such as slime molds generate diverse and complex structures while remaining in a multinucleate syncytial state. It is unknown if different regions of these giant syncytial cells have distinct transcriptional responses to environmental encounters and if nuclei within the cell diversify into heterogeneous states. Here, we performed spatial transcriptome analysis of the slime mold <i>Physarum polycephalum</i> in the plasmodium state under different environmental conditions and used single-nucleus RNA-sequencing to dissect gene expression heterogeneity among nuclei. Our data identifies transcriptome regionality in the organism that associates with proliferation, syncytial substructures, and localized environmental conditions. Further, we find that nuclei are heterogenous in their transcriptional profile and may process local signals within the plasmodium to coordinate cell growth, metabolism, and reproduction. To understand how nuclei variation within the syncytium compares to heterogeneity in single-nucleus cells, we analyzed states in single <i>Physarum</i> amoebal cells. We observed amoebal cell states at different stages of mitosis and meiosis, and identified cytokinetic features that are specific to nuclei divisions within the syncytium. Notably, we do not find evidence for predefined transcriptomic states in the amoebae that are observed in the syncytium. Our data shows that a single-celled slime mold can control its gene expression in a region-specific manner while lacking cellular compartmentalization and suggests that nuclei are mobile processors facilitating local specialized functions. More broadly, slime molds offer the extraordinary opportunity to explore how organisms can evolve regulatory mechanisms to divide labor, specialize, balance competition with cooperation, and perform other foundational principles that govern the logic of life.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">HyDrop enables droplet based single-cell ATAC-seq and single-cell RNA-seq using dissolvable hydrogel beads</a></h4>

              
                Single-cell RNA-seq and single-cell ATAC-seq technologies are used extensively to create cell type atlases for a wide range of organisms, tissues, and disease processes. To increase the scale of these atlases, lower the cost, and pave the way for more specialized multi-ome assays, custom droplet microfluidics may provide solutions complementary to commercial setups. We developed HyDrop, a flexible and open-source droplet microfluidic platform encompassing three protocols. The first protocol involves creating dissolvable hydrogel beads with custom oligos that can be released in the droplets. In the second protocol, we demonstrate the use of these beads for HyDrop-ATAC, a low-cost non-commercial scATAC-seq protocol in droplets. After validating HyDrop-ATAC, we applied it to flash-frozen mouse cortex and generated 7,996 high-quality single-cell chromatin accessibility profiles in a single run. In the third protocol, we adapt both the reaction chemistry and the capture sequence of the barcoded hydrogel bead to capture mRNA, and demonstrate a significant improvement in throughput and sensitivity compared to previous open-source droplet-based scRNA-seq assays (Drop-seq and inDrop). Similarly, we applied HyDrop-RNA to flash-frozen mouse cortex and generated 9,508 single-cell transcriptomes closely matching reference single-cell gene expression data. Finally, we leveraged HyDrop-RNA's high capture rate to analyse a small population of FAC-sorted neurons from the <i>Drosophila</i> brain, confirming the protocol's applicability to low-input samples and small cells. HyDrop is currently capable of generating single-cell data in high throughput and at a reduced cost compared to commercial methods, and we envision that HyDrop can be further developed to be compatible with novel (multi-) omics protocols.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Optogenetic inhibition of actomyosin reveals mechanical bistability of the mesoderm epithelium during Drosophila mesoderm invagination</a></h4>

              
                Apical constriction driven by actin and non-muscle myosin II ('actomyosin') provides a well-conserved mechanism to mediate epithelial folding. It remains unclear how contractile forces near the apical surface of a cell sheet drive out-of-the-plane bending of the sheet and whether myosin contractility is required throughout folding. By optogenetic-mediated acute inhibition of actomyosin, we find that during <i>Drosophila</i> mesoderm invagination, actomyosin contractility is critical to prevent tissue relaxation during the early, 'priming' stage of folding but is dispensable for the actual folding step after the tissue passes through a stereotyped transitional configuration. This binary response suggests that <i>Drosophila </i>mesoderm is mechanically bistable during gastrulation. Computer modeling analysis demonstrates that the binary tissue response to actomyosin inhibition can be recapitulated in the simulated epithelium that undergoes buckling-like deformation jointly mediated by apical constriction in the mesoderm and in-plane compression generated by apicobasal shrinkage of the surrounding ectoderm. Interestingly, comparison between wild type and <i>snail </i>mutants that fail to specify the mesoderm demonstrates that the lateral ectoderm undergoes apicobasal shrinkage during gastrulation independently of mesoderm invagination. We propose that <i>Drosophila</i> mesoderm invagination is achieved through an interplay between local apical constriction and mechanical bistability of the epithelium that facilitates epithelial buckling.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Identification of electroporation sites in the complex lipid organization of the plasma membrane</a></h4>

              
                The plasma membrane of a biological cell is a complex assembly of lipids and membrane proteins, which tightly regulate transmembrane transport. When a cell is exposed to strong electric field, the membrane integrity becomes transiently disrupted by formation of transmembrane pores. This phenomenon termed electroporation is already utilized in many rapidly developing applications in medicine including gene therapy, cancer treatment, and treatment of cardiac arrythmias. However, the molecular mechanisms of electroporation are not yet sufficiently well understood; in particular, it is unclear where exactly pores form in the complex organization of the plasma membrane. In this study we combine coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, machine learning methods, and Bayesian survival analysis to identify how formation of pores depends on the local lipid organization. We show that pores do not form homogeneously across the membrane, but colocalize with domains that have specific features, the most important being high density of polyunsaturated lipids. We further show that knowing the lipid organization is sufficient to reliably predict poration sites with machine learning. Additionally, by analysing poration kinetics with Bayesian survival analysis we show that poration does not depend solely on local lipid arrangement, but also on membrane mechanical properties and the polarity of the electric field. Finally, we discuss how the combination of atomistic and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, machine learning methods, and Bayesian survival analysis can guide the design of future experiments and help us to develop an accurate description of plasma membrane electroporation on the whole-cell level. Achieving this will allow us to shift the optimization of electroporation applications from blind trial-and-error approaches to mechanistic-driven design.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">PEAR, a flexible fluorescent reporter for the identification and enrichment of successfully prime edited cells</a></h4>

              
                Prime editing is a recently developed CRISPR/Cas9 based gene engineering tool that allows the introduction of short insertions, deletions, and substitutions into the genome. However, the efficiency of prime editing, which typically achieves editing rates of around 10%‚Äì30%, has not matched its versatility. Here, we introduce the prime editor activity reporter (PEAR), a sensitive fluorescent tool for identifying single cells with prime editing activity. PEAR has no background fluorescence and specifically indicates prime editing events. Its design provides apparently unlimited flexibility for sequence variation along the entire length of the spacer sequence, making it uniquely suited for systematic investigation of sequence features that influence prime editing activity. The use of PEAR as an enrichment marker for prime editing can increase the edited population by up to 84%, thus significantly improving the applicability of prime editing for basic research and biotechnological applications.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A non-bactericidal cathelicidin provides prophylactic efficacy against bacterial infection by driving phagocyte influx</a></h4>

              
                The roles of bactericidal cathelicidins against bacterial infection have been extensively studied. However, the antibacterial property and mechanism of action of non-bactericidal cathelicidins are rarely known. Herein, a novel naturally occurring cathelicidin (<i>Popu</i>CATH) from tree frog (<i>Polypedates puerensis</i>) did not‚Äôt show any direct anti-bacterial activity in vitro. Intriguingly, intraperitoneal injection of <i>Popu</i>CATH before bacterial inoculation significantly reduced the bacterial load in tree frogs and mice, and reduced the inflammatory response induced by bacterial inoculation in mice. <i>Popu</i>CATH pretreatment also increased the survival rates of septic mice induced by a lethal dose of bacterial inoculation or cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Intraperitoneal injection of <i>Popu</i>CATH significantly drove the leukocyte influx in both frogs and mice. In mice, <i>Popu</i>CATH rapidly drove neutrophil, monocyte/macrophage influx in mouse abdominal cavity and peripheral blood with a negligible impact on T and B lymphocytes, and neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, but not T and B lymphocytes, were required for the preventive efficacy of <i>Popu</i>CATH. <i>Popu</i>CATH did not directly act as chemoattractant for phagocytes, but <i>Popu</i>CATH obviously drove phagocyte migration when it was cultured with macrophages. <i>Popu</i>CATH significantly elicited chemokine/cytokine production in macrophages through activating p38/ERK mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and NF-Œ∫B p65. <i>Popu</i>CATH markedly enhanced neutrophil phagocytosis via promoting the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Additionally, <i>Popu</i>CATH showed low side effects both in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, <i>Popu</i>CATH acts as a host-based immune defense regulator that provides prophylactic efficacy against bacterial infection without direct antimicrobial effects. Our findings reveal a non-bactericidal cathelicidin which possesses unique anti-bacterial action, and highlight the potential of <i>Popu</i>CATH to prevent bacterial infection.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sensory-motor computations in a cortico-pontine pathway</a></h4>

              
                Subcortical circuits decode the output from multiple cortical areas to create commands for movement. By recording during monkeys' smooth pursuit eye movements, we reveal how the dorsolateral pontine nucleus (DLPN) and nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis (NRTP) decode cortical output. Preparatory activity is inherited from the smooth eye movement region of the frontal eye fields (FEFsem). Consistent with its effects on eye movement responses to visual motion, preparatory activity modulates the gain of pontine responses to visual motion input from visual area MT. Furthermore, the "place" code for target speed in area MT becomes the motor command's "rate" code in the pons, through linear weighting of MT's output. The division into decoding that happens in the pons and residual computations that occur downstream reveals that the pons is neither a relay nor the source of a final motor command. It is part of a complex, distributed cortical decoder for motor control.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Chronic neurotransmission increases the susceptibility of lateral-line hair cells to ototoxic insults</a></h4>

              
                Sensory hair cells receive near constant stimulation by omnipresent auditory and vestibular stimuli. To detect and encode these stimuli, hair cells require steady ATP production, which can be accompanied by a buildup of mitochondrial byproducts called reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS buildup is thought to sensitize hair cells to ototoxic insults, including the antibiotic neomycin. Work in neurons has shown that neurotransmission is a major driver of ATP production and ROS buildup. Therefore, we tested whether neurotransmission is a significant contributor to ROS buildup in hair cells. Using genetics and pharmacology, we disrupted two key aspects of neurotransmission in zebrafish hair cells: presynaptic calcium influx and the fusion of synaptic vesicles. We find that chronic block of neurotransmission enhances hair-cell survival when challenged with the ototoxin neomycin. This reduction in ototoxin susceptibility is accompanied by reduced mitochondrial activity, likely due to a reduced ATP demand. In addition, we show that mitochondrial oxidation and ROS buildup is reduced when neurotransmission is blocked. Mechanistically, we find that it is the synaptic vesicle cycle rather than presynaptic- or mitochondrial-calcium influx that contributes most significantly to this metabolic stress. Our results comprehensively indicate that, over time, neurotransmission causes ROS buildup that increases the susceptibility of hair cells to ototoxins.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Neuropsin-based Optogenetic Tool for Precise Control of Gq signaling</a></h4>

              
                Gq-coupled receptors regulate numerous physiological processes by activating enzymes and inducing intracellular Ca2+ signals. There is a strong need for an optogenetic tool that enables powerful experimental control over Gq signaling. Here, we present chicken opsin 5 (cOpn5) as the long sought-after, single-component optogenetic tool that mediates ultra-sensitive optical control of intracellular Gq signaling with high temporal and spatial resolution. Expressing cOpn5 in mammalian cells enables blue light-triggered, Gq-dependent Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and protein kinase C activation. Strong Ca2+ transients were evoked by brief light pulses of merely 10 ms duration and at 3 orders lower light intensity of that for common optogenetic tools. Photostimulation of cOpn5-expressing cells at the subcellular and single-cell levels generated intracellular and intercellular Ca2+ wave propagation, respectively, thus demonstrating the high spatial precision of cOpn5 optogenetics. The cOpn5-mediated optogenetics could also be applied to activate neurons and control animal behavior in a circuit-dependent manner. We further revealed that optogenetic activation of cOpn5-expressing astrocytes induced massive ATP release and modulation neuronal activation in the brain of awake, behaving mice. cOpn5 optogenetics may find broad applications in studying the mechanisms and functional relevance of Gq signaling in both non-excitable cells and excitable cells in all major organ systems.

                Microglia play pivotal roles in central nervous system development, homeostasis, responses to trauma, neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders with significant sex-bias in their symptoms and prevalence. The discovery that the survival of microglia in adult brains depends on the expression of the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), along with the development of the effective brain permeant CSF1R inhibitors PLX5622, has boosted the investigation of the role of microglia in health, disease and in relations to sex-bias. The effectiveness of PLX5622 in examining the role of microglia has mainly been demonstrated in mice. Surprisingly, despite the critical importance of rat models in brain research, there are only 4 publications in which PLX5622 was used to investigate the roles of microglia in adult rats. This has been attributed to the "impression" that PLX5622 is "ineffective in rats". In view of the importance and interest in the role of microglia, the indispensability of rats for in vivo electrophysiological brain studies and behavioral research and the high efficacy of PLX5622-chow in eliminating microglia from adult mice brains, we examined the effects of PLX5622-chow on the elimination of the microglia in adult female and male rats. We found significant differences in microglia elimination by ad libitum PLX5622 feeding in male and female rats in different brain regions with significantly greater effectivity in female brains. Our pragmatic study provides practical information on the use and design of PLX5622 in gender-related and rat brain preclinical microglia research.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Patterns of connectome variability in autism across five functional activation tasks. Fndings from the LEAP project</a></h4>

              
                Background: Autism spectrum disorder (autism) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition with pronounced behavioural, cognitive, and neural heterogeneities across individuals. Here, our goal was to characterise heterogeneity in autism by identifying patterns of neural diversity as reflected in BOLD fMRI in the way individuals with autism engage with a varied array of cognitive tasks. Methods: All analyses were based on the EU-AIMS/AIMS-2-TRIALS multisite Longitudinal European Autism Project (LEAP) with participants with autism and typically developing controls (TD) between 6 and 30 years of age. We employed a novel task-potency approach which combines the unique aspects of both resting-state fMRI and task-fMRI to quantify task-induced variations in the functional connectome. Normative modelling was used to map atypicality of features on an individual basis with respect to their distribution in neurotypical control participants. We applied robust out-of-sample canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to relate connectome data to behavioural data. Results: Deviation from the normative ranges of global functional connectivity was greater for individuals with autism compared to TD in each fMRI task paradigm (all tasks p<0.001). The similarity across individuals of the deviation pattern was significantly increased in autistic relative to TD individuals (p<0.002). The CCA identified significant and robust brain-behavior covariation between functional connectivity atypicality and autism-related behavioral features. Conclusions: Individuals with autism engage with tasks in a globally atypical way, but the particular spatial pattern of this atypicality is nevertheless similar across tasks. Atypicalities in the tasks originate mostly from prefrontal cortex and default mode network regions, but also speech and auditory networks. We show, moving forward, sophisticated modeling methods such as task-potency and normative modeling will prove key to unravelling complex heterogeneous conditions like autism.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A model of colour appearance based on efficient coding of natural images</a></h4>

              
                An object's colour, brightness and pattern are all influenced by its surroundings, and a number of visual phenomena and "illusions" have been discovered that highlight these often dramatic effects. Explanations for these phenomena range from low-level neural mechanisms to high-level processes that incorporate contextual information or prior knowledge. Importantly, few of these phenomena can currently be accounted for when measuring an object's perceived colour. Here we ask to what extent colour appearance is predicted by a model based on the principle of coding efficiency. The model assumes that the image is encoded by noisy spatio-chromatic filters at one octave separations, which are either circularly symmetrical or oriented. Each spatial band's lower threshold is set by the contrast sensitivity function, and the dynamic range of the band is a fixed multiple of this threshold, above which the response saturates. Filter outputs are then reweighted to give equal power in each channel for natural images. We demonstrate that the model fits human behavioural performance in psychophysics experiments, and also primate retinal ganglion responses. Next we systematically test the model's ability to qualitatively predict over 35 brightness and colour phenomena, with almost complete success. This implies that contrary to high-level processing explanations, much of colour appearance is potentially attributable to simple mechanisms evolved for efficient coding of natural images, and is a basis for modelling the vision of humans and other animals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Wide-field Calcium Imaging Reveals Widespread Changes in Cortical Connectivity Following Repetitive, Mild Traumatic Brain Injury in the Mouse</a></h4>

              
                The physiologic basis underlying the long-term consequences of repetitive, mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) remains poorly understood. Mild traumatic brain injury often results in brief loss of consciousness, impaired attention and concentration, memory problems, impulsivity, and headache, without objective findings on clinical imaging or examination. The effects of mTBI can persist and become cumulative with repetitive injury, suggesting global alterations in cortical networks. Using transparent polymer skulls, we performed mesoscopic Ca2+ imaging in mice to evaluate how repetitive mTBI alters patterns of neuronal interactions across the dorsal cerebral cortex. Spatial Independent Component Analysis (sICA) and Localized semi-Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (LocaNMF) were used to quantify changes in cerebral functional connectivity (FC). Repetitive, mild, controlled cortical impacts induce temporary neuroinflammatory responses, characterized by increased density of microglia exhibiting de-ramified morphology. These temporary neuro-inflammatory changes were not associated with compromised cognitive performance in the Barnes maze or motor function as assessed by rotarod. However, long-term alterations in functional connectivity were observed. Widespread, bilateral changes in FC occurred immediately following impact and persisted for up to 7 weeks, the duration of the experiment. Network alterations include decreases in global efficiency, clustering coefficient, and nodal strength, thereby disrupting functional interactions and information flow throughout the dorsal cerebral cortex. A subnetwork analysis shows the largest disruptions in FC were concentrated near the impact site. Therefore, repetitive mTBI induces a transient neuroinflammation, without alterations in cognitive or motor behavior, and a reorganized cortical network evidenced by the widespread, chronic alterations in cortical FC.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural Kernels for Recursive Support Vector Regression as a Model for Episodic Memory</a></h4>

              
                Retrieval of episodic memories requires intrinsic reactivation of neuronal activity patterns. The content of the memories are thereby assumed to be stored in synaptic connections. This paper proposes a theory in which these are the synaptic connections that specifically convey the temporal order information contained in the sequences of a neuronal reservoir to the sensory-motor cortical areas that give rise to the subjective impression of retrieval of sensory motor events. The theory is based on a novel recursive version of support vector regression that allows for efficient continuous learning that is only limited by the representational capacity of the reservoir. The paper argues that hippocampal theta sequences are a potential neural substrate underlying this reservoir.The theory is consistent with confabulations and post-hoc alterations of existing memories.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Associative memory of structured knowledge</a></h4>

              
                A long standing challenge in biological and artificial intelligence is to understand how new knowledge can be constructed from known building blocks in a way that is amenable for computation by neuronal circuits. Here we focus on the task of storage and recall of structured knowledge in long-term memory. Specifically, we ask how recurrent neuronal networks can store and retrieve multiple knowledge structures. We model each structure as a set of binary relations between events and attributes (attributes may represent e.g., temporal order, spatial location, role in semantic structure), and map each structure to a distributed neuronal activity pattern using a vector symbolic architecture (VSA) scheme. We then use associative memory plasticity rules to store the binarized patterns as fixed points in a recurrent network. By a combination of signal-to-noise analysis and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that our model allows for efficient storage of these knowledge structures, such that the memorized structures as well as their individual building blocks (e.g., events and attributes) can be subsequently retrieved from partial retrieving cues. We show that long-term memory of structured knowledge relies on a new principle of computation beyond the memory basins. Finally, we show that our model can be extended to store sequences of memories as single attractors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Influence of claustrum on cortex varies by area, layer, and cell type</a></h4>

              
                The claustrum is a small subcortical structure with widespread connections with disparate regions of the cortex. These far-reaching projections have led to many hypotheses concerning its function. However, we know little about how claustrum input affects neural activity in cortex, particularly beyond frontal areas. Here, using optogenetics and multi-regional Neuropixels recordings from over 15,000 neurons in awake mice, we demonstrate that the effect of claustrum input differs depending on brain area, layer, and cell type. Brief claustrum stimulation produces approximately 1 spike per claustrum neuron, which affects many fast-spiking (FS; putative inhibitory) but very few regular-spiking (RS; putative excitatory) cortical neurons. Prolonged claustrum stimulation affects many more cortical FS and RS neurons. More inhibition occurs in frontal regions and deeper layers, while more excitation occurs in posterior regions and superficial layers. These differences imply that the function of claustrum input to cortex depends on the area, supporting the idea that claustro-cortical circuits are organized into functional modules.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Long-term learning transforms prefrontal cortex selectivity during working memory</a></h4>

              
                The lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC) is reliably active during working memory (WM) across human and animal models, but the role of lPFC in successful WM is under debate. For instance, non-human primate (NHP) electrophysiology research finds that lPFC circuitry stores WM representations. Human neuroimaging instead suggests that lPFC plays a control function over WM content that is stored in sensory cortices. These seemingly incompatible WM accounts are often confounded by differences in the amount of task training and stimulus exposure across studies (i.e., NHPs tend to be trained extensively). Here, we test the possibility that such long-term training may alter the role of lPFC in WM maintenance. We densely sampled WM-related activity across learning, in three human participants, using a longitudinal functional MRI (fMRI) protocol. Over three months, participants trained on (1) a serial reaction time (SRT) task, wherein complex fractal stimuli were embedded within probabilistic sequences, and (2) a delayed recognition task probing WM for trained or novel stimuli. Participants were scanned frequently throughout training, to track how WM activity patterns change with repeated stimulus exposure and long-term associative learning. WM task performance improved for trained (but not novel) fractals and, neurally, delay activity significantly increased in distributed lPFC voxels across learning. Pattern similarity analyses also found that item-level WM representations emerged within lPFC, but not in sensory cortices, and lPFC delay activity increasingly reflected sequence relationships from the SRT task, even though that information was task-irrelevant for WM. These findings demonstrate that human lPFC develops stimulus-selective WM responses with learning and WM representations are shaped by long-term experience. Influences from training and long-term memory may reconcile competing accounts of lPFC function during WM.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamic Sex Differences in Reactive and Appetitive Aggression</a></h4>

              
                Background: Aggression is an evolutionarily conserved, adaptive component of social behavior. Studies in male mice illustrate that aggression is influenced by numerous factors including the degree to which an individual finds aggression rewarding and will work for access to attack and subordinate mice. While such studies have expanded our understanding of the molecular and circuit mechanisms of male aggression very little is known about female aggression, owed in part to limited availability of valid mouse models in females. Methods: Here we use an ethologically relevant model of male vs. female aggression by pair housing adult male and female outbred CFW mice with opposite sex cage mates. We assess reactive (defensive) aggression in the resident intruder (RI) test and appetitive (rewarding) aggression in the aggression conditioned place preference (CPP) and operant self-administration (SA) tests. Results: Our results show dramatic sex differences in both qualitative and quantitative aspects of reactive vs. appetitive aggression. Males exhibit more wrestling and less investigative behavior during RI, find aggression rewarding and will work for access to a subordinate to attack. Females exhibit more bites, alternate between aggressive behaviors and investigative behaviors more readily during RI, however, they do not find aggression to be rewarding or reinforcing. Conclusions: These results establish sex differences in aggression in mice, providing an important resource for the field to better understand the circuit and molecular mechanisms of aggression in both sexes.

	<p>The pathophysiology of stoke involves many complex pathways and risk factors. Though there are several ongoing studies on stroke, treatment options are limited, and the prevalence of stroke is continuing to increase. Understanding the genomic variants and biological pathways associated with stroke could offer novel therapeutic alternatives in terms of drug targets and receptor modulations for newer treatment methods. It is challenging to identify individual causative mutations in a single gene because many alleles are responsible for minor effects. Therefore, multiple factorial analyses using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) could be used to gain new insight by identifying potential genetic risk factors. There are many studies, such as Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PheWAS) which have identified numerous independent loci associated with stroke, which could be instrumental in developing newer drug targets and novel therapies. Additionally, using analytical techniques, such as meta-analysis and Mendelian randomization could help in evaluating stroke risk factors and determining treatment priorities. Combining SNPs into polygenic risk scores and lifestyle risk factors could detect stroke risk at a very young age and help in administering preventive interventions.</p>

	<p>Currently, there is little understanding of how interoceptive attentiveness (IA) affects brain responses during synchronized cognitive or motor tasks. This pilot study explored the effect of explicit IA manipulation on hemodynamic correlates of simple cognitive tasks implying linguistic or motor synchronization. Eighteen healthy participants completed two linguistic and motor synchronization tasks during explicit IA and control conditions while oxygenated (O2Hb) and deoxygenated (HHb) hemoglobin variations were recorded by functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). The findings suggested that the brain regions associated with sustained attention, such as the right prefrontal cortex (PFC), were more involved when an explicit focus on the breath was induced during the cognitive linguistic task requiring synchronization with a partner, as indicated by increased O2Hb. Interestingly, this effect was not significant for the motor task. In conclusion, for the first time, this pilot research found increased activity in neuroanatomical regions that promote sustained attention, attention reorientation, and synchronization when a joint task is carried out and the person is focusing on their physiological body reactions. Moreover, the results suggested that the benefits of conscious concentration on physiological interoceptive correlates while executing a task demanding synchronization, particularly verbal alignment, may be related to the right PFC.</p>

	<p>Pain and suffering in persons with disorders of consciousness (DoC) remain poorly understood, frequently unaddressed or inadequately addressed, and controversial on numerous levels. This narrative literature review will address a number of critical issues germane to pain and suffering in this challenging group of patients, providing an introductory overview of the topic, perspectives on current knowledge regarding pain pathoanatomy and pathophysiology, and a review of common pain generators and factors that can lead to the chronifcation of pain. Caveats on bedside pain assessment challenges, as well as electrophysiologic and neuroimaging findings in these patients, will also be explored. Pain management techniques, including non-pharmacological and pharmacological, will be reviewed. Ethical considerations in the context of pain and suffering in persons with disorders of consciousness will round out the review prior to our concluding comments.</p>

	<p>In public discourse, the sense of smell is typically characterized as the least important of the five senses. However, there are very little empirical data on this topic. Recently, much more attention has been brought to the sense of smell since olfactory dysfunction is a primary and often long-term symptom of COVID-19 infection. It was therefore of interest to expand research on the perceived value of olfaction in the current cultural condition. We developed a survey that directly compared the value of the senses of smell, hearing, and vision with each other and in relation to nine common items representing digital, material, personal, and physical commodities of varying social and emotional meaningfulness (phone, $10,000, favorite social media, online shopping, favorite streaming service, dream vacation, pet, hair, little left toe). In total, four hundred and seven female and male respondents comprising two life-stage groups (college students, general public adults) participated in our online survey study during winter&amp;amp;ndash;spring of 2021. The results reveal that the sense of smell was perceived as vastly less important than vision and hearing and much less valuable than various common commodities. We also found that life-stage and gender mediated our findings. For example, one-quarter of the college student respondents would give up their sense of smell in order to keep their phone and nearly half of all women would give up their sense of smell to keep their hair. Our data further illustrate that the senses of vision and hearing are valued relatively similarly. A number of questions arise from the present data and suggestions for ways in which our survey can be expanded and altered to address further research are discussed.</p>

	<p>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is effective in the treatment of depression. However, for the subset of patients with bipolar disorder, less data is available and overall strength of evidence is weaker than for its use in unipolar depression. A cohort of 505 patients (of which 46 had a diagnosis of bipolar disorder) with depression who were treated with rTMS were analyzed retrospectively with regards to their response to several weeks of treatment. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) was assessed as main outcome. Unipolar and bipolar patients with depression did not differ significantly in baseline demographic variables or severity of depression. Both groups did not differ significantly in their response to treatment as indicated by absolute and relative changes in the HDRS and response and remission rates. On HDRS subitem-analysis, bipolar patients showed superior amelioration of the symptom &amp;amp;ldquo;paranoid symptoms&amp;amp;rdquo; in a statistically significant manner. In conclusion, depressed patients with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder benefit from rTMS in a similar fashion as patients with unipolar depression in a naturalistic setting. rTMS might be more effective in reducing paranoia in bipolar than in unipolar patients.</p>

Their phase and amplitude independently predict cortical excitability and subsequent perceptual performance. However, the causal role of &alpha; phase-amplitude tradeoffs on visual perception remains ill-defined. We aimed to fill this gap and tested two clear predictions from the pulsed inhibition theory according to which &alpha; oscillations are associated with periodic functional inhibition. (1) High-&alpha; amplitude induces cortical inhibition at specific phases, associated with low perceptual performance, while at opposite phases, inhibition decreases (potentially increasing excitation) and perceptual performance increases. (2) Low-&alpha; amplitude is less susceptible to these phasic (periodic) pulses of inhibition, leading to overall higher perceptual performance. Here, cortical excitability was assessed in humans using phosphene (illusory) perception induced by single pulses of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied over visual cortex at perceptual threshold, and its postpulse evoked activity recorded with simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG). We observed that prepulse &alpha; phase modulates the probability to perceive a phosphene, predominantly for high-&alpha; amplitude, with a nonoptimal phase for phosphene perception between &ndash;/2 and &ndash;/4. The prepulse nonoptimal phase further leads to an increase in postpulse-evoked activity [event-related potential (ERP)], in phosphene-perceived trials specifically. Together, these results show that &alpha; oscillations create periodic inhibitory moments when &alpha; amplitude is high, leading to periodic decrease of perceptual performance. This study provides strong causal evidence in favor of the pulsed inhibition theory.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Late-Onset Behavioral and Synaptic Consequences of L-Type Ca2+ Channel Activation in the Basolateral Amygdala of Developing Rats</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Postnatal CNS development is fine-tuned to drive the functional needs of succeeding life stages; accordingly, the emergence of sensory and motor functions, behavioral patterns and cognitive abilities relies on a complex interplay of signaling pathways. Strictly regulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling mediated by L-type channels (LTCCs) is crucial in neural circuit development and aberrant increases in neuronal LTCC activity are linked to neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. In the amygdala, a brain region that integrates signals associated with aversive and rewarding stimuli, LTCCs contribute to NMDA-independent long-term potentiation (LTP) and are required for the consolidation and extinction of fear memory. <I>In vitro</I> studies have elucidated distinct electrophysiological and synaptic properties characterizing the transition from immature to functionally mature basolateral subdivision of the amygdala (BLA) principal neurons. Further, acute increase of LTCC activity selectively regulates excitability and spontaneous synaptic activity in immature BLA neurons, suggesting an age-dependent regulation of BLA circuitry by LTCCs. This study aimed to elucidate whether early life alterations in LTCC activity subsequently affect synaptic strength and amygdala-dependent behaviors in early adulthood. <I>In vivo</I> intra-amygdala injection of an LTCC agonist at a critical period of postnatal neurodevelopment in male rat pups was used to examine synaptic plasticity of BLA excitatory inputs, expression of immediate early genes (IEGs) and glutamate receptors, as well as anxiety and social affiliation behaviors at a juvenile age. Results indicate that enhanced LTCC activity in immature BLA principal neurons trigger persistent changes in the developmental trajectory to modify membrane properties and synaptic LTP at later stages, concomitant with alterations in amygdala-related behavioral patterns.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Oxytocin Facilitates Allomaternal Behavior under Stress in Laboratory Mice</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Oxytocin (Oxt) controls reproductive physiology and various kinds of social behaviors, but the exact contribution of Oxt to different components of parental care still needs to be determined. Here, we illustrate the neuroanatomical relations of the parental nurturing-induced neuronal activation with magnocellular Oxt neurons and fibers in the medial preoptic area (MPOA), the brain region critical for parental and alloparental behaviors. We used genetically-targeted mouse lines for <I>Oxt</I>, <I>Oxt receptor</I> (<I>Oxtr</I>), <I>vasopressin receptor 1a</I> (<I>Avpr1a</I>), <I>vasopressin receptor 1b</I> (<I>Avpr1b</I>), and <I>thyrotropin-releasing hormone</I> (<I>Trh</I>) to systematically examine the role of Oxt-related signaling in pup-directed behaviors. The <I>Oxtr</I>-<I>Avpr1a</I>-<I>Avpr1b</I> triple knock-out (TKO), and <I>Oxt</I>-<I>Trh</I>-<I>Avpr1a</I>-<I>Avpr1b</I> quadruple KO (QKO) mice were grossly healthy and fertile, except for their complete deficiency in milk ejection and modest deficiency in parturition secondary to maternal loss of the <I>Oxt</I> or <I>Oxtr</I> gene. In our minimal stress conditions, pup-directed behaviors in TKO and QKO mothers and fathers, virgin females and males were essentially indistinguishable from those of their littermates with other genotypes. However, <I>Oxtr</I> KO virgin females did show decreased pup retrieval in the pup-exposure assay performed right after restraint stress. This stress vulnerability in the <I>Oxtr</I> KO was abolished by the additional <I>Avpr1b</I> KO. The general stress sensitivity, as measured by plasma cortisol elevation after restraint stress or by the behavioral performance in the open field (OF) and elevated plus maze (EPM), were not altered in the <I>Oxtr</I> KO but were reduced in the <I>Avpr1b</I> KO females, indicating that the balance of neurohypophysial hormones affects the outcome of pup-directed behaviors.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Tolerability of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in patients with postural tachycardia syndrome: a cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a form of autonomic dysregulation. There is increasing evidence that the etiology may be immune-mediated in a subgroup of patients. Patients with POTS often experience an exacerbation of their symptoms associated with (viral) infections and often fear the same symptom aggravation after vaccination. In this report we describe the tolerability of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines against coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) and the consequences of a COVID-19 infection on POTS symptoms in our cohort of patients with neuropathic POTS. Methods: We conducted a standardized, checklist-based interview with 23 patients and recorded the acute side effects of mRNA vaccination, acute symptoms of COVID-19 infection as well as the effects of vaccination and COVID-19 infection on POTS symptoms. Results: Of all included patients, 20 patients received two mRNA vaccines without having had a previous COVID-19 infection, and five patients in total had suffered a COVID-19 infection. Of these, three had COVID-19 without and two after being vaccinated. No increased frequency of side effects after both doses of mRNA vaccines was observed. Six patients reported a mild and short-term aggravation of their POTS symptoms beyond the duration of acute vaccine side effects. All five patients who suffered a COVID-19 infection subsequently reported a pronounced and persistent exacerbation of POTS symptoms. Conclusions: Our observations suggest that mRNA vaccines are not associated with a higher frequency of acute side effects in patients with POTS. Symptom exacerbation as a consequence of mRNA vaccination seems to be less frequent and of shorter duration compared to patients who suffered a COVID-19 infection.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Association between the body mass index, waist circumference, and body fat percentage with erosive esophagitis in adults with obesity after sleeve gastrectomy [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: High anthropometric indexes before sleeve gastrectomy (SG) are associated with an increased risk of erosive esophagitis (EE) in bariatric surgery candidates. Reasons that explain how these indexes influence the development of esophageal pathology after surgery remains unclear. Objectives: To assess the association between the body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and body fat percentage (BFP) with the development of EE in adults with obesity three months after SG. Setting: Cl√≠nica Avenda√±o, Lima, Peru. Methods: Retrospective cohort using a database including adults with obesity who underwent SG during 2017-2020. All the patients included had an endoscopy before and after the surgery. Sociodemographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics were compared according to BMI, WC and BFP, as well as by the development of de novo esophagitis. The association was evaluated by crude and adjusted generalized linear models with the log-Poisson family. Results: From a total of 106 patients, 23 (21.7%) developed EE. We did not find significant differences in sociodemographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics between patients with de novo EE compared to those who did not develop EE. After adjustment, BMI (aRR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.18-1.40), BFP (aRR = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.15-1.19) and WC (aRR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.69-1.16) were not associated with the development of EE three months post SG. Conclusions: We found no association between preoperative anthropometric indexes and the development of de novo EE; therefore, morbid obesity should not be a criterion to exclude the patients to undergo SG as primary surgery because of the risk of developing EE.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">RecPD: A Recombination-aware measure of phylogenetic diversity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Cedoljub Bundalovic-Torma, Darrell Desveaux, David S. Guttman</p>

A critical step in studying biological features (e.g., genetic variants, gene families, metabolic capabilities, or taxa) is assessing their diversity and distribution among a sample of individuals. Accurate assessments of these patterns are essential for linking features to traits or outcomes of interest and understanding their functional impact. Consequently, it is of crucial importance that the measures employed for quantifying feature diversity can perform robustly under any evolutionary scenario. However, the standard measures used for quantifying and comparing the distribution of features, such as prevalence, phylogenetic diversity, and related approaches, either do not take into consideration evolutionary history, or assume strictly vertical patterns of inheritance. Consequently, these approaches cannot accurately assess diversity for features that have undergone recombination or horizontal transfer. To address this issue, we have devised RecPD, a novel recombination-aware phylogenetic-diversity statistic for measuring the distribution and diversity of features under all evolutionary scenarios. RecPD utilizes ancestral-state reconstruction to map the presence / absence of features onto ancestral nodes in a species tree, and then identifies potential recombination events in the evolutionary history of the feature. We also derive several related measures from RecPD that can be used to assess and quantify evolutionary dynamics and correlation of feature evolutionary histories. We used simulation studies to show that RecPD reliably reconstructs feature evolutionary histories under diverse recombination and loss scenarios. We then applied RecPD in two diverse real-world scenarios including a preliminary study type III effector protein families secreted by the plant pathogenic bacterium <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> and growth phenotypes of the <i>Pseudomonas</i> genus and demonstrate that prevalence is an inadequate measure that obscures the potential impact of recombination. We believe RecPD will have broad utility for revealing and quantifying complex evolutionary processes for features at any biological level.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Retinal optic flow during natural locomotion</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jonathan Samir Matthis, Karl S. Muller, Kathryn L. Bonnen, Mary M. Hayhoe</p>

We examine the structure of the visual motion projected on the retina during natural locomotion in real world environments. Bipedal gait generates a complex, rhythmic pattern of head translation and rotation in space, so without gaze stabilization mechanisms such as the vestibular-ocular-reflex (VOR) a walker‚Äôs visually specified heading would vary dramatically throughout the gait cycle. The act of fixation on stable points in the environment nulls image motion at the fovea, resulting in stable patterns of outflow on the retinae centered on the point of fixation. These outflowing patterns retain a higher order structure that is informative about the stabilized trajectory of the eye through space. We measure this structure by applying the curl and divergence operations on the retinal flow velocity vector fields and found features that may be valuable for the control of locomotion. In particular, the sign and magnitude of foveal curl in retinal flow specifies the body‚Äôs trajectory relative to the gaze point, while the point of maximum divergence in the retinal flow field specifies the walker‚Äôs instantaneous overground velocity/momentum vector in retinotopic coordinates. Assuming that walkers can determine the body position relative to gaze direction, these time-varying retinotopic cues for the body‚Äôs momentum could provide a visual control signal for locomotion over complex terrain. In contrast, the temporal variation of the eye-movement-free, head-centered flow fields is large enough to be problematic for use in steering towards a goal. Consideration of optic flow in the context of real-world locomotion therefore suggests a re-evaluation of the role of optic flow in the control of action during natural behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Allele imputation for the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor KIR3DL1/S1</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Genelle F. Harrison, Laura Ann Leaton, Erica A. Harrison, Katherine M. Kichula, Marte K. Viken, Jonathan Shortt, Christopher R. Gignoux, Benedicte A. Lie, Damjan Vukcevic, Stephen Leslie, Paul J. Norman</p>

Highly polymorphic interaction of KIR3DL1 and KIR3DS1 with HLA class I ligands modulates the effector functions of natural killer (NK) cells and some T cells. This genetically determined diversity affects severity of infections, immune-mediated diseases, and some cancers, and impacts the course of immunotherapies, including transplantation. KIR3DL1 is an inhibitory receptor, and KIR3DS1 is an activating receptor encoded by the <i>KIR3DL1/S1</i> gene that has more than 200 diverse and divergent alleles. Determination of <i>KIR3DL1/S1</i> genotypes for medical application is hampered by complex sequence and structural variation, requiring targeted approaches to generate and analyze high-resolution allele data. To overcome these obstacles, we developed and optimized a model for imputing <i>KIR3DL1/S1</i> alleles at high-resolution from whole-genome SNP data. We designed the model to represent a substantial component of human genetic diversity. Our Global imputation model is effective at genotyping <i>KIR3DL1/S1</i> alleles with an accuracy ranging from 88% in Africans to 97% in East Asians, with mean specificity of 99% and sensitivity of 95% for alleles >1% frequency. We used the established algorithm of the HIBAG program, in a modification named Pulling Out Natural killer cell Genomics (PONG). Because HIBAG was designed to impute <i>HLA</i> alleles also from whole-genome SNP data, PONG allows combinatorial diversity of <i>KIR3DL1/S1</i> with <i>HLA-A</i> and <i>-B</i> to be analyzed using complementary techniques on a single data source. The use of PONG thus negates the need for targeted sequencing data in very large-scale association studies where such methods might not be tractable.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Insights into the role of noradrenaline in effortful decisions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kristin Kaduk, Fadila Hadj-Bouziane</p>

To maintain homeostasis, our brain tracks the effort exerted during decision-making. A new study in PLOS Biology shows that the activity of noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) reflects the effort exerted to face cognitive or physical challenges.
Every decision we make involves costs and benefits that we implicitly weigh. As our energetic resources are finite, the general consensus is that we naturally tend to minimize the costs while maximizing benefits (reward). Reward value is discounted by the effort invested and/or its perception, and so there is a natural tendency for animals and humans alike to avoid pursuing rewarding options that require effort.

Because our energetic resources are limited, our brain needs to monitor effort to optimise behavioral choices and avoid fatigue. This Primer explores the implications of a recent PLOS Biology study showing that the activity of noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus reflects the amount of effort exerted to face costly cognitive or physical challenges, a signal that might help promote behavioral adaptation depending on context and our needs.

                <p>by Wanassa Beroual, Karine Pr√©vost, David Lalaouna, Nadia Ben Zaina, Odile Valette, Yann Denis, Meriem Djendli, Ga√´l Brasseur, Matteo Brilli, Marta Robledo Garrido, Jose-Ignacio Jimenez-Zurdo, Eric Mass√©, Emanuele G. Biondi</p>

Bacteria are powerful models for understanding how cells divide and accomplish global regulatory programs. In <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i>, a cascade of essential master regulators supervises the correct and sequential activation of DNA replication, cell division, and development of different cell types. Among them, the response regulator CtrA plays a crucial role coordinating all those functions. Here, for the first time, we describe the role of a novel factor named CcnA (cell cycle noncoding RNA A), a cell cycle‚Äìregulated noncoding RNA (ncRNA) located at the origin of replication, presumably activated by CtrA, and responsible for the accumulation of CtrA itself. In addition, CcnA may be also involved in the inhibition of translation of the S-phase regulator, GcrA, by interacting with its 5‚Ä≤ untranslated region (5‚Ä≤ UTR). Performing in vitro experiments and mutagenesis, we propose a mechanism of action of CcnA based on liberation (<i>ctrA</i>) or sequestration (<i>gcrA</i>) of their ribosome-binding site (RBS). Finally, its role may be conserved in other alphaproteobacterial species, such as <i>Sinorhizobium meliloti</i>, representing indeed a potentially conserved process modulating cell cycle in <i>Caulobacterales</i> and <i>Rhizobiales</i>.

The 2 major molecular switches in biology, kinases and GTPases, are both contained in the Parkinson disease‚Äìrelated leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2). Using hydrogen‚Äìdeuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we generated a comprehensive dynamic allosteric portrait of the C-terminal domains of LRRK2 (LRRK2<sub>RCKW</sub>). We identified 2 helices that shield the kinase domain and regulate LRRK2 conformation and function. One helix in COR-B (COR-B Helix) tethers the COR-B domain to the Œ±C helix of the kinase domain and faces its activation loop, while the C-terminal helix (Ct-Helix) extends from the WD40 domain and interacts with both kinase lobes. The Ct-Helix and the N-terminus of the COR-B Helix create a ‚Äúcap‚Äù that regulates the N-lobe of the kinase domain. Our analyses reveal allosteric sites for pharmacological intervention and confirm the kinase domain as the central hub for conformational control.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A DNA replication-independent function of pre-replication complex genes during cell invasion in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Evelyn Lattmann, Ting Deng, Michael Walser, Patrizia Widmer, Charlotte Rexha-Lambert, Vibhu Prasad, Ossia Eichhoff, Michael Daube, Reinhard Dummer, Mitchell P. Levesque, Alex Hajnal</p>

Cell invasion is an initiating event during tumor cell metastasis and an essential process during development. A screen of <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i> orthologs of genes overexpressed in invasive human melanoma cells has identified several components of the conserved DNA pre-replication complex (pre-RC) as positive regulators of anchor cell (AC) invasion. The pre-RC genes function cell-autonomously in the G1-arrested AC to promote invasion, independently of their role in licensing DNA replication origins in proliferating cells. While the helicase activity of the pre-RC is necessary for AC invasion, the downstream acting DNA replication initiation factors are not required. The pre-RC promotes the invasive fate by regulating the expression of extracellular matrix genes and components of the PI3K signaling pathway. Increasing PI3K pathway activity partially suppressed the AC invasion defects caused by pre-RC depletion, suggesting that the PI3K pathway is one critical pre-RC target. We propose that the pre-RC, or a part of it, acts in the postmitotic AC as a transcriptional regulator that facilitates the switch to an invasive phenotype.

                Background: The COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia has been ongoing for a year as at time of writing, since March 2020. Vaccination interventions are public health efforts that are arguably the most effective in the current pandemic situation, in addition to routine health protocols. Until now, there have been few reports of the effectiveness of vaccination and antibody titers formed after vaccination is carried out. This study aims to find out the difference in antibody titers after vaccination in confirmed COVID-19 cases. Methods: This observational study investigated the difference in SARS-Cov-2 quantitative antibody titers between two cohorts: unvaccinated COVID patients who were confirmed -with COVID-19 and individuals undergoing vaccination at the hospital Prof. dr. R. D. Kandou Manado. Inclusion and exclusion criteria, statistical analysis, and research ethics were applied in the study. Results: Antibody titers in survivor groups were relatively lower at 56 days and 84 days after COVID-19 diagnosis, while the antibody titer in the elderly group undergoing vaccination relatively increased at 56 days and 84 days after the first vaccination. There was a significant difference in antibody titers between a group of survivors and those who underwent vaccination on the first (28 days) and third (84 days). Conclusions: From this study, it was found that in the naturally COVID-19-infected group, antibody titers were still found for 84 days after COVID-19 diagnosis. In the group undergoing vaccination, it was found that antibody titers increased significantly at 56 days after vaccination.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">From mechanisms to functions: The role of theta and gamma coherence in the intrahippocampal circuits</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Brain rhythms are essential for information processing in neuronal networks. Oscillations recorded in different brain regions can be synchronized and have a constant phase difference, that is, they can be coherent. Coherence between local field potential (LFP) signals from different brain regions may be correlated with the performance of cognitive tasks, indicating that these regions of the brain are jointly involved in the information processing. Why does coherence occur and how is it related to the information transfer between different regions of the hippocampal formation? In this article, we discuss possible mechanisms of theta and gamma coherence and its role in the hippocampus-dependent attention and memory processes, since theta and gamma rhythms are most pronounced in these processes. We review in vivo studies of interactions between different regions of the hippocampal formation in theta and gamma frequency bands. The key propositions of the review are as follows: (1) coherence emerges from synchronous postsynaptic currents in principal neurons as a result of synchronization of neuronal spike activity; (2) the synchronization of neuronal spike patterns in two regions of the hippocampal formation can be realized through induction or resonance; (3) coherence at a specific time point reflects the transfer of information between the regions of the hippocampal formation; (4) the physiological roles of theta and gamma coherence are different due to their different functions and mechanisms of generation. All hippocampal neurons are involved in theta activity, and theta coherence arranges the firing order of principal neurons throughout the hippocampal formation. In contrast, gamma coherence reflects the coupling of active neuronal ensembles. Overall, the coherence of LFPs between different areas of the brain is an important physiological process based on the synchronized neuronal firing, and it is essential for cooperative information processing.</p>

                Browning of white adipose tissue is a potential way to suppress obesity. Here, Lee et¬†al. identify SENP2, a SUMO de-conjugating enzyme, as a browning inhibitor. Beige adipocytes are accumulated in white adipose tissue of adipocyte-specific SENP2 knockout mice. Increase of C/EBPŒ≤ sumoylation suppresses HOXC10 transcription, which promotes beige adipogenesis.

                Morabito et¬†al. show that vesicular zinc selectively inhibits synaptic NMDARs in an activity-dependent manner in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons. Removing zinc modulation of NMDARs alters dendritic computations as well as LTP induction. Modeling suggests that such a mechanism can maintain dendritic integration constant across different regimes of neuronal activity.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Identification and characterization of long non-coding RNA Carip in modulating spatial learning and memory</a></h4>

              
                Cui et¬†al. demonstrate that CaMKIIŒ≤-associated long non-coding RNA Carip affects the phosphorylation of AMPA receptor and NMDA receptor subunits. Carip deficiency significantly attenuates the excitatory synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation of the CA3-CA1 synapses in the mouse hippocampus, leading to spatial learning and memory deficits.
