                arXiv:2512.07842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of cortical dynamics during different states such as decision making, sleep and movement, is an important topic in Neuroscience. Modelling efforts aim to relate the neural rhythms present in cortical recordings to the underlying dynamics responsible for their emergence. We present an effort to characterize the neural activity from the cortex of a mouse during natural sleep, captured through local field potential measurements. Our approach relies on using a discretized Wilson--Cowan Amari neural field model for neural activity, along with a data assimilation method that allows the Bayesian joint estimation of the state and parameters. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on synthetic measurements before applying it to a dataset available in literature. Our findings suggest the potential of our approach to characterize the stimulus received by the cortex from other brain regions, while simultaneously inferring a state that aligns with the observed signal.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07869">Manifolds and Modules: How Function Develops in a Neural Foundation Model</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.07869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable success in fitting biological visual systems; however, their black-box nature inherently limits their utility for understanding brain function. Here, we peek inside a SOTA foundation model of neural activity (Wang et al., 2025) as a physiologist might, characterizing each 'neuron' based on its temporal response properties to parametric stimuli. We analyze how different stimuli are represented in neural activity space by building decoding manifolds, and we analyze how different neurons are represented in stimulus-response space by building neural encoding manifolds. We find that the different processing stages of the model (i.e., the feedforward encoder, recurrent, and readout modules) each exhibit qualitatively different representational structures in these manifolds. The recurrent module shows a jump in capabilities over the encoder module by 'pushing apart' the representations of different temporal stimulus patterns; while the readout module achieves biological fidelity by using numerous specialized feature maps rather than biologically plausible mechanisms. Overall, we present this work as a study of the inner workings of a prominent neural foundation model, gaining insights into the biological relevance of its internals through the novel analysis of its neurons' joint temporal response patterns.

                arXiv:2512.07881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This short note comments on \citet{Aerts2024Origin}, which proposes that ranked word frequencies in texts should be read through the lens of Bose--Einstein (BE) statistics and even used to illuminate the origin of quantum statistics in physics. The core message here is modest: the paper offers an interesting analogy and an eye-catching fit, but several key steps mix physical claims with definitions and curve-fitting choices. We highlight three such points: (i) a normalization issue that is presented as "bosonic enhancement", (ii) an identification of rank with energy that makes the BE fit only weakly diagnostic of an underlying mechanism, and (iii) a baseline comparison that is too weak to support an ontological conclusion. We also briefly flag a few additional concerns (interpretation drift, parameter semantics, and reproducibility).

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08815">Multi state neurons</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.08815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neurons, as eukaryotic cells, have powerful internal computation capabilities. One neuron can have many distinct states, and brains can use this capability. Processes of neuron growth and maintenance use chemical signalling between cell bodies and synapses, ferrying chemical messengers over microtubules and actin fibres within cells. These processes are computations which, while slower than neural electrical signalling, could allow any neuron to change its state over intervals of seconds or minutes. Based on its state, a single neuron can selectively de-activate some of its synapses, sculpting a dynamic neural net from the static neural connections of the brain. Without this dynamic selection, the static neural networks in brains are too amorphous and dilute to do the computations of neural cognitive models. The use of multi-state neurons in animal brains is illustrated in hierarchical Bayesian object recognition. Multi-state neurons may support a design which is more efficient than two-state neurons, and scales better as object complexity increases. Brains could have evolved to use multi-state neurons. Multi-state neurons could be used in artificial neural networks, to use a kind of non-Hebbian learning which is faster and more focused and controllable than traditional neural net learning. This possibility has not yet been explored in computational models.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08704">Sleep effects on brain, cognition, and mental health during adolescence are mediated by the glymphatic system</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.08704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Adolescence is a critical period of brain maturation and heightened vulnerability to cognitive and mental health disorders. Sleep plays a vital role in neurodevelopment, yet the mechanisms linking insufficient sleep to adverse brain and behavioral outcomes remain unclear. The glymphatic system (GS), a brain-wide clearance pathway, may provide a key mechanistic link. Methods: Participants from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (n =6,800; age ~ 11 years) were categorized into sleep-sufficient (>=9 h/night) and sleep-insufficient (<9 h/night) groups. Linear models tested associations among sleep, PVS burden, brain volumes, and behavioral outcomes. Mediation analyses evaluated whether PVS burden explained sleep-related effects. Results: Adolescents with insufficient sleep exhibited significantly greater PVS burden, reduced cortical, subcortical, and white matter volumes, poorer cognitive performance across multiple domains (largest effect in crystallized intelligence), and elevated psychopathology (largest effect in general problems). Sleep duration and quality were strongly associated with PVS burden. Mediation analyses revealed that PVS burden partially mediated sleep effects on cognition and mental health, with indirect proportions up to 10.9%. Sequential models suggested a pathway from sleep -> PVS -> brain volume -> behavior as the most plausible route. Conclusions: Insufficient sleep during adolescence is linked to glymphatic dysfunction, reflected by increased PVS burden, which partially accounts for adverse effects on brain structure, cognition, and mental health. These findings highlight the GS as a potential mechanistic pathway and imaging biomarker, underscoring the importance of promoting adequate sleep to support neurodevelopment and mental health.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16111">How random connectivity shapes the fluctuating dynamics of finite-size neural populations</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.16111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mesoscopic models of finite-size neuronal populations are crucial to understand the dynamics of neural networks in the brain, especially their fluctuations and response to stimuli. However, current theories to derive such models are based on homogeneous all-to-all (full) connectivity. This assumption neglects the variance in the connectivity of biologically realistic networks with connection probabilities $p<1$ (non-full connectivity). To gain insight into the different fluctuation mechanisms underlying neural variability at the population level, we derive and analyze a stochastic mean-field model for finite-size networks of Poisson neurons with random connectivity (including non-full connectivity), external noise and disordered mean inputs. We treat the quenched disorder of the connectivity by an annealed approximation enabling a doubly stochastic description of synaptic inputs for finite network size. A further reduction leads to a low-dimensional closed system of coupled Langevin equations for the mean and variance of the membrane potentials as well as a variable capturing finite-size fluctuations. Compared to microscopic simulations, the mesoscopic model describes the fluctuations and nonlinearities well and outperforms previous theories that neglected the variance in the connectivity. The joint effect of connectivity disorder and finite network size can be analytically understood by a softening of the effective nonlinearity and the multiplicative character of spiking noise. The mesoscopic theory shows that quenched disorder can stabilize the asynchronous state, and it correctly predicts large quantitative and non-trivial qualitative effects of connection probability on the variance of the population firing rate and its dependence on stimulus strength. In conclusion, our theory elucidates how disordered connectivity shapes nonlinear dynamics and fluctuations of neural populations.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00269">Feature Integration Spaces: Joint Training Reveals Dual Encoding in Neural Network Representations</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.00269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current sparse autoencoder (SAE) approaches to neural network interpretability assume that activations can be decomposed through linear superposition into sparse, interpretable features. Despite high reconstruction fidelity, SAEs consistently fail to eliminate polysemanticity and exhibit pathological behavioral errors. We propose that neural networks encode information in two complementary spaces compressed into the same substrate: feature identity and feature integration. To test this dual encoding hypothesis, we develop sequential and joint-training architectures to capture identity and integration patterns simultaneously. Joint training achieves 41.3% reconstruction improvement and 51.6% reduction in KL divergence errors. This architecture spontaneously develops bimodal feature organization: low squared norm features contributing to integration pathways and the rest contributing directly to the residual. Small nonlinear components (3% of parameters) achieve 16.5% standalone improvements, demonstrating parameter-efficient capture of computational relationships crucial for behavior. Additionally, intervention experiments using 2x2 factorial stimulus designs demonstrated that integration features exhibit selective sensitivity to experimental manipulations and produce systematic behavioral effects on model outputs, including significant statistical interaction effects across semantic dimensions. This work provides systematic evidence for (1) dual encoding in neural representations, (2) meaningful nonlinearly encoded feature interactions, and (3) introduces an architectural paradigm shift from post-hoc feature analysis to integrated computational design, establishing foundations for next-generation SAEs.

                arXiv:2505.24580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this commentary, we argue that El Hady and Machta's "surface wave" model for mechanical waves accompanying action potential (AP) propagation describes the same underlying process as the "axoplasmic pressure wave" model introduced earlier by Rvachev. Both models describe mechanical modes that store potential energy in the elastic components of the axon (axonal membrane, cytoskeleton, bulk axoplasmic deformation), with kinetic energy carried by the axoplasmic fluid and axoplasmic viscosity playing a significant role. The "surface wave" model quantitatively considers driving by the traveling electrical depolarization wave of the AP, whereas the "axoplasmic pressure wave" model qualitatively considers driving not only by the AP's electrical depolarization but also by other mechanisms, such as cytoskeletal actomyosin contractility. In addition, the "axoplasmic pressure wave" model considers mechanisms for synchronizing the depolarization wave and the pressure wave. Although derived using different approaches, the two models yield identical dependencies for the mechanical modes in key limits. The confusion in the literature, which treats these models as describing distinct processes, needs to be resolved to improve comprehensive understanding of the AP phenomenon and to guide future research.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08360">Conditional Morphogenesis: Emergent Generation of Structural Digits via Neural Cellular Automata</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.08360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological systems exhibit remarkable morphogenetic plasticity, where a single genome can encode various specialized cellular structures triggered by local chemical signals. In the domain of Deep Learning, Differentiable Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) have emerged as a paradigm to mimic this self-organization. However, existing NCA research has predominantly focused on continuous texture synthesis or single-target object recovery, leaving the challenge of class-conditional structural generation largely unexplored. In this work, we propose a novel Conditional Neural Cellular Automata (c-NCA) architecture capable of growing distinct topological structures - specifically MNIST digits - from a single generic seed, guided solely by a spatially broadcasted class vector. Unlike traditional generative models (e.g., GANs, VAEs) that rely on global reception fields, our model enforces strict locality and translation equivariance. We demonstrate that by injecting a one-hot condition into the cellular perception field, a single set of local rules can learn to break symmetry and self-assemble into ten distinct geometric attractors. Experimental results show that our c-NCA achieves stable convergence, correctly forming digit topologies from a single pixel, and exhibits robustness characteristic of biological systems. This work bridges the gap between texture-based NCAs and structural pattern formation, offering a lightweight, biologically plausible alternative for conditional generation.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07875">Softly Symbolifying Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.07875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) offer a promising path toward interpretable machine learning: their learnable activations can be studied individually, while collectively fitting complex data accurately. In practice, however, trained activations often lack symbolic fidelity, learning pathological decompositions with no meaningful correspondence to interpretable forms. We propose Softly Symbolified Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (S2KAN), which integrate symbolic primitives directly into training. Each activation draws from a dictionary of symbolic and dense terms, with learnable gates that sparsify the representation. Crucially, this sparsification is differentiable, enabling end-to-end optimization, and is guided by a principled Minimum Description Length objective. When symbolic terms suffice, S2KAN discovers interpretable forms; when they do not, it gracefully degrades to dense splines. We demonstrate competitive or superior accuracy with substantially smaller models across symbolic benchmarks, dynamical systems forecasting, and real-world prediction tasks, and observe evidence of emergent self-sparsification even without regularization pressure.

                arXiv:2512.07961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical decision-making makes frequent use of algorithms that combine risk equations with rules, providing clear and standardized treatment pathways. Symbolic regression (SR) traditionally limits its search space to continuous function forms and their parameters, making it difficult to model this decision-making. However, due to its ability to derive data-driven, interpretable models, SR holds promise for developing data-driven clinical risk scores. To that end we introduce Brush, an SR algorithm that combines decision-tree-like splitting algorithms with non-linear constant optimization, allowing for seamless integration of rule-based logic into symbolic regression and classification models. Brush achieves Pareto-optimal performance on SRBench, and was applied to recapitulate two widely used clinical scoring systems, achieving high accuracy and interpretable models. Compared to decision trees, random forests, and other SR methods, Brush achieves comparable or superior predictive performance while producing simpler models.

Abstract: Neurological injuries and age-related decline can impair sensory processing and disrupt motor coordination, gait, and balance. As mechanisms of neuroplasticity have become better understood, vibration-based interventions have gained attention as potential tools to stimulate sensory pathways and motor circuits to support functional recovery. This survey reviews stochastic and resonant vibration modalities, describing their mechanisms, therapeutic rationales, and clinical applications. We synthesize evidence on whole-body vibration for improving balance, mobility, and fine motor function in aging adults, stroke survivors, and individuals with Parkinson's disease, with attention to challenges in parameter optimization, generalizability, and safety. We also assess recent developments in focused muscle vibration and wearable stochastic resonance devices for upper-limb rehabilitation, evaluating their clinical promise along with limitations in scalability, ecological validity, and standardization. Across these modalities, we identify key variables that shape therapeutic outcomes and highlight ongoing efforts to refine protocols, improve usability, and integrate vibration techniques into broader neurorehabilitation frameworks. We conclude by outlining the most important research needs for translating vibration-based interventions into reliable and deployable clinical tools.

                arXiv:2512.08124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper will propose a novel machine learning based portfolio management method in the context of the cryptocurrency market. Previous researchers mainly focus on the prediction of the movement for specific cryptocurrency such as the bitcoin(BTC) and then trade according to the prediction. In contrast to the previous work that treats the cryptocurrencies independently, this paper manages a group of cryptocurrencies by analyzing the relative relationship. Specifically, in each time step, we utilize the neural network to predict the rank of the future return of the managed cryptocurrencies and place weights accordingly. By incorporating such cross-sectional information, the proposed methods is shown to profitable based on the backtesting experiments on the real daily cryptocurrency market data from May, 2020 to Nov, 2023. During this 3.5 years, the market experiences the full cycle of bullish, bearish and stagnant market conditions. Despite under such complex market conditions, the proposed method outperforms the existing methods and achieves a Sharpe ratio of 1.01 and annualized return of 64.26%. Additionally, the proposed method is shown to be robust to the increase of transaction fee.

                arXiv:2512.08591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the outcomes of professional basketball games, particularly in the National Basketball Association (NBA), has become increasingly important for coaching strategy, fan engagement, and sports betting. However, many existing prediction models struggle with concept drift, limited temporal context, and instability across seasons. To advance forecasting in this domain, we introduce a newly constructed longitudinal NBA dataset covering the 2004-05 to 2024-25 seasons and present a deep learning framework designed to model long-term performance trends. Our primary contribution is a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture that leverages an extended sequence length of 9,840 games equivalent to eight full NBA seasons to capture evolving team dynamics and season-over-season dependencies. We compare this model against several traditional Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) baselines, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The LSTM achieves the best performance across all metrics, with 72.35 accuracy, 73.15 precision and 76.13 AUC-ROC. These results demonstrate the importance of long-sequence temporal modeling in basketball outcome prediction and highlight the value of our new multi-season dataset for developing robust, generalizable NBA forecasting systems.

                arXiv:2503.08394v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-task optimization is typically characterized by a fixed and finite set of tasks. The present paper relaxes this condition by considering a non-fixed and potentially infinite set of optimization tasks defined in a parameterized, continuous and bounded task space. We refer to this unique problem setting as parametric multi-task optimization (PMTO). Assuming the bounds of the task parameters to be ($\boldsymbol{\theta}_l$, $\boldsymbol{\theta}_u$), a novel ($\boldsymbol{\theta}_l$, $\boldsymbol{\theta}_u$)-PMTO algorithm is crafted to operate in two complementary modes. In an offline optimization mode, a joint search over solution and task spaces is carried out with the creation of two approximation models: (1) for mapping points in a unified solution space to the objective spaces of all tasks, which provably accelerates convergence by acting as a conduit for inter-task knowledge transfers, and (2) for probabilistically mapping tasks to their corresponding solutions, which facilitates evolutionary exploration of under-explored regions of the task space. In the online mode, the derived models enable direct optimization of any task within the bounds without the need to search from scratch. This outcome is validated on both synthetic test problems and practical case studies, with the significant real-world applicability of PMTO shown towards fast reconfiguration of robot controllers under changing task conditions. The potential of PMTO to vastly speedup the search for solutions to minimax optimization problems is also demonstrated through an example in robust engineering design.

                arXiv:2508.16993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) have become the most popular tool for solving widely-existed multi-objective optimization problems. In Multi-Objective EAs (MOEAs), there is increasing interest in using an archive to store non-dominated solutions generated during the search. This approach can 1) mitigate the effects of population oscillation, a common issue in many MOEAs, and 2) allow for the use of smaller, more practical population sizes. In this paper, we analytically show that the archive can even further help MOEAs through reusing its solutions during the process of new solution generation. We first prove that using a small population size alongside an archive (without incorporating archived solutions in the generation process) may fail on certain problems, as the population may remove previously discovered but promising solutions. We then prove that reusing archive solutions can overcome this limitation, resulting in at least a polynomial speedup on the expected running time. Our analysis focuses on the well-established SMS-EMOA algorithm applied to the commonly studied OneJumpZeroJump problem as well as one of its variants. We also show that reusing archive solutions can be better than using a large population size directly. Finally, we show that our theoretical findings can generally hold in practice by experiments on well-known practical optimization problems -- multi-objective 0-1 Knapsack, TSP, QAP and NK-landscape problems -- with realistic settings.

                arXiv:2507.22787v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a three-dimensional vectorial extension of the Hopfield associative-memory model in which each neuron is a unit vector on $S^2$ and synaptic couplings are $3\times 3$ blocks generated through a vectorial Hebbian rule. The resulting block-structured operator is mathematically analogous to the Hessian of amorphous solids and induces a rigid energy landscape with deep minima for stored patterns. Simulations and spectral analysis show that the vectorial network substantially outperforms the classical binary Hopfield model. For moderate connectivity, the critical storage ratio $\gamma_c$ grows approximately linearly with the coordination number $Z$, while for $Z\gtrsim 40$ a high-connectivity regime emerges in which $\gamma_c$ systematically exceeds the extrapolated low-$Z$ linear fit. At the same time, a persistent spectral gap separates pattern modes from the bulk and basins of attraction enlarge, yielding enhanced robustness to initialization noise. Thus geometric constraints combined with amorphous-solid-inspired structure produce associative memories with superior storage and retrieval performance, especially in the high-connectivity ($Z \gtrsim 20$-$30$) regime.

                arXiv:2509.04622v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Representational similarity metrics are fundamental tools in neuroscience and AI, yet we lack systematic comparisons of their discriminative power across model families. We introduce a quantitative framework to evaluate representational similarity measures based on their ability to separate model families-across architectures (CNNs, Vision Transformers, Swin Transformers, ConvNeXt) and training regimes (supervised vs. self-supervised). Using three complementary separability measures-dprime from signal detection theory, silhouette coefficients and ROC-AUC, we systematically assess the discriminative capacity of commonly used metrics including RSA, linear predictivity, Procrustes, and soft matching. We show that separability systematically increases as metrics impose more stringent alignment constraints. Among mapping-based approaches, soft-matching achieves the highest separability, followed by Procrustes alignment and linear predictivity. Non-fitting methods such as RSA also yield strong separability across families. These results provide the first systematic comparison of similarity metrics through a separability lens, clarifying their relative sensitivity and guiding metric choice for large-scale model and brain comparisons.

                arXiv:2509.16959v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When different objectives conflict with each other in multi-task learning, gradients begin to interfere and slow convergence, thereby potentially reducing the final model's performance. To address this, we introduce SON-GOKU, a scheduler that computes gradient interference, constructs an interference graph, and then applies greedy graph-coloring to partition tasks into groups that align well with each other. At each training step, only one group (color class) of tasks are activated, and the grouping partition is constantly recomputed as task relationships evolve throughout training. By ensuring that each mini-batch contains only tasks that pull the model in the same direction, our method improves the effectiveness of any underlying multi-task learning optimizer without additional tuning. Since tasks within these groups will update in compatible directions, multi-task learning will improve model performance rather than impede it. Empirical results on six different datasets show that this interference-aware graph-coloring approach consistently outperforms baselines and state-of-the-art multi-task optimizers. We provide extensive theory showing why grouping and sequential updates improve multi-task learning, with guarantees on descent, convergence, and accurately identifying what tasks conflict or align.

                arXiv:2512.01824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growth of the Internet of Things has enabled a new generation of applications, pushing computation and intelligence toward the network edge. This trend, however, exposes challenges, as the heterogeneity of devices and the complex requirements of applications are often misaligned with the assumptions of traditional routing protocols, which lack the flexibility to accommodate application-layer metrics and policies. This work addresses this gap by proposing a software framework that enhances routing flexibility by dynamically incorporating application-aware decisions. The core of the work establishes a multi-hop Wi-Fi network of heterogeneous devices, specifically ESP8266, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi 3B. The routing layer follows a proactive approach, while the network is fault-tolerant, maintaining operation despite both node loss and message loss. On top of this, a middleware layer introduces three strategies for influencing routing behavior: two adapt the path a message traverses until arriving at the destination, while the third allows applications to shape the network topology. This layer offers a flexible interface for diverse applications. The framework was validated on a physical testbed through edge intelligence use cases, including distributing neural network inference computations across multiple devices and offloading the entire workload to the most capable node. Distributed inference is useful in scenarios requiring low latency, energy efficiency, privacy, and autonomy. Experimental results indicated that device heterogeneity significantly impacts network performance. Throughput and inference duration analysis showed the influence of the strategies on application behaviour, revealed that topology critically affects decentralized performance, and demonstrated the suitability of the framework for complex tasks.

">Graph embeddings for identifying symmetries in connectomes</a></h4>

              
                In many circuit models of neural computation, synaptic connections between neurons are organized according to their tuning to the variables being processed. The connectivities of canonical neural network models of head direction, spatial navigation, and orientation selectivity obey this principle and contain symmetries related to the angular and spatial variables they operate on. We develop a graph embedding algorithm to identify such symmetries. The algorithm segregates structure related to cell type from that related to the symmetries we seek to identify, distinguishing it from standard embedding methods. Our method successfully identifies rotational and translational symmetries in heading direction and visual projection neuron circuits using a connectome of the adult {\em Drosophila} brain, and it also identifies a toroidal symmetry in a synthetic connectome of grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex. Such embedding geometries reveal the latent variables that are processed by a neural circuit and which cell types are responsible for this computation.

                Background This study examines the role of teachers’ Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK) in the successful teaching of Environmental Education (EE) as part of Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG 4). The study is based on the Theory of PCK and the Tree Model of Environmental Education by Palmer. It is aimed at examining the impact of teacher expertise on the implementation of EE in early childhood classrooms. Methods The research was carried out in three privately owned preschools in Bukit Mahkota, Selangor in Malaysia. Ten participants were selected out of 20 targeted population of preschool teachers who worked with children aged between 5-6 years. The information was gathered through semi-structured face-to-face interviews with teachers. The qualitative data were interpreted and analysed using thematic analysis. Findings The findings indicated that there were big gaps in EE content knowledge, a lack of pedagogical strategies, as well as insufficient professional development among teachers. The participants were very willing to teach EE but showed little knowledge of the components of EE. The research also discovered that institutional limitations like the lack of resources, outdoor areas and overburdened curriculum also curtailed EE implementation. Evidence, however, indicated that experiential learning styles, such as gardening, recycling, and outdoor projects, have positive effects in increasing the environmental knowledge and stewardship attitudes of the children. Conclusions To acquire significant EE outcomes and ensure the advancement of SDG 4, it is crucial to implement the targeted training and institutional support of preschool educators, along with the equal distribution of resources in the context of strengthening their PCK related to EE. To close the gap between the intent of the curriculum and classroom practice, it is necessary to reinforce the content mastery and pedagogical competence of the teachers in a way that EE becomes successfully integrated into early childhood education.

                In the present study , every module M is unitary and every ring F is commutative with identity. We gave a definition of a new class F − module which is namely S-pseudo bounded module symbolically (S-PS.B.

The main purpose of this article is to present a few new conditions for some corollaries and properties. The F − homomorphism of monoform and compressible modules connect in a useful way with an endomorphism of a F − module M that we relied on it in the definition of S-pseudo bounded module. We used the symbol End ( M ) which means the set of all endomorphism maps of F − module M . Also S-pseudo bounded module gave us directly or with some conditions different modules such as retractable module, an injective module and others.

A Systematic Review of Applications, Advances, and Translational Potential [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Network pharmacology and molecular docking have emerged as important in modern herbal drug discovery, offering systems-level understanding into phytochemical interactions and therapeutic mechanisms. This review aimed to evaluate the application of integrated network pharmacology and molecular docking in herbal medicine research Methods A systematic search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for studies published between 2010 and August, 2025. Eligible studies included both network pharmacology and molecular docking in medicinal plants, botanical formulations, or isolated phytochemicals. Screening and selection followed PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Data were extracted on study characteristics, computational platforms, biological validation strategies, phytochemical profiles, protein targets, and mechanistic pathways. Results 36 studies met the eligibility criteria. Publications increased significantly after 2020, with most originating from Asia, particularly China (55.6%) and India (25.0%). Majority (61.1%) employed purely in silico pipelines, while 22.2% combined computational and in vitro validation, and 16.7% incorporated in vivo models. Flavonoids such as quercetin, kaempferol, apigenin, and luteolin accounted for most docked phytochemicals. Key molecular targets included ESR1, EGFR, AKT1, TNF, CASP3, and PTGS2, aligning predominantly with cancer, inflammatory, and metabolic pathways. Key signaling cascades PI3K-Akt, MAPK/ERK, NF-κB, and Wnt/β-catenin were consistently reported. Almost half of the studies (47.2%) integrated molecular dynamics simulations, while ADMET screening was reported in 71.4% of cases. Conclusion This review demonstrates that integrated network pharmacology and molecular docking have become foundational in herbal medicine research and growing with advances in computational biology. These approaches reveal multi-target mechanisms supporting the therapeutic potential of phytochemicals, yet translational progress is constrained by inconsistent pipelines. Strengthening validation frameworks, broadening phytochemical discovery beyond common flavonoids, and enhancing global research participation will be essential to accelerate clinically relevant herbal drug development.

                <p>by Rakshith Lokesh, Dagmar Sternad</p>

Manipulating complex objects is ubiquitous in our daily activities, such as donning a jacket or carrying a cup of coffee. However, such non-rigid objects easily become unstable: When carrying a cup of coffee, the coffee could slosh unpredictably and spill out of the cup. It remains unclear what motor control strategies ensure stability, especially when the physical properties of the object, like the amount of liquid in the cup, are unknown. The task of transporting a ‘cup of coffee’ was simplified to transporting a virtual cup with a sliding ball inside, modeled as a cart-pendulum system. Participants were instructed to ‘jiggle’ the cup in one dimension to prepare the cup and ball states for the ensuing continuous rhythmic movement. To introduce uncertainty regarding the object’s properties, the pendulum’s length was manipulated either to 1) change randomly from trial to trial, or to 2) remain constant across trials. We measured the ball’s angle at the end of preparation and the cup’s oscillation frequency during the rhythmic portion of the trial. Grip force on the robot handle served as proxy for mechanical impedance of the arm. The results supported three predictions: 1) When dynamic uncertainty was high, object preparation was important to stabilize the transient dynamics; stability increased during preparation and humans prepared longer when the dynamics was uncertain. 2) Humans maximized dynamic stability by flexibly covarying system initialization and cup frequency; dynamic stability matched participant behavior better than magnitude or smoothness of force. 3) Humans increased their arm impedance to accommodate uncertain dynamics, while the net force applied on the cup remained the same. Feedforward simulations using an impedance controller and stochastic open-loop optimal control corroborated these findings, further revealing that participants’ selection of preparation and interaction frequencies also minimized mechanical impedance. In sum, humans used preparation and interaction strategies to optimize the mechanical impedance and dynamic stability of the hand-object interactions. These results may inform approaches in robotic control and rehabilitation.

                <p>by Tarun Khajuria, Kadi Tulver, Jaan Aru</p>

Human vision is not merely a passive process of interpreting sensory input but can also function as a problem-solving process incorporating generative mechanisms to interpret ambiguous or noisy data. This synergy between the generative and discriminative components, often described as analysis-by-synthesis, enables robust perception and rapid adaptation to out-of-distribution inputs. In this work, we investigate a computational implementation of the analysis-by-synthesis paradigm using genetic search in a generative model, applied to a visual problem-solving task inspired by star constellations. The search is guided by low-level cues based on the structural fitness of candidate solutions compared to the test images. This dataset serves as a testbed for exploring how inferred signals can guide the synthesis of suitable solutions in ambiguous conditions, framing visual inference as an instance of complex problem solving. Drawing on insights from human experiments, we develop a generative search algorithm and compare its performance to humans, examining factors such as accuracy, reaction time, and overlap in drawings. Our results shed light on possible mechanisms of human visual problem solving and highlight the potential of generative search models to emulate aspects of this process.

Centrioles are polarized microtubule-based structures with appendages at their distal end that are essential for cilia formation and function. The protein C2CD3 is critical for distal appendage assembly, with mutations linked to orofaciodigital syndrome and other ciliopathies. However, its precise molecular role in appendage recruitment remains unclear. Using ultrastructure expansion microscopy (U-ExM) and iterative U-ExM on human cells, together with in situ cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) on mouse tissues, we reveal that C2CD3 adopts a radially symmetric 9-fold organization within the centriole’s distal lumen. We show that the C-terminal region of C2CD3 localizes close to a ~100 nm luminal ring structure consisting of ~27 nodes, while its N-terminal region localizes close to a hook-like structure that attaches to the A-microtubule as it extends from the centriole interior to exterior. This hook structure is adjacent to the DISCO complex (MNR/CEP90/OFD1), which marks future appendage sites. C2CD3 depletion disrupts not only the recruitment of the DISCO complex via direct interaction with MNR but also destabilizes the luminal ring network composed of C2CD3/SFI1/centrin-2/CEP135/NA14, as well as the distal microtubule tip protein CEP162. This reveals an intricate “in-to-out” molecular hub connecting the centriolar lumen, distal microtubule cap, and appendages. Although C2CD3 loss results in shorter centrioles and appendage defects, key structural elements remain intact, permitting continued centriole duplication. We propose that C2CD3 forms the luminal ring structure and extends radially to the space between triplet microtubules, functioning as an architectural hub that scaffolds the distal end of the centriole, orchestrating its assembly and directing appendage formation.

                <p>by Heungjin Ryu, Chie Hashimoto, David A. Hill, Keiko Mouri, Keiko Shimizu, Takeshi Furuichi</p>

In most mammals, female sexual receptivity (estrus) closely coincides with ovulation, providing males with precise fertility signals. However, in some anthropoid primates living in multi-male societies, females display extended receptivity along with exaggerated sexual swellings that probabilistically indicate ovulation. This raises the question about how males successfully time mating, particularly when ovulation is difficult to predict from such signals. To address this question in bonobos, we combined daily variation in swelling size, hormonal profiles, and male mating behaviors. By estimating day-specific ovulation probabilities relative to the onset and subsidence (detumescence) of maximal swelling, we also examined how male efforts correlate with female fertility. Our results revealed that while ovulation probability was widely distributed and difficult to predict when aligned with the onset of the swelling phase, male behavior was closely aligned with the conception probability. Males concentrated mating efforts late in the phase and stopped after detumescence. High-ranking males intervened in copulations involving females with higher conception probabilities, specifically those with maximal swelling and older infants. When multiple females exhibited maximal swelling, males preferentially followed females whose maximal swelling started earlier and who had older infants. Male–male aggression increased when there were more females with maximal swelling. However, this tendency was reversed when male party size exceeded the average. Importantly, our results revealed that the low predictability of ovulation is best explained by inter- and intra-individual variation in the length of maximal swelling phase, rather than ovulation occurring randomly within that phase in bonobos. Males effectively manage such a noisy signal by prioritizing late-phase ovulatory cues and integrating reproductive history, thereby extracting usable timing information. This behavioral mechanism helps explain the persistence of conspicuous yet noisy ovulatory signals in bonobos. Since males are capable of inferring ovulation timing even under noisy conditions, selection may not favor highly precise female signals. Instead, it shifts more of the time and energy costs onto males, allowing conspicuous female traits to be maintained.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1382/v1?src=rss">Investigating Visual-Motor Skills and Perception: A Comparative Study of Adults with Low Vision and Healthy Controls using the Test for Motor Visual Skills 3 (TVMS-3) [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Low vision (LV) reduces visual perception and motor coordination, limiting independence in tasks such as navigation and object handling. The Test of Visual-Motor Skills, Third Edition (TVMS-3), is a validated measure of visual-motor integration. This study evaluated visual perception and motor skills in adults with LV compared with healthy controls in the Caribbean. Methods A case-control study was conducted between January and March 2023 at a university-affiliated optometry clinic. Fifty-five participants were recruited: 25 with LV and 30 healthy controls, sourced from the clinic database and the Trinidad and Tobago Diabetes Association. Assessments included distance visual acuity (LogMAR), near visual acuity (MNRead), and the TVMS-3. Data were analyzed using Pearson’s correlation and independent-samples t-tests to explore the relationships between acuity and motor performance. Results Among the LV participants, the diagnoses included diabetic retinopathy (14.5%), cataract (10.9%), and glaucoma (10.9%). Reported difficulties were as follows recognizing faces (72%), spatial orientation (80%), and perceiving fast-moving objects (76–80%). On the TVMS-3, the most frequent errors were Error 5 (lines connected incorrectly) and Error 6 (size/part changed), both observed in 88% of the LV participants. Near visual acuity was significantly correlated with drawing accuracy (r = .670, p < .001). The LV group recorded significantly lower TVMS scores (35.48 ± 7.36) compared with thecontrols (67.47 ± 8.21), p < .001. Discussion Adults with LV demonstrated poorer visual-motor skills and greater perceptual challenges than those with normal vision. These deficits compromise daily activities requiring precision and spatial awareness. Implications for Practice TVMS-3 is a valuable tool for assessing visual-motor integration in adults with LV. The findings highlight the need for early detection and tailored rehabilitation strategies to support independence and improve quality of life.

                This article examines factors that compromise the validity and reliability of employment interview selection processes, with a focus on the influence of interviewer bias, format, and decision-making processes. The purpose of the present Systematic Review (SR) is to determine how different types and formats of interview modalities affect the selection process, consolidate empirical findings regarding the influence of the most widespread interviewer biases, and identify bias mitigation strategies that can enhance the interview selection process. The methodology used PECO and PRISMA criteria to identify keywords, define search strings, and 19 full review articles published between 2015 and 2025 in peer-reviewed journals. This time frame captures the most recent developments and relevant research, recognizing the opportunity to reflect this under-researched area, specifically the role of bias and interview format in employment selection processes. The results emphasize the importance of pre-and post-interview reflection, interviewer preparedness, and gathering applicant feedback to refine selection decisions. In conclusion, the interview process can be improved by offering interviewer refresher training, utilizing recorded interviews to minimize the effects of selective memory, and implementing bias-mitigation strategies, such as job analysis and interviewer self-awareness, to enhance the validity and reliability of employment selection interviews.

                Introduction Antioxidants have emerged as potentially beneficial options. Present in both foods and supplements, these molecules can neutralize free radicals and modulate inflammatory processes, both of which are implicated in the pathophysiology of osteoarthritis. Although the results of antioxidants have been promising, the current evidence remains heterogeneous and sometimes inconsistent. Therefore, it is necessary to integrate and critically analyze the available data. Objective This systematic review protocol with meta-analysis aims to describe the methodology necessary to analyze the effects of antioxidant intervention compared with usual medical care on pain, physical function, and quality of life in people with osteoarthritis. Methods In conducting this literature synthesis, a comprehensive search will be executed across the Medline databases via PubMed, Scopus, Web of Sciences, ScienceDirect, and EBSCO to identify randomized clinical trials that satisfy the predetermined eligibility criteria. Primary outcomes, including pain, physical function, and quality of life, and secondary outcomes, such as clinical modifications, will be analyzed. The quality of the selected studies will be evaluated using the ROB-2 risk of bias tool, and the certainty of the evidence will be assessed through the GRADE method. A meta-analysis will be conducted using either a fixed- or random-effects model, depending on the degree of heterogeneity. Heterogeneity will be assessed using the I2 statistic. If the outcome assessment method is homogeneous, the mean difference (MD) with a 95% confidence interval will be utilized; otherwise, the standardized mean difference (SMD) will be employed to calculate the effect size. Discussion Osteoarthritis imposes a substantial clinical and socioeconomic burden, and antioxidants are increasingly recognized as potential adjuvants owing to their safety and anti-inflammatory properties. The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis based on this protocol will aid in determining the extent of the impact of antioxidant consumption in pertinent clinical practice.

                Background thermography is widely used to quantify surface temperature distributions during radiofrequency heating in biomedical, material, and industrial contexts. However, reproducible datasets capturing thermal responses of biological and inert materials under controlled RF excitation are scarce. This limitation hinders the validation of electromagnetic–thermal models, the benchmarking of image-based temperature estimation techniques, and the development of super-resolution and reconstruction algorithms. To address this gap, we generated a curated thermal image dataset that documents how different materials absorb and dissipate RF energy within an ISM band. Methods We constructed a controlled RF heating system consisting of a signal generator, a 6 W power amplifier, a circulator with matched load, and a unidirectional applicator antenna operating near 2.5 GHz. Biological tissues (pork, beef, chicken) and inert materials (foam, wood, phantom) were exposed to continuous-wave RF excitation while surface temperature was monitored using three infrared cameras with low, medium, and high resolution. Thermal images were acquired under systematically varied conditions, including RF power (0–5.5 dBm, extended to 6.5 dBm for low-loss materials), camera-to-sample distance (20–30 cm), and observation angle (0°, 30°, 60°). Each recording was captured after stabilization periods to ensure repeatability, and all images were exported as calibrated per-pixel temperature maps. Metadata documenting material type, acquisition geometry, and temperature range were embedded following a standardized naming structure. A complementary data-augmentation pipeline generated resolution-specific synthetic variations, yielding additional controlled perturbations for algorithm development. Conclusions The dataset comprises 3,600 original and 600 augmented thermal images spanning nine material categories and three spatial resolutions. Its standardized acquisition protocol and comprehensive metadata enable reproducible studies on RF–material interactions, temperature-field reconstruction, geometric correction, and super-resolution enhancement. This resource is expected to support research in computer vision, hyperthermia modelling, and the development of machine learning methods for thermal imaging under controlled RF exposure.

                In this paper, every module M is unitary and every ring F is commutative with identity. Some properties of S-Pseudo bounded radical are studied. A proper submodule ℵ of an F − module M is said to be S-pseudo bounded submodule if there exists , φ ∈ End ( M ) , x ∈ M such that φ ( x ) ∈ ℵ implies ann F ( ℵ ) = ann F φ ( x ) making use of endomorphism map over an F − module . The characterization of S-Pseudo bounded radical for finitely generated and multiplication module is given. It must be emphasized that scalar module and prime submodule played a major role in achieving new results and to study the relationship between the radical of submodules and the radical of S-pseudo bounded submodule. In our work many properties and corollaries will be proved which explain the idea of the radical of S-pseudo bounded submodule and a new class of F − module as well as F − submodule provided with some examples that illustrate and clarify in a nice way this type of module (submodule). We used the symbol End ( M ) which means the set of all endomorphism maps of F − module M and S − rad M PS . B . ( ℵ ) refers to the intersection of all S-pseudo bounded submodules of M containing ℵ .

                Background Graphs or networks are ubiquitous data structures across scientific disciplines, from ecological and molecular to social networks. Visualisation is an important step to gain insight into network data, however most network analysis software packages, such as igraph and NetworkX, focus on statistical tools and offer limited visualisation options. Other packages offer powerful graphical user interfaces but rely on custom formats and implementations, which restricts interoperability with other scientific software. Methods iplotx is a Python software package designed to act as a universal visualiser for any network analysis package. A simple yet rich declarative style grammar enables customisation of any visual element including edge geometry, marker size and shape, labels, and groupings. Rendering relies on custom Matplotlib artists, which enables broad interoperability with other data visualisation libraries. Results iplotx supports eight different network and tree analysis packages (NetworkX, igraph, graph tool, Biopython, ETE, cogent3, dendropy, and scikit-bio) and implements a plug-in mechanism for universal input compatibility. It supports a wide spectrum of outputs including raster and vector images, animations, and interactive plots. The package implements unique features such as three-dimensional network visualisations and is fully compatible with the Python scientific software stack including seaborn, scipy, pandas, and Cartopy. Areas of application for iplotx include biomolecular and gene regulatory networks, protein-protein interactions, biochemical pathways, ecological networks, phylogenetics, and extend beyond biomedicine into economics, social, and transportation sciences. Conclusions Compared to extant software, iplotx offers broader interoperability, richer styling, a large gallery of examples, and extensive code testing. This makes iplotx a robust choice for the visualisation of any networks and trees in biomedicine and beyond.

                Background Despite diabetes mellitus and periodontal diseases are mutually exclusive, little is known about particular types of bacteria that may have exacerbated the development of diabetics’ periodontal inflammation. The purpose of this study was to descriptively characterize and explore the differences in the salivary microbiomes of individuals with type 2 diabetes (20-40 years old) who had gingivitis or periodontitis to those who did not. Additionally, we evaluated the descriptive relationship between the relative abundance of periodontopathogens and nitrate-reducing bacteria in their salivary microbiome. Methods Saliva was collected from all participants. Genomic DNA was isolated and pooled in equimolar quantities from all individuals within each group to create three pooled libraries: type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients without periodontal disease (G1), T2DM patients with gingivitis (G2), and T2DM patients with periodontitis (G3). Sequencing was performed using Oxford Nanopore MinION Technology. The relative abundance and bacterial diversity were measured using bioinformatic methods, and all analyses of sequencing data were strictly descriptive and exploratory. Salivary nitrite/nitrate concentrations were measured on individual, un-pooled samples. Results The salivary microbiota among people with type 2 diabetes and periodontal disease (G2; G3) was observed to have greater bacterial diversity and abundance than that of patients without periodontal disease (G1), according to descriptive alpha-diversity analysis. The G3 group exhibited the largest relative abundance of Porphyromonas gingivalis, a key periodontopathogen. Descriptive analysis also suggested that periodontopathic bacteria and nitrate-reducing bacteria have different community structures across the groups. Furthermore, comparison of individual salivary samples showed that nitrite/nitrate concentration was significantly lower in the G3 group compared to the G1 group (p< 0.05). Conclusion Results of this exploratory study suggest that the relationship between periodontopathic and denitrifying bacteria in the salivary microbiome varies among those with type 2 diabetes mellitus who also have gingivitis or periodontitis. These distinct microbial features observed may be microbiological characteristics associated with the progression of periodontal disease in this population, warranting further validation as potential indicators for early management.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-425/v2?src=rss">Case Report: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and diagnosis challenges: case report and evidence synthesis [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Prion diseases are mortal neurodegenerative disorders, which include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Due to its heterogenous clinical presentation diagnosis uncertainties are common. In this paper we explore CJD diagnostic challenges focusing on differential diagnosis and diagnostic delays. Methods We report a case of a patient who was misclassified and evaluated by several medical specialties before the CJD suspicion. A systematic review of the literature of the CJD case reports focused on the timely and differential diagnosis was carried out in Medline and Embase until May 2023. Results Patient with diagnosis was made due to the form of presentation and clinical evolution, neuroimaging and the presence of protein 14-3-3. In systematic review, fifteen articles were selected, who reported 31 cases of CJD with problems in the timely diagnosis and incorrect initial diagnosis, the main initial differential diagnoses were psychiatry exacerbation, myelopathy, epilepsy, stroke, parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia and autoimmune encephalitis. The most common clinical onset was psychobehavioral disturbances (apathy, confusion and sleep disturbance), extrapyramidal signs and cognitive impairment. The diagnosis delay was from one to eighteen months. Conclusion A discussion of the case report and the diagnostic challenges reported in the literature was made. Patients can present a wide range of symptoms. It is recommended to consider CJD for the differential diagnosis in patients with behavioral symptoms, and cognitive impairment.

                Papadopoulos et al. report an inverted-U relationship between tone discriminability and arousal in mouse auditory cortex. A spiking network model with clustered connectivity explains the effects via modulations of metastable attractor dynamics. The model suggests that transitions in dynamical regimes mediate state-dependent sensory processing and induce changes in neural variability.

                <p>Nature Communications, Published online: 09 December 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-66794-6">doi:10.1038/s41467-025-66794-6</a></p>RPA is an essential ssDNA binding protein. Here, authors uncover a phosphosite on RPA70 and show that the RPA70 and RPA32 subunits cooperate through a phosphocode to reconfigure RPA domains. This suggests a common mode of reciprocal regulation of RPA and kinases during G2/M phase of cell cycle.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104054">A dynamic scale-mixture model of motion in natural scenes</a></h4>

              
                Some of the most important tasks of visual and motor systems involve estimating the motion of objects and tracking them over time. Such systems evolved to meet the behavioral needs of the organism in its natural environment, and may therefore be adapted to the statistics of motion it is likely to encounter. By tracking the movement of individual points in movies of natural scenes, we begin to identify common properties of natural motion across scenes. As expected, objects in natural scenes move in a persistent fashion, with velocity correlations lasting hundreds of milliseconds. More subtly, but crucially, we find that the observed velocity distributions are heavy-tailed and can be modeled as a Gaussian scale-mixture. Extending this model to the time domain leads to a dynamic scale-mixture model, consisting of a Gaussian process multiplied by a positive scalar quantity with its own independent dynamics. Dynamic scaling of velocity arises naturally as a consequence of changes in object distance from the observer, and may approximate the effects of changes in other parameters governing the motion in a given scene. This modeling and estimation framework has implications for the neurobiology of sensory and motor systems, which need to cope with these fluctuations in scale in order to represent motion efficiently and drive fast and accurate tracking behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107223">Human neurocomputational mechanisms of guilt-driven and shame-driven altruistic behavior</a></h4>

              
                Although prior research has examined the psychological and neural correlates of guilt and shame, the cognitive antecedents that trigger them, as well as their transformation into social behavior, remain insufficiently understood. We developed a novel task to investigate how two cognitive antecedents, harm and responsibility, elicit guilt and shame, and how these emotions subsequently drive compensatory behavior, by combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with computational modeling in human participants. Behaviorally, we found that harm had a stronger impact on guilt, whereas responsibility had a stronger impact on shame. Moreover, compared to shame, guilt exerted a greater effect on compensation. Computational modeling results indicated that the integration of harm and responsibility by individuals is consistent with the phenomenon of responsibility diffusion. The fMRI results revealed that brain regions associated with inequity representation (posterior insula) and value computation (striatum) encode this integrated measure. Individual differences in responsibility-driven shame sensitivity were associated with activity in theory-of-mind regions (e.g. temporoparietal junction). Guilt-driven and shame-driven compensatory behavior recruited distinct neural substrates, with shame-driven compensatory sensitivity being more strongly linked to activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex, a region implicated in cognitive control. Our findings provide computational, algorithmic, and neural accounts of guilt and shame.

                Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are widely used in regenerative medicine, including the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis. However, implanted MSCs disappear within days, constraining therapeutic efficacy, which is largely attributed to nutrient deprivation. In this study, we established glycogen metabolism engineering strategies in mammalian cells. By expressing a functionally optimized glycogen synthase (GYSmut), MSCs could accumulate large amounts of glycogen rapidly as a reserve substance. Glycogen engineering significantly improved the survival of MSCs during starvation both in vitro and in vivo, enhancing cell viability post-implantation and their therapeutic efficacy in pulmonary fibrosis. Glycogen-engineered MSCs may serve as chassis cells for further applications. Our research highlights the importance of glucose metabolism regulation in cell-based therapy and demonstrates the great potential for the metabolic engineering of MSCs and other therapeutic cells.

">Genetic Targeting and Conductance-Based Modeling Reveal Novel Diversity Within Mouse Type II Spiral Ganglion Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) transmit auditory signals from the cochlea to the brain and are divided into two main types: type I and type II, distinguished by their anatomy and connectivity. However, the function of type II SGNs remains poorly understood due to their scarcity and lack of clear physiological markers. In this study, we use two Cre-dependent fluorescent reporter mouse lines to enhance the identification and targeting of type II SGNs for whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. We reveal a set of distinguishing biophysical features, most notably, the presence of an inactivating potassium current and weaker voltage-gated sodium currents, that clearly separate type II SGNs from their type I counterparts. Additionally, we uncover greater-than-expected heterogeneity among type II SGNs, including variation in size, excitability, and ion channel expression. These features suggest the existence of distinct subtypes of type II SGNs, with potential differences in function. We find that most type II SGNs are relatively inexcitable and incapable of sustained firing. Instead, they appear to be better suited to integrating sustained signals, potentially supporting roles in detecting cochlear damage or modulating efferent feedback. Additionally, through computational modeling, we demonstrate that removing the inactivation component of the inactivating potassium current specific to type II SGNs allowed repetitive spiking to similar levels seen in type I SGNs, suggesting a crucial role for the current in stifling type II SGN activity. Together, our findings define biophysical signatures that distinguish SGN types and subtypes, offering new insight into their contributions to normal hearing and cochlear pathology.

">Stable neuronal representations to repeated stimulation underlie cognitive resilience in Alzheimer's disease pathology</a></h4>

              
                While Alzheimer's Disease (AD) typically triggers cognitive decline, some individuals with significant AD pathology maintain normal cognition into late life. Understanding the neuronal underpinnings of such cognitive resilience would propel the development of interventions for delaying dementia. To this end, we used cognitive testing to identify a subset of cognitively resilient 13-month-old TgF344-AD rats (established AD) and their non-transgenic littermates, followed by Neuropixels recording from 8500 neurons during repeated somatosensory stimulation. Cognitively resilient TgF344-AD rats recruited fewer neurons yet displayed more stable neuronal representations during repeated stimulations in cortical excitatory and hippocampal inhibitory ensembles, with reduced excitatory spike burstiness during network activation and a distinct pattern of functional synaptic connectivity. These associations existed independently of amyloid and tau levels. For the first time, our study revealed neuronal population-level hallmarks of maintained cognition that may serve as a novel neurophysiological biomarker of cognitive resilience and a target for stabilizing cognition.

">Tissue-to-Bytes: A Catalytic Digital Twin Platform for Consortium-Scale Integration of Single-Cell Omics Data in BRAIN Initiative Cell Atlas Network</a></h4>

              
                The NIH BRAIN Initiative Cell Atlas Network (BICAN) is a collaborative effort among neuroscientists, computational biologists, and data scientists to create reference brain cell atlases to be used by the research community as a molecular and anatomical foundational framework for the study of human brain function and disorders. Coordinated sharing and management of the scarce human brain tissue, across lifespans and among the eleven participating BICAN centers and laboratories with anatomical precision, is a formidable undertaking. Creating and operating the necessary data production pipelines with de novo metadata standards prospectively established to adhere to the highest possible levels of Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) data principles, present unparalleled challenges that place BICAN into uncharted territories. A digital twin paradigm has been formulated and operationalized to manage advanced single-cell molecular techniques and complexity of data production workflows that are used in the BICAN consortium. The Neuroanatomy-anchored Information Management Platform (NIMP) implements the digital twin paradigm from conception to design, to production. NIMP is an agile, extensible, catalytic infrastructure for integrative and collaborative BICAN consortium-scale FAIR data generation. Digital-twin thinking ensures that NIPM provides tissue-to-bytes, end-to-end integration of data production pipelines spanning brain banks, laboratories, sequencing centers, and data archives. NIMP digital twin characteristics are manifested in the coupling of real-world workflows occurring in the BICAN laboratories with their digital counterparts moving progressively through verifiable provenance lineage paths. The implementation of NIMP digital twin features are grounded on advanced informatics strategies that include codification of anatomical contexts; standardized tissue request and sharing workflows, library preparation, sequencing, and single-cell omics data generation and deposition. These workflows and processes are governed by standardized Common Data Elements (CDEs); tracked by blockchain-inspired resource-identifiers (ID); ingested and edited using role-based access control (RBAC); and accessed by query-embedded dashboarding and atlas-enabled interactive resource exploration with dynamically rendered Sankey diagrams. In three years, NIMP has managed data and metadata for 762 human donors, 8,449 brain slabs, and 21,781 sequencing libraries across 11 laboratories, resulting in an estimated total of over 18 million cells for Basal Ganglia alone. The NIMP digital twin paradigm not only serves BICAN; it provides a blueprint for future-proof data coordination at consortium scale.

                Though linked to an unusually broad array of functions, the human claustrum's complex morphology has hindered in vivo study, resulting in a small MRI literature marked by implausibly large discrepancies in reported characteristics. We constructed the first three-dimensional histological "gold standard" claustrum model, and systematically evaluated in vivo 7-Tesla MRI datasets against it and downsampled derivatives. MRI showed resolution-dependent differences rather than contrast limitations, transforming the claustrum's intricate sheet into an artefactually thickened ribbon. However, submillimetre MRI reliably recovered the dorsal "core" that contains most claustral volume and density and houses major corticoclaustral connectivity. At 0.5mm resolution, extension into the temporal lobe, including irregular ventral "puddles", was partially recovered, with uncertainty reflecting boundary imprecision rather than anatomical loss. Our results refute the view that the claustrum is inaccessible in the living human brain, define practical measurement limits, and provide a foundation for future functional investigations.

">Stress Coping Style Alters Functional Brain Network Activity to Acute Stressor</a></h4>

              
                Consistent individual differences in behavior (e.g., personality types, stress coping styles) are a common occurrence across animal taxa. One hypothesis poses that the resulting constraints for within-individual behavioral variation may also lead to constraints for the evolution of behavior. With stress coping styles seen across taxa, it suggests a common underlying proximate mechanism. In this study we investigated neural activity patterns across the brain by quantifying immediate early gene expression in individuals with alternative stress coping styles in response to an acute stressor in zebrafish (Danio rerio). While immediate early gene expression levels of individual brain regions in the aversive brain network were similar across groups, functional network activity differed. There were several differences across groups including interactions between the basolateral amygdala and hippocampal homologs. One brain area that had many different connections across groups was the central gray. There were many differences involving central gray activity between proactive and reactive fish at baseline suggesting that baseline activity may prime for the reaction to stress. Collectively, baseline brain activity can predict behaviors, suggesting that these differences in brain interactions at baseline may be important for biasing behavioral responses to stressors that characterizes a stress coping style.

">VCAP-102 Achieves Exceptional BBB Penetration in Marmosets After Ten Years of AAV Capsid Evaluation</a></h4>

              
                Efficient passage of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is essential for achieving broad central nervous system transduction following systemic delivery. Since PHP.B was reported in 2016 to exhibit high BBB permeability in C57BL/6J mice, many BBB-penetrant capsids have been developed, yet their performance often varies substantially across species. From 2016 to 2025, we produced each newly reported BBB-penetrant capsid as its sequence became available and evaluated it under standardized intravenous administration conditions in marmosets. This included PHP.B, PHP.eB, AAV-F, CAP-B22, CAP-B10, CPP.16, CAP-Mac, and BR1N. Although several of these capsids have been reported to penetrate the marmoset BBB, none reproduced these effects under our unified evaluation conditions. We also pursued several directed-evolution approaches to engineer AAV9-based variants with improved BBB permeability; however, none surpassed AAV9. In 2025, VCAP-102 was reported as an AAV9-derived capsid with BBB permeability in mice and non-human primates. When evaluated using our standardized framework, VCAP-102 consistently mediated markedly stronger and more widespread whole-brain transduction than AAV9 across all three animals tested. These findings provide a decade-long, systematic assessment of BBB-penetrant AAV capsids in marmosets and identify VCAP-102 as a highly promising candidate for future systemically delivered AAV-based gene therapies.

                Seasonal hibernation allows species to survive harsh environments by entering a profound hypometabolic and hypothermic state called deep torpor (DT). However, the neural mechanisms controlling entry into this state remain poorly understood. Here, we map neuronal activity across hibernation stages in the Syrian hamster and identify DT-associated activity in the hypothalamic anterior preoptic area (aPOA) as essential for hibernation entry. Single-nucleus multiomic profiling enabled the design of a novel enhancer adeno-associated virus selectively targeting candidate glutamatergic neuronal subpopulations. Using this tool, we demonstrate that activity of a subpopulation of Samd3-positive glutamatergic neurons in the hamster aPOA is both necessary and sufficient for DT induction. Together, our findings identify a neuronal population regulating hibernation entry and provide the first genetic access to manipulate this complex behavior.

                Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the accumulation of -synuclein (-syn) aggregates, which are thought to drive neurodegeneration in vulnerable neuronal populations, particularly within the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway. Here, we aimed to investigate the spatiotemporal relationship between -syn aggregation and dopaminergic cell degeneration by developing an optimized analysis pipeline for efficient whole-brain mapping. We injected -syn preformed fibrils (PFFs) into the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) of wild-type mice, using monomeric -syn-injected mice as the control group. Aggregate propagation and dopaminergic degeneration were analyzed using antibodies against phosphorylated -syn (pS129) and tyrosine hydroxylase, followed by brain clearing combined with high-resolution (<4 m) light-sheet microscopy (LSM), coupled with automated pipeline data analysis. Whole-brain LSM mapping revealed dense somatic and neuritic phosphorylated -syn aggregates within dopaminergic neurons of the SNc 12 weeks post-unilateral PFF injection, accompanied by significant loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons and prion-like propagation -syn aggregates to anatomically connected brain regions, including the striatum. The distribution pattern of -syn pathology visualized by LSM was validated by whole-brain immunohistochemical analysis of PFF-injected mouse brains. The 3D LSM approach introduced here uniquely captures the spatial organization and propagation of -syn pathology and dopaminergic degeneration across interconnected brain networks.

">Loss of neurexins disrupts inhibitory connectivity and increases vulnerability of dopamine neurons in culture</a></h4>

              
                Midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons are essential regulators of basal ganglia function. Their axonal structure is intricate, with numerous non-synaptic release sites and fewer synaptic terminals that notably release glutamate or GABA. Despite their significance, the molecular mechanisms governing DA neuron connectivity and neurochemical identity remain poorly understood. We hypothesize that trans-synaptic cell adhesion molecules such as neurexins (Nrxns) regulate the interactions of DA neuron axons with target cells and thereby influence axonal branching and synapse formation by DA neurons. We therefore examined neuronal survival, axonal growth and synapse formation in cultured DA neurons lacking all neurexins (DAT::NrxnsKO). Conditional deletion of all Nrxns in DA neurons revealed that loss of Nrxns does not disrupt the basic development of these neurons or the structure of their axonal terminals, including normal expression of the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2) and the calcium sensor synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1). However, loss of Nrxns affects the survival of DA neurons and their formation of inhibitory synapses, suggesting that Nrxns regulate the axonal connectivity of these neurons.

">Tether-mediated extraction of myelinoid bodies by microglia and astrocytes can maintain myelin integrity</a></h4>

              
                Oligodendrocytes make myelin for the electrical insulation of axons and saltatory impulse conduction. Myelin lipids and proteins undergo a slow turnover, but exactly how the multilamellar and compacted membrane sheaths are remodeled without compromising myelin sheath integrity has remained puzzling, in particular at advanced age when myelin abnormalities increase. Earlier EM studies had suggested myelin membranes are shed and subsequently phagocytosed by microglia. However, the formation of multilamellar myelinoid bodies (MBs), leaving a well-ordered myelin sheath behind, is difficult to reconcile with simple shedding mechanisms. Here, we show by three-dimensional FIB-SEM reconstructions of optic nerves in mice and by two-photon live-imaging of myelinated cortical slices that MBs are initially connected to their parental sheaths by long tethers, which are stretched by trogocytosing microglia and astrocytes. We observe ruptured tethers attached to both MBs and sheaths, suggesting a novel mechanism of tension-driven tether scission. Importantly, the successive fusion of the corresponding innermost myelin membranes in an extended tether can preserve myelin sheath integrity. Thus, the remodeling by tether-mediated MB extraction emerges as a mechanism of physiological maintenance of myelin sheaths in the CNS.

">Early intervention with a PACAP lactoside following repetitive mild traumatic brain injury prevents persistent LHb hyperactivity and motivational deficits in male mice</a></h4>

              
                Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) often leads to long-lasting mood disorders and motivational deficits, significantly decreasing quality of life. The neuropeptide pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) has known neuroprotective effects and is often deficient in neurological conditions, but its role in preventing mTBI's long-term effects on mood circuits remains unclear. Our previous studies of repetitive closed-head mTBI in murine models found that the lateral habenula (LHb) is a key area for post-injury impairments. These impairments are characterized by mTBI-induced LHb hyperactivity and mood-related behavioral deficits. Here we investigated if a novel PACAP type I receptor (PAC1R) agonist, TES2320, could prevent or treat these long-term mTBI effects. The drug is based on a truncated glycoside analogue of PACAP that is stable and brain penetrant. Using RNAscope, we first found that mTBI caused a persistent and widespread reduction in PACAP mRNA within the LHb, suggesting a possible mTBI-related PACAP signaling deficiency in LHb circuits. We then used two intervention strategies in young adult male mice: an early intervention administered immediately after injury and a late intervention given as a single injection one-month post-injury. One month after injury, we measured LHb activity and self-care grooming motivation. Both early and late PAC1 agonist interventions almost completely normalized the mTBI-induced increases in LHb spontaneous tonic activity and hyperexcitability. However, only the early intervention improved the delayed initiation of grooming seen in mTBI mice. Unfortunately, a single late PAC1R agonist injection not only failed to reverse the grooming delay, but also significantly reduced total grooming behavior 24 hours after treatment. This finding points to a potential behavioral side effect of late PAC1R agonist administration on grooming. Overall, our findings confirm that an early PAC1R agonist intervention effectively prevents mTBI-induced LHb hyperactivity and associated motivational deficits, likely by restoring the persistent PACAP signaling deficiency in the LHb and its related circuits. This preclinical study provides strong evidence that novel PAC1R agonists could be a valuable preventive therapy for mTBI-related depression and anti-reward circuit dysfunction.

">Astrocyte cell-surface proteomics identified CD44 as an OPN/SPP1 receptor regulating lipid metabolism and glial crosstalk in Alzheimer s disease</a></h4>

              
                The development of {beta}-amyloid (A{beta}) pathology in Alzheimer s disease (AD) is accompanied by profound changes in astrocytes and microglia. How these responses are orchestrated by cell surface proteins, key mediators of cell-cell communication, remain unclear. Using in situ astrocyte cell-surface proteome profiling in 5xFAD mice, we identified a set of dysregulated surface proteins induced by A{beta} pathology, including CD44. CD44 was selectively upregulated in plaque-adjacent astrocytes and interacted with osteopontin (OPN), encoded by the diseaseassociated microglia gene Spp1, to promote lipid accumulation, and this effect is {gamma}-secretase dependent. Astrocytic CD44 in turn regulated Spp1 expression and microglial activity. Conditional deletion of Cd44 in adult astrocytes of 5xFAD mice attenuated glial reactivity, reduced A{beta} pathology, and improved cognition. These findings define a plaque-proximal OPN-CD44 axis that controls astrocyte lipid metabolism and glial activity, positioning CD44 as a surface-accessible therapeutic target in AD.

">Profiles of Aging Based on Cognition, Affect, and Brain Reserve</a></h4>

              
                The aging paradox describes improvements in emotional wellbeing as a function of aging, despite declines in cognition. Conversely, late life depression has been associated with increased cognitive decline in aging. We sought to understand these seemingly contradictory patterns of cognitive and mental health in older age. Building on cognitive reserve, affective reserve, and brain reserve models of aging, we developed three alternative algorithmic approaches to group N=22,686 participants from the UK Biobank into different profiles of aging. Our results revealed that aging profiles identified using our data-driven brain reserve model, which incorporated measures of cognition, neuroticism, and brain volume, achieved the highest validation results. Importantly, only two of the four aging profiles were characterized by the aging paradox (i.e., improved emotionality and decreased cognition with age). We identified one profile characterized by particularly low levels of neuroticism and relative resilience to cognitive decline. Another profile benefited from relatively preserved brain volumes, potentially driven by younger ages and/or higher socioeconomic status. Conversely, we identified two profiles with poorer health characteristics, including one profile with elevated cardiovascular risk. Taken together, these findings enrich our understanding of the emotion paradox and highlight the value of taking a nuanced and stratified approach when studying aging. In the future, aging profiles could be used to target preventative strategies to address modifiable risk factors and improve lifespan and healthspan.

">Dentate gyrus drives pattern separation in proximal CA3 during rate, but not global, remapping</a></h4>

              
                Pattern separation converts overlapping experiences into discrete memory traces, with granule-cell sparsity in the dentate gyrus (DG) thought to execute this computation. Proximal CA3 is functionally aligned with the DG through dense reciprocal connectivity, yet the manner in which DG output governs pattern separation within proximal CA3 remains unresolved. This study combined selective DG lesions with high-resolution recordings across the CA3 while rats explored environments that varied in contextual similarity. Global remapping in CA3 remained largely intact following DG lesion, but rate remapping was almost entirely abolished. Discrimination impairments were most pronounced in proximal CA3 and attenuated along the transverse axis toward distal CA3, paralleling the topography of mossy-fiber projections. These data support a hierarchical and mode-specific framework for pattern separation: the entorhinal cortex selects between global and rate remapping according to input dissimilarity, while the DG selectively enhances discrimination of similar inputs via rate-based modulation. This mechanism clarifies how the entorhinal-hippocampal circuit resolves overlapping experiences into distinct memory representations.

">Structure-Function Coupling Aligns with a Unimodal-to-Transmodal Gradient in the Mouse Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how anatomical connectivity shapes brain activity is essential for clarifying brain function and disorders. In the human brain, the regional heterogeneity in structure-function (S-F) coupling is well characterized by measuring correlations between structural and functional connectivity. However, it remains unclear whether the same principles apply to the mouse cortex, where biological mechanisms can be studied directly. Here, we mapped S-F coupling across the mouse cortex by combining high-resolution structural connectivity derived from axonal tracing with resting-state functional connectivity measured by wide-field calcium imaging. Our findings revealed that structural connectivity imposes a robust yet regionally variable constraint on functional connectivity. As in humans, the S-F coupling was strong in primary sensorimotor areas and weaker in association areas, demonstrating a gradient from unimodal-to-transmodal cortical organization. This spatial variation covaried with intrinsic cellular properties, including myelination, excitation-inhibition balance, synaptic density, and gene expression profiles, but did not align with the anatomically defined cortical hierarchy. Our findings highlight graded S-F coupling as a common organizational principle in both the mouse and human cortex, providing a framework for future mechanistic studies using mouse models.

">Towards harmonized spectral quantification in MRSI: Comparative analysis of Backward-Linear-Predicted and original 1H-FID-MRSI dephased data</a></h4>

              
                Object: We hypothesized that the inherent acquisition delay (AD) in 1H-FID-MRSI can introduce systematic LCModel quantification biases due to strong spectral dephasing, and that Backward-Linear-Prediction (BLP) reconstruction toward AD = 0 ms can harmonize metabolite estimates across acquisitions with various delays. Materials and Methods: 2D 1H-FID-MRSI were acquired in rats at 14.1T with three AD values (0.71, 0.94, 1.30 ms). Hippocampal metabolites were quantified using LCModel and AD-matched basis sets. Complementary Monte-Carlo simulations (n = 1000) replicated 1H-FID-MRSI spectra at multiple ADs under realistic SNR conditions. BLP was applied to in vivo and simulated FIDs to back-predict missing points up to AD = 0 ms, enabling quantification within a unified basis set framework. Results: In vivo and simulated data showed clear AD-dependent variations for several metabolites (Gln, tCho, tNAA, Ins, Tau), with discrepancies frequently >10% despite AD-specific basis sets. Simulations confirmed metabolite-specific biases increasing with AD. BLP reconstruction preserved quantification consistency up to 0.98 ms of recovered FIDs, reducing inter-AD mismatches in vivo - particularly for Tau, tNAA and tCho - lowering the mean discrepancy from 10.5% to approx. 5%. Discussion: These findings show that AD affects 1H-FID-MRSI quantification in LCModel, whereas BLP reconstruction can harmonize spectra across delays by enabling a virtual AD = 0 ms quantification scheme. This supports BLP as a practical strategy to improve consistency and comparability in MRSI studies.

                Object: The present study exploits newly developed dynamic indirect 1H-[2H]-FID-MRSI at 9.4T, combined with a dedicated metabolic model, to enable regional and quantitative characterization of glucose oxidative metabolism flux in the rat brain with minimal metabolic assumptions, by measuring both 2H-labelled Glx turnover and pool size along a controlled 2H-Glc infusion protocol. Materials and Methods: Seven rats underwent dynamic 2D 1H-FID-MRSI during a 2-hour infusion of [6,6'-2H2] glucose. Consecutive 13-min acquisitions quantified Glx-C4 1H-signal decay, converted to 2H-Glx concentrations using baseline metabolite pool sizes. A three-pool kinetic model including 2H-label loss was fitted to regional turnover curves to estimate oxidative flux (Vgt) and pyruvate dilution (Kdil). Model performance and parameter robustness were finally assessed with Monte-Carlo simulations. Results: In vivo 2H-Glx turnover showed a saturated exponential rise (~60 min), with a labelling plateau higher in striatum (1.85 mol/g) than hippocampus (1.55 mol/g). Metabolic modelling provided region-specific oxidative fluxes: Vgt = 0.27 {+/-} 0.07 mol/g/min (hippocampus) and Vgt = 0.40 {+/-} 0.06 mol/g/min (striatum), with consistent Kdil across regions. Simulations confirmed a good model robustness in retrieving Vgt over a large range of experimental conditions. Discussion: This work shows the appropriateness of indirect dynamic 1H-[2H]-FID-MRSI for quantitative metabolic flux mapping of cerebral glucose oxidative metabolism.

">Encoding and Decoding of Brain Dynamic Functional Connectivity for ADHD Diagnosis</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies have demonstrated strong associations between the changes in dynamic functional connectivity (FC) and both behavioral and cognitive functions. The sliding window technique is the most widely used method for evaluating dynamic FC; however, it faces two key challenges: distributional shifts across windows and high dimensionality, as FC is computed across windows of the entire time series. To address these issues, we propose BRAINMAP (Bi-level Representation using Attention for INterpretability with Mamba-Aided Prediction) to model the dynamic FC of the brain. BRAINMAP employs the Optimal Transport technique to correct distributional shifts across sliding windows and leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in conjunction with a hybrid approach that integrates an attention mechanism and the Mamba block to effectively capture spatiotemporal features for functional MR images. Finally, we introduce a novel Top-K sliding window feature selection algorithm to induce sparsity in dynamic FC. We conducted an extensive evaluation of our model for diagnosing Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) using three resting-state fMRI datasets: ADHD-200, UCLA, and CNI-TLC, which comprise a total of 447 subjects with ADHD and 845 typically developing controls. Our architecture outperformed existing state-of-the-art dynamic FC models in ADHD detection, achieving improvements ranging from 3% to 12% across the three datasets. We demonstrate that our proposed model produces robust biomarkers, most notably the connection between the dorsal attention network and the visual network. Using an association study, we further establish the clinical relevance of the identified biomarkers.

">Phospho-signalling deregulation of the mTOR pathway in fibroblasts from LRRK2 Parkinson s patients</a></h4>

              
                Activating mutations at the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene are the most frequent genetic cause of Parkinson's Disease (PD). Using in-depth mass-spectrometry, here we analysed the impact of LRRK2 mutations on the proteome and phospho-proteome of skin fibroblasts from a large LRRK2 clinical cohort from Spain. The cohort encompassed G2019S LRRK2-associated PD (L2PD) (n=15), G2019S LRRK2 non-manifesting carriers (L2NMCs) (n=13), idiopathic PD (iPD) (n=12), and control subjects (n=14) (total n=54). The proteome analysis revealed 89 differential proteins in G2019S L2PD (58 down/ 31 up) and 168 in G2019S L2NMCs (127 down / 41 up) compared to controls. Most of these proteome changes involved deficits in proteins related to mitochondrial energy and ribosomal protein synthesis. At the phospho-proteome level, we identified 394 differential phospho-sites in G2019S L2PD (188 hyper / 206 hypo), 367 in G2019S L2NMCs (215 hyper / 152 hypo), and 428 in iPD (214 hyper / 214 hypo) compared with controls. These phospho-proteomic changes included hyper-phosphorylated proteins associated with the mTOR and Rho GTPase pathways. Notably, the top hyper-phosphorylated hit in G2019S carriers was pThr37/46 4E-BP1, a key effector of the mTOR pathway controlling protein synthesis, and this protein was also deregulated in iPD. In summary, our study uncovers peripheral deregulation of mTOR phospho-signalling associated with LRRK2 mutations, which is related to deficits in mitochondrial and ribosomal proteins, and affects converging pathways altered in iPD.

">Anatomical and molecular organization of the nociceptive medial thalamus</a></h4>

              
                The medial thalamus (MTh) is a critical hub for integrating the affective and motivational dimensions of pain, yet its cellular and circuit organization remains poorly defined. Here, we combine activity-dependent genetic tagging, whole-brain clearing and light-sheet imaging, single-cell transcriptomics, and viral circuit tracing to build a comprehensive anatomical and molecular atlas of nociceptive and opioidergic neurons within the MTh. We show that acute and chronic pain activate distinct, spatially localized microdomains across multiple MTh subnuclei, including the central medial, interanteromedial, mediodorsal, and xiphoid nuclei. Activity-dependent tagging reveals a stable ensemble of nociceptive neurons that remains engaged across acute and chronic pain states, suggesting persistent thalamic encoding of affective nociception. Using fluorescent in situ hybridization, we find that most nociceptive-activated neurons express Oprm1, and that nearly all Oprm1 neurons are activated by nociceptive stimuli, identifying a pain-active, -opioid receptor-expressing population in MTh (MThMOR). Rabies-based tracing demonstrates that MThMOR neurons receive convergent inputs from nociceptive and inhibitory regions including the anterior cingulate cortex, periaqueductal gray, parabrachial nucleus, and habenula, while projecting broadly to cortical, subcortical, and brainstem structures involved in pain, arousal, and motivation. Enkephalinergic inputs to MTh arise from distinct, non-nociceptive populations, suggesting parallel pathways for nociceptive transmission and endogenous opioid modulation. Together, these findings define the anatomical and molecular organization of the nociceptive medial thalamus and highlight MThMOR neurons as a cell-type-specific substrate for the development of targeted opioid-based pain therapies.

">Tau interactions with inner nuclear envelope proteins modulates chromatin</a></h4>

              
                Intracellular re-distribution of the neuronal microtubule associated protein Tau, from the axon into the somatodendritic compartment, is a physiological stress-related event that increases Tau in the soma and enables Tau interactions with the nucleus. Cellular functions of stress-induced Tau-Nucleus interactions are unknown. Combining proximity biotinylation interactomics with chromatin imaging and molecular reconstitution assays, we uncover that physiological Tau interacts with proteins coordinating chromatin at the nuclear membrane, including lamin B receptor, thereby changing their DNA interactions. Accordingly, we find that increasing somatodendritic Tau is sufficient to dysregulate expression of genes in lamin associated domains and transcription factors, collectively leading to an upregulation of stress response pathways and downregulation of cholesterol metabolic genes. These nuclear envelope-related mechanisms suggest that neuronal stress-related somatodendritic Tau missorting can initiate chromatin-related cascades important for early changes in AD and tauopathies.

">Electroconvulsive Therapy Induces Dopaminergic Axon Regeneration, Corticostriatal Remodeling, and Restoration of Motor Function in Parkinsonian Mice</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive degeneration of midbrain dopaminergic neurons with loss of axonal dopamine neurotransmission in the dorsal striatum, leading to striatal circuit dysfunction and debilitating motor symptoms. Current therapies provide symptomatic relief but do not restore lost neuronal function. Decades of clinical observations have reported the unexpected observation that electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), a standard treatment for refractory neuropsychiatric disorders, can incidentally alleviate motor symptoms in PD patients, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we report that in the unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) mouse model of PD, two weeks of repeated ECT produced robust and sustained motor recovery, with improvements in locomotion and sensorimotor asymmetry persisting for at least 30 days post-treatment. Remarkably, ECT induced dopaminergic axonal sprouting from surviving dopaminergic neurons with cell bodies located at the substantia nigra-ventral tegmental border, leading to a partial recovery of striatal dopaminergic axonal reinnervation. In striatal direct pathway spiny projection neurons (dSPNs), which exhibit pathological hyperexcitability and spine loss following dopamine depletion, ECT normalized both corticostriatal synaptic responses and spine density. Consistently, ECT upregulated gene transcripts involved in cytoskeletal remodeling while downregulating those associated with glutamatergic signaling and neuronal excitability. These changes were accompanied by a coordinated transcriptional shift toward enhanced mitochondrial anabolic capacity and energy production, including increased expression of genes involved in ATP and Coenzyme Q biosynthesis. Together, these findings demonstrate that ECT can partially restore basal ganglia circuitry following dopamine depletion and provide a basis for further study of its potential as a noninvasive, disease-modifying intervention for PD.

">Modeling the Action-Perception Loop and its role in Phantom Limb Pain using Active Inference</a></h4>

              
                Phantom limb pain is among the most prevalent and distressing consequences of limb amputation. Theories regarding its underlying mechanisms remain disputed, contributing to challenges in effectively treating the pain. In recent years, mathematical models grounded in the Bayesian inference framework have been used to describe various aspects of pain perception. However, pain is not only passively inferred but actively shaped through interactions with the environment--a dimension that classical Bayesian approaches typically do not capture. Because amputation disrupts both sensory input related to the limb and the ability to perform actions, a model incorporating both sensory and active components of pain may provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying phantom limb pain. To this end, we developed a model within the active inference framework, which extends Bayesian inference to include action selection. The model provides a conceptual account of how loss of limb control, ambiguity in sensory input pertaining to limb position, residual noxious input, and preamputation pain may contribute to the emergence and persistence of phantom limb pain. Furthermore, it offers insight into the possible mechanisms underlying common interventions and may help account for their variable efficacy across individuals.

">Master clock-thalamic-prefrontal circuit controls circadian social priority</a></h4>

              
                Social behaviors arise from complex brain operations that adapt to intricate targets and varying states. Achieving a singular social goal requires an extensive social brain network, of which computation is malleable and subject to modulation by diverse internal factors. However, how the brain leverages its internal state to navigate competing social goals is elusive. Here we show that the priority between competing instincts-social novelty versus sexual preference-exhibits a distinct circadian pattern. This is controlled by a two-component circuit linking the master clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a key brain region in the social brain network. Specifically, SCNVIP neurons project to Vipr2-expressing neurons within the thalamic nucleus reuniens (RE), which in turn projects to the mPFC to mediate this behavior. The function of Vipr2 in the RE is critical for shaping the circadian pattern of both appetitive and consummatory social behaviors. This allows higher social functions to be engaged in a timely manner, appropriately aligning prioritized social behaviors with the body's clock-regulated reproductive system. Overall, this SCN-RE-mPFC circuit provides a neural principle through which the master clock coordinates the prefrontal cortex to resolve a conflict of motivated behaviors by referencing an internal state.

">White-Matter BOLD Mediates Time-Varying Cortico-Cortical Functional Connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Functional connectivity (FC) measurements in the brain using BOLD fMRI have largely focused on correlations between gray-matter (GM) BOLD signals, ignoring the possible relevance of white-matter (WM) in delineating neural networks. We first employed a tract-informed mediation framework to test whether WM pathways contribute indirect, bundle-specific effects to cortico-cortical coupling. Using resting-state fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project, we quantified pathway-level mediation effects across GM-WM-GM units and found that WM BOLD signals significantly mediated GM-GM associations, with clear tract-dependent heterogeneity. Building upon this, we examined how dynamic features of WM BOLD signals relate to time-varying intra-cortical FC. We found that temporal variability of WM signals, rather than their mean amplitudes, more closely tracked fluctuations in GM-GM dynamic connectivity, with correlations reaching approximately 0.4 across specific tracts. Together, these results indicate that WM BOLD signals are related to how cortical regions interact, underscoring their integral role in large-scale brain network organization.

">Behavioral orienting but not novelty activates dopamine neurons</a></h4>

              
                Novel stimuli have a profound impact on brain function and behavior. They evoke attention, arousal and sensory exploration and induce synaptic plasticity in brain regions related to learning and memory. Many of these effects have been attributed to novelty-evoked activation of the dopaminergic midbrain and dopamine (DA) release in major projection targets in the striatum. However, it remains controversial if individual DA neurons respond to novel stimuli. To address this question, we recorded and manipulated DA neurons in mice exposed to novel and familiar odors while monitoring orienting behaviors including exploratory sniffing, facial movements, and pupil dilation. We found that DA neurons were activated by orienting behaviors, rather than by novelty itself. Moreover, their activity was causally involved in generating the orienting responses. Finally, we identified a major input region to the dopaminergic midbrain which couples orienting to DA firing. Activity in the mediodorsal pons (mdPons) correlated tightly with sniffing and facial movements. Consequently, optogenetic stimulation of glutamatergic mdPons neurons induced both orienting and DA firing. Our findings suggest that DA neurons do not respond to novelty per se but are activated through descending glutamatergic projections from the mdPons. This mechanism links salient sensory events to DA release, providing a basis for novelty-evoked exploration and plasticity.

">Early life sleep is associated with longevity in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Sleep is a universal behavior that is critical for brain function and physiological homeostasis. While growing epidemiological and experimental evidence suggests reduced sleep quality is associated with negative health outcomes, the causal relationship between sleep loss and reduced longevity remains poorly understood. Here, we examine sleep across the lifespan and its relationship to longevity in Drosophila melanogaster. We examined the associations between numerous components of sleep at different life stages to longevity. Early life sleep, but not middle and late-life sleep, was positively associated with longevity. Age-dependent changes in sleep were consistent but accelerated, when flies are housed under stressful conditions including nutrient and temperature stress. Further, pharmacological restoration of sleep in the first 10 days of life, but not at later time points, increases longevity. Together, this work provides a systematic investigation of how different components of sleep impact longevity and suggests early life sleep may be particularly important in promoting sleep across the lifespan.

">Neuronal APOE4 drives damaging lipid accumulation via contact-dependent neuron-oligodendrocyte-microglia interaction in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) confers the greatest genetic risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). With APOE4 broadly expressed in the brain, its cell-type-specific roles in AD pathogenesis are only beginning to be defined. Here, we show that neuronal APOE4 expression drives damaging lipid accumulation in hippocampal neurons, oligodendrocytes, and microglia, with preferential buildup of peroxidized lipids in microglia in a tauopathy mouse model. Neuron-specific removal of APOE4 abolished this lipid phenotype, whereas neuron-specific expression of APOE4 was sufficient to recapitulate it, demonstrating that neuronal APOE4 is both necessary and sufficient for lipid accumulation. Strikingly, the association between lipid burden, microgliosis, and neurodegeneration was strongest in mice with neuron-specific APOE4 expression. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed neuronal APOE4-vulnerable neuron populations, as well as enrichment of disease-associated microglia and oligodendrocytes, all promoting lipid pathology. Primary mouse co-culture experiments showed that neuronal APOE4 drives microglial lipid accumulation via contact-dependent mechanisms involving uptake of lipids from neurons and oligodendrocytes. These findings establish neuronal APOE4 as a key driver of lipid accumulation via neuron-oligodendrocyte-microglia interactions, providing mechanistic insight into APOE4-driven lipid pathology in AD.

">Early death and neuronal abnormalities in depdc5 loss-of-function mosaic zebrafish models</a></h4>

              
                Abstract DEPDC5 (DEP domain-containing protein 5) encodes a repressor of the mTORC1 signaling pathway. Variants in DEPDC5 are associated with a range of focal epilepsies, including mosaic variants associated with focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) and other focal brain malformations with brain-only somatic mosaic variants. To investigate the role of DEPDC5 in human epilepsy related to mosaic variants, we have generated mosaic depdc5 loss-of-function zebrafish models using homology-based constructs acutely targeting depdc5 and labeled with tdTomato to allow for visualization of the degree of mosaicism. The resulting mosaic depdc5 CRISPants demonstrated early larval death, with ~50% of CRISPants (vs. 10% of controls) dead by 7 days post fertilization (dpf), analogous to the early death sometimes associated with human DEPDC5-related epilepsy. We compared depdc5 CRISPants with uninjected and scrambled controls from the same clutches. Body and head size were reduced in the depdc5 CRISPants. Analysis of swimming behavior showed a striking reduction in distance traveled and maximum velocity in the depdc5 CRISPants vs. controls. Based on visual confirmation of mutational load, we categorized CRISPants into depdc5+ vs. depdc5++, reflecting weak vs. strong tdTomato fluorescence. We observed that depdc5++ CRISPants had increased episodes of posture loss, suggesting increased seizure-like behavior related to higher percentages of mutant cells. Local field potential recordings revealed increased neuronal hyperexcitability in depdc5 CRISPants vs. controls. Acridine orange staining demonstrated early apoptosis in the CRISPants vs. controls. Our mosaic depdc5 CRISPants provide a clinically relevant model to study the role of mosaic DEPDC5-related epilepsy and early death.

Adapting this response when a threat-associated stimulus or situation has become safe requires extinction learning and formation of an extinction memory. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) affords to longitudinally monitor network activity, yet, in the rodent, still suffers from significant variability of results and practical restrictions, mainly related to the different approaches of subject immobilization. Physical restraint of awake animals permits only short scanning times, while anesthesia can induce uncontrolled brain states with limited stimulus responsiveness and processing. Here, we implement a paradigm where light medetomidine sedation permits long scanning times in a stable brain state with functional characteristics comparable to the human resting state. We observe responsiveness of the brain to visual stimulation and large-scale resting-state network activity with small-world connectivity features. After visual fear conditioning outside the MRI scanner, rats exposed to the unreinforced visual conditioned stimulus in this stable persistent activity state inside the scanner (extinction) exhibit a significantly lower conditioned fear response when re-exposed to the conditioned stimulus days after scanning (test). We present a brain state-informed paradigm easily adaptable for future studies involving invasive neural manipulations to causally investigate extinction and its memory consolidation.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Steady-state evoked potentials research has provided significant insights into temporal dynamics of attentional processes. While these studies focused primarily on group-level inspection, there is a need for further research employing methodological approaches that enable the examination of individual-level variability, often linked to various cognitive and clinical outcomes. In the present study (<span style="font-style:italic;">n</span> = 29), we aimed to measure and discern attentional shift processes, examining both group and individual subject dynamics. We utilized electroencephalographic frequency tagging to examine attentional engagement, disengagement, and reengagement while participants switched focus between four flickering stimuli. Analysis of ssVEPs revealed significant changes in amplitude between attentional conditions. Group-level results indicated an increase in activity during engagement with the first target, followed by a decrease upon disengagement, while reengagement with the second target showed a corresponding increase in activity occurring on average 110 ms prior to disengagement. Distinct individual patterns emerged, with participants showing either disengagement, reengagement, both, or no shifts. Notably, the timing and order of these attentional shifts varied considerably. These findings demonstrate the ability of this approach to quantify attentional shifts on both group and individual-level, providing a foundation for further research into individual differences in attentional control, with implications for understanding adaptive and maladaptive psychological functioning.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Face recognition depends upon the ability to match a visual image to a representation stored in memory. During natural viewing, observers fixate centrally on faces, resulting in face parts appearing in specific spatial locations. We examined whether this perceptual experience influences the cognitive and neural mechanisms involved in face recognition. Participants viewed left/right or upper/lower face halves presented in typical (eg left face half in left visual field) or atypical (eg left face half in right visual field) locations. For familiar faces, familiarity judgments were faster and more accurate when face halves were displayed in typical locations. To examine the neural correlates of this recognition bias, fMRI was used to measure responses to familiar face halves presented in typical or atypical spatial locations. Early visual areas (V1–V4) showed responses primarily determined by visual field and were not sensitive to typical spatial presentation. In contrast, the occipital face area and the fusiform face area exhibited greater activations for face halves presented in their typical spatial location. This bias was also evident in regions beyond the visual brain. These findings suggest that higher-level representations used in the perceptual processing of familiar faces are influenced by statistical regularities in real-world face viewing.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>A couple of recent neuroimaging studies together led us to hypothesize—perhaps counterintuitively—that the occipital place area (OPA), which supports “visually-guided navigation” (ie making our way through the immediately visible environment, avoiding boundaries and obstacles), develops later than the retrosplenial complex (RSC), which supports “map-based navigation” (ie finding our way from a specific place to some distant, out-of-sight place). But is this true? We directly test this hypothesis using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) adaptation in 5- and 8-year-old children and ask when OPA and RSC represent left and right information—information that both regions represent in adulthood, albeit for different kinds of navigation. Our results revealed that in 5-year-olds, OPA does not represent left/right information and only does so in 8-year-olds. By contrast, RSC in 5-year-olds represents left/right information, like in 8-year-olds. These findings strongly support our hypothesis: the OPA, which is involved in visually-guided navigation, develops later than the RSC, which supports map-based navigation. This developmental timeline not only demonstrates that OPA and RSC develop at different rates but also strengthens the case that these regions serve distinct roles in adult human navigation—since a single system cannot follow two separate developmental trajectories.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Choice consistency denotes the capacity to maintain stable, coherent preferences across diverse contexts—a cornerstone of rational decision-making. However, real-world decisions frequently diverge from normative models, marked by inconsistencies and irrationalities. Memory processes may underlie this variability, influencing the formation and maintenance of choice consistency. Yet, the interplay between memory and choice consistency, particularly their shared neural substrates, remains poorly understood. To address these gaps, we developed a novel behavioral paradigm integrating memory retrieval and food-based decision tasks. Resting-state and task functional magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired from 44 healthy young adults (age range: 18 to 27 years). Behaviorally, remembered food items exhibited significantly faster choice reaction times compared to forgotten items. Leveraging data-driven connectome-based predictive modeling of resting-state functional connectivity, we identified distinct neural predictors: intra-default mode network connectivity and default mode network–memory network connectivity positively predicted memory accuracy, whereas default mode network–frontoparietal control network connectivity negatively predicted memory accuracy. Furthermore, intra-default mode network connectivity and default mode network–frontoparietal control network connectivity positively predicted choice consistency. These findings advance our understanding of memory-decision interactions, highlighting the default mode network and frontoparietal control network as critical neural substrates that bridge mnemonically modulated value signals and choice consistency.</span>

Previous evidence from two independent research lines suggests that both how we represent the interaction goal and the human/non-human nature of the co-actor may affect how we process (and react to) their mistakes. Here, we examined in a full-factorial design whether these two factors modulate how we monitor someone else’s errors during minimally joint tasks. During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), participants interacted with a human or the computer while sharing or not the goal of playing a melody together (shared vs. individual goal conditions). We used implied-motion pictures of a human hand to represent the human partner’s responses, while a robotic piston represented the computer’s ones. Despite the minimal nature of the interaction, multivariate pattern analysis revealed that it was possible to decode the human/non-human nature of the partner from post-error brain activation patterns but only in the shared goal condition. With both partners, post-error behavioral adaptations in this condition were associated with activation of the pre-supplementary motor area and right anterior insula, brain regions responsible for proactive action control. Goal sharing is thus a powerful factor in boosting interpersonal action monitoring with both human and non-human partners.</span>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Hippocampal theta and gamma rhythms are often viewed as discrete channels supporting distinct cognitive operations. In particular, “gamma multiplexing” models propose that slow and fast gamma bands independently encode separate information streams or memory processes. Here, we present an alternative view: hippocampal oscillations form an interdependent process, governed by an energy cascade akin to turbulent flow across scales. In this framework, large-amplitude, low-frequency rhythms drive energy transfer to higher-frequency oscillations, rather than acting as isolated carriers of segregated information. Using laminar local field potential recordings in freely moving mice, we show that optogenetic inactivation of the medial entorhinal cortex or CA1 reduces theta power, leading to proportional reductions across the entire gamma spectrum (60–100 Hz). These data support the perspective that the putative ‘slow gamma’ component (30–50 Hz) potentially reflects higher-order theta harmonics rather than a distinct, independent rhythm. Moreover, locally generated gamma remains tightly coupled to theta, supporting an interdependent frequency spectrum modulated by network excitation. These findings challenge gamma multiplexing models and instead support an energy cascade framework, in which hippocampal gamma emerges from hierarchical, theta-driven oscillatory dynamics. Recognizing gamma as part of an interdependent, turbulence-like process reconciles contradictions in prior research and redefines how hippocampal oscillations contribute to cognition.</p>

                Rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Digital Twin (DT) technology, and the Metaverse have created new opportunities for transforming STEM education and workforce preparation. However, existing learning systems remain fragmented and lack an integrated, human-centered framework capable of supporting high-fidelity simulations, adaptive learning, and real-time competence development aligned with Industry 5.0. This study addresses this gap by developing a unified AI-Based Digital Twins Metaverse (AI-DTM) framework aimed at strengthening STEM employability skills and fostering adaptive expertise in higher education. This research employed a conceptual–analytical design comprising three structured phases: (1) a systematic conceptual synthesis guided by PRISMA 2020 to identify technological, pedagogical, and human-centric mechanisms relevant to AI, DTs, and Metaverse-based learning; (2) construction of an integrated AI-DTM framework through theoretical mapping, concept modeling, and iterative refinement; and (3) expert validation involving specialists in AI systems, digital twins, immersive learning, and instructional design. Evidence from interdisciplinary literature across AI-enhanced learning, DT-enabled simulation, and XR-based experiential environments informed the development of the framework. The resulting AI-DTM framework integrates AI-driven learner modeling, real-time DT simulations, and immersive Metaverse environments to create a unified, adaptive ecosystem. Key outcomes include: (a) personalized learning pathways supported by intelligent analytics and automated feedback; (b) high-fidelity, risk-free simulations that replicate authentic STEM work processes; (c) immersive and collaborative virtual experiences that enhance engagement, problem-solving, and teamwork; and (d) continuous competence profiling enabling the development of adaptive expertise. The framework demonstrates strong alignment with Industry 5.0 principles, supporting human–AI collaboration, data-driven decision-making, and future workforce readiness. This study provides a novel, scalable model that advances the design of AI-enabled learning ecosystems by integrating AI, Digital Twins, and Metaverse technologies into a cohesive architecture. The AI-DTM framework offers theoretical and practical contributions for enhancing STEM employability skills, strengthening adaptive expertise, and guiding institutions.

                The Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) framework is a pivotal tool for organizing mechanistic knowledge and linking it to adverse outcomes of regulatory significance. However, the integration of test method information, particularly New Approach Methods (NAMs), within the central repository for AOP knowledge, (the AOP-Wiki), has been suboptimal, limiting the framework’s utility for regulatory decision-making. The Methods2AOP collaboration, comprised of various international stakeholders, was established to address this gap and enhance the role of test methods within the AOP framework. This paper reviews their work emphasizing the importance of linking detailed test method information and conceptually proposes how it may be included in the AOP knowledgebase. The Methods2AOP collaboration proposes using ontologies to standardize and structure information, thereby facilitating interoperability, enabling reusability, and establishing clear connections between test methods and Key Events (KEs). A conceptual model is presented to demonstrate qualitative similarities between concepts in key event components and structured methods information. The implementation of Methods2AOP recommendations would increase the clarity and transparency of method descriptions, which could support regulatory acceptance and a wider adoption of NAMs. The broad community of stakeholders impacted by this work stands to benefit from the Methods2AOP recommendations through enhanced regulatory decisions, increased visibility and scientific impact, new market opportunities, and the accelerated adoption of NAMs in regulatory affairs. In summary, the Methods2AOP collaboration presents a comprehensive effort to formally standardize the integration of test methods into the AOP framework, thereby fostering a more robust, and transparent system that aligns with the goals of the scientific and regulatory communities.

                Background Corruption, a multifaceted governance issue, impacts public well-being globally. The recent trends reveal a rise in suicide rates across the Americas, while all other regions show declines over twenty years of time. This study investigates corruption’s effect on suicide in 26 American countries, considering moderating factors of unemployment, inflation, and economic growth. Methods This study analysed latest two decades of available data, using stepwise panel regression method to investigate the effects of corruption and economic variables on suicide across income levels. Data were sourced from Transparency International, World Bank and the World Health Organization. Initially, unit root tests and CUSUM plots were used to ensure the stability and stationarity of the dataset, and model specification were validated through F test, LM test and Hausman test to select the ideal econometric model - POLS, REM, or FEM for the study. Results A strong suicide rate persistence revealed, particularly in high-income countries, where the lagged suicide variable showed a coefficient of 0.8063 (p < 0.001). Corruption significantly impacted suicide rates in upper-middle-income countries (coefficient = -0.0268, p < 0.05), with higher corruption perceptions scores correlating with lower suicide rates. Additionally, unemployment acted as a significant moderator, intensifying the corruption’s adverse impact on suicide with a coefficient of 0.0022 (p < 0.001) in upper-middle income nations. Economic growth demonstrated a minor protective effect, particularly in high-income regions, with an interaction coefficient of -0.0005 (p < 0.1), suggesting slight suicide reduction linked to economic stability. Conclusion This study found that corruption, unemployment, and economic growth significantly influence suicide rates across the Americas. Corruption exacerbates suicide risks in upper-middle-income countries, while unemployment amplifies this effect. Economic growth offers a slight protective effect, particularly in high-income regions, suggesting that economic stability may help mitigate suicide rates.

                Background Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide, and the emergence of drug resistance, systemic toxicity, and limited efficacy of current therapies highlight the need for safer and more effective treatment. Natural products have emerged as promising sources of multi-target anticancer agents. A. cardamomum has demonstrated preliminary anticancer potential, yet the bioactive constituents and their molecular mechanisms in breast cancer remain poorly elucidated. Methods This study integrated in silico approaches to investigate the therapeutic potential of A. cardamomum seed extract against breast cancer. LC–MS analysis identified phytochemical compounds, followed by network pharmacology to determine their potential targets and molecular pathways. Pharmacokinetic and toxicity predictions were assessed through ADMET and Lipinski’s rule of five analyses to evaluate drug-likeness and safety. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted to evaluate binding affinity and structural stability of compounds with key oncogenic proteins. Results LC-MS profiling identified 22 distinct compounds in A. cardamomum seeds. ADMET and Lipinski analyses demonstrated that most compounds possessed high gastrointestinal absorption, favorable oral bioavailability, and low toxicity risk. Network pharmacology highlighting SRC, TNF-α, Caspase-3, and EGFR as central nodes in the protein-protein interaction network. Molecular docking identified compounds C17 and C20 as the most promising bioactives, showing strong binding affinities and interactions similar to control ligands. MD simulations confirmed their stable complexes, indicating conformational stability and robust ligand–protein interactions. Conclusion This study highlights the promising multi-target anticancer potential of A. cardamomum seeds. Compounds C17 and C20 were identified as lead candidates with strong and stable interactions with key breast cancer-related proteins and favorable pharmacokinetic properties. These results suggest that A. cardamomum could serve as a potential source for developing new plant-based therapies against breast cancer. Further in vitro and in vivo investigations are warranted to validate their efficacy and safety.

                Background Adolescent depression affects approximately 13% of youth globally, often emerging before age 14 and leading to long-term impairments in social, academic, and emotional functioning. Evidence suggests that mentalization-based treatment (MBT), particularly its adolescent adaptation, may reduce depressive symptoms by strengthening reflective functioning. Methods This single-arm pilot study will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a short-term, family-inclusive MBT intervention for 15 adolescents aged 10–14 years with mild-to-moderate depression in Valparaíso, Chile. The intervention consists of 12 weekly sessions delivered in three phases: shared formulation, promotion of individual and family mentalization, and evaluation of therapeutic progress. Feasibility outcomes include recruitment, retention, and adherence rates. Secondary outcomes include changes in depressive and anxiety symptoms, family cohesion, and therapeutic processes. Qualitative interviews with adolescents, caregivers, and therapists will complement quantitative data. Results The study will generate parameters on feasibility, adherence, and acceptability, as well as preliminary estimates of clinical and process outcomes to inform the design of a future randomized controlled trial. Conclusions Findings will guide the cultural adaptation and potential scaling of adolescent and family MBT within the Chilean public health system. This protocol outlines the methodological framework and expected contributions of the study to clinical practice and research on adolescent depression.

                Celiac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by gluten in genetically susceptible individuals, characterized by villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and intraepithelial lymphocytosis. Despite advances in serological testing, duodenal biopsy remains the diagnostic gold standard, especially in atypical or patchy disease. This retrospective study at King Fahd University Hospital (KFUH), Saudi Arabia, evaluated the diagnostic contribution of biopsies from the duodenal bulb (D1) and distal duodenum (D2) in 224 patients assessed for suspected CD between August 2023 and August 2024. Clinical, serological [IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-TG2), anti-endomysial antibodies (EMA), deamidated gliadin peptide], and histopathological data were analyzed. Sixty-five patients (29%) were diagnosed with CD. Villous atrophy, mucosal flattening, and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes were strongly associated with CD (p ≤ 0.001), and positive anti-TG2 and EMA correlated with Marsh grade. Combined D1 and D2 sampling improved diagnostic yield, underscoring the value of integrating histology and serology in evaluating classical and non-classical CD presentations.

                <p>by Dmitry Amakhin, Anton Chizhov, Guillaume Girier, Mathieu Desroches, Jan Sieber, Serafim Rodrigues</p>

In this article we demonstrate a general protocol for constructing systematically experimental steady-state bifurcation diagrams for electrophysiologically active cells. We perform our experiments on entorhinal cortex neurons, both excitatory (pyramidal neurons) and inhibitiory (interneurons). A slowly ramped voltage-clamp electrophysiology protocol serves as closed-loop feedback controlled experiment for the subsequent current-clamp open-loop protocol on the same cell. In this way, the voltage-clamped experiment determines dynamically stable and unstable (hidden) steady states of the current-clamp experiment. The transitions between observable steady states and observable spiking states in the current-clamp experiment provide partial evidence for stability and bifurcations of the steady states. This technique for completing steady-state bifurcation diagrams in a model-independent way expands support for model validation to otherwise inaccessible regions of the phase space. Overlaying the voltage-clamp and current-clamp protocols leads to an experimental validation of the classical <i>slow-fast dissection</i> method introduced by J. Rinzel in the 1980s and routinely applied ever since in order to analyse slow-fast neuronal models. Our approach opens doors to observing further complex hidden states with more advanced control strategies, allowing to control real cells beyond pharmacological manipulations.

                <p>by Rainey Lyons, Vanja Dukic, David M. Bortz</p>

Characteristics of individuals in a population, such as age and size, play a key role in determining how populations change over time. In contexts of population dynamics, identifying effective model features, such as fecundity and mortality rates, is generally a complex and computationally intensive process, especially when the dynamics are heterogeneous across the population. In this work, we propose a Weak form Scientific Machine Learning-based method for selecting appropriate model ingredients from a library of scientifically feasible functions used to model structured populations. This paper presents extensions of the Weak form Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (WSINDy) method to select the best-fitting ingredients from noisy time-series histogram data. This extension includes learning heterogeneous dynamics and also learning the boundary processes (such as birth) of the model directly from the data. We additionally incorporate a cross-validation method which helps fine tune the recovered boundary process hyperparameters to the data.
Several test cases are considered, demonstrating the method’s performance for several standard models from population modeling, including age and size-structured models. Through these examples, we examine both the advantages and limitations of the method, with a particular focus on the distinguishability of terms in the library.

Understanding how the human brain processes body movements is essential for clarifying the mechanisms underlying social cognition and interaction. This study investigates the encoding of biomechanically possible and impossible body movements in occipitotemporal cortex using ultra-high field 7Tesla fMRI. By predicting the response of single voxels to impossible/possible movements using a computational modelling approach, our findings demonstrate that a combination of low-level, postural, biomechanical, and categorical features significantly predicts neural responses in the ventral visual cortex, particularly within the extrastriate body area (EBA), underscoring the brain’s sensitivity to biomechanical plausibility.

Learning by observing others’ experiences is a hallmark of human intelligence. While the neurocomputational mechanisms underlying observational learning are well understood, less is known about whom people prefer to learn from in the context of observational learning. One hypothesis posits that learners prefer individuals who exhibit a high degree of decision noise, ‘free riding’ on the costly exploration of others. An alternative hypothesis is that learners prefer individuals with low decision noise, as lower decision noise is often associated with better performance. In a preregistered experiment, we found that most participants preferred to learn from low-noise (high-performing) individuals. Furthermore, exploratory analyses revealed that participants who preferred low-noise individuals tended to rely on imitation of others’ actions. These findings offer a potential computational account of how learning styles are related to partner selection in social learning.

                <p>by Longqiang Wang, Xiao Wu, Atanu Paul, Jun Yao, Bin Wang</p>

The breast and ovarian tumor suppressor BRCA1 is a cell cycle-regulated protein and tumors with reduced BRCA1 protein level may share molecular features of <i>BRCA1</i>-mutant tumor and respond to PARPi therapy. Here, we identify that BRCA1 protein stability is controlled through ubiquitin lysine 11 (K11)-linkage modification under the regulation of Cezanne deubiquitinating enzyme, APC/C E3 ligase, and Ube2S E2 conjugating enzyme in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Cezanne-deficiency leads to increased BRCA1 K11-ubiquitination, decreased BRCA1 protein level, and increased cellular sensitivity to PARPi. The BRCA1 K11-linked ubiquitination is carried out through a degron on BRCA1 that is recognized by APC/C cofactor Cdh1. Tumor expression and mutational analyses indicate that Cezanne low or Ube2S high expression is associated with “BRCAness” and correlated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. Thus, our study has demonstrated a ubiquitin K11-linked ubiquitination pathway that regulates BRCA1 protein stability, dysregulation of which predicts BRCA1-deficiency that may be effectively targeted with PARPi therapy.

                <p>by Eudald Pascual-Carreras, Kathrin Garschall, Patrick R. H. Steinmetz</p>

Animals with lifelong growth adjust their growth rates to nutrient availability, yet the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we studied how food supply and TOR signaling regulate the cell cycle in a multipotent population of Vasa2-/Piwi1-expressing cells in the sea anemone <i>Nematostella vectensis</i>. We discovered that starvation induces a reversible G<sub>1</sub>/G<sub>0</sub> cell cycle arrest in Vasa2+/Piwi1+ cells and that cell cycle re-entry upon refeeding is dependent on TOR signaling. In addition, the length of the refeeding stimulus after starvation determines the proportion of cells that re-enter S-phase. Remarkably, prolonged starvation delayed both refeeding-induced TOR signaling activation and S-phase re-entry, and led to a global decrease in the active histone mark H3K27ac in Vasa2+/Piwi1+ cells. This strongly suggests that <i>Nematostella</i> Vasa2+/Piwi1+ cells undergo starvation-controlled quiescence deepening, a phenomenon previously described only in unicellular eukaryotes and mammalian cell culture. The nutritional control of quiescence and cell proliferation may thus be a fundamental, evolutionarily conserved strategy underlying the environmental regulation of indeterminate growth in animals.

The hydroxycarboxylic acid receptors (HCAR2 and HCAR3), also known as prototypical metabolite-sensing receptors, are key targets for treating dyslipidemia and metabolic disorders. While HCAR2 activation, but not HCAR3 activation, is associated with side effects of cutaneous flushing, the structural features and ligand preferences of HCAR3 remain less understood. Here, we used Sf9 cells to express HCAR3-Gi and HCAR2-Gi complexes, and present cryo-EM structures of HCAR3-Gi complexes with agonists compound 6O (3.31 Å), D-phenyllactic acid (3.05 Å), IBC293 (3.26 Å), and acifran (3.18Å), as well as HCAR2-Gi complex with agonist acifran (2.72 Å). Our findings reveal the mechanism behind 6O’s highest affinity to HCAR3, attributed to its full occupation of both R1 and R2 regions of the orthosteric binding pocket. Moreover, combined with cAMP assay in HEK-293 cells, we have elucidated that the ligand selectivity between HCAR3 and HCAR2 depended on <i>π</i>–<i>π</i> interaction with F107<sup>3.32</sup> (L107<sup>3.32</sup> in HCAR2) and ligand-binding pocket size difference, facilitated by key residues difference V/L83<sup>2.60</sup>, Y/N86<sup>2.63</sup>, and S/W91<sup>23.48</sup>. Collectively, these structural insights lay the groundwork for developing HCAR3-specific drugs, potentially avoiding HCAR2-induced adverse effects.

                Background To present a decade-long evaluation of the Turkish Pediatric Endocrinology Subspecialty Board Examination (TPEBE), focusing on its structural evolution, psychometric performance, and candidates’ perceptions. Methods This cross-sectional study analyzed examination data from 2015–2025, encompassing 263 sittings (261 eligible candidates) and post-exam survey responses from 217 participants. Examination metrics included mean scores, pass rates, and reliability coefficients (Cronbach’s α) for multiple-choice question (MCQ) and key feature problem (KFP) components. Survey items assessed perceptions of exam difficulty, fairness, relevance, and organization using a 9-point Likert scale. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Results Mean total scores declined following the 2019 inclusion of KFPs (x̄=52.9±9.05 in 2025), while reliability improved progressively (MCQ α=0.53–0.90; KFP α=0.31–0.85). Pass rates varied from 22.6% to 85.0%. Male candidates scored higher on MCQs and total scores (p<0.05), but gender differences in KFP performance and overall pass rates were not statistically significant. Candidates rated the examination highly for organization (x̄=7.75±1.54) and clinical relevance of KFPs (x̄=7.35±1.59), though exam duration received the lowest satisfaction (x̄=5.14±2.97). Qualitative feedback emphasized the educational value of KFPs and recommended extended testing time. Conclusions Over ten years, the TPEBE has evolved into a psychometrically robust and educationally valuable certification process. The balanced integration of MCQs and KFPs has strengthened construct validity and candidate engagement. These examinations are expected to gain broader recognition by institutions and regulators as a benchmark for educational and professional achievement.

                Methane (CH₄) and carbon monoxide (CO) remain two of the most critical air pollutants due to their significant environmental and health risks. This study investigates the enhancement of pollutant removal efficiency in plasma-based systems by examining how spark discharge polarity affects gas treatment performance under sub-atmospheric pressure. Using a tubular electrostatic precipitator (ESP) operated at 15, 20, and 25 kV and pressures of 380, 406, and 508 Torr, we measured key plasma parameters including discharge current, electron temperature and density, ozone (O3) generation, specific energy input (SEI), and gas removal efficiency under both positive and negative polarity conditions. Our results show that higher electron temperatures and discharge currents increase the availability of energetic electrons capable of enhancing molecular dissociation and pollutant removal. Negative polarity produced a more active plasma, yielding maximum removal efficiencies of 88% for CH₄ and 87% for CO at 25 kV and 380 Torr, driven by intensified formation of reactive species such as O•, OH•, and O3 that promote oxidative degradation. SEI increased with voltage, reaching 873 J/L under optimal conditions, in close correlation with peak removal performance. The system exhibited a 20.3°C rise in outlet gas temperature within 120 seconds, indicating substantial energy deposition while maintaining non-thermal plasma behavior. These findings demonstrate that pollutant removal in ESP systems is governed primarily by plasma-chemical reactions rather than electrostatic collection, and they provide a practical pathway for optimizing spark-driven ESP reactors for indoor air purification applications targeting low concentrations of CH₄ and CO.

                Background The South African Constitution recognizes equal access to education as a fundamental human right for all individuals. However, despite progressive legislative frameworks, students with physical disabilities continue to face infrastructural, attitudinal, and systemic barriers that hinder full participation in higher education institutions. Aim This study explored the lived experiences of students with physical disabilities at a university in KwaZulu-Natal. Methods This study employed a phenomenological qualitative study design using semi-structured interviews to explore the lived experiences of students with physical disabilities at a university in KwaZulu-Natal. Purposive sampling was used to recruit eight participants across different colleges, who shared their in-depth perspectives and experiences through in-person and virtual interviews. Data were analysed thematically. Results Seven main themes emerged from the data. These include: (1) inadequate and misaligned accessibility to campus infrastructure, (2) stakeholder influence on the lack of an adequate, accommodating environment, (3) inaccessible and insufficient transport services, (4) inconsistencies and gaps in disability support services, (5) attitudinal barriers, (6) positive peer interactions and social inclusion, and (7) student-driven future recommendations. Conclusion The findings highlight that while peer support fosters a sense of belonging, systemic barriers persist. These findings underscore the need for proactive, consultative, and equity-driven approaches that prioritize universal design, stakeholder accountability, and the meaningful inclusion of students with physical disabilities in decision-making processes. Contribution The findings underscore the need for alignment between policy and practice through student consultation in decision-making and enhancing stakeholder awareness of students’ grievances.

                Background Despite plentiful research on the link between corporate governance (CG) and dividend policy, the mediating impact of corporate social responsibility (CSR) on the CG –dividend policy link remains unexplored. This study investigates the mediating impact of CSR on the CG –dividend policy link, and explores the mechanism through which CSR mediates this relationship. Methods Firms listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges are considered as a study sample. The data collection period ranged from 2012 to 2021. The final sample included 15,800 firm-year observations. Results The results findings indicate that firms with strong CG tend to pay low dividends, consistent with the substitution hypothesis, in which dividends and CG act as substitutes for each other. In addition to establishing a direct link between CG and dividend policy, our study significantly contributes to the extant literature by presenting both theoretical proposition and empirical evidence on the mediation effect of CSR in the above-mentioned relationship. We find that CSR mediates the corporate governance- dividend policy relationship, which implies that in comparison to corporate governance, CSR has a more dominating impact on firms’ dividend policy decisions, and better-governed firms are more likely to engage in CSR activities to protect their stakeholders; consequently, they prefer to hold or invest cash instead of paying dividends because CSR engagements lower the cost of equity capital. These findings were corroborated by a set of robustness tests. Conclusions Our results have several implications for firms, regulators, and investors. Firms can use high dividend payouts to compensate for poor investor protection and to maintain good relationships with investors. When making investment decisions, investors are advised to consider socially responsible firms because of their strong CG structure. Finally, policy makers should give special consideration to CSR in order to reduce environmental and social problems and to enhance the related standards to ensure the safety and security of all stakeholders and hence reduce global accusation and pressure.

                Background In the context of 21st century education, creative thinking is a key competency required to navigate complex and rapidly changing global challenges. However, in the digital era, students’ creative thinking skills are often insufficiently developed due to the lack of attention to learning profiles, interests, and readiness. In social studies learning, this issue limits students’ opportunities to explore and express creative ideas. Methods This study aimed to design and implement a hypermedia e-module based on differentiated learning, called EduHYPE-IPS, to enhance elementary school students’ creative thinking skills. The research employed a Research and Development (R&D) with ten stages the Borg and Gall model. The participants were fifth-grade students from six elementary schools in Majalengka and Yogyakarta, selected purposively. Data were collected through creative thinking tests and response questionnaires from students and teachers, and analyzed using descriptive and comparative statistics to determine validity, practicality, and effectiveness. Results The developed e-module achieved a high level of validity, with an average expert validation score of 92.45% across media, content, and language aspects. Field trials demonstrated an improvement in students’ creative thinking, with an average N-Gain of 22.46% in the control class and 51.81% in the experimental class. Both students and teachers responded very positively, indicating that EduHYPE-IPS was engaging, user-friendly, and effective in supporting differentiated learning. Conclusions The findings confirm that the hypermedia e-module meets the criteria of being valid, practical, and effective. EduHYPE-IPS can serve as an innovative digital learning resource to foster creativity in primary education and as a practical tool for teachers to design engaging, student-centered lessons integrating technology with differentiated teaching strategies.

<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Dentatorubral-Pallidoluysian Atrophy (DRPLA) is a dominant neurodegenerative disease caused by CAG triplet repeat expansion in <i>ATN1</i>, which encodes the transcriptional co-repressor Atrophin-1. DRPLA features motor, cognitive, and epileptic symptoms and shares pathogenic mechanisms with other polyglutamine (polyQ) disorders, including protein misfolding, impaired autophagy, and transcriptional dysregulation. To understand disease mechanisms, we performed RNA-seq on HEK293T cells stably over-expressing wild-type or pathogenic ATN1. Cells expressing pathogenic ATN1 exhibited a distinct transcriptomic profile, including disruptions in synaptic organization, extracellular matrix remodeling, ion channel expression, and neurotransmission. Several genes tied to neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, and oncogenic pathways were fully activated or silenced. Dysregulated pathways also included inflammation, chromatin remodeling, stress responses, and redox imbalance. Heat shock protein expression changes suggested proteotoxic stress and impaired protein quality control, with some findings conserved in a previously reported <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> model of DRPLA. The transcriptomic signatures that we describe here expand understanding of the normal functions of ATN1 and the biology of disease of DRPLA.</p>

                Background Bariatric surgery, particularly sleeve gastrectomy (SG), has emerged as an effective long-term treatment for morbid obesity. Despite its benefits, howver, it may result in severe complications. One rare but serious postoperative issue is the development of a gastrobronchial fistula (GBF), a condition with a challenging diagnosis and management pathway due to its insidious nature. Case Presentation We report the case of a 36-year-old woman who underwent sleeve gastrectomy in 2015. The early postoperative course was complicated by a gastric fistula that was managed with double pigtail stents. Subsequently, the patient developed recurrent bronchopulmonary infections, and imaging in 2017 revealed a GBF connecting the gastric remnant to the bronchial tree. Initial endoscopic management with stenting failed because of migration. Definitive surgical management involved complex adhesiolysis and creation of tension-free fistula-jejunal anastomosis. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and the patient remains asymptomatic. Discussion Gastrothoracic fistula post-bariatric surgery is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication. Their development is often linked to the insufficient treatment of early gastric leaks or collections. Diagnosis is frequently delayed owing to nonspecific respiratory symptoms. Endoscopic approaches have show limited success, and surgical management, often complex, is frequently necessary. Multidisciplinary strategies, including endoscopic and surgical options, are vital for achieving favorable outcomes. Conclusion Gastrobronchial fistulas represent a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge following sleeve gastrectomy. A high index of suspicion, long-term follow-up, and tailored multidisciplinary approach are essential for effective management and resolution. Awareness of this rare complication should prompt early detection and intervention to reduce the morbidity and mortality.

<p>Recapitulative schema of different exploratory levels of the evolutionary impact on human neurological diseases.
</p>
<br/>
<p>Clinical neuroscience focuses on the mechanisms of brain function, but this approach falls short of insights into how the central nervous system (CNS) evolved, both in health and disease. Here, we discuss evolutionary concepts relevant to understanding human brain diseases, on the genetic, subcellular, cellular, connectomic, behavioral, and cultural levels. By revisiting common neurological diseases, we discuss evolved residues from our ancestors, mechanisms of exaptation, antagonistic pleiotropy, and human longevity with the consequent outpacing of biological evolution by cultural evolution. An evolution-based conceptual framework can propel transdisciplinary research targeting the constraints imposed by and compensatory adaptations involved in human-specific neurological diseases.

<p>ASDs are neurodevelopmental disorders of social behavior deficits and repetitive / restricted behaviors, affecting 1 in 31 children in the U.S. Pharmacological interventions for the core symptoms of ASD are lacking. ASD genetics are highly heterogenous, with hundreds of genes conferring risk, though these genes are beginning to converge on shared molecular, cellular, and circuit mechanisms, representing potential new paths for treatment development.

<br/>
<p>Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by deficits in social communication and interaction and the presence of repetitive and restricted behaviors. ASDs are clinically and genetically heterogeneous with hundreds of genes identified through large-scale whole exome and genome sequencing studies contributing to risk. Recent studies are beginning to illuminate shared mechanisms across ASD-associated genes at the molecular, cellular, circuit, and behavioral levels, identifying neurogenesis and excitatory-inhibitory neuron development as points of biological convergence. These functional analyses of ASD genes provide substantial promise for gaining a deeper understanding of ASD pathophysiology and elucidating novel therapeutic targets.

                <p>Reversing the aging process may yield significant benefits in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS), as accelerated biological aging is observed in this population. Secondary analyses of 2 previously conducted dietary interventions including a 6-month modified ketogenic diet in 39 participants and an 8-week randomized comparison of intermittent and daily calorie restriction versus a weight-stable regimen in 36 participants demonstrated significant decreases in metabolomic age (mAge) following the ketogenic diet (<i>p</i> = 0.009) and intermittent calorie restriction (<i>p</i> = 0.04), whereas daily calorie reduction had no effect. These findings indicate that fasting-mimicking diets (FMDs) can reverse accelerated metabolomic aging in PwMS. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1278–1282</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Socioeconomic status (SES) and lifestyle activities (LA) are strongly related, and both are associated with dementia risk. We investigated the influence of SES and LA on brain atrophy and cognitive decline considering amyloid-beta (Aβ) positron emission tomography and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) load.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We investigated 221 older adults (mean age, 67.1 ± 8.2 years) who underwent cognitive testing annually over a median follow-up period of 3.4 years. Longitudinal T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging was available for 181 participants. Measures of SES and LA were collected using questionnaires and combined to SES and LA scores using a latent variable approach. We used linear mixed-effects models to investigate if SES and LA are independently or interactively with Aβ and WMH load associated with decline in domains language, processing speed/attention, executive function, and episodic memory. Mediation models assessed whether these associations were explained by gray matter atrophy.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>SES and LA were associated with better cognitive performance at baseline, but were not associated with cognitive decline over time. In interaction with brain pathologies, higher LA reduced the detrimental effects of Aβ and WMH load on language decline, whereas higher SES reduced the detrimental effects of Aβ pathology on episodic memory decline. Individuals with low SES showed faster Aβ-related gray matter atrophy, which mediated the association between Aβ and episodic memory decline but not language decline.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results suggest that multiple resilience mechanisms underlie the protective effects of SES and LA on cognitive decline. Interventions targeting SES-related risk factors may be most effective when implemented early, before neurodegenerative changes begin. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1222–1236</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The understanding of neurofilament light chain (NfL) presence and release in oligodendrocytes is limited. This study aims to determine the NfL expression in oligodendrocytes, investigate whether excess ɑ-synuclein (α-syn) impacts NfL expression, release, and functions in oligodendrocytes, as well as detect plasma NfL-positive oligodendrocyte-derived extracellular vesicles (ODEVs) changes in patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA), Parkinson's disease (PD), and healthy controls (HCs).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>NfL expression in oligodendrocytes was assessed using RNAscope and immunofluorescence staining in human and mouse brain slices, as well as flow cytometry in mouse brain single-cells. The MO3.13 oligodendrocyte cell line was used to mimic MSA pathology with α-syn overexpression or preformed fibril treatment. NfL levels were detected in cell line, brain tissues and condition media, and the differences between MSA pathology and controls were compared. Plasma NfL-positive ODEVs were quantified using nano-scale flow cytometry in a cohort of 101 MSA patients, 96 PD patients, and 97 HCs.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Both <i>NEFL</i> mRNA and NfL protein showed co-localization with typical oligodendrocyte marker anti-2,3-cyclic nucleotide-3-phosphodiesterase (CNPase). A total of 58.5% of CNPase-positive oligodendrocytes co-expressed NfL. Increased α-syn load elevates NfL expression in both oligodendrocyte cell line and MSA patient brain slices. NfL overexpression inhibited oligodendrocyte maturation, but did not affect α-syn-induced cell viability deficits. α-Syn promoted oligodendrocytic NfL release via extracellular vesicles. Plasma NfL-positive ODEVs were elevated in MSA patients compared to PD and HCs.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings suggest additional cellular roles for NfL in oligodendrocytes beyond its established function in neurons and have potential implications for the neurodegenerative pathophysiology of MSA. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1364–1379</p>

<p>This study demonstrates that intranasal Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cell (WJ-MSC) administration at 3 or 10 days post-insult reduced the lesion size and sensorimotor impairment following neonatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury in mice. WJ-MSCs expressed receptors for HI-upregulated chemokines and migrated from the nasal cavity into the meninges and brain parenchyma. WJ-MSCs inhibited neuroinflammation and boosted neuroregeneration via their secretome. Intranasal WJ-MSC therapy remains effective in conjunction with hypothermia, underscoring its translational potential as noninvasive adjunct to current clinical care. Created with <a target="_blank"

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (HIBI) caused by perinatal asphyxia is a primary cause of long-term neurological morbidity. Hypothermia is the sole available clinical intervention despite its limited efficacy. Intranasal mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) show promise for the treatment of HIBI. This study explores the efficacy, migration, treatment window, and therapeutic mechanisms of intranasally applied Wharton's jelly-derived MSCs (WJ-MSCs) in a neonatal HIBI mouse model, and assesses its therapeutic benefit in conjunction with hypothermia.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Nine-day-old C57BL/6 mice underwent hypoxia-ischemia (HI), with or without hypothermia, and were intranasally dosed with 0.1 to 2.0 × 10<sup>6</sup> WJ-MSCs, at 3 or 10 days post-HI. WJ-MSCs were traced using different techniques. Neurogenesis was examined 2 days post-treatment. Neuroinflammation, sensorimqotor outcome, and neuronal tissue loss was assessed 28 days post-HI. Additionally, anti-inflammatory and neuroregenerative properties of WJ-MSCs were investigated in non-contact co-cultures with microglia and neural stem cells, and by secretome profiling.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Intranasally delivered WJ-MSCs reduced HI-induced lesion size and sensorimotor impairments. WJ-MSCs expressed multiple receptors for upregulated chemokines in the HI-lesion, and migrated from the nasal cavity into the meninges and brain parenchyma. WJ-MSCs secreted a broad spectrum of immunomodulatory and neuroregenerative proteins, and inhibited neuroinflammation and boosted neuroregeneration <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. WJ-MSC potency was sustained across different donors. Importantly, intranasal WJ-MSCs augmented the therapeutic benefits of hypothermia following neonatal HIBI in mice.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study provides new translational evidence that intranasal WJ-MSCs, either alone or in combination with hypothermia, mitigate the consequences of neonatal HIBI by resolving inflammation and boosting neurorepair through their secretome. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1380–1394</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.78002?af=R">Cross‐Sectional FDG in Down Syndrome and Autosomal Dominant Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Directly compare the brain glucose patterns seen with [F-18] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) between 2 genetically determined forms of Alzheimer's disease: Down syndrome (DS) and autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Cross-sectional analyses of FDG were performed in individuals with DS (n = 76) from the Alzheimer Biomarker Consortium-Down Syndrome (ABC-DS), ADAD (n = 297), and neurotypical familial controls (n = 188) from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN). Within-group linear regression models and generalized additive models were performed for select regional FDG uptake measures (isthmus cingulate and inferior parietal, precuneus, middle temporal gyrus, and precentral gyrus). Age, sex, apolipoprotein (APOE) ε4 carrier status, and cortical amyloid burden were included within these analyses.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Even 20 years before expected onset of clinical symptoms, FDG uptake was lower for DS compared to neurotypical familial controls (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). ADAD baseline FDG was similar to neurotypical familial controls until 7 years before expected symptom onset. Both symptomatic individuals with DS and ADAD had lower FDG compared to neurotypical familial controls (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). A higher amyloid burden was associated with lower FDG for both genetic forms, with similar rates of decline in FDG uptake for DS and ADAD who were amyloid positive.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Brain glucose metabolism is substantially lower for people with DS, even in individuals who are cognitively stable. The patterns of FDG decline are distinct in these 2 genetically determined forms of AD. The diagnostic utility of FDG-PET is specific to the genetic form of AD.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.78003?af=R">Predictive Value of Plasma Biomarkers in Tau‐PET Transitions</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to determine the predictive value of amyloid-positron emission tomography (PET) versus the plasma ratio of phosphorylated tau at threonine 217 (p-tau217) to non-phosphorylated tau217 (%p-tau217) for tau-PET transitions (T− to T+). The added value of combining plasma amyloid-β 42 and amyloid-β 40 (Aβ42/40) and %p-tau217 into an amyloid probability score (APS2) was also assessed.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA) participants had plasma markers measured at via mass spectrometry (MS), an amyloid-PET scan, and a tau-PET (meta-temporal region of interest [ROI]) negative scan (standardized uptake value ratio [SUVR] &lt;1.29) at the index (baseline) date, along with one or more follow-up tau-PET scans. The BioFINDER-2 cohort was used for validation. Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, and apolipoprotein (<i>APOE</i>) ε4 were used to assess predictors, with scaling to the interquartile range (IQR) for comparability of hazard ratios (HR).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 255 tau-PET negative MCSA participants (median age: 71.9 years), 37 converted to tau-PET positive (median follow-up time: 3.81 years). Higher %p-tau217 (HR: 1.52 [95% CI: 1.28–1.80]), amyloid-PET centiloid (HR: 1.47 [95% CI: 1.20–1.79]), and APS2 (HR: 1.62 [95% CI: 1.22–2.16]) predicted tau-PET conversion. However, Aβ42/40 (HR: 0.94 [95% CI: 0.54–1.66]) was not associated with tau-PET conversion. In the BioFINDER-2 cohort (605 tau-negative, median age: 70.2), 33 converted to tau-positive (median follow-up time: 2 years), with higher %p-tau217 (HR: 1.80 [95% CI: 1.50–2.17]), amyloid-PET centiloid (HR: 2.29 [95% CI: 1.77–2.97]), and lower Aβ42/40 (HR: 2.38 [95% CI: 1.17–4.83]) predicting conversion.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In two cohorts, %p-tau217 was associated with tau-PET conversion, comparable to amyloid-PET. APS2 also predicted conversion in the MCSA cohort, whereas Aβ42/40 predicted conversion in the BioFINDER-2 cohort, which had more individuals with cognitive impairment.

<p>Graphical abstract illustrating the study design, experimental workflow, and key findings from single-cell profiling of peripheral mononuclear cells in multiple sclerosis patients undergoing anti-CD20 therapy, revealing disease- and treatment-associated immune signatures.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed to investigate disease-related and anti-CD20 therapy-related changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from multiple sclerosis (MS) patients compared to healthy controls (HC) using multi-omics single-cell analysis.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Targeted single-cell sequencing of transcriptomes and epitopes was performed on PBMCs isolated from 64 blood samples collected from MS patients at baseline and at 3 time points following anti-CD20 treatment, alongside HC. Multicolor spectral flow cytometry was performed on 15 of the samples.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Cell cluster analysis identified a subpopulation of classical monocytes with significantly high interleukin-1 beta (<i>IL1B</i>) expression and a pro-inflammatory profile compared to other monocyte clusters. This monocyte cluster expressed genes of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines, such as <i>CXCL8</i>, <i>CCL3</i>, <i>CCL4</i>, and <i>TNFα</i> and was a major cell transmitter subset within the intercellular communication network. The IL1B<sup>high</sup> monocyte cluster was prevalent in HC (8.1% of PBMCs), but reduced in untreated MS patients (0.8% of PBMCs). High <i>CXCR4</i> expression and Gene Ontology-term analysis indicated that IL1B<sup>high</sup> monocytes from MS patients had central nervous system (CNS)-infiltrating abilities in contrast to HC, likely regulated by <i>LEF1</i>. After anti-CD20 treatment, IL1B<sup>high</sup> monocytes showed changes in pro-inflammatory gene expression and <i>MYC</i>-associated regulatory networks, and their abundance increased 6-fold in the blood.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our single-cell analysis identified a unique peripheral IL1B<sup>high</sup> monocyte cluster with a suggested CNS-infiltrating cellular phenotype that may explain its lower abundance in the blood of untreated compared to anti-CD20 treated MS patients. Treatment-associated changes in this population may contribute to the non-B cell related effects of anti-CD20 therapy. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1283–1298</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Charcot–Marie–Tooth (CMT) disease is a heterogeneous group of genetic neuropathies, with &gt;90 genes identified. Several aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases have been linked to CMT. <i>DARS2</i>, encoding the mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase, has been typically associated with leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation. This study aimed to investigate the association between biallelic <i>DARS2</i> variants and axonal CMT.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We investigated 5 individuals from 3 unrelated families with axonal CMT and biallelic <i>DARS2</i> variants. Functional studies in fibroblasts assessed their effects on DARS2 expression, localization, and mitochondrial function. Enzymatic activity was evaluated in HEK293 cells.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The 5 individuals, including 4 adults, presented with childhood-onset progressive axonal CMT. None had leukoencephalopathy, but one showed central nervous system involvement, with intellectual disability and epilepsy. Genetic analysis identified compound heterozygous <i>DARS2</i> variants: family A, p.Ser238Phe and p.Arg336Cys; family B, p.Ser238Phe and p.Ile25Thrfs*38; family C, c.492+2T&gt;C and p.Pro503Leu. Functional studies revealed reduced DARS2 protein levels, mitochondrial network abnormalities, and impaired mitochondrial function. p.Ser238Phe behaves as a hypomorphic allele, whereas p.Pro503Leu reduced DARS2 enzymatic activity by 75%.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings expand the <i>DARS2</i>-related disease spectrum, establishing a novel association with axonal CMT. Hypomorphic variants, such as p.Ser238Phe, when paired with more deleterious variants, result in isolated axonal CMT, whereas more severe combinations—although not as deleterious as those seen in leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and lactate elevation—result in axonal CMT with central nervous system involvement, albeit without leukoencephalopathy. These observations raise the possibility that <i>DARS2</i>-associated diseases form a continuum rather than representing strictly distinct central or peripheral nervous system disorders.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>In Parkinson's disease (PD), the power of beta oscillations (± 13–30 hertz [Hz]) from subthalamic nucleus (STN) local field potentials (LFPs) is associated with motor symptoms. Beta power can be used for adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS) algorithms based upon symptom fluctuations. The time course of beta power modulations after levodopa intake at home remains to be described.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Ten-minute averages of beta peak power were recorded in 33 patients with PD treated with STN-DBS for a median duration of 134 days during the titration phase. Median beta power after scheduled medication intakes (n = 24,103) and the effects of peak frequency, stun effect, stimulation amplitude, levodopa dose, and preoperative levodopa response were analyzed using cluster-based permutation testing.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Beta power was significantly reduced between 30 and 140 minutes after intake for stimulation amplitudes between 0 and 2.1 mA (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). This response was seen in low (12.7–20.5 Hz) but not high (21.5–30.3 Hz) beta frequencies. Significant clusters were found regardless of stun effect and preoperative levodopa response, during low stimulation amplitudes (&lt; 1 mA), and for 100 and 150 mg but not 50 mg doses. A linear mixed-effects model for the area under the curve (AUC) levodopa beta response (30–180 min) revealed a dose–response relationship, a stronger negative response in low-beta compared with high-beta frequencies, and no significant effect of stimulation amplitude.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>STN beta power responds to levodopa during low to moderate stimulation amperages, depending on the beta peak frequency and dose, which is informative for aDBS implementation. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1352–1363</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.78031?af=R">Identification of New KCNT1‐Epilepsy Drugs by In Silico, Cell, and Drosophila Modeling</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Hyperactive KCNT1 potassium channels, caused by gain-of-function mutations, are associated with a range of epilepsy disorders. Patients typically experience drug-resistant seizures and, in cases with infantile onset, developmental regression can follow. KCNT1-related disorders include epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures and sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy. There are currently no effective treatments for KCNT1 epilepsies, but suppressing overactive channels poses a potential strategy.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Using the KCNT1 channel structure we in silico screened a library of known drugs for those predicted to block the channel pore to inhibit channel activity. Cellular KCNT1 channel inhibition was analyzed using electrophysiology and <i>Drosophila</i> bang-sensitive assays were used to analyze seizure suppression. Brain penetration of one drug was analyzed using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry in a mouse.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Eight known drugs were investigated in vitro for their effects on patient-specific mutant KCNT1 channels, with 4 drugs showing significant reduction of K<sup>+</sup> current amplitudes. The action of the 4 drugs was then analyzed in vivo and 2 were found to reduce the seizure phenotype in humanized <i>Drosophila</i> KCNT1 epilepsy models. One drug, antrafenine, was shown to cross the blood–brain barrier in mice.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study identified a known drug, antrafenine, that reduces KCNT1 channel activity, reduces seizure activity in <i>Drosophila</i>, and crosses the blood–brain barrier in the mouse, suggesting its potential applicability as a new treatment for KCNT1 epilepsy. The sequential in silico, in vitro, and in vivo mechanism-based drug selection strategy used here may have broader application for other human disorders where a disease mechanism has been identified.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Various modifiable risk factors have been identified for dementia, but it remains unclear whether these associations and importance vary according to genetic predisposition.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 182,473 dementia-free individuals from United Kingdom (UK) Biobank cohort. We calculated the hazard ratios (HRs) and population-attributable fractions (PAF) of 11 modifiable risk factors (smoking status, drinking status, diet, physical activity, hypertension, diabetes, waist-to-hip ratio, education, depression, social contact, and air pollution) for dementia in general population and across various genetic groups based on <i>APOE</i> genotypes and a weighted polygenic-risk score (PRS).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>During 12.42-year follow-up, a total of 2,065 incident all-cause dementia (ACD) cases were documented. Low social contact, diabetes, and abdominal obesity were top 3 modifiable risk factors associated with an increased risk of dementia, especially in low <i>APOE</i> risk (ε2ε2 or ε2ε3) group. The HRs associated with low social contact, diabetes, and abdominal obesity were 3.86 (95% CI: 2.08–7.17), 2.18 (95% CI: 1.43–3.32) and 1.29 (95% CI: 0.88–1.89) for dementia in the low <i>APOE</i> risk. The same patterns were also observed in PRS groups. In terms of PAFs, abdominal obesity contributed the most in low genetic risk groups (PAF: 13.68 to 15.73%). In contrast, less education was the largest contributor in high <i>APOE</i> and high PRS groups (PAF: 11.35% [95% CI: 5.32–17.38%] and 11.24% [95% CI: 4.40–18.07%], respectively), followed by hypertension (PAF: 9.09% [95% CI: 2.01–16.17%] and 5.29% [95% CI: −2.72 to 13.29%], respectively). Overall, the total PAF decreased with increasing genetic risk, particularly for metabolic risk factors.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings highlight the importance of personalized risk assessments and the development of tailored interventions based on genetic background to prevent dementia more effectively. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1210–1221</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The efficacy and safety of intra-arterial thrombolysis (IAT) as an adjunct to endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) in large vessel occlusion strokes (LVOS) remain uncertain, with recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) yielding conflicting results. This meta-analysis aimed to assess the impact of IAT following successful EVT in patients with LVOS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, <a target="_blank"
   title="Link to external resource"
   href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</a>, the Cochrane Library databases, and the International Stroke Conference 2025 abstracts to identify RCTs evaluating IAT following successful EVT from January 2015 to February 2025. The primary outcome was the odds of achieving an excellent functional outcome (defined as a modified Rankin Scale [mRS] = 0–1 at 90 days). Secondary outcomes included 90-day functional independence (mRS = 0–2). Safety measures included symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), and mortality at 90 days. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD420250651602).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The primary pooled analysis of 6 RCTs (<i>N</i> = 1,974) showed that IAT significantly increased the likelihood of achieving excellent functional outcome at 90 days (mRS = 0–1: odds ratio [OR] = 1.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.21–1.80, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), with a notable effect in anterior circulation (OR = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.18–1.87, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) but not in posterior circulation LVOS (OR = 1.51, 95% CI = 0.83–2.74, <i>p</i> = 0.18). Among thrombolytic drugs, alteplase was most strongly associated with favorable outcomes (mRS = 0–1: OR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.31–2.87, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), followed by tenecteplase (OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.08–1.89, <i>p</i> = 0.01). No significant safety concerns were observed, as there was no increase in the odds of sICH (OR = 1.15, 95% CI = 0.75–1.75, <i>p</i> = 0.51) or 90-day mortality (OR = 1.00, 95% CI = 0.79–1.26, <i>p</i> = 0.99). Sensitivity analyses for all outcomes yielded consistent results.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>IAT following successful EVT significantly enhances the likelihood of achieving an excellent functional outcome, particularly in anterior circulation strokes.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Tofersen is the first effective and approved therapy for superoxide dismutase 1 (<i>SOD1</i>)-associated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS [SOD1-ALS]). Following treatment with tofersen, neurofilament levels in patients' cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum seem to respond earlier than clinical parameters. This evidence prompted us to hypothesize that this novel treatment could provide an opportunity to identify additional biomarkers responsive to therapy in SOD1-ALS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We investigated a panel of 120 neural, glial, and inflammatory markers in CSF and serum samples longitudinally collected from a total of 28 SOD1-ALS patients at baseline, and after 3, 6 and 12 months of treatment with tofersen, followed by validation with conventional methodology.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified a set of proteins, including neurofilament light chain, neurofilament heavy chain, amyloid-beta 1–40 and amyloid-beta 1–42, neuropeptide Y (NPY), and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1), whose CSF levels both differed between SOD1-ALS and the control group, and were responsive to tofersen at 3 and 6 months after treatment initiation. Another group of markers, including the neuropentraxin (NPTX) family members NPTX1, NPTX2 and NPTXR, did not separate untreated SOD1-ALS from controls, but was responsive to tofersen. At 12 months on tofersen the levels of neurofilament light chain, neurofilament heavy chain, NPTX1, NPTX2, and NPTXR remained reduced compared with baseline, and correlated with the clinical response to tofersen. Consistent with increasing CSF pleocytosis and intrathecal immunoglobulin production, inflammatory markers were significantly increased after 12 months of treatment.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results highlight a complex, time-dependent differential response of CSF biomarkers to tofersen treatment, and may pave the way for developing a panel of responsive proteins to make biomarker endpoints more robust in clinical trials for SOD1-ALS and beyond.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.78070?af=R">Detecting Awareness in the Intensive Care Unit Using Functional Near‐Infrared Spectroscopy</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Signs of awareness after acute severe brain injury are critical for informing goals-of-care decisions, ranging from the continuation of aggressive life-sustaining therapy to comfort-focused end-of-life measures. However, awareness may go undetected in some critically ill patients when assessed using bedside behavioral neurological examination. Here, we use functional near-infrared spectroscopy to identify covert awareness in acute brain injured patients who are unable to follow behavioral commands.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a prospective, consecutive cross-sectional study of 32 critically ill patients in a single intensive care unit (ICU). All had acute brain injuries from various causes and lacked behavioral command-following on bedside examination, as determined by using the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised. Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy, an optical bedside neuroimaging technique, we assessed brain activity while patients were instructed to perform a mental imagery task in which a positive response was dependent upon preserved awareness. We referred to this phenomenon as covert awareness.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 32 acutely brain injured patients (mean age = 63, ± 12 years, 15 females), 8 (25%) were able to willfully modulate their brain activity when instructed to imagine playing a game of tennis—providing evidence of covert awareness despite no observable behavioral signs that this was the case. We found no association between covert awareness and 3-month functional outcomes using the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Functional near-infrared spectroscopy detected preserved consciousness in 25% of patients who lacked behavioral command following in an intensive care setting. This finding highlights the need for further research to assess the use of advanced neuroimaging techniques in the clinical assessment of critically ill patients. Such methods could ensure that goals of care decisions are based on a more accurate understanding of a patient's level of awareness. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:1201–1209</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-384/v3?src=rss">Integrated water quality assessment and health risk analysis of heavy metal and microbial contamination in the Ichu River, Peru [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background The Ichu River serves as the primary water source for urban consumption, agricultural irrigation, and several local industrial operations in the Huancavelica region; however, increasing anthropogenic pressures including untreated municipal wastewater, mining effluents, agricultural runoff, and expanding urbanization have significantly deteriorated its water quality. These combined stressors highlight the need for an integrated assessment to understand the extent of contamination and associated human health risks. Methods The investigation measured water quality and health-related risks by analyzing physicochemical parameters, heavy metals, and microbial pollutants at eight sampling points, site 1 (S1) through (S8). Results The research data showed that water quality worsened progressively from upstream to downstream locations such as turbidity, TDS, conductivity, and BOD levels increased. Oil pollution and oxygen depletion arose from a reduction in dissolved oxygen from 6.3 to 4.5 mg/L at the different sampling sites (S1 to S8). Heavy metals (As, Pb, Cd, and Cr) in the samples exceeded the standards established by the World Health Organization (WHO) established standards because of mining and industrial wastewater and local wastewater discharge. The presence of excessive Escherichia coli (E. coli) and total coliforms in microbial tests proved that the water was severely contaminated by fecal matter. Principal Component Analysis showed that heavy metals exist with microbial pollution and organic load as the main sources of water quality decline, and pollution indicators were found to establish powerful relationships with depleted oxygen levels. Conclusion The severe contamination risks found in this study justify immediate pollution control measures, wastewater treatment enforcement, and sustainable watershed management practices. Urgent action is necessary because vital parameters surpass the standards set by the WHO and (United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) to avoid enduring environmental damage and health problems. This research demonstrates the value of continuing water quality assessments while enforcing policies and raising public awareness to improve the water quality of the Ichu River.

                Background Sea cucumbers can be explored as alternative raw materials by the pharmaceutical and fishery industries as anticancer agents because they contain potential bioactive compounds. Methods This study aimed to determine the anticancer activity of Paracaudina australis extract against breast cancer cells (T47D) using an MTT assay. The secondary metabolites found in P.australis are steroids, terpenoids, saponins, and phenolics. The Thin-Layer Chromatography test results are indicated by Rf values, and steroid compounds in the ethyl acetate fraction are included in the standard Rf values. The isolates obtained were identified by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry, Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, High-performance liquid chromatography, and UV-Visual spectrophotometry. Results The isolated compounds were Dihydrocholesterol and Cholestan-3-ol, with a molecular formula (C27H48O). The ion weight and molecular mass of the compound were m/z 388,7. Conclusions These compounds may be responsible for the anticancer activity of P.australis. The IC50 of Isolate F4 was 25,3 μg/ml, and IC50 of Isolate F7,8 was 13,76 μg/ml.
