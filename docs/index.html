                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The distribution patterns of a set of conserved brain developmental regulatory transcription factors were analyzed in the forebrain of the basal actinopterygian fish <i>Acipenser ruthenus</i>, consistent with the prosomeric model. In the telencephalon, the pallium was characterized by ventricular expression of Pax6. In the subpallium, the combined expression of Nkx2.1/Islet-1 (Isl1) allowed to propose ventral and dorsal areas, as the septo-pallidal (Nkx2.1/Isl1+) and striatal derivatives (Isl1+) respectively, and a dorsal portion of the striatal derivatives, ventricularly rich in Pax6 and devoid of Isl1 expression. Dispersed Orthopedia (Otp) cells were found in the supracommissural and posterior nuclei of the ventral telencephalon, related to the medial portion of the amygdaloid complex. The preoptic area was identified by the Nkx2.1/Isl1 expression. In the alar hypothalamus, an Otp-expressing territory, lacking Nkx2.1/Isl1, was identified as the paraventricular domain. The adjacent subparaventricular domain was subdivided in a rostral territory expressing Nkx2.1 and an Isl1+ caudal one. In the basal hypothalamus, the tuberal region was defined by the Nkx2.1/Isl1 expression and a rostral Otp-expressing domain was identified. Moreover, the Otp/Nkx2.1 combination showed an additional zone lacking Isl1, tentatively identified as the mamillary area. In the diencephalon, both Pax6 and Isl1 defined the prethalamic domain, and within the basal prosomere 3 scattered Pax6- and Isl1-expressing cells were observed in the posterior tubercle. Finally, a small group of Pax6 cells was observed in the pretectal area. These results improve the understanding of the forebrain evolution and demonstrate that its basic bauplan is present very early in the vertebrate lineage.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Savings have been described as the ability of healthy humans to relearn a previously acquired motor skill faster than the first time, which in the context of motor adaptation suggests that the learning rate in the brain could be adjusted when a perturbation is recognized. Alternatively, it has been argued that apparent savings were the consequence of a distinct process that instead of reflecting a change in the learning rate, revealed an explicit re-aiming strategy. Based on recent evidence that feedback adaptation may be central to both planning and control, we hypothesized that this component could genuinely accelerate relearning in human adaptation to force fields (FFs) during reaching. Consistent with our hypothesis, we observed that on re-exposure to a previously learned FF, the very first movement performed by healthy volunteers in the relearning context was better adapted to the external disturbance, and this occurred without any anticipation or cognitive strategy because the relearning session was started unexpectedly. We conclude that feedback adaptation is a medium by which the nervous system can genuinely accelerate learning across movements.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Striatal activity is necessary to initiate and execute sequences of actions. The main excitatory input to the striatum comes from the cortex. While it is hypothesized that motor and premotor cortico-striatal projections are important to guide striatal activity during the execution of sequences of actions, technical limitations have made this challenging to address. Here, we implemented a task in mice that allows for the study of different moments to execute a serial order sequence consisting of two subsequences of actions. Using this task, we performed electrophysiological recordings in the premotor (M2) and primary motor (M1) cortices, and state-dependent optogenetic inhibitions of their cortico-striatal projections. We show that while both M2 and M1 contain activity modulations related to the execution of self-paced sequences, mainly, the premotor cortico-striatal projections contribute to the proper execution/structuring of these sequences.</p>

                Pseudomonas aeruginosa¬†(P. aeruginosa) is an aerobic Gram-negative¬†bacterium that is implicated in the development of severe systemic infections among pediatric patients.¬† It is identified in hospitalized chronically ill pediatric patients in association with genitourinary, respiratory tract, and skin or soft tissue infections as well as severe and life-threating infection including sepsis.¬† A variety of immunologic mechanisms play a vital role in the host defense mechanisms against invasive infections with P. aeruginosa. Rarely, specific inborn errors of immune function are implicated in deficiencies that predispose to invasive infections with P. aeruginosa.¬† Innate immune function including germ-line encoded pattern recognition receptors such as toll-like receptors (TLRs) and their downstream signaling is vital in the host defense against P. aeruginosa through the generation of antimicrobial peptides, cytokines/chemokines, and shaping of adaptive immune responses. Herein, we describe a previously healthy two-year-old female with an invasive skin, soft tissue, and central nervous system infection secondary to P. aeruginosa.¬† The invasive nature of this infection prompted a careful evaluation for an inborn error of immunity. Decreased cytokine response to agonists of TLRs was documented. Targeted sequencing of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)-4 documented a homozygous deletion of exons 8-13 consistent with IRAK-4 deficiency.¬† This report provides a vital educative message in the existing scientific literature by underscoring the importance of considering inborn errors of immunity in all patients with severe P. aeruginosa infections.¬† Functional assessments of immune function often in combination with sequencing can accurately assign a diagnosis in a timely fashion allowing for definitive treatment and the use of necessary supportive care.

                Genotyping of single cells using single nucleotide polymorphism arrays is a cost-effective technology that provides good coverage and precision, but requires whole genome amplification (WGA) due to the low amount of genetic material. Since WGA introduces noise, we recently developed SureTypeSC, an algorithm to minimize genotyping errors. Here, we present SureTypeSCR, an R package that integrates a state-of-the-art algorithm (SureTypeSC) for noise reduction in single cell genotyping and unites all common parts of genotyping workflow in a single tool. SureTypeSCR is built on top of the tidyverse ecosystem, which facilitates common operations over the data and allows users to create and experiment with the genotyping pipeline. Furthermore, the workflow of SureTypeSCR can also be used for standard genotyping of bulk DNA for batch processing in a single pipeline.¬†SureTypeSCR is avaliable from: https://github.com/Meiomap/SureTypeSCR

                Background: Surgical resection remains the primary curative treatment for intra-cavity cancer. Low physical fitness and psychological factors such as depression are predictive of post‚Äìoperative morbidity, mortality and length of hospital stay. Prolonged post-operative morbidity is associated with persistently elevated risk of premature death. We aim to investigate whether a structured, responsive exercise training programme, a psychological support programme or combined exercise and psychological support, delivered between treatment decision and major intra-cavity surgery for cancer, can reduce length of hospital stay, compared with standard care. Methods: WesFit is a pragmatic, 2x2 factorial-design, multi-centre, randomised-controlled trial, with planned recruitment of N=1560. Participants will be randomised to one of four groups. Group 1 (control) will receive usual pre-operative care, Group 2 (exercise) patients will undergo 2/3 aerobic, high-intensity interval training sessions per week supervised by personal trainers. Group 3 (psychological support) patients are offered 1 session per week at a local cancer support centre. Group 4 will receive both exercise and psychological support. All patients undergo baseline and pre-operative cardiopulmonary exercise testing, complete self-report questionnaires and will be followed up at 30 days, 12 weeks and 12 months post-operatively. Primary outcome is post-operative length-of-stay. Secondary outcomes include disability-adjusted survival at 1-year postoperatively, post-operative morbidity, and health-related quality of life. Exploratory investigations include objectively measured changes in physical fitness assessed by cardiopulmonary exercise test, disease-free and overall mortality at 1-year postoperatively, longer-term physical activity behaviour change, pre-operative radiological tumour regression, pathological tumour regression, pre and post-operative body composition analysis, health economics analysis and nutritional characterisation and its relationship to post-operative outcome. Conclusions: The WesFit trial will be the first randomised controlled study investigating whether an exercise training programme +/- psychological intervention results in improvements in clinical and patient reported outcomes in patients undergoing major inter-cavity resection of cancer.

                Pneumatosis cystoid intestinalis is a rare disease reported in the literature affecting 0.03% of the population. It has a variety of causes and its manifestation may change widely. It usually presents as a marginal finding resulting from various gastrointestinal pathologies. In the acute complicated form of pneumatosis intestinalis, management is challenging for physicians and surgeons. We present a case of a 60-year-old patient who was admitted to our surgical department with a symptomatology suggestive of small bowel occlusion. Computed tomography demonstrated ileal volvulus associated with parietal signs suffering and pneumoperitoneum. An emergent exploratory laparoscopy followed by conversion was performed demonstrating segmental ileal pneumatosis intestinalis secondary to a small bowel volvulus due to an inflammatory appendix wrapping around the distal ileum. Further, detorsion, retrograde draining, and appendectomy were performed because there were no signs of necrosis and the appendix was pathological. The postoperative course was uneventful. This case is exceedingly rare in the literature, because it was featured by the ileal volvulus due to appendicitis.This case report emphasizes the importance of surgical procedures in the management of symptomatic pneumatosis intestinalis.

                Background: Horses are herd animals that have been domesticated in the last century.¬†In several countries, an overview of risk factors and clinical evaluation in horses with colic has not been well‚Äêdescribed. This study aimed to evaluate risk factors and hematological profiles in horses associated with colic in Gresik, East Java, Indonesia. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed during April - October 2019. A total of 115 horses were diagnosed based on physical examination, clinical symptoms, and rectal examination. A questionnaire was asked to the horse-owners to analyze the risk factors while the clinical examination was performed and blood samples were collected for pre-treatment and 14 days post-treatment. Hematological profile was evaluated from a whole blood sample. Serum cortisol, plasma epinephrine, and norepinephrine concentrations were also evaluated after separating the aliquots.¬† Results: Of the 115 horses, 96 were diagnosed with colic. The horses with colic showed a significant association between cases with gender (p<0.021), breed (p<0.000), wheat bran feeding (p<0.015), concentrate feeding (p<0.003), anthelmintics administration (p<0.000), gastrointestinal parasites (p<0.000), dental diseases (p<0.024), previous exposure to colic (p<0.000), body condition score (p<0.000), and access to water per day (p<0.000). Based on whole blood and serum evaluation, there were ameliorated significantly on the hematological profile (p<0.01), serum cortisol (p<0.05), and plasma epinephrine (p<0.01) at¬†14 days post-treatment. Conclusion: This study has identified factors associated with colic in Delman horses. The study provides crucial information to investigate cases of colic and to contribute the development of healthcare strategies during treatment and clinical evaluation.

                Background In order to facilitate better international and cross-cultural comparisons of health professionals (HPs) attitudes towards Religiosity and/or Spirituality (R/S) using individual participant data meta-analysis we updated the NERSH Data Pool. Methods We performed both a network search, a citation search and systematic literature searches to find new surveys. Results We found six new surveys (N=1,068), and the complete data pool ended up comprising 7,323 observations, including 4,070 females and 3,253 males. Most physicians (83%, N=3,700) believed that R/S had ‚Äúsome‚Äù influence on their patients‚Äô health (CI95%) (81.8%‚Äì84.2%). Similarly, nurses (94%, N=1,020) shared such a belief (92.5%‚Äì95.5%). Across all samples 649 (16%; 14.9%‚Äì17.1%) physicians reported to have undergone formal R/S-training, compared with nurses where this was 264 (23%; 20.6%‚Äì25.4%). Conclusions Preliminary analysis indicates that HPs believe R/S to be important for patient health but lack formal R/S-training. Findings are discussed. We find the data pool suitable as a base for future cross-cultural comparisons using individual participant data meta-analysis.

The¬†microcontroller¬†was¬†¬†set¬†up¬†to¬†calculate¬†the¬†participant‚Äôs¬†distance¬†and¬†presence¬†in¬†the¬†cubicle.¬†¬†¬† Results:¬†¬†Toilet¬†positioning¬†varied¬†greatly¬†depending¬†on¬†whether¬†one¬†is¬†sitting¬†or¬†squatting.¬†For sitting toilet,¬†the¬†red¬†cover¬†was¬†close¬†to¬†the¬†accurate¬†distance¬†at¬†a 172Àö¬†angle.¬†IR¬†detected¬†a¬†man¬†but¬†not a¬†woman's¬†body. The¬†blue¬†cover¬†provided¬†the¬†same¬†best¬†angle¬†of¬†172Àö¬†with a higher¬†sensor¬†distance.¬†When¬†the¬†red¬†and¬†blue¬†cover¬†combination¬†was¬†applied,¬†the¬†reading¬†of¬†141cm¬†detected¬†both¬†men¬†and¬†women,¬†at¬†172Àö¬† angle. The¬†actual¬†distance¬†for¬†squatting¬†toilets¬†¬†was¬†158cm. The optimal¬†angle¬†for¬†both¬†red¬†and¬†blue¬†covers¬†was¬†176Àö, however¬†the¬†sensor¬†distance¬†was¬†greater¬†for the blue cover.¬†Finally, the red and blue cover combination gave¬†a¬†more accurate distance of up to 163cm from the actual reading,¬†when detecting both genders at a normal angle of 76Àö.¬† Conclusion:¬†The¬†combination of red and blue cover¬†gave the most¬†accurate detection¬†for¬†the¬†squatting and sitting toilets.¬†The best angle for sitting¬†was¬†172Àö,¬†and for squatting¬†was¬†176Àö.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Encoding Retina Image to Words using Ensemble of Vision Transformers for Diabetic Retinopathy Grading [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Diabetes is one of the top ten causes of death among adults worldwide. People with diabetes are prone to suffer from eye disease such as diabetic retinopathy (DR). DR damages the blood vessels in the retina and can result in vision loss. DR grading is an essential step to take to help in the early diagnosis and in the effective treatment thereof, and also to slow down its progression to vision impairment. Existing automatic solutions are mostly based on traditional image processing and machine learning techniques. Hence, there is a big gap when it comes to more generic detection and grading of DR. Various deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been previously utilized for this purpose. To enhance DR grading, this paper proposes a novel solution based on an ensemble of state-of-the-art deep learning models called vision transformers. A challenging public DR dataset proposed in a 2015 Kaggle challenge was used for training and evaluation of the proposed method. This dataset includes highly imbalanced data with five levels of severity: No DR, Mild, Moderate, Severe, and Proliferative DR. The experiments conducted showed that the proposed solution outperforms existing methods in terms of precision (47%), recall (45%), F1 score (42%), and Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) (60.2%). Finally, it was able to run with low inference time (1.12 seconds). For this reason, the proposed solution can help examiners grade DR more accurately than manual means.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">DARPP‚Äê32 distinguishes a subset of adult‚Äêborn neurons in zebra finch HVC</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Adult male zebra finches (<i>Taeniopygia guttata</i>) continually incorporate adult-born neurons into HVC, a telencephalic brain region necessary for the production of learned song. These neurons express activity-dependent immediate early genes (e.g. <i>zenk</i> and <i>c-fos</i>) following song production, suggesting that these neurons are active during song production. Half of these adult-born HVC neurons (HVC NNs) can be backfilled from the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA) and are a part of the vocal motor pathway underlying learned song production, but the other half do not backfill from RA, and they remain to be characterized. Here we used cell birth-dating, retrograde tract tracing, and immunofluorescence to demonstrate that half of all HVC NNs express the phosphoprotein DARPP-32, a protein associated with dopamine (DA) receptor expression. We also demonstrate that DARPP-32+ HVC NNs are contacted by tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive fibers suggesting that they receive catecholaminergic input, have transiently larger nuclei than DARPP-32-neg HVC NNs, and do not backfill from RA. Taken together, these findings help characterize a group of HVC NNs that have no apparent projections to RA and so far have eluded positive identification other than HVC NN status.</p>

                Background : This research aimed to examine and analyze risk factors for death, hematologic parameters and coagulation in COVID-19 patients at RSUD Dr. Soetomo Surabaya, one of the referral centers for probable COVID-19 patient cases in East Java. Method : This was a retrospective analytical study by taking secondary data on patients with probable COVID-19 cases who were treated in hospital isolation rooms from May to September, 2020. Result : Of 538 probable COVID-19 patients, 217¬† tested positive, with an average age of 52.11¬±13.12 years, and there were 38 death cases. Hematologic parameters, such as white blood cell, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, were significantly different in the deceased group. On the other hand, coagulation parameters, consisting of D-dimer, CRP, PT, and aPTT showed significantly similar value in the deceased group. Univatiate analysis concluded that chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, WBC, NLR, and PPT counts could predict the mortality, while multivariate analysis revealed that coronary heart disease was the only significant independent predictor of mortality. Conclusion : This research shows that hematologic and coagulation parameters were increased in the majority of COVID-19 patients and the deceased group. While the number of neutrophils and WBC increases, the number of lymphocytes decreases significantly with increasing disease severity. Coronary heart disease is an independent predictor of mortality.

                Background: The aim of this study is to evaluate the knowledge, perceptions, and attitude of the public in Pakistan (using social media) towards COVID-19. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted amongst 1120 individuals nationwide. A self-developed, pre-tested questionnaire was used that comprised of sections covering demographic characteristics, medical history, hygiene awareness, COVID-19-related knowledge, and learning attitude. Descriptive statistics were used for frequencies, percentages, averages and standard deviations. Inferential statistics were done using the Student‚Äôs t-test and ANOVA. Results:¬†The average age of participants was 31 years (range 18-60 years). In total 56 individuals (5%) had completed primary or secondary school education; 448 (40%) were employed (working from home) and 60% were jobless due to the COVID-19 crisis. Almost all the study subjects (1030 (92%)) were washing their hands multiple times a day. A total of 83% had awareness regarding quarantine time, 82% used face masks whenever they left their homes, 98% were aware of the origin of the disease, and 70% had knowledge regarding the most common symptoms of COVID-19. Conclusion: It can be concluded from the current study that female participants had higher level of education, and more awareness regarding the coronavirus. The majority of the participants followed proper hand washing regimes and washed their faces. Further knowledge and awareness should be promoted.

                Background: Bone marrow involvement is an important aspect of determining staging of disease and treatment for childhood neuroblastoma. Current standard of care relies on microscopic examination of bone marrow trephine biopsies and aspirates respectively, to define involvement. Flow cytometric analysis of disaggregated tumour cells, when using a panel of neuroblastoma specific markers, allows for potentially less subjective determination of the presence of tumour cells. Methods: A retrospective review of sequential bone marrow trephine biopsies and aspirates, performed at Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, between the years 2015 and 2018, was performed to assess whether the addition of flow cytometric analysis to these standard of care methods provided concordant or additional information. Results: There was good concurrence between all three methods for negative results 216/302 (72%). Positive results had a concordance of 52/86 (61%), comparing samples positive by flow cytometry and positive by either or both cytology and histology. ¬†Of the remaining samples, 20/86 (23%) were positive by either or both cytology and histology, but negative by flow cytometry. Whereas 14/86 (16%) of samples were positive only by flow cytometry. Conclusions: Our review highlights the ongoing importance of expert cytological and histological assessment of bone marrow results. Flow cytometry is an objective, quantitative method to assess the level of bone marrow disease in aspirates. ¬†In this study, flow cytometry identified low-level residual disease that was not detected by cytology or histology. The clinical significance of this low-level disease warrants further investigation.

                Background: Dermatoglyphics is considered, in the scientific milieu, to be an epigenetic marker. The objective of this study was to analyze the presence of dermatoglyphic marks characteristic of neuromotor capacity and abdominal resistance in children and adolescents. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study. The sample consisted of 1,002 individuals, female children and adolescents between the ages of 10 and 16, from public and private schools in the city of Joa√ßaba, Santa Catarina, Brazil. The protocol selected for analyzing the fingerprints was dermatoglyphics, proposed by Cummins and Midlo using a Dermatoglyphic Reader. The Brazilian Sports Project Manual - PROESP 2015 was used to collect data on muscle strength motor tests. Results: The results showed the presence of a dermatoglyphic mark characteristic of abdominal motor capacity and muscle strength in females. A higher frequency of arches was identified in MET4 and whorls in MET5 and MDT4 in the Risk Zone group. In the Healthy Zone group, ulnar loop was found to be more frequent in MET4, MET5, and MDT4 fingers. Conclusions: The results demonstrated a predictive marker for abdominal motor capacity and strength in females through dermatoglyphics.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Cre driver mouse lines for thalamocortical circuit mapping</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Subpopulations of neurons and associated neural circuits can be targeted in mice with genetic tools in a highly selective manner for visualization and manipulation. However, there are not well-defined Cre ‚Äòdriver‚Äô lines that target expression of Cre recombinase to thalamocortical neurons. Here were characterize three Cre driver lines for the nuclei of the dorsal thalamus: <i>Oligodendrocyte transcription factor 3</i> (<i>Olig3)-Cre</i>, <i>histidine decarboxylase (HDC)-Cre</i>, and <i>corticotropin-releasing hormone</i> (<i>CRH)-Cre.</i> We examined the postnatal distribution of Cre expression for each of these lines with the Cre-dependent reporter <i>CAG-tdTomato</i> (<i>Ai9)</i>. Cre-dependent expression of tdTomato reveals that <i>Olig3-Cre</i> expresses broadly within thalamus, including thalamocortical neurons and interneurons, while <i>HDC-Cre</i> and <i>CRH-Cre</i> each have unique patterns of expression restricted to thalamocortical neurons within and across the sensory relay nuclei of the dorsal thalamus. Cre expression is present by the time of natural birth in all three lines, underscoring their utility for developmental studies. To demonstrate the utility of these Cre drivers for studying sensory thalamocortical circuitry, we targeted expression of channelrhodopsin-2 to thalamus from the <i>CAG-COP4*H134R/EYFP (Ai32)</i> allele with either <i>HDC-Cre</i> or <i>CRH-Cre.</i> Optogenetic activation of thalamocortical afferents in primary visual cortex was sufficient to measure frequency-dependent depression. Thus, these Cre drivers provide selective Cre-dependent gene expression in thalamus suitable for both anatomical and functional studies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Comparative neuroanatomical distribution and expression levels of neuropeptide F in the central nervous system of the female freshwater prawn, Macrobrachium rosenbergii, during the ovarian cycle</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neuropeptide F (NPF) plays critical roles in controlling feeding and reproduction of prawns. In the present study, we investigated changes in the expression levels of <i>Macrobrachium rosenbergii</i> neuropeptide F (MrNPF), and its neuroanatomical distribution in eyestalk (ES), brain (BR), subesophageal ganglion (SEG), thoracic ganglia (TG), and abdominal ganglia (AG), during the ovarian cycle of female prawn. By qRT-PCR, the amount of <i>MrNPF</i> transcripts exhibited a gradual increase in the ES, BR, and combined SEG and TG from stages I and II, to reach maximum level at stage III, and slightly declined at stage IV, respectively. The highest to lowest expression levels were detected in combined SEG and TG, BR, ES, and AG, respectively. MrNPF immunolabelling was observed in several neuronal clusters, associated fibers and neuropils of these CNS tissues. MrNPF-ir was more intense in neurons and neuropils of SEG and TG than those found in other parts of the CNS. The number of MrNPF-ir neurons, and intensity of MrNPF-ir were higher in the ES, BR, SEG, and TG at the late stages than those at the early stages of the ovarian cycle, while those in AG exhibited insignificant change. Taken together, there is a correlation between changes in neuroanatomical distribution of MrNPF and stages of the ovarian cycle, implying that MrNPF may be an important neuropeptide that integrates sensory stimuli, including photo-, chemo-, and gustatory receptions, to control feeding and reproduction, particularly ovarian development, of this female prawn, <i>M. rosenbergii</i>.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Cancer as a homeostatic challenge: the role of the hypothalamus</a></h4>

              
                The initiation, progression, and metastatic spread of cancer elicits diverse changes in systemic physiology. In this way, cancer represents a novel homeostatic challenge to the host system. Here, we discuss how the hypothalamus, a critical brain region involved in homeostasis senses, integrates and responds to cancer-induced changes in physiology. Through this lens, cancer-associated changes in behavior (e.g., sleep disruption) and physiology (e.g., glucocorticoid dysregulation) can be viewed as the result of an inability to re-establish homeostasis.

                Alexander et¬†al. use multiplexed single-cell secretion analysis to disentangle TLR4-induced autocrine feedback loops. They show that IL-10 raises the threshold of inflammatory activation in macrophages while also negatively regulating highly activated cells. The restraining role of IL-10 is mediated by IFN-Œ≤ signaling, while TNF-induced IL-10 likely mediates response resolution.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Enhancer recruitment of transcription repressors RUNX1 and TLE3 by mis-expressed FOXC1 blocks differentiation in acute myeloid leukemia</a></h4>

              
                Simeoni et¬†al. demonstrate that the Forkhead factor FOXC1 recruits a repressor complex of RUNX1, HDAC1, and Groucho family member TLE3 to a discrete set of enhancers distributed close to genes controlling monocyte/macrophage differentiation, thereby contributing to the differentiation block, which is the pathognomonic feature of acute myeloid leukemia.

                Activation of the serine synthesis pathway is important for cancer cell growth, but how this pathway is regulated is not well understood. Li et¬†al. report that ATF3 is an important regulator of this pathway and can promote serine biosynthesis and tumor growth under serine-limiting conditions.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Brown adipocyte ATF4 activation improves thermoregulation and systemic metabolism</a></h4>

              
                Paulo et¬†al. demonstrate that ATF4 activation in brown adipocytes genetically can improve thermoregulation regardless of Ucp1‚Äôs action. Low-protein-diet feeding can also activate ATF4 in brown adipocytes and improve thermoregulation in wild-type and Ucp1 knockout mice. These data suggest the presence of an Ucp1-independent thermogenic process that can be modulated by dietary interventions.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">A20 deficiency in myeloid cells protects mice from diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance due to increased fatty acid metabolism</a></h4>

              
                Catrysse et¬†al. show that absence of A20 in myeloid cells leads to protection against diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. They speculate that this is caused by increased oxygen consumption and increased fatty acid metabolism of A20-deficient macrophages. These findings reveal a role for A20 in regulating macrophage immunometabolism.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Gut microbiota-mediated secondary bile acids regulate dendritic cells to attenuate autoimmune uveitis through TGR5 signaling</a></h4>

              
                Hu et¬†al. reveal that gut microbiota-related dysmetabolism of bile acids is involved in the development of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU). Secondary bile acids are reduced in the feces and serum of EAU mice. Secondary bile acids regulate function of dendritic cells via the TGR5-cAMP-PKA pathway in EAU mice.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Inappropriate use of antibiotics exacerbates inflammation through OMV-induced pyroptosis in MDR Klebsiella pneumoniae infection</a></h4>

              
                Ye et¬†al. show that inappropriate use of antibiotics in the case of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Klebsiella pneumoniae (K.¬†pneumoniae) infection might cause severe inflammatory damage. Carbapenems enhance the secretion of OMVs with upregulated membrane presentation of GroEL, which promotes macrophages to take up OMVs, develop pyroptosis, and release proinflammatory cytokines.

                It is poorly understood why subtype C HIV-1 strains are most prevalent worldwide. Bosso et¬†al. show that a characteristic additional NF-Œ∫B binding site in the long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter allows clade C HIV-1 strains to evade restriction by interferon-inducible nuclear PYHIN proteins.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Organotypic endothelial adhesion molecules are key for Trypanosoma brucei tropism and virulence</a></h4>

              
                Trypanosoma brucei are parasites that cause severe disease in mammals. De Niz et¬†al. investigate how T.¬†brucei interacts with blood vessels to preferentially traverse into certain organs, where they establish vast reservoirs. Selective removal of organ-specific vascular receptors ultimately alters parasite virulence and host survival.

                Pisano et¬†al. use transsynaptic tracing and whole-brain light-sheet microscopy to quantitatively map cerebellar paths to and from the forebrain, including relatively dense projections to the prefrontal neocortex. Divergence of paths from single injection sites suggests that a single cerebellar region can influence multiple thalamic and neocortical targets at once.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Evolution of pathogen tolerance and emerging infections: A missing experimental paradigm</a></h4>

              
                Researchers worldwide are repeatedly warning us against future zoonotic diseases resulting from humankind‚Äôs insurgence into natural ecosystems. The same zoonotic pathogens that cause severe infections in a human host frequently fail to produce any disease outcome in their natural hosts. What precise features of the immune system enable natural reservoirs to carry these pathogens so efficiently? To understand these effects, we highlight the importance of tracing the evolutionary basis of pathogen tolerance in reservoir hosts, while drawing implications from their diverse physiological and life-history traits, and ecological contexts of host-pathogen interactions. Long-term co-evolution might allow reservoir hosts to modulate immunity and evolve tolerance to zoonotic pathogens, increasing their circulation and infectious period. Such processes can also create a genetically diverse pathogen pool by allowing more mutations and genetic exchanges between circulating strains, thereby harboring rare alive-on-arrival variants with extended infectivity to new hosts (i.e., spillover). Finally, we end by underscoring the indispensability of a large multidisciplinary empirical framework to explore the proposed link between evolved tolerance, pathogen prevalence, and spillover in the wild.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Metformin alleviates stress-induced cellular senescence of aging human adipose stromal cells and the ensuing adipocyte dysfunction</a></h4>

              
                Aging is associated with central fat redistribution and insulin resistance. To identify age-related adipose features, we evaluated the senescence and adipogenic potential of adipose-derived-stromal cells (ASCs) from abdominal subcutaneous fat obtained from healthy normal-weight young (&lt;25y) or older women (&gt;60y). Increased cell passages of young-donor ASCs (<i>in vitro</i> aging), resulted in senescence but not oxidative stress. ASC-derived adipocytes presented impaired adipogenesis but no early mitochondrial dysfunction. Conversely, aged-donor ASCs at early passages displayed oxidative stress and mild senescence. ASC-derived adipocytes exhibited oxidative stress, and early mitochondrial dysfunction but adipogenesis was preserved. <i>In vitro</i> aging of aged-donor ASCs resulted in further increased senescence, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress and severe adipocyte dysfunction. When <i>in vitro</i> aged young-donor ASCs were treated with metformin, no alteration was alleviated. Conversely, metformin treatment of aged-donor ASCs decreased oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction resulting in decreased senescence. Metformin's prevention of oxidative stress and of the resulting senescence improved the cells' adipogenic capacity and insulin sensitivity. This effect was mediated by the activation of AMP-activated-protein-kinase as revealed by its specific inhibition and activation. Overall, aging ASC-derived adipocytes presented impaired adipogenesis and insulin sensitivity. Targeting stress-induced senescence of ASCs with metformin may improve age-related adipose tissue dysfunction.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Variation in human herpesvirus 6B telomeric integration, excision and transmission between tissues and individuals</a></h4>

              
                Human herpesviruses 6A and 6B (HHV-6A/6B) are ubiquitous pathogens that persist lifelong in latent form and can cause severe conditions upon reactivation. They are spread by community-acquired infection of free virus (acqHHV6A/6B) and by germline transmission of inherited chromosomally-integrated HHV-6A/6B (iciHHV-6A/6B) in telomeres. We exploited a hypervariable region of the HHV-6B genome to investigate the relationship between acquired and inherited virus and revealed predominantly maternal transmission of acqHHV-6B in families. Remarkably, we demonstrate that some copies of acqHHV-6B in saliva from healthy adults gained a telomere, indicative of integration and latency, and that the frequency of viral genome excision from telomeres in iciHHV-6B carriers is surprisingly high and varies between tissues. In addition, newly formed short telomeres generated by partial viral genome release are frequently lengthened, particularly in telomerase-expressing pluripotent cells. Consequently, iciHHV-6B carriers are mosaic for different iciHHV-6B structures, including circular extra-chromosomal forms that have the potential to reactivate. Finally, we show transmission of an HHV-6B strain from an iciHHV-6B mother to her non-iciHHV-6B son. Altogether we demonstrate that iciHHV-6B can readily transition between telomere-integrated and free virus forms.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A prion accelerates proliferation at the expense of lifespan</a></h4>

              
                In fluctuating environments, switching between different growth strategies, such as those affecting cell size and proliferation, can be advantageous to an organism. Trade-offs arise, however. Mechanisms that aberrantly increase cell size or proliferation‚Äîsuch as mutations or chemicals that interfere with growth regulatory pathways‚Äîcan also shorten lifespan. Here we report a natural example of how the interplay between growth and lifespan can be epigenetically controlled. We find that a highly conserved RNA-modifying enzyme, the pseudouridine synthase Pus4/TruB, can act as a prion, endowing yeast with greater proliferation rates at the cost of a shortened lifespan. Cells harboring the prion grow larger and exhibit altered protein synthesis. This epigenetic state, [<i>BIG</i><sup>+</sup>] (<i>b</i>etter <i>i</i>n <span class="underline"><i>g</i></span>rowth), allows cells to heritably yet reversibly alter their translational program, leading to the differential synthesis of dozens of proteins, including many that regulate proliferation and aging. Our data reveal a new role for prion-based control of an RNA-modifying enzyme in driving heritable epigenetic states that transform cell growth and survival.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The cell adhesion molecule Sdk1 shapes assembly of a retinal circuit that detects localized edges</a></h4>

              
                Nearly 50 different mouse retinal ganglion cell (RGC) types sample the visual scene for distinct features. RGC feature selectivity arises from their synapses with a specific subset of amacrine (AC) and bipolar cell (BC) types, but how RGC dendrites arborize and collect input from these specific subsets remains poorly understood. Here we examine the hypothesis that RGCs employ molecular recognition systems to meet this challenge. By combining calcium imaging and type-specific histological stains we define a family of circuits that express the recognition molecule Sidekick 1 (Sdk1) which include a novel RGC type (S1-RGC) that responds to local edges. Genetic and physiological studies revealed that Sdk1 loss selectively disrupts S1-RGC visual responses which result from a loss of excitatory and inhibitory inputs and selective dendritic deficits on this neuron. We conclude that Sdk1 shapes dendrite growth and wiring to help S1-RGCs become feature selective.

                Gene knockout of the master regulator of mitochondrial fission, Drp1, prevents neoplastic transformation. Also, mitochondrial fission and its opposing process of mitochondrial fusion are emerging as crucial regulators of stemness. Intriguingly, stem/progenitor cells maintaining repressed mitochondrial fission are primed for self-renewal and proliferation. Using our newly derived carcinogen transformed human cell model we demonstrate that fine-tuned Drp1 repression primes a slow cycling 'stem/progenitor-like state', which is characterized by small networks of fused mitochondria and a gene-expression profile with elevated functional stem/progenitor markers (Krt15, Sox2 etc) and their regulators (Cyclin E). Fine tuning Drp1 protein by reducing its activating phosphorylation sustains the neoplastic stem cell markers. Whereas, fine-tuned reduction of Drp1 protein maintains the characteristic mitochondrial shape and gene-expression of the primed 'stem/progenitor-like state' to accelerate neoplastic transformation, and more complete reduction of Drp1 protein prevents it. Therefore, our data highlights a 'goldilocks'; level of Drp1 repression supporting stem/progenitor state dependent neoplastic transformation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Activity-dependent Golgi satellite formation in dendrites reshapes the neuronal surface glycoproteome</a></h4>

              
                Activity-driven changes in the neuronal surface glycoproteome are known to occur with synapse formation, plasticity and related diseases, but their mechanistic basis and significance are unclear. Here, we observed that <i>N</i>-glycans on surface glycoproteins of dendrites shift from immature to mature forms containing sialic acid in response to increased neuronal activation. In exploring the basis of these <i>N</i>-glycosylation alterations, we discovered they result from the growth and proliferation of Golgi satellites scattered throughout the dendrite. Golgi satellites that formed during neuronal excitation were in close association with ER exit sites and early endosomes and contained glycosylation machinery without the Golgi structural protein, GM130. They functioned as distal glycosylation stations in dendrites, terminally modifying sugars either on newly synthesized glycoproteins passing through the secretory pathway, or on surface glycoproteins taken up from the endocytic pathway. These activities led to major changes in the dendritic surface of excited neurons, impacting binding and uptake of lectins, as well as causing functional changes in neurotransmitter receptors such as nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Neural activity thus boosts the activity of the dendrite‚Äôs satellite micro-secretory system by redistributing Golgi enzymes involved in glycan modifications into peripheral Golgi satellites. This remodeling of the neuronal surface has potential significance for synaptic plasticity, addiction and disease.

                Preadipocytes are crucial for healthy adipose tissue expansion. Preadipocyte differentiation is altered in obese individuals, which has been proposed to contribute to obesity-associated metabolic disturbances. Here, we aimed at identifying the pathogenic processes underlying impaired adipocyte differentiation in obese individuals with insulin resistance (IR)/type 2 diabetes (T2D). We report that down-regulation of a key member of the major spliceosome, <i>PRFP8</i>/PRP8, as observed in IR/T2D preadipocytes from subcutaneous (SC) fat, prevented adipogenesis by altering both the expression and splicing patterns of adipogenic transcription factors and lipid droplet-related proteins, while adipocyte differentiation was restored upon recovery of <i>PRFP8</i>/PRP8 normal levels. Adipocyte differentiation was also compromised under conditions of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated protein degradation (ERAD) hyperactivation, as occurs in SC and omental (OM) preadipocytes in IR/T2D obesity. Thus, targeting mRNA splicing and ER proteostasis in preadipocytes could improve adipose tissue function and thus contribute to metabolic health in obese individuals.

                The vertebrate eye-primordium consists of a pseudostratified neuroepithelium, the optic vesicle (OV), in which cells acquire neural retina or retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) fates. As these fates arise, the OV assumes a cup-shape, influenced by mechanical forces generated within the neural retina. Whether the RPE passively adapts to retinal changes or actively contributes to OV morphogenesis remains unexplored. We generated a zebrafish Tg(E1-<i>bhlhe40</i>:GFP) line to track RPE morphogenesis and interrogate its participation in OV folding. We show that, in virtual absence of proliferation, RPE cells stretch and flatten, thereby matching the retinal curvature and promoting OV folding. Localized interference with the RPE cytoskeleton disrupts tissue stretching and OV folding. Thus, extreme RPE flattening and accelerated differentiation are efficient solutions adopted by fast-developing species to enable timely optic cup formation. This mechanism differs in amniotes, in which proliferation drives RPE expansion with a much-reduced need of cell flattening.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Considering unique, shared, and dominant brain activation in the Visual Word Form Area and Lateral Occipital Cortex: A comparison of separate and combined word reading and picture naming</a></h4>

              
                Identifying printed words and pictures concurrently is ubiquitous in daily tasks, and so it is important to consider the extent to which reading words and naming pictures may share a cognitive-neurophysiological functional architecture. Two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments examined whether reading along the left ventral occipitotemporal region (vOT; often referred to as a visual word form area, VWFA) has activation that is overlapping with referent pictures (i.e., both conditions significant and shared, or with one significantly more dominant) or unique (i.e., one condition significant, the other not), and whether picture naming along the right lateral occipital complex (LOC) has overlapping or unique activation relative to referent words. Experiment 1 used familiar regular and exception words (to force lexical reading) and their corresponding pictures in separate naming blocks, and showed dominant activation for pictures in the LOC, and shared activation in the VWFA for exception words and their corresponding pictures (regular words did not elicit significant VWFA activation). Experiment 2 controlled for visual complexity by superimposing the words and pictures and instructing participants to either name the word or the picture, and showed primarily shared activation in the VWFA and LOC regions for both word reading and picture naming, with some dominant activation for pictures in the LOC. Overall, these results highlight the importance of including exception words to force lexical reading when comparing to picture naming, and the significant shared activation in VWFA and LOC serves to challenge specialized models of reading or picture naming.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">HCN2 in cholinergic interneurons of the nucleus accumbens mediates reward response</a></h4>

              
                Cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) are important for mediating the behavioral response to rewarding stimuli. A major role for these cells is to regulate dopamine (DA) transmission by activating cholinergic receptors at local DAergic nerve terminals. However, the mechanisms that enable cholinergic neurons to enhance DA release in response to reward remain unknown. Here we report that the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 2 (HCN2) in NAc ChIs mediates an enhancement in DA signaling in response to rewarding stimuli. The HCN current in NAc ChIs and its modulation by DA, as well as the increase in cholinergic efflux by local cocaine infusion were impaired in mice with deletion of HCN2 in cholinergic cells. Enhancement in the DA efflux and signaling in the NAc in response to rewarding stimuli, as well as cocaine conditioning were also dependent on HCN2 in ChIs. These results provide a mechanistic link between the activity of NAc ChIs and reward encoding.

                We constantly exploit the statistical regularities in our environment to help guide our perception. The hippocampus has been suggested to play a pivotal role in both learning environmental statistics, as well as exploiting them to generate perceptual predictions. However, it is unclear how the hippocampus balances encoding new predictive associations with the retrieval of existing ones. Here, we present the results of two high resolution human fMRI studies (N=24 for both experiments) directly investigating this. Participants were exposed to auditory cues that predicted the identity of an upcoming visual shape (with 75% validity). Using multivoxel decoding analysis, we found that the hippocampus initially preferentially represented unexpected shapes (i.e., those that violated the cue regularities), but later switched to representing the cue-predicted shape regardless of which was actually presented. These findings demonstrate that the hippocampus in involved both acquiring and exploiting predictive associations, and switches between these modes depending on whether learning is ongoing or complete.

                Since its discovery in fireflies, bioluminescence has been used in a wide range of biological assays, from reporter gene assays to in vivo imaging. Bioluminescent light is produced from the enzymatic action of luciferase on its substrate luciferin using ATP as a cofactor. Recently, subcellular targeting of luciferase to neural synaptic vesicles has led to the development of the sensor Syn-ATP that allows for quantitative measurement of presynaptic ATP levels. Manual analysis of presynaptic bioluminescence signals from Syn-ATP is challenging due to signal heterogeneity and cellular motion in long imaging sessions. Here, we present a pipeline for semi-automated image analysis of Syn-ATP signals in the nerve terminals of hippocampal neurons. Our method streamlines data analysis and reduces user-introduced bias, thus enhancing the reproducibility and reliability of quantitative ATP imaging.

                The experience of early adversity can program persistent alterations in mood-states. It has been suggested that a perturbation of signalling pathways within forebrain neurocircuits, in particular a disruption of the balance between Gq and Gi-signaling in forebrain excitatory neurons during critical developmental epochs may program dysregulation of anxio-depressive behaviors. Prior evidence indicates that increased Gq-signaling mediated activation of forebrain excitatory neurons in postnatal life can enhance adult anxio-depressive behaviors. Here, we have addressed whether Gi-signaling mediated inhibition of forebrain excitatory neurons in the postnatal and juvenile windows of life can influence adult anxio-depressive behaviors. Our findings indicate that chronic chemogenetic inhibition of forebrain excitatory neurons via Gi-mediated signalling during critical developmental time windows does not impact mood-related behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Connectome-Based Smoothing (CBS): Concepts, methods, and evaluation</a></h4>

              
                Structural connectomes are increasingly mapped at high spatial resolutions comprising many hundreds--if not thousands--of network nodes. However, high-resolution connectomes are particularly susceptible to image registration misalignment, tractography artifacts, and noise, all of which can lead to reductions in connectome accuracy and test-retest reliability. We investigate a network analogue of image smoothing to address these key challenges. Connectome-Based Smoothing (CBS) involves jointly applying a carefully chosen smoothing kernel to the two endpoints of each tractography streamline, yielding a spatially smoothed connectivity matrix. We develop computationally efficient methods to perform CBS using a matrix congruence transformation and evaluate a range of different smoothing kernel choices on CBS performance. We find that smoothing substantially improves the identifiability, sensitivity, and test-retest reliability of high-resolution connectivity maps, though at a cost of increasing storage burden. For atlas-based connectomes (i.e. low-resolution connectivity maps), we show that CBS marginally improves the statistical power to detect associations between connectivity and cognitive performance, particularly for connectomes mapped using probabilistic tractography. CBS was also found to enable more reliable statistical inference compared to connectomes without any smoothing. We provide recommendations on optimal smoothing kernel parameters for connectomes mapped using both deterministic and probabilistic tractography. We conclude that spatial smoothing is particularly important for the reliability of high-resolution connectomes, but can also provide benefits at lower parcellation resolutions. We hope that our work enables computationally efficient integration of spatial smoothing into established structural connectome mapping pipelines.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Methodological considerations in analyzing synchronization of resting-state brain networks with the intrinsic electrical rhythm of the stomach: Advantages of weighted phase-locking</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: To evaluate the amplitude-weighted phase-locking value (awPLV) as a measure of synchronization of brain resting-state networks (RSNs) with the gastric basal electrical rhythm (BER). Methods: A recent study combined rsfMRI with concurrent cutaneous electrogastrography (EGG), in a highly-sampled individual who underwent 22 scanning sessions (two 15-minute runs per session) at 3.0 Tesla. After excluding three sessions due to weak EGG signals, 9.5 hours of data remained, from which 18 RSNs were estimated using spatial independent component analysis. Previously, using the phase-locking value (PLV), three of the 18 RSNs were determined to be synchronized with the BER. However, RSN power fluctuations in the gastric frequency band could reduce sensitivity of PLV. Accordingly, the current reanalysis used awPLV to unweight contributions from low power epochs. Mismatched EGG and rsfMRI data (from different days) served as surrogate data; for each RSN, empirical awPLV was compared with chance-level awPLV using a Wilcoxon rank test. P-values were adjusted using with a false discovery rate of 0.05. Additionally, simulations were performed to compare PLV and awPLV error rates under settings with a known ground truth. Results: Simulations show high false-negative rates when using PLV, but not awPLV. Reanalysis of the highly-sampled individual data using awPLV indicates that 11 of the 18 RSNs were synchronized with the BER. Conclusion: Simulations indicate that awPLV is a more sensitive measure of stomach/brain synchronization than PLV. Reanalysis results imply communication between the enteric nervous system and brain circuits not typically considered responsive to gastric state or function.

                N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) play a pivotal role in both short and long-term plasticity. While the functional role of postsynaptic NMDARs is well established, a framework of presynaptic NMDAR (preNMDAR) function is missing. Differences in subunit composition of preNMDARs are documented at central synapses, raising the possibility that subtype composition plays a role in transmission performance. Here, we use electrophysiological recordings at Schaffer collateral - CA1 synapses and Ca2+ imaging coupled to focal glutamate uncaging at boutons of CA3 pyramidal neurones to reveal two populations of presynaptic NMDARs that contain either the GluN2A or GluN2B subunit. Activation of the GluN2B population decreases action potential (AP)-evoked Ca2+ influx via modulation of small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (SK-channels) while activation of the GluN2A containing population does the opposite. Moreover, the level of functional expression of each receptor population can be homeostatically modified, bidirectionally affecting short-term facilitation during burst firing, thus providing a capacity for a fine adjustment of the presynaptic integration time window and therefore the bandwidth of information transfer.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinct ground state and activated state modes of spiking in forebrain neurons</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal firing patterns have significant spatiotemporal variety with no agreed upon theoretical framework. Using a combined experimental and modeling approach, we found that spike interval statistics can be described by discrete modes of activity. A "ground state" (GS) mode of low-rate spiking is universal among forebrain excitatory neurons and characterized by irregular spiking at a cell-specific rate. In contrast, "activated state" (AS) modes consist of spiking at characteristic timescales and regularity and are specific to neurons in a given region and brain state. We find that the majority of spiking is contributed by GS mode, while neurons can transiently switch to AS spiking in response to stimuli or in coordination with population activity patterns. We hypothesize that GS spiking serves to maintain a persistent backbone of neuronal activity while AS modes support communication functions.

                Exposure to infection in utero predisposes towards psychiatric diseases such as autism, depression and schizophrenia in later life. The mechanisms involved are typically studied by administering mimetics of double-stranded (ds) RNA viral or bacterial infection to pregnant rats or mice. The effect of single-stranded (ss) virus mimetics has been largely ignored, despite evidence linking prenatal ss virus exposure specifically with psychiatric disease. Understanding the effects of gestational ss virus exposure has become even more important with the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In this study, in pregnant mice, we compare directly the effects, on the maternal blood, placenta and the embryonic brain, of maternal administration of ds-virus mimetic poly I:C (to activate toll-like receptor 3, TLR3) and ss-virus mimetic resiquimod (to activate TLR7/8). We find that, 4h after the administration, both poly I:C and resiquimod elevated the levels of IL-6, TNFa, and chemokines including CCL2 and CCL5, in maternal plasma. Both agents also increased placental mRNA levels of IL-6 and IL-10, but only resiquimod increased placental TNFa mRNA. In foetal brain, poly I:C produced no detectable immune-response-related increases, whereas pronounced increases in cytokine (e.g. Il-6, Tnfa, and chemokine (e.g. Ccl2, Ccl5) expression were observed with maternal resiquimod administration. The data show substantial differences between the effect of maternal exposure to a TLR7/8 activator as compared to a TLR3 activator. There are significant implications for future modelling of diseases where maternal ss virus exposure contributes to environmental disease risk in offspring.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Performance of temporal and spatial ICA in identifying and removing low-frequency physiological and motion effects in resting-state fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Effective separation of signal from noise (including physiological processes and head motion) is one of the chief challenges for improving the sensitivity and specificity of resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) measurements and has a profound impact when these noise sources vary between populations. Independent component analysis (ICA) is an approach for addressing these challenges. Conventionally, due to the lower amount of temporal than spatial information in rs-fMRI data, spatial ICA (sICA) is the method of choice. However, with recent developments in accelerated fMRI acquisitions, the temporal information is becoming enriched to the point that the temporal ICA (tICA) has become more feasible. This is particularly relevant as physiological processes and motion exhibit very different spatial and temporal characteristics when it comes to rs-fMRI applications, leading us to conduct a comparison of the performance of sICA and tICA in addressing these types of noise. In this study, we embrace the novel practice of using theory (simulations) to guide our interpretation of empirical data. We find empirically that sICA can identify more noise-related signal components than tICA. However, on the merit of functional-connectivity results, we find that while sICA is more adept at reducing whole-brain motion effects, tICA performs better in dealing with physiological effects. These interpretations are corroborated by our simulation results. The overall message of this study is that if ICA denoising is to be used for rs-fMRI, there is merit in considering a hybrid approach in which physiological and motion-related noise are each corrected for using their respective best-suited ICA approach.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Functional network topography of the medial entorhinal cortex</a></h4>

              
                The medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) creates a map of local space, based on the firing patterns of grid, head direction (HD), border, and object-vector (OV) cells. How these cell types are organized anatomically is debated. In-depth analysis of this question requires collection of precise anatomical and activity data across large populations of neurons during unrestrained behavior, which neither electrophysiological nor previous imaging methods fully afford. Here we examined the topographic arrangement of spatially modulated neurons in MEC and adjacent parasubiculum using miniaturized, portable two-photon microscopes, which allow mice to roam freely in open fields. Grid cells exhibited low levels of co-occurrence with OV cells and clustered anatomically, while border, HD and OV cells tended to intermingle. These data suggest that grid-cell networks might be largely distinct from those of border, HD and OV cells and that grid cells exhibit strong coupling among themselves but weaker links to other cell types.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Slow-oscillatory tACS does not modulate human motor cortical response to repeated plasticity paradigms</a></h4>

              
                Previous history of activity and learning modulates synaptic plasticity and can lead to saturation of synaptic connections. According to the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis, neural oscillations during slow-wave sleep play an important role in restoring plasticity within a functional range. However, it is not known whether slow-wave oscillations - without the concomitant requirement of sleep - play a causal role in human synaptic homeostasis. Here, slow-oscillatory transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS, 1Hz, 1mA, 18 minutes) was interleaved between two plasticity-inducing interventions: motor learning, and a paradigm known to induce long-term-potentiation-like plasticity in human motor cortex (paired associative stimulation; PAS). The hypothesis tested was that slow-oscillatory tACS would abolish the expected interference between motor learning and PAS, and facilitate plasticity from successive interventions. Thirty-six participants received sham and active fronto-motor tACS in two separate sessions, along with electroencephalography (EEG) recordings. A further 38 participants received tACS through a control (posterior midline) montage. Using neuro-navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the left motor cortex, motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded throughout the session. Bayesian statistics were used to quantify evidence for or against the hypothesis of an effect of each intervention on MEP amplitude. As expected, there was converging evidence that motor training increased MEPs. Importantly, we found moderate evidence against an effect of active tACS in restoring PAS plasticity, and no evidence of lasting entrainment of slow-oscillations in the EEG. This suggests that, under the conditions tested here, slow-oscillatory tACS does not modulate synaptic homeostasis in the motor system of awake humans.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Identification of potential proteins and microRNAs in Multiple Sclerosis and Huntington's diseases using in silico methods.</a></h4>

              
                Neurogenerative diseases like multiple sclerosis, Huntington's disease are the major roadblocks in the way towards a healthy brain. Neurodegenerative diseases like multiple sclerosis and Huntington's disease are affected by several factors such as environmental, immunological, genetics, and the worse scenario we can think of is that they are on the rise worldwide. Degenerative diseases specifically target a limited group of neurons at first resulting in the loss of specific functions associated with the specific part of the brain. The early diagnosis of these neurodegenerative diseases is important so that treatments can start from the early stages of these diseases. In this study, we have established a link between Multiple sclerosis and Huntington's disease, and also we were able to establish the possible microRNAs that were connected to the expression of genes associated with these two diseases. In this present study, we analyzed the microarray datasets obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus and we identified 266 differentially expressed genes tried to identify using in silico methods the Hub genes involved in Multiple sclerosis and Huntington's disease. After identifying the genes and proteins we tried to identify the microRNAs that are interacting with the Hub genes. In our study, we identified that the protein network has PTPRC, CXCL8, RBM25 proteins that have maximum connectivity. The top Hub genes are then subjected to a database that contains information concerning the microRNAs that are interacting with the Hub proteins as well as with each other. According to our study, the hsa-mir-155-5p has one of the highest degrees in the microRNA network. Our study will be useful in the future for the development of new drug targets for these neurodegenerative diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Amyloid Œ≤ oligomer selective antibodies for Alzheimers therapeutics and diagnostics</a></h4>

              
                Improvements have been made in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), manifesting mostly in the development of in vivo imaging methods that allow for the detection of pathological changes in AD by MRI and PET scans. Many of these imaging methods, however, use agents that probe amyloid fibrils and plaques- species that do not correlate well with disease progression and are not present at the earliest stages of the disease. Amyloid {beta} oligomers (A{beta}Os), rather, are now widely accepted as the A{beta} species most germane to AD onset and progression. Here we report evidence further supporting the role of A{beta}Os as pathological instigators of AD and introduce a promising anti-A{beta}O diagnostic probe capable of distinguishing the 5xFAD mouse model from wild type mice by PET and MRI. In a developmental study, A{beta} oligomers in 5xFAD mice were found to appear at 3 months of age, just prior to the onset of memory dysfunction, and spread as memory worsened. The increase is prominent in the subiculum and correlates with concomitant development of reactive astrocytosis. The impact of these A{beta}Os on memory is in harmony with findings that intraventricular injection of synthetic A{beta}Os into wild type mice induced hippocampal dependent memory dysfunction within 24 hours. Compelling support for the conclusion that endogenous A{beta}Os cause memory loss was found in experiments showing that intranasal inoculation of A{beta}O-selective antibodies into 5xFAD mice completely restored memory function, measured 30 days post-inoculation. These antibodies, which were modified to give MRI and PET imaging probes, were able to distinguish 5xFAD mice from wild type littermates. These results provide strong support for the role of A{beta}Os in instigating memory loss and salient AD neuropathology, and they demonstrate that A{beta}O selective antibodies have potential both for therapeutics and for diagnostics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Efference information flow during skill acquisition mediates its interaction with medical simulation technology</a></h4>

              
                Despite substantial progress towards establishing virtual reality (VR) simulators as a replacement for physical ones for skill training, its effect on the brain network during skill acquisition has not been well addressed. In this study, we employed portable optical neuroimaging technology and Granger causality approach to uncover the impact of the two medical simulation technologies on the directed functional brain network of the subjects with two different skill levels. The mobile brain-behavior relantionship was evaluated using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) while right-handed subjects performed well-established fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery (FLS) pattern cutting task. A multiple regression path analysis found that the cognitive-action information flow from the right prefrontal cortex to the supplementary motor area statistically significantly predicted the FLS task performance. Here, the skill level (expert vs novice) affected the cognitive-action information flow from the right prefrontal cortex and the efference copy information flow from the left primary motor cortex via supplementary motor area as hub to the cognitiveperception at the left prefrontal cortex, i.e., the action-preception link. The simulation technology (physical vs VR simulator) affected solely the cognitive-action information flow from the right prefrontal cortex to the left primary motor cortex; however, the interaction between the medical simulation technology) and the skill level affected the efference information flow from the left primary motor cortex to the right prefrontal cortex and from the supplementary motor area to the left prefrontal cortex. These discriminative findings are crucial since our VR simulator had face and construct validity. Therefore, our study highlighted the importance of efference information flow within the framework of the perception-action cycle when comparing medical simulation technology for visuomotor skill acquisition.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Large-scale two-photon calcium imaging in freely moving mice</a></h4>

              
                We developed a miniaturized two-photon microscope (MINI2P) for fast, high-resolution, multiplane calcium imaging of over 1,000 neurons at a time in freely moving mice. With a microscope weight below 3g and a highly flexible connection cable, MINI2P allowed imaging to proceed with no impediment of behavior in half-hour free-foraging trials compared to untethered, unimplanted animals. The improved cell yield was achieved through a new optical system design featuring an enlarged field of view (FOV) and a new micro-tunable lens with increased z-scanning range and speed that allowed for fast and stable imaging of multiple, interleaved planes as well as 3D functional imaging. A novel technique for successive imaging across multiple, adjacent FOVs enabled recordings from more than 10,000 neurons in the same animal. Large-scale proof-of-principle data were obtained from cell populations in visual cortex, medial entorhinal cortex, and hippocampus, revealing spatial tuning of cells in all areas, including visual cortex.

	<p>The International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD3) defines Short-lasting Unilateral Neuralgiform Headache Attacks (SUNHA) as attacks of moderate or severe, strictly unilateral head pain lasting from seconds to minutes, occurring at least once a day and usually associated with prominent lacrimation and redness of the ipsilateral eye. Two subtypes of SUNHA are identified: Short-lasting Unilateral Neuralgiform headache attacks with Conjunctival injection and Tearing (SUNCT) and Short-lasting Unilateral Neuralgiform headache attacks with cranial Autonomic symptoms (SUNA). These pathologies are infrequent in children and difficult to diagnose. The authors reviewed the existing literature on SUNCT and SUNA, especially in the developmental age, which describes the pathophysiology in detail and focuses on the therapeutic options available to date. SUNHA-type headaches must be considered on the one hand, for the possibility of the onset of forms secondary to underlying pathologies even of a neoplastic nature, and on the other hand, for the negative impact they can have on an individual‚Äôs quality of life, particularly in young patients. Until now, published cases suggest that no chronic variants occur in childhood and adolescents. In light of this evidence, the authors offer a review that may serve as a source to be drawn upon in the implementation of suitable treatments in children and adolescents suffering from these headaches, focusing on therapies that are non-invasive and as risk-free as possible for pediatric patients.</p>

	<p>Objective: The aim of this scoping review was to identify if the phase of the menstrual cycle was considered in observational studies comparing pressure pain sensitivity between women with migraine or tension-type headache (TTH) and headache-free women. Methods: A systematic electronic literature search in PubMed, Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, and CINAHL databases was conducted. Observational studies including one or more groups with TTH and/or migraine comparing pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) were included. The methodological quality (risk of bias) was assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Authors, objectives, inclusion/exclusion criteria, size sample, female sample, tool to assess PPTs, mean age, and the use of any medication were extracted and analyzed independently by two authors. Results: From a total of 1404 and 1832 identified articles for TTH and migraine, 30 and 18 studies satisfied the criteria and were included. Nineteen (63.4%) studies assessing TTH patients and eleven (61.1%) assessing migraine patients showed a high risk of bias. The most common flaws were attributed to improper selection of control and control over other additional factors. Based on the systematic review, just one study including TTH and one including migraine patients considered the menstrual cycle. Conclusion: The results of this scoping review identified that the phase of the menstrual cycle has been rarely considered in studies investigating sensitivity to pressure pain in primary headaches, such as TTH or migraine, although there is evidence showing the relevance of the phase of the menstrual cycle in pain perception.</p>

	<p>Binge alcohol consumption and alcohol use disorders (AUD) are prevalent, and there is comorbidity with depression and anxiety. Potential underlying mechanisms include neurophysiological, genetic, and metabolic changes resulting from alcohol exposure. Mood and anxiety disorders are more common among women, but whether females are more susceptible to binge-induced oxidative stress and co-occurring anxiety and depression-like behaviors remains unknown. Here, we used a repeated, weekly binge alcohol paradigm in male and female rats to investigate sex differences in despair and anxiety-like behaviors and brain oxidative stress parameters. A single binge alcohol exposure significantly elevated glutathione (GSH) levels in prefrontal cortex (PFC) of both male and female animals. This was accompanied by increased lipid peroxidation in PFC of both sexes. Repeated (once weekly) binge exposure induced changes in anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in both males and females and increased GSH level in the PFC without detectable oxidative damage. Our findings suggest that repeated binge alcohol exposure influences affect regardless of sex and in the absence of membrane damage.</p>

	<p>Body integrity dysphoria (BID), a long-lasting desire for the amputation of physically healthy limbs, is associated with reduced fMRI resting-state functional connectivity of somatosensory cortices. Here, we used fMRI to evaluate whether these findings could be replicated and expanded using a task-based paradigm. We measured brain activations during somatosensory stimulation and motor tasks for each of the four limbs in ten individuals with a life-long desire for the amputation of the left leg and fourteen controls. For the left leg, BID individuals had reduced brain activation in the right superior parietal lobule for somatosensory stimulation and in the right paracentral lobule for the motor task, areas where we previously found reduced resting-state functional connectivity. In addition, for somatosensory stimulation only, we found a robust reduction in activation of somatosensory areas SII bilaterally, mostly regardless of the stimulated body part. Areas SII were regions of convergent activations for signals from all four limbs in controls to a significantly greater extent than in subjects with BID. We conclude that BID is associated with altered integration of somatosensory and, to a lesser extent, motor signals, involving limb-specific cortical maps and brain regions where the first integration of body-related signals is achieved through convergence.</p>

	<p>Recording ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) is a highly sensitive tool to study the dam‚Äìpup social relationships, and USV recordings have been used to study the effects of ethanol on pups. Gestational effects of ethanol on the emission of USVs in rat pups have been studied in our previous research. In the present study, the effects of ethanol given to dams during lactation on the acoustic parameters of USVs emitted by isolated pups were examined. Ethanol was administered to dams from postnatal days (PNDs) 5‚Äì21. From PNDs 11‚Äì21, the high- and low-ethanol-treated dams were exposed to ethanol-containing water (v/v) at concentrations of 30% and 15%, respectively. Tap water without ethanol (0%) was provided to the control dams. The pups in all three ethanol-treated groups were separated from the dam and littermates on PNDs 4, 8, 12, and 16, and USVs produced by the pups were recorded for 5 min. It was found that elevated distress USVs with longer duration and higher percentage of frequency modulations were displayed by the pups from the high-ethanol dams. Alterations in USVs were particularly evident in the pups with a reduced body weight at PND 12. This effect might be because high-ethanol dams showed significantly lower intake of higher ethanol-containing water, and consequently, produced lower amount of milk, as well as exhibited poor maternal care. Insufficient maternal care and malnutrition resulted in pup growth retardation and increased mortality rate in the high-ethanol group, which were not observed in the low-ethanol or control pups. Accordingly, the pups in the high-ethanol group experienced elevated negative emotionality during isolation from their dam and increased emission of USVs. Longer duration and increased frequency modulation of pup USVs are expected to be noticed by the dam and to initiate/increase proper maternal care. It is concluded that ethanol given to lactating mothers has more serious consequences on pup development than the gestational ethanol exposure, and has more harmful effects on pups.</p>

	<p>There is increasing interest in the development and deployment of digital solutions to improve patient care and facilitate monitoring in medical practice, e.g., by remote observation of disease symptoms in the patients‚Äô home environment. Digital health solutions today range from non-regulated wellness applications and research-grade exploratory instruments to regulated software as a medical device (SaMD). This paper discusses the considerations and complexities in developing innovative, effective, and validated SaMD for multiple sclerosis (MS). The development of SaMD requires a formalised approach (design control), inclusive of technical verification and analytical validation to ensure reliability. SaMD must be clinically evaluated, characterised for benefit and risk, and must conform to regulatory requirements associated with device classification. Cybersecurity and data privacy are also critical. Careful consideration of patient and provider needs throughout the design and testing process help developers overcome challenges of adoption in medical practice. Here, we explore the development pathway for SaMD in MS, leveraging experiences from the development of Floodlight‚Ñ¢ MS, a continually evolving bundled solution of SaMD for remote functional assessment of MS. The development process will be charted while reflecting on common challenges in the digital space, with a view to providing insights for future developers.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel gene <I>SCN1A</I> are associated with human epilepsy disorders, but how most of these mutations alter channel properties and result in seizures is unknown. This study focuses on two different mutations occurring at one position within <I>SCN1A</I>. R1648C (R-C) is associated with the severe disorder Dravet syndrome, and R1648H (R-H), with the milder disorder GEFS+. To explore how these different mutations contribute to distinct seizure disorders, <I>Drosophila</I> lines with the R-C or R-H mutation, or R1648R (R-R) control substitution in the fly sodium channel gene <I>para</I> were generated by CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. The R-C and R-H mutations are homozygous lethal. Animals heterozygous for R-C or R-H mutations displayed reduced life spans and spontaneous and temperature-induced seizures not observed in R-R controls. Electrophysiological recordings from adult GABAergic neurons in R-C and R-H mutants revealed the appearance of sustained neuronal depolarizations and altered firing frequency that were exacerbated at elevated temperature. The only significant change observed in underlying sodium currents in both R-C and R-H mutants was a hyperpolarized deactivation threshold at room and elevated temperature compared with R-R controls. Since this change is constitutive, it is likely to interact with heat-induced changes in other cellular properties to result in the heat-induced increase in sustained depolarizations and seizure activity. Further, the similarity of the behavioral and cellular phenotypes in the R-C and R-H fly lines, suggests that disease symptoms of different severity associated with these mutations in humans could be due in large part to differences in genetic background.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Sex Differences in Behavioral and Brainstem Transcriptomic Neuroadaptations following Neonatal Opioid Exposure in Outbred Mice</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The opioid epidemic led to an increase in the number of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) cases in infants born to opioid-dependent mothers. Hallmark features of NOWS include weight loss, severe irritability, respiratory problems, and sleep fragmentation. Mouse models provide an opportunity to identify brain mechanisms that contribute to NOWS. Neonatal outbred Swiss Webster Cartworth Farms White (CFW) mice were administered morphine (15 mg/kg, s.c.) twice daily from postnatal day 1 (P1) to P14, an approximation of the third trimester of human gestation. Female and male mice underwent behavioral testing on P7 and P14 to determine the impact of opioid exposure on anxiety and pain sensitivity. Ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) and daily body weights were also recorded. Brainstems containing pons and medulla were collected during morphine withdrawal on P14 for RNA sequencing. Morphine induced weight loss from P2 to P14, which persisted during adolescence (P21) and adulthood (P50). USVs markedly increased at P7 in females, emerging earlier than males. On P7 and P14, both morphine-exposed female and male mice displayed hyperalgesia on the hot plate and tail-flick assays, with females showing greater hyperalgesia than males. Morphine-exposed mice exhibited increased anxiety-like behavior in the open-field arena on P21. Transcriptome analysis of the brainstem, an area implicated in opioid withdrawal and NOWS, identified pathways enriched for noradrenergic signaling in females and males. We also found sex-specific pathways related to mitochondrial function and neurodevelopment in females and circadian entrainment in males. Sex-specific transcriptomic neuroadaptations implicate unique neurobiological mechanisms underlying NOWS-like behaviors.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Single Dose of Amphetamine Induces Delayed Subregional Attenuation of Cholinergic Interneuron Activity in the Striatum</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Psychostimulants such as amphetamine (AMPH) target dopamine (DA) neuron synapses to engender drug-induced plasticity. While DA neurons modulate the activity of striatal (Str) cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) with regional heterogeneity, how AMPH affects ChI activity has not been elucidated. Here, we applied quantitative fluorescence imaging approaches to map the dose-dependent effects of a single dose of AMPH on ChI activity at 2.5 and 24 h after injection across the mouse Str using the activity-dependent marker phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (p-rpS6<sup>240/244</sup>). AMPH did not affect the distribution or morphology of ChIs in any Str subregion. While AMPH at either dose had no effect on ChI activity after 2.5 h, ChI activity was dose dependently reduced after 24 h specifically in the ventral Str/nucleus accumbens (NAc), a critical site of psychostimulant action. AMPH at either dose did not affect the spontaneous firing of ChIs. Altogether this work demonstrates that a single dose of AMPH has delayed regionally heterogeneous effects on ChI activity, which most likely involves extra-Str synaptic input.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Variability in soil properties influencing pigeonpea (Cajanus cajana L.) yield: a multivariate statistical analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Aims:¬†The aim of the study was to reveal the variability in soil properties influencing pigeonpea (Cajanus cajana L.) seed yield under semi-arid rainfed condition. Methods:¬†Soils were initially classified into series level and further these series were divided into soil-phase units. For two site years viz., 2018-19 and 2019-20, surface soil samples from each soil-phase unit were collected before sowing of pigeonpea and subsequently crop growth parameters at critical stages were recorded. Results:¬†The principal component analysis with varimax rotation resulted in seven components for both the site years, having eigenvalues greater than one, explained more than 80% of the variability. The step wise linear regression analysis showed that the pigeonpea seed yield was linearly correlated with PC3 (p<0.01), PC4 (p<0.01) and PC7 (p<0.05) of soil properties with R2 = 0.679, during 2018-19. Whereas, during 2019-20, the seed yield was linearly correlated with PC1 (p<0.01), PC3 (p<0.01) and PC6 (p<0.05) with R2 = 0.677. In site year 1, the available P2O5, Fe, Zn, S, Cu, number of pods, surface soil moisture determined the yield. In site year 2, the available K2O, P2O5, Fe, Zn, S, clay, CEC and available water content determined the yield. All these variables together explain variability in yield.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Levels of SARS-CoV-2 population exposure are considerably higher than suggested by seroprevalence surveys</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Siyu Chen, Jennifer A. Flegg, Lisa J. White, Ricardo Aguas</p>

Accurate knowledge of prior population exposure has critical ramifications for preparedness plans for future SARS-CoV-2 epidemic waves and vaccine prioritization strategies. Serological studies can be used to estimate levels of past exposure and thus position populations in their epidemic timeline. To circumvent biases introduced by the decay in antibody titers over time, methods for estimating population exposure should account for seroreversion, to reflect that changes in seroprevalence measures over time are the net effect of increases due to recent transmission and decreases due to antibody waning. Here, we present a new method that combines multiple datasets (serology, mortality, and virus positivity ratios) to estimate seroreversion time and infection fatality ratios (IFR) and simultaneously infer population exposure levels. The results indicate that the average time to seroreversion is around six months, IFR is 0.54% to 1.3%, and true exposure may be more than double the current seroprevalence levels reported for several regions of England.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Acetylcholine-gated current translates wake neuronal firing rate information into a spike timing-based code in Non-REM sleep, stabilizing neural network dynamics during memory consolidation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Quinton M. Skilling, Bolaji Eniwaye, Brittany C. Clawson, James Shaver, Nicolette Ognjanovski, Sara J. Aton, Michal Zochowski</p>

Sleep is critical for memory consolidation, although the exact mechanisms mediating this process are unknown. Combining reduced network models and analysis of <i>in vivo</i> recordings, we tested the hypothesis that neuromodulatory changes in acetylcholine (ACh) levels during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep mediate stabilization of network-wide firing patterns, with temporal order of neurons‚Äô firing dependent on their mean firing rate during wake. In both reduced models and <i>in vivo</i> recordings from mouse hippocampus, we find that the relative order of firing among neurons during NREM sleep reflects their relative firing rates during prior wake. Our modeling results show that this remapping of wake-associated, firing frequency-based representations is based on NREM-associated changes in neuronal excitability mediated by ACh-gated potassium current. We also show that learning-dependent reordering of sequential firing during NREM sleep, together with spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), reconfigures neuronal firing rates across the network. This rescaling of firing rates has been reported in multiple brain circuits across periods of sleep. Our model and experimental data both suggest that this effect is amplified in neural circuits following learning. Together our data suggest that sleep may bias neural networks from firing rate-based towards phase-based information encoding to consolidate memories.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Biomedical Data Commons (BMDC) prioritizes B-lymphocyte non-coding genetic variants in Type 1 Diabetes</a></h4>

The repurposing of biomedical data is inhibited by its fragmented and multi-formatted nature that requires redundant investment of time and resources by data scientists. This is particularly true for Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), one of the most intensely studied common childhood diseases. Intense investigation of the contribution of pancreatic Œ≤-islet and T-lymphocytes in T1D has been made. However, genetic contributions from B-lymphocytes, which are known to play a role in a subset of T1D patients, remain relatively understudied. We have addressed this issue through the creation of Biomedical Data Commons (BMDC), a knowledge graph that integrates data from multiple sources into a single queryable format. This increases the speed of analysis by multiple orders of magnitude. We develop a pipeline using B-lymphocyte multi-dimensional epigenome and connectome data and deploy BMDC to assess genetic variants in the context of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). Pipeline-identified variants are primarily common, non-coding, poorly conserved, and are of unknown clinical significance. While variants and their chromatin connectivity are cell-type specific, they are associated with well-studied disease genes in T-lymphocytes. Candidates include established variants in the HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DRB1 and IL2RA loci that have previously been demonstrated to protect against T1D in humans and mice providing validation for this method. Others are included in the well-established T1D GRS2 genetic risk scoring method. More intriguingly, other prioritized variants are completely novel and form the basis for future mechanistic and clinical validation studies The BMDC community-based platform can be expanded and repurposed to increase the accessibility, reproducibility, and productivity of biomedical information for diverse applications including the prioritization of cell type-specific disease alleles from complex phenotypes.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Differences in olfactory bulb mitral cell spiking with ortho- and retronasal stimulation revealed by data-driven models</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Michelle F. Craft, Andrea K. Barreiro, Shree Hari Gautam, Woodrow L. Shew, Cheng Ly</p>

The majority of olfaction studies focus on orthonasal stimulation where odors enter via the front nasal cavity, while retronasal olfaction, where odors enter the rear of the nasal cavity during feeding, is understudied. The coding of retronasal odors via coordinated spiking of neurons in the olfactory bulb (OB) is largely unknown despite evidence that higher level processing is different than orthonasal. To this end, we use multi-electrode array <i>in vivo</i> recordings of rat OB mitral cells (MC) in response to a food odor with both modes of stimulation, and find significant differences in evoked firing rates and spike count covariances (i.e., noise correlations). Differences in spiking activity often have implications for sensory coding, thus we develop a single-compartment biophysical OB model that is able to reproduce key properties of important OB cell types. Prior experiments in olfactory receptor neurons (ORN) showed retro stimulation yields slower and spatially smaller ORN inputs than with ortho, yet whether this is consequential for OB activity remains unknown. Indeed with these specifications for ORN inputs, our OB model captures the salient trends in our OB data. We also analyze how first and second order ORN input statistics dynamically transfer to MC spiking statistics with a phenomenological linear-nonlinear filter model, and find that retro inputs result in larger linear filters than ortho inputs. Finally, our models show that the temporal profile of ORN is crucial for capturing our data and is thus a distinguishing feature between ortho and retro stimulation, even at the OB. Using data-driven modeling, we detail how ORN inputs result in differences in OB dynamics and MC spiking statistics. These differences may ultimately shape how ortho and retro odors are coded.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Regulation of integrin and extracellular matrix genes by HNRNPL is necessary for epidermal renewal</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jingting Li, Yifang Chen, Manisha Tiwari, Varun Bansal, George L. Sen</p>

Stratified epithelia such as the epidermis require coordinated regulation of stem and progenitor cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation to maintain homeostasis. Integrin-mediated anchorage of the basal layer stem cells of the epidermis to the underlying dermis through extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins is crucial for this process. It is currently unknown how the expression of these integrins and ECM genes are regulated. Here, we show that the RNA-binding protein (RBP) heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L (HNRNPL) binds to these genes on chromatin to promote their expression. HNRNPL recruits RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to integrin/ECM genes and is required for stabilizing Pol II transcription through those genes. In the absence of HNRNPL, the basal layer of the epidermis where the stem cells reside prematurely differentiates and detaches from the underlying dermis due to diminished integrin/ECM expression. Our results demonstrate a critical role for RBPs on chromatin to maintain stem and progenitor cell fate by dictating the expression of specific classes of genes.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Autoimmune limbic encephalitis (ALE) is the most common type of autoimmune encephalitis (AIE). Subacute memory disturbance, temporal lobe seizures, and psychiatric symptoms are clinical hallmarks of the disease. However, little is known on the factors contributing to cognitive functioning in ALE. Hence, we here investigate major determinants of cognitive functioning in ALE. In a retrospective analysis of 102 patients with ALE, we first compared verbal learning capacity, nonverbal learning capacity, and attentional and executive functioning by absence or presence of different types of neural autoantibodies (AABs). Subsequently we established three linear regression models including 63, 38, and 61 patients, respectively to investigate how cognitive functioning in these domains may depend on common markers of ALE such as intrathecal inflammation, blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-barrier function, mesiotemporal epileptiform discharges and slowing, determined by electroencephalography (EEG) and structural mesiotemporal changes, measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We also accounted for possible effects of cancer- and immunotherapy and other centrally effective medication. There was no effect of AAB status on cognitive functioning. Although the regression models could not predict verbal and nonverbal learning capacity, structural mesiotemporal neural network alterations on T2-/fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)-signal-weighted MRI and mesiotemporal epileptiform discharges or slowing on EEG exerted a significant impact on memory functions. In contrast, the regression model significantly predicted attentional and executive functioning with CSF white blood cell count and centrally effective medication being significant determinants. In this cohort, cognitive functioning in ALE does not depend on the AAB status. Common markers of ALE cannot predict memory functioning that only partially depends on structural and functional alterations of mesiotemporal neural networks. Common markers of ALE significantly predict attentional and executive functioning that is significantly related to centrally effective medication and CSF white blood cell count, which may point toward inflammation affecting brain regions beyond the limbic system.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Orexin (hypocretin) mediates light‚Äêdependent fluctuation of hippocampal function in a diurnal rodent</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Environmental lighting conditions play a central role in cognitive function, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Utilizing a diurnal rodent model, the Nile grass rat (<i>Arvicanthis niloticus</i>), we previously found that daytime light intensity affects hippocampal function in this species in a manner similar to its effects in humans. Compared to animals housed in a 12:12‚Äâh bright light‚Äìdark (brLD) cycle, grass rats kept in a 12:12‚Äâh dim light‚Äìdark (dimLD) cycle showed impaired spatial memory in the Morris water maze (MWM) and reduced CA1 apical dendritic spine density. The present study explored the neural substrates mediating the effects of daylight intensity on hippocampal function focusing on the hypothalamic orexin (hypocretin) system. First, animals housed in dimLD were treated with daily intranasal administration of orexin A peptide over five training days of the MWM task. Compared to vehicle controls, this treatment led to superior spatial memory accompanied by increased phosphorylation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II Œ± and glutamate receptor 1 within the CA1. To assess the role of hippocampal orexinergic signaling, an adeno-associated viral vector (AAV) expressing an orexin receptor 1 (OX1R) shRNA was injected into the dorsal hippocampus targeting the CA1 of animals housed in brLD. AAV-mediated knockdown of OX1R within the hippocampus resulted in deficits in MWM performance and reduced CA1 apical dendritic spine density. These results are consistent with the view that the hypothalamic orexinergic system underlies the modulatory role of daytime illumination on hippocampal function in diurnal mammals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Temporal dynamic of the hippocampal structural plasticity associated with the fear memory destabilization/reconsolidation process</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Reconsolidation of a contextual fear memory is a protein synthesis-dependent process in which a previously destabilized memory returns to a stable state. This process has become the subject of many studies due to its importance in memory processing, maintenance and updating, and its potential role as a therapeutical target in fear memory disorders such as phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder. In this sense, understanding the underlying mechanisms of memory reconsolidation is paramount in developing potential treatments for such memory dysfunctions. In the present work, we studied the interaction between two key neural structures involved in the reconsolidation process: the basolateral amygdala complex of the amygdala (BLA) and the dorsal hippocampus (DH). Our results show changes in the structural plasticity of the CA1 region of the DH in the form of dendritic spines density changes associated with the destabilization/reconsolidation process. Furthermore, we demonstrate a modulatory role of BLA over such structural plasticity by infusing different drugs such as ifenprodil, a destabilization blocker, and propranolol, a reconsolidation disruptor, in this brain structure. Altogether our work shows a particular temporal dynamic in the CA1 region of DH that accompanies the destabilization/reconsolidation process and aims to provide new information on the underlying mechanisms of this process that potentially contributes for a better understanding of memory storage, maintenance, expression and updating, and its potential medical applications.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Adult‚Äêborn neurons promote cognitive flexibility by improving memory precision and indexing</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Adult neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) is an extraordinary form of plasticity fundamental for cognitive flexibility. Recent evidence showed that newborn neurons differentially modulate input to the infra- and supra-pyramidal blades of the DG during the processing of spatial and contextual information, respectively. However, how this differential regulation by neurogenesis is translated into different aspects contributing cognitive flexibility is unclear. Here, we increased adult-born neurons by a genetic expansion of neural stem cells and studied their influence during navigational learning. We found that increased neurogenesis improved both memory precision and flexibility. Interestingly, each of these gains was associated with distinct subregional patterns of activity and better separation of memory representations in the DG-CA3 network. Our results highlight the role of adult-born neurons in promoting memory precision and indexing and suggests their anatomical allocation within specific DG-CA3 compartments, together contributing to cognitive flexibility.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Disrupting the medial prefrontal cortex with designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drug alters hippocampal sharp‚Äêwave ripples and their associated cognitive processes</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) interact during a myriad of cognitive processes including decision-making and long-term memory consolidation. Exactly how the mPFC and hippocampus interact during goal-directed decision-making remains to be fully elucidated. During periods of rest, bursts of high-frequency oscillations, termed sharp-wave ripple (SWR), appear in the local field potential. Impairing SWRs on the maze or during post-learning rest can interfere with memory-guided decision-making and memory consolidation. We hypothesize that the hippocampus and mPFC bidirectionally interact during SWRs to support memory consolidation and decision-making. Rats were trained on the neuroeconomic spatial decision-making task, Restaurant Row, to make serial stay-skip decisions where the amount of effort (delay to reward) varied upon entry to each restaurant. Hippocampal cells and SWRs were recorded in rats with the mPFC transduced with inhibitory DREADDs. We found that disrupting the mPFC impaired consolidating SWRs in the hippocampus. Hippocampal SWR rates depended on the internalized value of the reward (derived from individual flavor preferences), a parameter important in decision-making, and disrupting the mPFC changed this relationship. Additionally, we found a dissociation between SWRs that occurred while rats were on the maze dependent upon whether those SWRs occurred while the rat was anticipating food reward or during post-reward consumption.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Burst activity plays no role in the field‚Äêto‚Äêfield variability and rate remapping of grid cells</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Grid cells in rodent medial entorhinal cortex are thought to play a key role for spatial navigation. When the animal is freely moving in an open arena the firing fields of each grid cell tend to form a highly regular, hexagonal lattice spanning the environment. However, firing rates vary from field to field and change under contextual modifications, whereas the field locations shift at most by a small amount under such ‚Äúrate remapping.‚Äù The observed differences in firing rate could reflect overall activity changes or changes in the detailed spike-train statistics. As these two alternatives imply distinct neural coding schemes, we investigated whether temporal firing patterns vary from field to field and whether they change under rate remapping. Focusing on short time scales, we found that the proportion of bursts compared to all discharge events is similar in all firing fields of a given grid cell and does not change under rate remapping. For each cell, mean firing rates with bursts are proportional to mean firing rates without bursts. However, this ratio varies across cells. Additionally, we looked at how rate remapping relates to entorhinal theta-frequency oscillations. Theta-phase coding was preserved despite firing-rate changes from rate remapping but we did not observe differences between the first and second half of the theta cycle, as had been reported for CA1. Our results indicate that both, the heterogeneity between firing fields and rate remapping, are not due to altered firing patterns on short time scales but reflect location-specific changes at the firing-rate level.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Age‚Äêrelated functional connectivity along the hippocampal longitudinal axis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Accumulated evidence points toward a long-axis functional division of the hippocampus, with its anterior part primarily associated with emotional processes and the posterior with navigation and cognition. It is yet unclear, however, how functional connectivity between areas along the hippocampal longitudinal axis and other brain regions differ, and how they are affected by age. Applying an anatomically driven general linear model-based functional connectivity analysis on a large database of resting-state fMRI data, we demonstrate that independent of age, the posterior hippocampus is functionally connected primarily with sensory and motor areas, the middle hippocampus with the default mode network, and the anterior with limbic and prefrontal regions. Along with an age-related disintegration of intra-hippocampal BOLD signal uniformity, the middle and posterior sub-regions exhibit mostly decreases in their functional connectivity with cortical regions, whereas the anterior hippocampus and ventral striatum appear to become more synchronized with age. These findings indicate that long-axis hippocampal areas are tuned to particular functional networks, which do not age in a unified manner.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Insulin‚Äêlike growth factor 1 gene transfer for sporadic Alzheimer's disease: New evidence for trophic factor mediated hippocampal neuronal and synaptic recovery‚Äêbased behavior improvement</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder with no cure. Patients typically suffer from cognitive impairment imprinted by irreversible neocortex and hippocampal degeneration with overt synaptic and neuron dysfunction. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) has proven to be a potent neuroprotective molecule in animal models of age-related neurodegeneration. In this regard, adenoviral gene transfer aiming at IGF1 brain overexpression has been hitherto an underexplored approach for the sAD treatment. We postulated enhanced IGF1 signaling in the brain as a restorative means in the diseased brain to revert cognitive deficit and restore hippocampal function. We implemented recombinant adenovirus mediated intracerebroventricular IGF1 gene transfer on the streptozotocin (STZ) induced sAD rat model, using 3-month-old male Sprague Dawley rats. This approach enhanced IGF1 signaling in the hippocampus and dampened sAD phosphorylated Tau. We found a remarkable short-term improvement in species-typical behavior, recognition memory, spatial memory, and depressive-like behavior. Histological analysis revealed a significant recovery of immature hippocampal neurons. We additionally recorded an increase in hippocampal microglial cells, which we suggest to exert anti-inflammatory effects. Finally, we found decreased levels of pre- and postsynaptic proteins in the hippocampus of STZ animals. Interestingly, IGF1 gene transfer increased the levels of PSD95 and GAD65/67 synaptic markers, indicating that the treatment enhanced the synaptic plasticity. We conclude that exogenous activation of IGF1 signaling pathway, 1 week after intracerebroventricular STZ administration, protects hippocampal immature neurons, dampens phosphorylated Tau levels, improves synaptic function and therefore performs therapeutically on the sAD STZ model. Hence, this study provides strong evidence for the use of this trophic factor to treat AD and age-related neurodegeneration.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Fear conditioning potentiates the hippocampal CA1 commissural pathway in vivo and increases awake phase sleep</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus is essential for spatial learning and memory. To assess learning we used contextual fear conditioning (cFC), where animals learn to associate a place with aversive events like foot-shocks. Candidate memory mechanisms for cFC are long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), but there is little direct evidence of them operating in the hippocampus in vivo following cFC. Also, little is known about the behavioral state changes induced by cFC. To address these issues, we recorded local field potentials in freely behaving mice by stimulating in the left dorsal CA1 region and recording in the right dorsal CA1 region. Synaptic strength in the commissural pathway was monitored by measuring field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) before and after cFC. After cFC, the commissural pathway's synaptic strength was potentiated. Although recordings occurred during the wake phase of the light/dark cycle, the mice slept more in the post-conditioning period than in the pre-conditioning period. Relative to awake periods, in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep the fEPSPs were larger in both pre- and post-conditioning periods. We also found a significant negative correlation between the animal's speed and fEPSP size. Therefore, to avoid confounds in the fEFSP potentiation estimates, we controlled for speed-related and sleep-related fEPSP changes and still found that cFC induced long-term potentiation, but no significant long-term depression. Synaptic strength changes were not found in the control group that simply explored the fear-conditioning chamber, indicating that exploration of the novel place did not produce the measurable effects caused by cFC. These results show that following cFC, the CA1 commissural pathway is potentiated, likely contributing to the functional integration of the left and right hippocampi in fear memory consolidation. In addition, the cFC paradigm produces significant changes in an animal's behavioral state, which are observable as proximal changes in sleep patterns.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Delicate balance: the relationship between internal astigmatism and lens astigmatism [version 2; peer review: 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Due to lack of equipment for directly measuring crystal morphology, there has been little research on lenticular astigmatism. The purpose of this study was to accurately explore the correlation between internal astigmatism and lens astigmatism in patients with ametropia. Methods:¬†This is a cross-sectional study conducted in the Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College, China, in September 2020. Diopter values (refractive astigmatism, RA) of patients with ametropia was recorded, and the corneal and lens biological parameters were measured by CASIA2 (corneal/anterior segment optical correlation tomography analyzer). Biometric parameters, including the total corneal astigmatism (total corneal astigmatism,¬†TCA), anterior and posterior curvature radius of the lens (anterior curvature radius of the lens,¬†ACL;¬†¬†posterior curvature radius of the lens,¬†PCL), internal astigmatism (internal astigmatism, IA), anterior and posterior astigmatism of the lens¬†(anterior astigmatism of the lens, AAL;¬†¬†posterior astigmatism of the lens,¬†PAL) were measured. Grouping and comparisons were made according to gender and age. Results:¬†In total, 151 participants (293 eyes) were included in the analysis. There were significant ( P<0.05) differences in the IA ( Z=-2.194, P=0.028) according to gender, but not in the other parameters. By age group, there were statistically significant differences in the TCA ( H=10.609, P=0.005), IA ( F=3.722, P=0.025), and PAL ( H=8.254, P=0.016), but not in the others. The IA was positively correlated with the age ( r=0.155, P=0.008), RA ( r=0. 534, P<0.001), AAL ( r=0.308, P<0.001), and was negatively correlated with the TCA ( r=-0.244, P<0.001). The regression equation between the IA and AAL was: Y (IA) =-0.626 +0.447 X (AAL). Conclusions:¬†¬†Internal astigmatism is mainly related to¬†the¬†anterior astigmatism of the lens, and the higher the anterior astigmatism of the lens, the higher the internal astigmatism; At the same time, internal astigmatism increases with age.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">High flow nasal oxygen for acute type two respiratory failure: a systematic review [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Acute type two respiratory failure (AT2RF) is characterized by high carbon dioxide levels (PaCO2 >6kPa). Non-invasive ventilation (NIV), the current standard of care, has a high failure rate. High flow nasal therapy (HFNT) has potential additional benefits such as CO2 clearance, the ability to communicate and comfort. The primary aim of this systematic review is to determine whether HFNT in AT2RF improves 1) PaCO2, 2) clinical and patient-centred outcomes and 3) to assess potential harms. Methods: We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE and CENTRAL ¬†(January 1999-January 2021). Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies comparing HFNT with low flow nasal oxygen (LFO) or NIV were included. Two authors independently assessed studies for eligibility, data extraction and risk of bias. We used Cochrane risk of bias tool for RCTs and Ottawa-Newcastle scale for cohort studies. Results: From 727 publications reviewed, four RCTs and one cohort study (n=425) were included. In three trials of HFNT vs NIV, comparing PaCO2 (kPa) at last follow-up time point, there was a significant reduction at four hours¬†(1 RCT; HFNT median 6.7, IQR 5.6 ‚Äì 7.7 vs NIV median 7.6, IQR 6.3 ‚Äì 9.3) and no significant difference at¬† 24-hours or five days. Comparing HFNT with LFO, there was no significant difference at 30-minutes. There was no difference in intubation or mortality. Conclusions: This review identified a small number of studies with low to very low certainty of evidence. A reduction of PaCO2 at an early time point of four hours post-intervention was demonstrated in one small RCT. Significant limitations of the included studies were lack of adequately powered outcomes and clinically relevant time-points and small sample size. Accordingly, systematic review cannot recommend the use of HFNT as the initial management strategy for AT2RF and trials adequately powered to detect clinical and patient-relevant outcomes are urgently warranted.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A study protocol to prepare an RBD protein for vaccine against COVID-19 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a global threat to humans and the world‚Äôs economy. Effective and safe vaccines against this virus are essential to control and eradicate the pandemic. The currently applied vaccines carry SARS-CoV-2 spike-protein mRNA/cDNA. These vaccines go through several cellular processes in the recipients for producing antigens. On the contrary, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (receptor binding domain)-protein is an antigen. It will directly stimulate antibody production against SARS-CoV-2. Hence, we propose to produce SARS-CoV-2 RBD-protein as a fast acting, effective and safe vaccine.¬† Methods: We propose to reconstruct a plasmid carrying three¬†types of¬† DNA¬†sequences: RBD¬†cDNA, FP (fusion peptide)¬†DNA and sfGFP(superfolder green fluorescent protein),¬†cDNA creating the RBD-FP-sfGFP DNA within an orf (open reading frame). Escherichia coli, C2566H, transformed with the reconstructed plasmid will express RBD-FP-sfGFP fusion protein producing green fluorescent cfu (colony forming unit). The RBD-protein will be separated from the sfGFP using an FP specific enterokinase, and eluted by HIC (hydrophobic interaction chromatography), detected with a BioVision Elisa kit, and quantified by spectrophotometry at UV280nm.¬† Results: The plasmid reconstruct will carry ampr (ampicillin-resistant)¬†gene as a selective marker and a T7 promoter controlling the expression of RBD-FP-sfGFP fusion protein. The transformed Escherichia coli will efficiently express the RBD-FP-sfGFP fusion protein. The highly efficient sfGFP fused within the RBD-FP-sfGFP will produce green fluorescent cfu. The RBD-FP-sfGFP protein extract from the green cfu, digested by enterokinase and separated by the HIC will produce pure RBD protein.¬† Conclusion: A positive BioVision ELISA test detects <10 pg RBD protein/ml of the sample. A larger sample of the purified RBD protein can be used as a vaccine following a standard formulation and safety protocols. Once administered, the RBD protein will stimulate antibody production against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The RBD protein has no potential to recombine with human genome.
