	<p>Despite reports of a high incidence and various predictors of post-stroke depression (PSD), the underdiagnosis and undertreatment rates of PSD are still high. This study aimed to examine the incidence of depression in stroke patients and identify factors associated with PSD. This was a retrospective cohort study on ischemic stroke patients from the Geisinger Neuroscience Ischemic Stroke (GNSIS) registry. The following statistical analyses were performed to predict PSD in the studied population: a Kaplan&amp;amp;ndash;Meier estimator and a Cox proportional hazards model. A total of 5882 patients were included in the study. The median age at the time of an ischemic stroke was 72 years and 56% were males. A total of 294 patients were diagnosed with PSD within one year of a stroke. The cumulative incidence of depression was found to be 6.4% (95% CI 5.7&amp;amp;ndash;7.1%) at one year for the entire cohort. Women were found to have a higher risk of PSD than men (HR for women = 1.47, 95% CI 1.18&amp;amp;ndash;1.85, p = 0.001). A history of prior stroke (HR = 1.58, 95% CI 1.18&amp;amp;ndash;2.11, p = 0.002) and myocardial infarction (HR = 1.47, 95% CI 1.05&amp;amp;ndash;2.06, p = 0.025) were associated with PSD. Medicaid patients had a higher risk for PSD (HR = 2.16, 95% CI 1.5&amp;amp;ndash;3.12, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) than those with commercial insurance or health maintenance organization plans. Our findings showed that women, patients with a history of prior stroke or myocardial infarction, and with Medicaid insurance were more likely to develop PSD. Through an observational study on the EHR data, we confirmed that chronic stress, including financial and health-related stress, irrespective of age, significantly increased the risk for PSD.</p>

     alt="Localization of chemical synapses and modulatory release sites in the cardiac ganglion of the crab, Cancer borealis"/>
<p>The crustacean cardiac ganglion is a heavily modulated nine-neuron central pattern generator. We describe the distribution of chemical synapses and several neuromodulators within this system, which includes unusual clusters of synapsin-like immunoreactivity surrounding motor neuron cell bodies. These putative synapses near somata colocalize with many neuromodulators including the excitatory peptide proctolin (shown).

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The crustacean cardiac ganglion (CG) comprises nine neurons that provide rhythmic drive to the heart. The CG is the direct target of multiple modulators. Synapsin-like immunoreactivity was found clustered around the somata of the large cells (LC) and in a neuropil at the anterior branch of the CG trunk of <i>Cancer borealis</i>. This implicates the soma as a key site of synaptic integration, an unusual configuration in invertebrates. Proctolin is an excitatory neuromodulator of the CG, and proctolin-like immunoreactivity exhibited partial overlap with putative chemical synapses near the LCs and at the neuropil. A proctolin-like projection was also found in a pair of excitatory nerves entering the CG. GABA-like immunoreactivity was nearly completely colocalized with chemical synapses near the LCs but absent at the anterior branch neuropil. GABA-like projections were found in a pair of inhibitory nerves entering the CG. <i>C. borealis</i> Allatostatin B1 (CbASTB), red pigment concentrating hormone, and FLRFamide-like immunoreactivity each had a unique pattern of staining and co-localization with putative chemical synapses. These results provide morphological evidence that synaptic input is integrated at LC somata in the CG. Our findings provide a topographical organization for some of the multiple inhibitory and excitatory modulators that alter the rhythmic output of this semi-autonomous motor circuit.</p>

<h2>Graphical Abstract</h2>
<p>The large black beetle, the chafer <i>Holotrichia parallela</i>, shows a unique ca. 48-h endogenous rhythm (viz., a circabidian rhythm) in appearance on the ground. The ecological significance and the molecular mechanism remain obscure, but a previous study implied that the circadian clock system is responsible for the 2-day rhythm. In the present study, we investigated neuropeptide pigment-dispersing factor-immunoreactive (PDF-ir) neurons in the brain of <i>H. parallela</i> in order to search for circadian neural components since PDF is a well-known output neuromodulator of circadian pacemakers in several insects. We anatomically identified ∼ 100 PDF-ir cells near the accessory medulla (AME) in the optic lobe, which is a site for circadian pacemakers in the cockroach and flies, and furthermore, we found that their varicose terminal arbors in the lateral protocerebrum form output synapses upon unknown fibers as well as other PDF-ir fibers. Their conceivable function in the circabidian rhythm was discussed based on the anatomical insights.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) is a well-known output neuropeptide modulator of circadian pacemakers in insects. Here, we investigated PDF-immunoreactive (ir) neurons in the brain of the large black chafer <i>Holotrichia parallela</i> to search for circadian neural components, which are potentially involved in its circabidian rhythm. PDF-ir cells were exclusively detected near the accessory medulla (AME) as a cluster of ∼ 100 cells with almost homogeneous size. No other cells exhibited immunoreactivity. The PDF-ir cells send beaded fibers into the proximal half of the AME and ventral elongation in an anterior region between the medulla (ME) and lobula (LO). Neither the lamina, ME, LO, nor lobula plate receives PDF-ir fibers. Primary axons derived from the PDF-ir cells extend toward the contralateral hemisphere through the dorsolateral protocerebrum anterior to the calyx to connect the bilateral AME. The axons form varicose outgrowths exclusively in the lateral protocerebrum. Double labeling with antisynapsin revealed partial overlaps between PDF-ir varicosities and synapsin-ir puncta. Thus, it was assumed that the PDF-ir fibers form output synapses there. To verify this, we investigated the ultrastructure of the PDF-ir varicosities in the lateral protocerebrum by preembedding immunoelectron microscopy. The PDF-ir profiles contain small clear synaptic vesicles as well as both PDF-positive and PDF-negative dense-core vesicles, and the profiles form output synapses upon unknown profiles and receive synapses from other PDF-ir profiles. PDF neurons near the AME are considered to be prominent circadian pacemakers in the cockroach and flies. Their possible function in the circabidian rhythm was discussed based on these anatomical insights.</p>

                Background: Optimum productivity of beef cattle is achieved with adequate feed supply, both in quality and quantity. Consumption of local feedstuff Neptunia plena L. Benth and Leersia hexandra Swartz as a ration by the animal subject is expected to promote cost efficiency and production, as well as provide essential nutrition needs. Therefore, this research aimed to evaluate dry matter digestibility (DMD), organic matter digestibility (OMD), N-NH3 production, and volatile fatty acid (VFA) in beef cattle. Methods: Feed and rumen inoculum samples were prepared and analyzed for their proximate contents. There were five treatment groups based on the diet received by beef cattle. In vitro approaches were used to determine the DMD, OMD, N-NH3 production, and VFA in beef cattle. The research was conducted in the Laboratory of Feed Nutrient Science, Faculty of Animal Husbandry and Agriculture, Diponegoro University, Semarang. The data were analyzed using ANOVA at a significance level of 95%, and a Duncan Multiple Range Test. Results: The results showed that the highest DMD (P<0.05) was derived from T5 (56.47%), followed by T4 (56.45%) and T3 (55.90%). T5=62.40% significantly (P<0.05) generated the highest OMD followed by T4=61.95% and T3=60.82%. This treatment had the highest N-NH3 value, namely 5.02 mM, compared with T3=4.55 mM, T4=4.50 mM, T2=4.22 mM, and T1=3.99 mM. Furthermore, T5 had the highest VFA (P<0.05) compared with T4, T3, T2, and T1 with the value of 150.5, 133.0, 130.5, 130.0, and 123.5 mM, respectively. Conclusions: The local feedstuff-based ration contributed to beef cattle production.

                Background  Over the previous few decades, demographics, gender, and the number of papers published have all changed considerably. One of the fields of medicine that has yet to be extensively investigated is endocrinology.   Methods Journal of Endocrinology and General & Comparative Endocrinology are two landmark journals that publish articles from around the world. Each decade during the 70-year period from 1961 to 2021 has been examined in this study. Funding source, first author – last author gender, their demographics and proportion of papers with at least one female author were the parameters considered while studying each publication. It was predicted that the number of female authors per paper would increase with time, as would the range of degrees held by the authors, demographical variations in authorship, and the funding source. The aim was also to determine the distribution of female first authors and senior authors in endocrinology journals over a 70-year period, as well as to check the gender combinations using the Punnett square.   Results  Female initial authors rose from 7% to 29.6% (p<0.0006) between 1961 and 2021, whereas female senior authors rose from 15.6% to 22.2%. Despite women's small contributions to first and senior authors, female participation rose from 17.48% (25/143) to 70% (170/250) between 1961 and 2021. Male-Female and Female-Male combinations rose with Chi-Square = 124.6, (p<0.0001). Europe and the Americas had the most female academic medical contributors (p<0.0001) Regardless of author status, female participation rose from 17.48% in 1961 to 68% in 2021.  Conclusion   In papers published in endocrinology journals, there was a rising trend in female contributions to academic medicine. Even with the large growth of female endocrinologists, there is still a disparity in why the increase in female authors is comparably fewer.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Adverse drug reactions to the three doses of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) mRNA-1273 vaccine in a cohort of cancer patients under active treatment of a tertiary hospital in Madrid, Spain [version 2; peer review: 1 approv</a></h4>

              
                Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines efficacy and safety have been tested in phase 3 studies in which cancer patients were not included or were underrepresented. Methods: The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety profile of the mRNA-1273 vaccine across cancer patients and its relationship to patients’ demographics. We selected from our records all 18-years or older solid cancer patients under active treatment vaccinated with the complete three-dose schedule mRNA-1273 vaccine whose adverse drug reactions (ADRs)  after each dose were recorded. Medical records were reviewed retrospectively to collect data between April 19, 2021, and December 31, 2021. Patients with documented previous infection by SARS-Cov-2 were excluded. Results: A total of 93 patients met the inclusion criteria. Local ADRs were reported more frequently after the first and second dose than after the third (41.9%, 43% and 31.1% of the patients respectively), while systemic ADRs followed the opposite pattern (16.1%, 34.4% and 52.6% of the patients respectively). We found a statistically significant association between sex and systemic adverse reactions after the third dose, p < 0.001 and between systemic adverse reactions after the second dose and systemic adverse reactions after the third dose, p = 0.001 A significant linear trend, p = 0.012, with a higher Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score associated with a lower proportion of patients suffering from systemic side effects was found. Women had 5.79 times higher odds to exhibit systemic ADRs after the third dose (p=0.01) compared to males. Increasing age was associated with a decreased likelihood of exhibiting ADRs (p=0.016). Conclusion: The mRNA-1273 vaccine shows a tolerable safety profile. The likelihood of ADRs appears to be associated with gender and age. Its association with ECOG scores is less evident. Further studies are needed to elucidate this data in cancer patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The role of angiotensin receptor blocker (losartan) on decreasing fibrotic process of corpora cavernosa in priapism model of wistar rats [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Priapism induces regulation of Transforming Growth Factor-β1 (TGF-β1) expression and collagen-type-1 deposition. This will replace the normal corpora cavernosa with fibrotic tissue which eventually resulted in erectile dysfunction. It is also known that the fibrosis process of corpora cavernosa is related to Renin-Angiotensin II System (RAS). Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), especially losartan, inhibit the inflammation process and fibrotic tissue formation. This study evaluated the effect of losartan in reducing fibrosis in priapism by evaluating TGF-β1 and collagen-type-1 in cavernous tissue and determined the effect of losartan in preventing fibrosis in priapism model of Wistar rats assessed by the metavir score. Methods: A total of eighteen male Wistar rats mean were divided into five groups. For the priapism models, we applied negative pressure on the penis to make an artificial erection to mimic the priapism process. The control groups were observed and the treatment groups were orally given losartan 15 mg/kg/day. Corpora cavernosa was harvested for TGF-β1 and collagen-type-1 measurement using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The fibrotic tissue of each rat was then collected and assessed histopathologically with the metavir scoring system. Results: Penile TGF-β1 concentration in the losartan-treated group was not significantly different on day 10 and day 28 of observation (p10=0,30; p28=0,17). Meanwhile, collagen-type-1 concentration was significantly lower compared to control group (p10=0,002; p28=0,01). There was a significant difference in metavir scores in rats that received losartan and those who did not (p<0,05). Conclusion: Losartan could suppress the fibrosis process in the priapism model. It could decrease the collagen type 1 deposition during corpora cavernosa tissue regeneration. Based on the metavir score, the group receiving losartan therapy was better than the control group.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Epidemiological and evolutionary consequences of different types of CRISPR-Cas systems</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hélène Chabas, Viktor Müller, Sebastian Bonhoeffer, Roland R. Regoes</p>

Bacteria have adaptive immunity against viruses (phages) in the form of CRISPR-Cas immune systems. Currently, 6 types of CRISPR-Cas systems are known and the molecular study of three of these has revealed important molecular differences. It is unknown if and how these molecular differences change the outcome of phage infection and the evolutionary pressure the CRISPR-Cas systems faces. To determine the importance of these molecular differences, we model a phage outbreak entering a population defending exclusively with a type I/II or a type III CRISPR-Cas system. We show that for type III CRISPR-Cas systems, rapid phage extinction is driven by the probability to acquire at least one resistance spacer. However, for type I/II CRISPR-Cas systems, rapid phage extinction is characterized by an a threshold-like behaviour: any acquisition probability below this threshold leads to phage survival whereas any acquisition probability above it, results in phage extinction. We also show that in the absence of autoimmunity, high acquisition rates evolve. However, when CRISPR-Cas systems are prone to autoimmunity, intermediate levels of acquisition are optimal during a phage outbreak. As we predict an optimal probability of spacer acquisition 2 factors of magnitude above the one that has been measured, we discuss the origin of such a discrepancy. Finally, we show that in a biologically relevant parameter range, a type III CRISPR-Cas system can outcompete a type I/II CRISPR-Cas system with a slightly higher probability of acquisition.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Turning promise into practice: Crop biotechnology for increasing genetic diversity and climate resilience</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sarah Garland, Helen Anne Curry</p>

As climate change increasingly threatens agricultural production, expanding genetic diversity in crops is an important strategy for climate resilience in many agricultural contexts. In this Essay, we explore the potential of crop biotechnology to contribute to this diversification, especially in industrialized systems, by using historical perspectives to frame the current dialogue surrounding recent innovations in gene editing. We unearth comments about the possibility of enhancing crop diversity made by ambitious scientists in the early days of recombinant DNA and follow the implementation of this technology, which has not generated the diversification some anticipated. We then turn to recent claims about the promise of gene editing tools with respect to this same goal. We encourage researchers and other stakeholders to engage in activities beyond the laboratory if they hope to see what is technologically possible translated into practice at this critical point in agricultural transformation.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Tau mediates synergistic influence of vascular risk and Aβ on cognitive decline</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Elevated vascular risk and amyloid-beta (Aβ) burden have been synergistically associated with cognitive decline in preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD), though the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We examined whether accelerated longitudinal tau accumulation mediates the vascular risk-Aβ interaction on cognitive decline.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 175 cognitively unimpaired older adults (age 70.5±8.0y). Baseline vascular risk was quantified using the office-based Framingham Heart Study general cardiovascular disease risk score (FHS-CVD). Baseline Aβ burden was measured with Pittsburgh Compound-B PET. Tau burden was measured longitudinally (3.6±1.5y) with Flortaucipir PET, focusing on inferior temporal cortex (ITC). Cognition was assessed longitudinally (7.0±2.0y) using the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite. Linear mixed effects models examined the interactive effects of baseline vascular risk and Aβ on longitudinal ITC tau. Additionally, moderated mediation was used to determine whether tau accumulation mediated the FHS-CVD*Aβ effect on cognitive decline.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We observed a significant interaction between elevated baseline FHS-CVD and Aβ on greater ITC tau accumulation (p=0.004), even in individuals with Aβ burden below the conventional threshold for amyloid-positivity. Examining individual vascular risk factors, we found elevated systolic blood pressure and body mass index showed independent interactions with Aβ on longitudinal tau (both p&lt;0.0001). ITC tau accumulation mediated 33% of the interactive association of FHS-CVD and Aβ on cognitive decline.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Vascular risks interact with subthreshold levels of Aβ to promote cognitive decline, partially by accelerating early neocortical tau accumulation. Our findings support vascular risk reduction, especially treating hypertension and obesity, to attenuate Aβ-related tau pathology and reduce late-life cognitive decline.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Decreasing Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Expenditures and Improving Quality at the Health System Level</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to evaluate a multicomponent health system intervention designed to reduce escalating disease-modifying treatment (DMT) expenditures and improve multiple sclerosis (MS) outcomes by increasing use of preferred formulary and highly effective DMTs (HETs).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a trend study of treatment utilization and expenditure outcomes prior to (2009–2011) and during (2012–2018) MS Treatment Optimization Program (MSTOP) implementation in Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) compared to a Kaiser Permanente region of similar size. Annual relapse rates (ARRs) were obtained from KPSC's electronic health records.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Adherence to preferred formulary DMTs increased from 25.4% in 2011 to 72.2% in 2017 following MSTOP implementation in KPSC and 22.1% to 43.8%, respectively, in the comparator. KPSC's annual DMT expenditures in 2018 were less than in 2011 despite an 11.3% increase in DMT-treated members. The decline in average per patient per year of treatment expenditures from a peak of $43.1 K in 2014 to $26.3 K in 2018 in KPSC was greater than the comparator, which peaked at $52.1 K and declined to $40.0 K in 2018. Over the 7 years following initiation of MSTOP, cumulative MS DMT expenditures were $161.6 million less than the comparator. HET use increased to 62.5% of per patient treatment-years versus 32.4% in the comparator. This corresponded to a 69% decline in adjusted ARR (95% confidence interval = 64.1–73.2%; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) among DMT-treated patients in KPSC.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>A novel, expert-led health system intervention reduced MS DMT expenditures despite rising prices while simultaneously reducing MS relapse rates. Our focus on health system progress toward meaningful, measurable targets could serve as a model to improve quality and affordability of MS care in other settings.

                <p>Oxidative stress (OS) induces inflammation, which in turn exacerbates OS and the expression of acute phase proteins (APPs). Regulatory T lymphocyte (Treg) therapy was assessed for suppression of OS and APP responses in longitudinal serum samples from subjects with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) enrolled in a phase I clinical trial. The first round of Treg therapy suppressed levels of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL). During a 6-month washout period, ox-LDL levels increased. A second round of therapy again suppressed ox-LDL levels and then rose following the cessation of treatment. Serum levels of APPs, soluble CD14, lipopolysaccharide binding protein, and C-reactive protein, were stabilized during Treg administrations, but rose during the washout period and again after therapy was discontinued. Treg therapy potentially suppresses peripheral OS and the accompanying circulating pro-inflammatory induced APPs, both of which may serve as peripheral candidates for monitoring efficacies of immunomodulating therapies.

                <p>We sought to determine whether racial and socioeconomic disparities in the utilization of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson's disease (PD) have improved over time. We examined DBS utilization and analyzed factors associated with placement of DBS. The odds of DBS placement increased across the study period, whereas White patients with PD were 5 times more likely than Black patients to undergo DBS. Individuals, regardless of racial background, with 2 or more comorbidities were 14 times less likely to undergo DBS. Privately insured patients were 1.6 times more likely to undergo DBS. Despite increasing DBS utilization, significant disparities persist in access to DBS. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:246–254</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Human genomics established that pathogenic variation in diverse genes can underlie a single disorder. For example, hereditary spastic paraplegia is associated with &gt;80 genes, with frequently only few affected individuals described for each gene. Herein, we characterize a large cohort of individuals with biallelic variation in <i>ENTPD1</i>, a gene previously linked to spastic paraplegia 64 (Mendelian Inheritance in Man # 615683).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Individuals with biallelic <i>ENTPD1</i> variants were recruited worldwide. Deep phenotyping and molecular characterization were performed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 27 individuals from 17 unrelated families were studied; additional phenotypic information was collected from published cases. Twelve novel pathogenic <i>ENTPD1</i> variants are described (NM 001776.6): c.398_399delinsAA; p.(Gly133Glu), c.540del; p.(Thr181Leufs*18), c.640del; p.(Gly216Glufs*75), c.185 T &gt; G; p.(Leu62*), c.1531 T &gt; C; p.(*511Glnext*100), c.967C &gt; T; p.(Gln323*), c.414-2_414-1del, and c.146 A &gt; G; p.(Tyr49Cys) including 4 recurrent variants c.1109 T &gt; A; p.(Leu370*), c.574-6_574-3del, c.770_771del; p.(Gly257Glufs*18), and c.1041del; p.(Ile348Phefs*19). Shared disease traits include childhood onset, progressive spastic paraplegia, intellectual disability (ID), dysarthria, and white matter abnormalities. <i>In vitro</i> assays demonstrate that <i>ENTPD1</i> expression and function are impaired and that c.574-6_574-3del causes exon skipping. Global metabolomics demonstrate <i>ENTPD1</i> deficiency leads to impaired nucleotide, lipid, and energy metabolism.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The <i>ENTPD1</i> locus trait consists of childhood disease onset, ID, progressive spastic paraparesis, dysarthria, dysmorphisms, and white matter abnormalities, with some individuals showing neurocognitive regression. Investigation of an allelic series of <i>ENTPD1</i> (1) expands previously described features of <i>ENTPD1</i>-related neurological disease, (2) highlights the importance of genotype-driven deep phenotyping, (3) documents the need for global collaborative efforts to characterize rare autosomal recessive disease traits, and (4) provides insights into disease trait neurobiology.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">ZSCAN1 Autoantibodies Are Associated with Pediatric Paraneoplastic ROHHAD</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Rapid-onset Obesity with Hypothalamic Dysfunction, Hypoventilation and Autonomic Dysregulation (ROHHAD), is a severe pediatric disorder of uncertain etiology resulting in hypothalamic dysfunction and frequent sudden death. Frequent co-occurrence of neuroblastic tumors have fueled suspicion of an autoimmune paraneoplastic neurological syndrome (PNS); however, specific anti-neural autoantibodies, a hallmark of PNS, have not been identified. Our objective is to determine if an autoimmune paraneoplastic etiology underlies ROHHAD.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Immunoglobulin G (IgG) from pediatric ROHHAD patients (n = 9), non-inflammatory individuals (n = 100) and relevant pediatric controls (n = 25) was screened using a programmable phage display of the human peptidome (PhIP-Seq). Putative ROHHAD-specific autoantibodies were orthogonally validated using radioactive ligand binding and cell-based assays. Expression of autoantibody targets in ROHHAD tumor and healthy brain tissue was assessed with immunohistochemistry and mass spectrometry, respectively.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Autoantibodies to ZSCAN1 were detected in ROHHAD patients by PhIP-Seq and orthogonally validated in 7/9 ROHHAD patients and 0/125 controls using radioactive ligand binding and cell-based assays. Expression of ZSCAN1 in ROHHAD tumor and healthy human brain tissue was confirmed.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results support the notion that tumor-associated ROHHAD syndrome is a pediatric PNS, potentially initiated by an immune response to peripheral neuroblastic tumor. ZSCAN1 autoantibodies may aid in earlier, accurate diagnosis of ROHHAD syndrome, thus providing a means toward early detection and treatment. This work warrants follow-up studies to test sensitivity and specificity of a novel diagnostic test. Last, given the absence of the ZSCAN1 gene in rodents, our study highlights the value of human-based approaches for detecting novel PNS subtypes. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:279–291</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Using a multi-cohort, discovery-replication-validation design, we sought new plasma biomarkers that predict which individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) will experience cognitive decline.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In 108 discovery cohort PD individuals and 83 replication cohort PD individuals, we measured 940 plasma proteins on an aptamer-based platform. Using proteins associated with subsequent cognitive decline in both cohorts, we trained a logistic regression model to predict which patients with PD showed fast (&gt; = 1 point drop/year on Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA]) versus slow (&lt; 1 point drop/year on MoCA) cognitive decline in the discovery cohort, testing it in the replication cohort. We developed alternate assays for the top 3 proteins and confirmed their ability to predict cognitive decline – defined by change in MoCA or development of incident mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia – in a validation cohort of 118 individuals with PD. We investigated the top plasma biomarker for causal influence by Mendelian randomization (MR).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A model with only 3 proteins (melanoma inhibitory activity protein [MIA], C-reactive protein [CRP], and albumin) separated fast versus slow cognitive decline subgroups with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.80 in the validation cohort. The individuals with PD in the validation cohort in the top quartile of risk for cognitive decline based on this model were 4.4 times more likely to develop incident MCI or dementia than those in the lowest quartile. Genotypes at MIA single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2233154 associated with MIA levels and cognitive decline, providing evidence for MIA's causal influence.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>An easily obtained plasma-based predictor identifies individuals with PD at risk for cognitive decline. MIA may participate causally in development of cognitive decline. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:255–269</p>

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Duchenne muscular dystrophy is associated with various degrees of cognitive impairment and behavioral disturbances. Emotional and memory deficits also constitute reliable outcome measures to assess efficacy of treatments in the <i>mdx</i> mouse lacking the muscle and neuronal full-length dystrophins. The present study aimed to evaluate whether these deficits could be alleviated by the restoration of brain dystrophin.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed intracerebroventricular administration of a new potent tricyclo-DNA antisense oligonucleotide (tcDNA-ASO) containing a full phosphodiester backbone conjugated to a palmitic acid moiety (tcDNA-ASO), designed to skip the mutated exon 23 of <i>mdx</i> mice.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We first show that the tcDNA-ASO rescues expression of brain dystrophin to 10–30% of wild-type levels and significantly reduces the abnormal unconditioned fear responses in <i>mdx</i> mice in a dose-dependent manner, 5 weeks post-injection. Exon skipping efficiency, ASO biodistribution, protein restoration and effect on the fear response were optimal with a dose of 400 μg at 6–7 weeks post-injection, with synaptic-like expression in brain tissues such as the hippocampus and amygdala. Furthermore, this dose of tcDNA-ASO restored long-term memory retention of <i>mdx</i> mice in an object recognition task, but only had minor effects on fear conditioning.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results suggest for the first time that postnatal re-expression of brain dystrophin could reverse or at least alleviate some cognitive deficits associated with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:213–229</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We performed a population-based study on inclusion body myositis with the primary aims to define the prevalence, survival rate, and incidence, and to investigate the symptom profiles associated with disease duration and sex over a 33-year period.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients diagnosed between 1985 and 2017 in Region Västra Götaland, Sweden, were identified according to the European Neuromuscular Centre diagnostic criteria from 2011.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 128 patients, 89 men and 39 women, with the strict clinicopathological definition of inclusion body myositis. The prevalence was 32 per million inhabitants, 19 per million women and 45 per million men, by December 31, 2017. Mean incidence was 2.5 per million inhabitants and year. Mean age at symptom onset was 64.4 years with quadriceps weakness being the most common presenting symptom followed by finger flexor weakness. Dysphagia was a common presenting symptom being more frequent in women (23%) than men (10%) and was during the disease course reported in 74% of men and 84% of women. Seventy-three patients were deceased, with a mean survival of 14 years from symptom onset. Survival rates from both diagnosis date and symptom onset were decreased compared to the matched population.</p>
<p>Twenty-one percent of the patients had an additional autoimmune disease. A cross-sectional analysis of autoantibodies in 50 patients and 28 matched controls showed autoantibodies to cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase 1A in 40% of the patients and 3.6% of controls.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Inclusion body myositis is an autoimmune disease with decreased survival rate and with marked sex differences in both prevalence and clinical manifestations. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:201–212</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Astrocytes outline the perivascular space (PVS) and regulate fluid exchange through the aquaporin-4 water channel. As neuromyelitis optica is an autoimmune astrocytopathy targeting aquaporin-4, we hypothesized that it could be associatied with PVS abnormalities.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A total of 34 patients, and 46 age- and sex-matched healthy controls from two independent cohorts (exploratory and validation dataset) underwent a standardized 3.0-T magnetic resonance imaging protocol including conventional and diffusion tensor imaging. Susceptibility-weighted imaging was also acquired in the exploratory dataset. We evaluated macroscopic and microstructural abnormalities of PVS in terms of enlargement and water diffusivity (DTI-ALPS index). In the exploration dataset, a susceptibility-weighted sequence was used to draw the regions of interest for the DTI-ALPS index calculation in areas having veins perpendicular to lateral ventricles. Between-group comparisons, correlations, and regression models were run to assess associations between PVS abnormalities, and clinical and magnetic resonance imaging variables.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Patients had a higher frequency of severe PVS enlargement in the centrum semiovale (29.4% vs 8.7%), which correlated with brain atrophy, deep grey matter atrophy, and poorer cognitive performance (<i>r</i>-values range: −0.44, −0.36; <i>p</i> values: 0.01–0.046).</p>
<p>In both datasets, patients had reduced DTI-ALPS index compared with controls (<i>p</i> values 0.004–0.038). Lower DTI-ALPS index, deep gray matter volume, and cortical volume could discriminate between patients and controls (<i>R</i>
<sup>2</sup> = 0.62), whereas lower DTI-ALPS index, higher number of myelitis, and higher T2-lesion volume were associated with worse disability (<i>R</i>
<sup>2</sup> = 0.55).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder are characterized by abnormal enlargement and impaired water diffusion along the PVS, whose clinical implications suggest a direct correlation with disease pathogenesis and severity. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:173–183</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Accumulation of α-synuclein (α-syn) in neurons is a prominent feature of Parkinson's disease (PD). Recently, researchers have considered that extracellular vesicles (EVs) may play an important role in protein exportation and propagation, and α-syn-containing EVs derived from the central nervous system (CNS) have been detected in peripheral blood. However, mechanistic insights into CNS-derived EVs have not been well-described.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Likely neurogenic EVs were purified from the plasma of PD patients and healthy controls using a well-established immunoprecipitation assay with anti-L1CAM-coated beads. A <i>Prnp-SNCA</i>
<sup>A53T</sup> transgenic PD mouse model was used to evaluate the neuronal pathology induced by PD-derived L1CAM-purified EVs. EV-associated microRNA (miRNA) profiling was used to screen for altered miRNAs in PD-derived L1CAM-purified EVs.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>PD patient-derived L1CAM-purified (likely neurogenic) EVs facilitated α-syn pathology and neuron loss in <i>Prnp-SNCA</i>
<sup>A53T</sup> transgenic PD mice. The miRNA, novel_miR_44438, was significantly increased in the PD group, which promoted α-syn accumulation and neuronal degeneration in a dose-dependent manner. Novel _miR_44438 directly targets NDST1 mRNA and inhibits the function of heparan sulfate, thus preventing exosome biogenesis and α-syn release from exosomes.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Novel_miR_44438 in PD-derived L1CAM-purified EVs inhibits the α-syn efflux from neurons thereby promoting the pathological accumulation and aggregation of α-syn. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:230–245</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To examine rates of intravenous thrombolysis (IVT), mechanical thrombectomy (MT), door-to-needle (DTN) time, door-to-puncture (DTP) time, and functional outcome between patients with admission magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) versus computed tomography (CT).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>An observational cohort study of consecutive patients using a target trial design within the nationwide Swiss-Stroke-Registry from January 2014 to August 2020 was carried out. Exclusion criteria included MRI contraindications, transferred patients, and unstable or frail patients. Multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression with multiple imputation was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals for IVT, MT, DTN, DTP, and good functional outcome (mRS 0–2) at 90 days.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of the 11,049 patients included (mean [SD] age, 71 [15] years; 4,811 [44%] women; 69% ischemic stroke, 16% transient ischemic attack, 8% stroke mimics, 6% intracranial hemorrhage), 3,741 (34%) received MRI and 7,308 (66%) CT. Patients undergoing MRI had lower National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (median [interquartile range] 2 [0–6] vs 4 [1–11]), and presented later after symptom onset (150 vs 123 min, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Admission MRI was associated with: lower adjusted odds of IVT (aOR 0.83, 0.73–0.96), but not with MT (aOR 1.11, 0.93–1.34); longer adjusted DTN (+22 min [13–30]), but not with longer DTP times; and higher adjusted odds of favorable outcome (aOR 1.54, 1.30–1.81).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We found an association of MRI with lower rates of IVT and a significant delay in DTN, but not in DTP and rates of MT. Given the delays in workflow metrics, prospective trials are required to show that tissue-based benefits of baseline MRI compensate for the temporal benefits of CT.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Polygenic Resilience Modulates the Penetrance of Parkinson Disease Genetic Risk Factors</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The aim of the current study is to understand why some individuals avoid developing Parkinson disease (PD) despite being at relatively high genetic risk, using the largest datasets of individual-level genetic data available.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We calculated polygenic risk score to identify controls and matched PD cases with the highest burden of genetic risk for PD in the discovery cohort (International Parkinson's Disease Genomics Consortium, 7,204 PD cases and 9,412 controls) and validation cohorts (Comprehensive Unbiased Risk Factor Assessment for Genetics and Environment in Parkinson's Disease, 8,968 cases and 7,598 controls; UK Biobank, 2,639 PD cases and 14,301 controls; Accelerating Medicines Partnership–Parkinson's Disease Initiative, 2,248 cases and 2,817 controls). A genome-wide association study meta-analysis was performed on these individuals to understand genetic variation associated with resistance to disease. We further constructed a polygenic resilience score, and performed multimarker analysis of genomic annotation (MAGMA) gene-based analyses and functional enrichment analyses.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A higher polygenic resilience score was associated with a lower risk for PD (β = −0.054, standard error [SE] = 0.022, <i>p</i> = 0.013). Although no single locus reached genome-wide significance, MAGMA gene-based analyses nominated <i>TBCA</i> as a putative gene. Furthermore, we estimated the narrow-sense heritability associated with resilience to PD (<i>h</i>
<sup>2</sup> = 0.081, SE = 0.035, <i>p</i> = 0.0003). Subsequent functional enrichment analysis highlighted histone methylation as a potential pathway harboring resilience alleles that could mitigate the effects of PD risk loci.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The present study represents a novel and comprehensive assessment of heritable genetic variation contributing to PD resistance. We show that a genetic resilience score can modify the penetrance of PD genetic risk factors and therefore protect individuals carrying a high-risk genetic burden from developing PD.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study aimed to assess whether non-invasive brain stimulation with transcranial alternating current stimulation at gamma-frequency (γ-tACS) applied over the precuneus can improve episodic memory and modulate cholinergic transmission by modulating cerebral rhythms in early Alzheimer's disease (AD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this randomized, double-blind, sham controlled, crossover study, 60 AD patients underwent a clinical and neurophysiological evaluation including assessment of episodic memory and cholinergic transmission pre and post 60 minutes treatment with γ-tACS targeting the precuneus or sham tACS. In a subset of 10 patients, EEG analysis and individualized modelling of electric field distribution were carried out. Predictors to γ-tACS efficacy were evaluated.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We observed a significant improvement in the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning (RAVL) test immediate recall (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and delayed recall scores (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) after γ-tACS but not after sham tACS. Face-name associations scores improved with γ-tACS (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) but not after sham tACS. Short latency afferent inhibition, an indirect measure of cholinergic transmission, increased only after γ-tACS (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). <i>ApoE</i> genotype and baseline cognitive impairment were the best predictors of response to γ-tACS. Clinical improvement correlated with the increase in gamma frequencies in posterior regions and with the amount of predicted electric field distribution in the precuneus.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Precuneus γ-tACS, able to increase γ-power activity on the posterior brain regions, showed a significant improvement of episodic memory performances, along with restoration of intracortical excitability measures of cholinergic transmission. Response to γ-tACS was dependent on genetic factors and disease stage. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:322–334</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Integrative Approach to Predict Severity in Nonketotic Hyperglycinemia</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Glycine encephalopathy, also known as nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH), is an inherited neurometabolic disorder with variable clinical course and severity, ranging from infantile epileptic encephalopathy to psychiatric disorders. A precise phenotypic characterization and an evaluation of predictive approaches are needed.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Longitudinal clinical and biochemical data of 25 individuals with NKH from the patient registry of the International Working Group on Neurotransmitter Related Disorders were studied with in silico analyses, pathogenicity scores, and molecular modeling of <i>GLDC</i> and <i>AMT</i> variants.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Symptom onset (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) and diagnosis occur earlier in life in severe NKH (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Presenting symptoms affect the age at diagnosis. Psychiatric problems occur predominantly in attenuated NKH. Onset age ≥ 3 months (66% specificity, 100% sensitivity, area under the curve [AUC] = 0.87) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/plasma glycine ratio ≤ 0.09 (57% specificity, 100% sensitivity, AUC = 0.88) are sensitive indicators for attenuated NKH, whereas CSF glycine concentration ≥ 116.5μmol/l (100% specificity, 93% sensitivity, AUC = 0.97) and CSF/plasma glycine ratio ≥ 0.15 (100% specificity, 64% sensitivity, AUC = 0.88) are specific for severe forms. A ratio threshold of 0.128 discriminates the overlapping range. We present 10 new <i>GLDC</i> variants. Two mild variants resulted in attenuated, whereas 2 severe variants or 1 mild and 1 severe variant led to severe phenotype. Based on clinical, biochemical, and genetic parameters, we propose a severity prediction model.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study widens the phenotypic spectrum of attenuated NKH and expands the number of pathogenic variants. The multiparametric approach provides a promising tool to predict disease severity, helping to improve clinical management strategies. ANN NEUROL 2022;92:292–303</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Acute Kidney Injury associated with "Triple whammy" combination: a protocol for a systematic review. [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: “Triple whammy” (TW) refers to the simultaneous use of diuretics, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). To date, the risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI) associated to this combination has not been deeply investigated. The objectives are to analyze the incidence of AKI associated to the exposure to “triple whammy” including all NSAIDs versus non-exposure to this combination. Secondarily, the risk of hospitalization, severe adverse events, requirement of renal replacement therapy and mortality will be assessed. Also, the incidence of AKI associated to the exposure to “triple whammy” versus non-exposure will be analyzed, including only metamizole as NSAID.   Methods: A systematic literature search of intervention studies and analytical observational studies will be conducted in the Cochrane Library, Medline and EMBASE, among others. AKI 12 months after the last prescription of the triple combination will be the main outcome. Relative frequencies, risk of bias and certainty of evidence will be analyzed. Additionally, sensitivity and subgroup analyses will be performed.   Results: Once this systematic review has been completed, the results are expected to provide an estimate of the risk associated with this triple combination and the renal variables, in addition to new guidance on the renal treatment of patients potentially receiving triple therapy.  Conclusions: This is intended to be the first systematic review of observational studies to analyse TW combination and AKI's risk based on well-validated epidemiological databases exploring drug safety issues.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Plant tissue culture challenges in Ethiopia and alternative options for low-cost media [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Plant tissue culture (PTC) is the cultivation of any part of a plant in nutritionally defined media under an aseptic and controlled environment, regardless of season and weather. The application of PTC leads to the mass propagation of varietal, high-quality seedlings of ornamental plants, medicinal plants, plantation crops, fruit trees, and forest trees. PTC technology, on the other hand, is more expensive in developing nations, such as Ethiopia, than traditional propagation methods such as seeds, cuttings, grafting, and so on. As a result, it is critical to take steps to cut production costs and explore alternate choices for present PTC obstacles (budget restrictions, procedural and operational matters, and unfortunate interactions and partnerships). In order to lower the unit cost of crop production, cost-effective procedures and the optimal utilization of equipment are required. This can be accomplished by increasing the efficiency of processes and optimizing resource allocation. Gelling agents, macro and micronutrients, equipment, carbon sources, and the utilization of bioreactors, which can minimize space, energy, and labor needs, can all be replaced to lower production costs. Therefore, these alternative options are recommended as a workaround to the problems and are briefly described in this document.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A retrospective cohort study on effects of antenatal steroids on respiratory morbidity for term elective caesarean sections in South Asian women [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Respiratory distress (RD) is higher among newborns born by caesarean section (CS) compared to vaginal delivery. Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recommend steroid administration for CS prior to 39 weeks. Effectiveness of steroids for neonatal RD at term is inconclusive. The racial differences are yet to be studied. Methods A single center retrospective cohort study was conducted in Colombo, Sri Lanka from December 2016 to February 2019. All mothers delivered by CS between 37+0 and 38+6 weeks were included. Mothers with severe maternal hypertension, fetal rhesus sensitization, intrauterine infection, multiple pregnancies and who received steroids at a prior gestation were excluded. Cohort was subdivided according to administration of intramuscular dexamethasone prior to CS. Primary outcomes measured were RD, admissions to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and special care baby unit (SCBU). Neonatal infections and maternal duration of hospital stay were recorded as secondary outcome measures. Results 560 patients were included. 23.2% of patients received antenatal corticosteroids. Incidence of RD, NICU admissions and SCBU admissions in the study cohort was 10%, 0.9%, and 2.7% respectively. Relative risk for developing RD in the steroid group compared to non-steroid group was 2.67 (95CI 1.64-4.35). 4.6% of the steroid group and 3.3% of the non-steroid group needed to be admitted to the NICU/SCBU (p=0.464). A significantly higher number of babies in the steroid group needed IV antibiotics. The average number of days the mothers were admitted to the hospital was 2.45 days (SD+/- 1.424) for steroid group and 1.4 days (SD+/- 0.856) for the non-steroid group (p < 0.001). Conclusions There is a significant increase in the respiratory morbidity in the dexamethasone administered south Asian mothers at term prior to CS. However, this effect has no clinical significance since the admissions to NICU and SCBU were not significantly different.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">The quest for multiscale brain modeling</a></h4>

              
                Addressing the multiscale organization of the brain, which is fundamental to the dynamic repertoire of the organ, remains challenging. In principle, it should be possible to model neurons and synapses in detail and then connect them into large neuronal assemblies to explain the relationship between microscopic phenomena, large-scale brain functions, and behavior. It is more difficult to infer neuronal functions from ensemble measurements such as those currently obtained with brain activity recordings.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Population-based sequencing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis reveals how current population dynamics are shaped by past epidemics</a></h4>

              
                Transmission is a driver of tuberculosis (TB) epidemics in high-burden regions, with assumed negligible impact in low-burden areas. However, we still lack a full characterization of transmission dynamics in settings with similar and different burdens. Genomic epidemiology can greatly help to quantify transmission, but the lack of whole genome sequencing population-based studies has hampered its application. Here, we generate a population-based dataset from Valencia region and compare it with available datasets from different TB-burden settings to reveal transmission dynamics heterogeneity and its public health implications. We sequenced the whole genome of 785 <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> strains and linked genomes to patient epidemiological data. We use a pairwise distance clustering approach and phylodynamic methods to characterize transmission events over the last 150 years, in different TB-burden regions. Our results underscore significant differences in transmission between low-burden TB settings, i.e., clustering in Valencia region is higher (47.4%) than in Oxfordshire (27%), and similar to a high-burden area as Malawi (49.8%). By modeling times of the transmission links, we observed that settings with high transmission rate are associated with decades of uninterrupted transmission, irrespective of burden. Together, our results reveal that burden and transmission are not necessarily linked due to the role of past epidemics in the ongoing TB incidence, and highlight the need for in-depth characterization of transmission dynamics and specifically tailored TB control strategies.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Lung evolution in vertebrates and the water-to-land transition</a></h4>

              
                A crucial evolutionary change in vertebrate history was the Palaeozoic (Devonian 419–359 million years ago) water-to-land transition, allowed by key morphological and physiological modifications including the acquisition of lungs. Nonetheless, the origin and early evolution of vertebrate lungs remain highly controversial, particularly whether the ancestral state was paired or unpaired. Due to the rarity of fossil soft tissue preservation, lung evolution can only be traced based on the extant phylogenetic bracket. Here we investigate, for the first time, lung morphology in extensive developmental series of key living lunged osteichthyans using synchrotron x-ray microtomography and histology. Our results shed light on the primitive state of vertebrate lungs as unpaired, evolving to be truly paired in the lineage towards the tetrapods. The water-to-land transition confronted profound physiological challenges and paired lungs were decisive for increasing the surface area and the pulmonary compliance and volume, especially during the air-breathing on land.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Type 1 piliated uropathogenic Escherichia coli hijack the host immune response by binding to CD14</a></h4>

              
                A key attribute of persistent or recurring bacterial infections is the ability of the pathogen to evade the host's immune response. Many <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> express type 1 pili, a pre-adapted virulence trait, to invade host epithelial cells and establish persistent infections. However, the molecular mechanisms and strategies by which bacteria actively circumvent the immune response of the host remain poorly understood. Here, we identified CD14, the major co-receptor for lipopolysaccharide detection, on mouse dendritic cells as a binding partner of FimH, the protein located at the tip of the type 1 pilus of <i>Escherichia coli</i>. The FimH amino acids involved in CD14 binding are highly conserved across pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains. Binding of the pathogenic strain CFT073 to CD14 reduced dendritic cell migration by overactivation of integrins and blunted expression of co-stimulatory molecules by overactivating the NFAT pathway, both rate-limiting factors of T cell activation. This response was binary at the single cell level, but averaged in larger populations exposed to both piliated and non-piliated pathogens, presumably via the exchange of immunomodulatory cytokines. While defining an active molecular mechanism of immune evasion by pathogens, the interaction between FimH and CD14 represents a potential target to interfere with persistent and recurrent infections, such as urinary tract infections or Crohn's disease.

                Human and non-human primates produce rhythmical sounds as soon as they are born. These early vocalizations are important for soliciting the attention of caregivers. How they develop, remains a mystery. The orofacial movements necessary for producing these vocalizations have distinct spatiotemporal signatures. Therefore, their development could potentially be tracked over the course of prenatal life. We densely and longitudinally sampled fetal head and orofacial movements in marmoset monkeys using ultrasound imaging. We show that orofacial movements necessary for producing rhythmical vocalizations differentiate from a larger movement pattern that includes the entire head. We also show that signature features of marmoset infant contact calls emerge prenatally as a distinct pattern of orofacial movements. Our results establish that aspects of the sensorimotor development necessary for vocalizing occur prenatally, even before the production of sound.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A scalable and modular automated pipeline for stitching of large electron microscopy datasets</a></h4>

              
                Serial-section electronmicroscopy (ssEM) is themethod of choice for studyingmacroscopic biological samples at extremely high resolution in three dimensions. In the nervous system, nanometer-scale images are necessary to reconstruct dense neural wiring diagrams in the brain, so called connectomes. In order to use this data, consisting of up to 10<sup>8</sup> individual EM images, it must be assembled into a volume, requiring seamless 2D stitching from each physical section followed by 3D alignment of the stitched sections. The high throughput of ssEM necessitates 2D stitching to be done at the pace of imaging, which currently produces tens of terabytes per day. To achieve this, we present a modular volume assembly software pipeline ASAP (Assembly Stitching and Alignment Pipeline) that is scalable to datasets containing petabytes of data and parallelized to work in a distributed computational environment. The pipeline is built on top of the Render (27) services used in the volume assembly of the brain of adult Drosophilamelanogaster (30). It achieves high throughput by operating on themeta-data and transformations of each image stored in a database, thus eliminating the need to render intermediate output. ASAP ismodular, allowing for easy incorporation of new algorithms without significant changes in the workflow. The entire software pipeline includes a complete set of tools for stitching, automated quality control, 3D section alignment, and final rendering of the assembled volume to disk. ASAP has been deployed for continuous stitching of several large-scale datasets of the mouse visual cortex and human brain samples including one cubic millimeter of mouse visual cortex (28; 8) at speeds that exceed imaging. The pipeline also has multi-channel processing capabilities and can be applied to fluorescence and multi-modal datasets like array tomography.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Pneumococcal genetic variability in age-dependent bacterial carriage</a></h4>

              
                The characteristics of pneumococcal carriage vary between infants and adults, with onward implications for transmission rates, and disease control using vaccines. Host immune factors have been shown to contribute to these age-specific differences, but the role of pathogen variation is currently less well-known. Indeed, identification of specific pneumococcal genetic factors associated with carriage in younger or older age groups may suggest alternative vaccine formulations would reduce overall disease. To search for such factors, we used whole genome sequencing to understand how pneumococcal variation is associated with age. We performed genome sequencing in a large carriage cohort, and conducted a meta-analysis with an existing carriage study. We compiled a dictionary of pathogen genetic variation including serotype, sequence cluster, sequence elements, SNPs, burden combined rare variants, and clusters of orthologous genes (COGs) for each cohort - all of which used in a genome-wide association with host age. Age-dependent colonization showed weak evidence for heritability in the first cohort (h2 = 0.10, 0.00 - 0.69 95% CI), and stronger evidence in the second cohort (h2 = 0.56, 0.23 - 0.87 95% CI). We found that serotypes and genetic background (strain) explained a proportion of the heritability in the first cohort (h2<sub>serotype</sub> = 0.07, 0.04 - 0.14 95% CI and h2<sub>GPSC</sub> = 0.06, 0.03 - 0.13 95% CI) and the second cohort (h2<sub>serotype</sub> = 0.11, 0.05 - 0.21 95% CI and h2<sub>GPSC</sub> = 0.20, 0.12 - 0.31 95% CI). In a meta-analysis of these cohorts, we found one candidate association (p = 1.2x10<sup>-9</sup>) upstream of an accessory Sec-dependent serine-rich glycoprotein adhesin. Overall, while we did find an effect of pathogen genome variation on pneumococcal carriage in children versus adult hosts, this was variable between populations and does not appear have a strong relationship with individual genes. This supports proposals for adaptive future vaccination strategies which are primarily targeted at dominant circulating serotypes, and tailored to the composition of the pathogen populations.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mutational robustness changes during long-term adaptation in laboratory budding yeast populations</a></h4>

              
                As an adapting population traverses the fitness landscape, its local neighborhood (i.e., the collection of fitness effects of single-step mutations) can change shape because of interactions with mutations acquired during evolution. These changes to the distribution of fitness effects can affect both the rate of adaptation and the accumulation of deleterious mutations. However, while numerous models of fitness landscapes have been proposed in the literature, empirical data on how this distribution changes during evolution remains limited. In this study, we directly measure how the fitness landscape neighborhood changes during laboratory adaptation. Using a barcode-based mutagenesis system, we measure the fitness effects of 91 specific gene disruption mutations in genetic backgrounds spanning 8,000-10,000 generations of evolution in two constant environments. We find that the mean of the distribution of fitness effects decreases in one environment, indicating a reduction in mutational robustness, but does not change in the other. We show that these distribution-level patterns result from differences in the relative frequency of certain patterns of epistasis at the level of individual mutations, including fitness-correlated and idiosyncratic epistasis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Flagellar energy costs across the tree of life</a></h4>

              
                Flagellar-driven motility grants unicellular organisms the ability to gather more food and avoid predators, but the energetic costs of construction and operation of flagella are considerable. Paths of flagellar evolution depend on the deviations between fitness gains and energy costs. Using structural data available for all three major flagellar types (bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic), flagellar construction costs were determined for <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Pyrococcus furiosus</i>, and <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>. Estimates of cell volumes, flagella numbers, and flagellum lengths from the literature yield flagellar costs for another ~200 species. The benefits of flagellar investment were analysed in terms of swimming speed, nutrient collection, and growth rate; showing, among other things, that the cost-effectiveness of bacterial and eukaryotic flagella follows a common trend. However, a comparison of whole-cell costs and flagellum costs across the Tree of Life reveals that only cells with larger cell volumes than the typical bacterium could evolve the more expensive eukaryotic flagellum. These findings provide insight into the unsolved evolutionary question of why the three domains of life each carry their own type of flagellum.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dopamine neuron morphology and output are differentially controlled by mTORC1 and mTORC2</a></h4>

              
                The mTOR pathway is an essential regulator of cell growth and metabolism. Midbrain dopamine neurons are particularly sensitive to mTOR signaling status as activation or inhibition of mTOR alters their morphology and physiology. mTOR exists in two distinct multiprotein complexes termed mTORC1 and mTORC2. How each of these complexes affect dopamine neuron properties, and whether they have similar or distinct functions is unknown. Here, we investigated this in mice with dopamine neuron-specific deletion of <i>Rptor</i> or <i>Rictor</i>, which encode obligatory components of mTORC1 or mTORC2, respectively. We find that inhibition of mTORC1 strongly and broadly impacts dopamine neuron structure and function causing somatodendritic and axonal hypotrophy, increased intrinsic excitability, decreased dopamine production, and impaired dopamine release. In contrast, inhibition of mTORC2 has more subtle effects, with selective alterations to the output of ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons. Disruption of both mTOR complexes leads to pronounced deficits in dopamine release demonstrating the importance of balanced mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling for dopaminergic function.

                <b>Background:</b> Metabolic syndrome–associated osteoarthritis (MetS-OA) is a distinct osteoarthritis phenotype defined by the coexistence of MetS or its individual components. Despite the high prevalence of MetS-OA, its pathogenic mechanisms are unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the role of cellular senescence in the development of MetS-OA.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Surveying the experience of postdocs in the United States before and during the COVID-19 pandemic</a></h4>

              
                In the interest of advocating for the postdoctoral community in the United States (US), we compared the results of surveys of postdocs carried out in 2019 and in late 2020. We found that respondents’ mental health and wellness were significantly impacted by the pandemic irrespective of their gender, race, citizenship, or other identities. Career trajectories and progression were also affected, as respondents reported being less confident about achieving career goals, and having more negative perceptions of the job market compared to before the pandemic. Postdocs working in the US on temporary visas reported experiencing increased stress levels due to changes in immigration policy. Access to institutional Postdoctoral Offices or Associations positively impacted well-being and helped mitigate some of the personal and professional stresses caused by the pandemic.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Unsuppressed HIV infection impairs T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and abrogates T cell cross-recognition</a></h4>

              
                In some instances, unsuppressed HIV has been associated with severe COVID-19 disease, but the mechanisms underpinning this susceptibility are still unclear. Here, we assessed the impact of HIV infection on the quality and epitope specificity of SARS-CoV-2 T cell responses in the first wave and second wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in South Africa. Flow cytometry was used to measure T cell responses following PBMC stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools. Culture expansion was used to determine T cell immunodominance hierarchies and to assess potential SARS-CoV-2 escape from T cell recognition. HIV-seronegative individuals had significantly greater CD4<sup>+</sup>T cell responses against the Spike protein compared to the viremic PLWH. Absolute CD4 count correlated positively with SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses (CD4 r= 0.5, p=0.03; CD8 r=0.5, p=0.001), whereas T cell activation was negatively correlated with CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses (CD4 r= -0.7, p=0.04). There was diminished T cell cross-recognition between the two waves, which was more pronounced in individuals with unsuppressed HIV infection. Importantly, we identify four mutations in the Beta variant that resulted in abrogation of T cell recognition. Together, we show that unsuppressed HIV infection markedly impairs T cell responses to SARS-Cov-2 infection and diminishes T cell cross-recognition. These findings may partly explain the increased susceptibility of PLWH to severe COVID-19 and also highlights their vulnerability to emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">XAB2 dynamics during DNA damage-dependent transcription inhibition</a></h4>

              
                Xeroderma Pigmentosum group A-binding protein 2 (XAB2) is a multi-functional protein playing a critical role in distinct cellular processes including transcription, splicing, DNA repair and mRNA export. In this study, we demonstrate that XAB2 is involved specifically and exclusively in Transcription-Coupled Nucleotide Excision Repair (TC-NER) reactions and solely for RNA Polymerase 2 transcribed genes. Surprisingly, contrary to all the other NER proteins studied so far, XAB2 does not accumulate on the local UV-C damage; on the contrary, it becomes more mobile after damage induction. XAB2 mobility is restored when DNA repair reactions are completed. By scrutinizing from which cellular complex/partner/structure XAB2 is released, we have identified that XAB2 is detached after DNA damage induction from DNA:RNA hybrids, commonly known as R-loops, and from the CSA and XPG proteins. This release contributes to the DNA damage recognition step during TC-NER, as in the absence of XAB2, RNAP2 is blocked longer on UV lesions. Moreover, we also demonstrate that XAB2 has a role in retaining RNAP2 on its substrate without any DNA damage.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Generation and propagation of network bursts in the basal ganglia exhibit dynamic changes during early postnatal development</a></h4>

              
                The neonatal brain is characterised by intermittent bursts of oscillatory activity interspersed by relative silence. While these bursts of activity are well characterised for many cortical areas much less is known whether and how these propagate and interact with subcortical regions. Here, early network activity was recorded using silicon probes from the developing basal ganglia, including the motor/somatosensory cortex, dorsal striatum and intralaminar thalamus, during the first two postnatal weeks in mice. Using an unsupervised detection and classification method, two main classes of bursting activity were found, consisting of spindle bursts (SB) and nested gamma spindle bursts (NGB), which were characterised by oscillatory activity at respectively ~10 Hz and ~30 Hz. These bursts were reliably identified across all three brain structures but differed in their structural, spectral, and developmental characteristics. Coherence and cross-correlation analyses revealed that burst events often occur synchronously across different brain regions and were mostly of a similar type, especially between cortex and striatum, which also exhibited the strongest interactions as compared to other brain regions. Interestingly, the preferred frequency for these interactions suggested a developmental shift from initial lower frequencies to higher frequencies across development. Together, these results provide the first detailed description of early network activity within the developing basal ganglia and suggests that distinct brain regions drive and coordinate burst activity at different developmental stages.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Microcephaly-associated WDR62 mutations hamper Golgi apparatus-to-spindle pole shuttling in human neural progenitors</a></h4>

              
                WDR62 is a spindle pole-associated scaffold protein with pleiotropic functions during corticogenesis. Recessive mutations in WDR62 are associated with structural brain abnormalities and account for the second most common cause of autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH), indicating WDR62 as a critical hub for human brain development. Here, we investigated a C-terminal truncating mutation (D955AfsX112) in WDR62 using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) obtained from a patient with MCPH2. We generated neuroepithelial stem (NES) cells and cerebro-cortical progenitors and neurons from patient-derived and isogenic retro-mutated iPSC lines. We found that WDR62 dysfunction resulted in impaired cell cycle progression and alterations of the neurogenic trajectories of iPSC neuroderivatives. Moreover, we report WDR62 localization at the Golgi apparatus during interphase, both in human neural progenitors in vitro and in human fetal brain tissue. WDR62 shuttling from the Golgi apparatus to spindle poles is dynamic and microtubule-dependent. Impairment of WDR62 function and localization results in severe neurodevelopmental abnormalities, thus delineating new mechanisms in MCPH etiology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Trophoblast glycoprotein is required for efficient synaptic vesicle exocytosis from retinal rod bipolar cells.</a></h4>

              
                Rod bipolar cells (RBCs) faithfully transmit light-driven signals from rod photoreceptors in the outer retina to third order neurons in the inner retina. Recently, significant work has focused on the role of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins in synaptic development and signal transduction at RBC synapses. We previously identified trophoblast glycoprotein (TPBG) as a novel transmembrane LRR protein localized to the dendrites and axon terminals of RBCs. We now examine the effects on RBC physiology and retinal processing of TPBG genetic deletion in mice using immunofluorescence and electrophysiological techniques. The scotopic electroretinogram showed a modest increase in the b-wave and a marked attenuation in oscillatory potentials in the TPBG knockout. No effect of TPBG deletion was observed on RBC morphology, the localization of RBC signal transduction proteins, TRPM1 currents, or RBC excitability. Because scotopic oscillatory potentials primarily reflect RBC-driven rhythmic activity of the inner retina, we investigated the contribution of TPBG to downstream transmission from RBCs to third-order neurons. Time-resolved capacitance measurements indicated that TPBG deletion reduces synaptic vesicle exocytosis and subsequent GABAergic reciprocal feedback without altering voltage-gated Ca2+ currents. Thus, TPBG is required for efficient neurotransmitter release from RBCs to downstream cells. Our results highlight a novel synaptic role for TPBG at RBC ribbon synapses and support further examination into the mechanisms by which TPBG regulates RBC physiology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural tracking of speech does not unequivocally reflect intelligibility</a></h4>

              
                During listening, brain activity tracks the rhythmic structures of speech signals. Here, we directly dissociated the contribution of neural tracking in the processing of speech acoustic cues from that related to linguistic processing. We examined the neural changes associated with the comprehension of Noise-Vocoded (NV) speech using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Participants listened to NV sentences in a 3-phase training paradigm: (1) pre-training, where NV stimuli were barely comprehended, (2) training with exposure of the original clear version of speech stimulus, and (3) post-training, where the same stimuli gained intelligibility from the training phase. Using this paradigm, we tested if the neural responses of a speech signal was modulated by its intelligibility without any change in its acoustic structure. To test the influence of spectral degradation on neural tracking independently of training, participants listened to two types of NV sentences (4-band and 2-band NV speech), but were only trained to understand 4-band NV speech. Significant changes in neural tracking were observed in the delta range in relation to the acoustic degradation of speech. However, we failed to find a direct effect of intelligibility on the neural tracking of speech in both theta and delta ranges. This suggests that acoustics greatly influence the neural tracking response to speech signals, and that caution needs to be taken when choosing the control signals for speech-brain tracking analyses, considering that a slight change in acoustic parameters can have strong effects on the neural tracking response.

	<p>Objective: The aim of this study was the verification of the Subdural Hematoma in the Elderly (SHE) score proposed by Alford et al. as a mortality predictor in patients older than 65 years with nontraumatic/minor trauma acute subdural hematoma (aSDH). Additionally, we evaluated further predictors associated with poor outcome. Methods: Patients were scored according to age (1 point is given if patients were older than 80 years), GCS by admission (1 point for GCS 5&amp;amp;ndash;12, 2 points for GCS 3&amp;amp;ndash;4), and SDH volume (1 point for volume 50 mL). The sum of points determines the SHE score. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify additional independent risk factors associated with 30-day mortality. Results: We evaluated 131 patients with aSDH who were treated at our institution between 2008 and 2020. We observed the same 30-day mortality rates published by Alford et al.: SHE 0: 4.3% vs. 3.2%, p = 1.0; SHE 1: 12.2% vs. 13.1%, p = 1.0; SHE 2: 36.6% vs. 32.7%, p = 0.8; SHE 3: 97.1% vs. 95.7%, p = 1.0 and SHE 4: 100% vs. 100%, p = 1.0. Additionally, 18 patients who developed status epilepticus (SE) had a mortality of 100 percent regardless of the SHE score. The distribution of SE among the groups was: 1 for SHE 1, 6 for SHE 2, 9 for SHE 3, and 2 for SHE 4. The logistic regression showed the surgical evacuation to be the only significant risk factor for developing the seizure. All patients who developed SE underwent surgery (p = 0.0065). Furthermore, SHE 3 and 4 showed no difference regarding the outcome between surgical and conservative treatment. Conclusions: SHE score is a reliable mortality predictor for minor trauma acute subdural hematoma in elderly patients. In addition, we identified status epilepticus as a strong life-expectancy-limiting factor in patients undergoing surgical evacuation.</p>

	<p>Background: Intrasaccular flow disruptors (IFD) have been introduced in the treatment of intracranial aneurysms (IAs) to overcome the low aneurysm occlusion rate and the high recanalization rate of the coiling technique. Among them, the Contour Neurovascular System (CNS) and the Neqstent (NQS) were designed to reconstruct the aneurysmal neck and both can be used as assisting coiling devices. We aimed to report our preliminary experience with the flow disruptor-assisted coiling (IFD-AC) technique. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of all patients with IAs treated with the IFD-AC. Results: Between February 2021 and April 2022, we treated 15 IAs with the IFD-AC: 10 ruptured and 5 unruptured. The IFD-AC was successfully performed in 13 cases, with a post-operative RROC 1 in 12 cases (92.3%) and RROC 2 in 1 case (7.7%). There was one ischemic event (6.7%) and no hemorrhagic complications. Twelve patients underwent a mid-term radiologic follow-up: Ten IAs (83.4%) presented an adequate occlusion, while 2 (16.7%) had a recurrence. Conclusions: The IFD-AC, both with the CNS and the NQS, seems a safe technique with promising efficacy profile. The IFD-AC has proved to be safe without antiplatelet therapy in ruptured cases. Further studies are needed to confirm our preliminary results.</p>

	<p>Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is considered an intermediate state between normal aging and early dementia. Fear of falling (FOF) could be considered a risk indicator for falls and quality of life in individuals with MCI. Our objective was to explore factors associated with FOF in those with MCI due to Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD-MCI) and mild cognitive impairment in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD-MCI). Seventy-one participants were separated into two groups, AD-MCI (n = 37) and PD-MCI (n = 34), based on the disease diagnosis. FOF was assessed using the Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale. The neuropsychological assessment and gait assessment were also measured. FOF was significantly correlated with global cognitive function, attention and working memory, executive function, Tinetti assessment scale scores, gait speed, and stride length in the AD-MCI group. Moreover, attention and working memory were the most important factors contributing to FOF. In the PD-MCI group, FOF was significantly correlated with gait speed, and time up and go subtask performance. Furthermore, turn-to-walk was the most important factor contributing to FOF. We noted that FOF in different types of MCI was determined by different factors. Therapies that aim to lower FOF in AD-MCI and PD-MCI populations may address attention and working memory and turn-to-walk, respectively.</p>

	<p>Background: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and deadly brain tumor. The clinical significance of necroptosis (NCPS) genes in GBM is unclear. The goal of this study is to reveal the potential prognostic NCPS genes associated with GBM, elucidate their functions, and establish an effective prognostic model for GBM patients. Methods: Firstly, the NCPS genes in GBM were identified by single-cell analysis of the GSE182109 dataset in the GEO database and weighted co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. Three machine learning algorithms (Lasso, SVM-RFE, Boruta) combined with COX regression were used to build prognostic models. The subsequent analysis included survival, immune microenvironments, and mutations. Finally, the clinical significance of NCPS in GBM was explored by constructing nomograms. Results: We constructed a GBM prognostic model composed of NCPS-related genes, including CTSD, AP1S1, YWHAG, and IER3, which were validated to have good performance. According to the above prognostic model, GBM patients in the TCGA and CGGA groups could be divided into two groups according to NCPS, with significant differences in survival analysis between the two groups and a markedly worse prognostic status in the high NCPS group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). In addition, the high NCPS group had higher levels of immune checkpoint-related gene expression, suggesting that they may be more likely to benefit from immunotherapy. Conclusions: Four genes (CTSD, AP1S1, YWHAG, and IER3) were screened through three machine learning algorithms to construct a prognostic model for GBM. These key and novel diagnostic markers may become new targets for diagnosing and treating patients with GBM.</p>

	<p>Background: Emergence delirium (ED) occurs immediately after emergence from general anesthesia, which may have adverse consequences. This cross-sectional survey assessed Chinese physicians&amp;amp;rsquo; and nurses&amp;amp;rsquo; knowledge of, attitudes towards, and practice regarding ED in adults. Methods: Electronic questionnaires were sent to 93 major academic hospitals across mainland China and both attending anesthesiologists and anesthesia nurses were recommended to complete them. Results: A total of 243 anesthesiologists and 213 anesthesia nurses participated in the survey. Most of the participants considered it a very important issue; however, less than one-third of them routinely assessed ED. In terms of screening tools, anesthesiologists preferred the Confusion Assessment Method, while anesthesia nurses reported using multiple screening tools. Divergence also appeared with regard to the necessity of monitoring the depth of anesthesia. Anesthesiologists considered it only necessary in high-risk patients, while the nurses considered that it should be carried out routinely. No unified treatment strategy nor medication was reported for ED treatment during the recovery period. Conclusions: This study illustrated that there are high awareness levels among both Chinese anesthesiologists and anesthesia nurses regarding the importance of ED. However, a specific practice in terms of routine delirium assessment, anesthesia depth monitoring, and a standardized treatment algorithm needs to be implemented to improve ED management.</p>

	<p>Background: High-dose ionizing radiation (IR) (&amp;amp;gt;0.5 Gy) is an established risk factor for cognitive impairments, but this cannot be concluded for low-to-moderate IR exposure (&amp;amp;lt;0.5 Gy) in adulthood as study results are inconsistent. The objectives are to summarize relevant epidemiological studies of low-to-moderate IR exposure in adulthood and to assess the risk of non-cancerous CNS diseases. Methods: A systematic literature search of four electronic databases was performed to retrieve relevant epidemiological studies published from 2000 to 2022. Pooled standardized mortality ratios, relative risks, and excess relative risks (ERR) were estimated with a random effect model. Results: Forty-five publications were included in the systematic review, including thirty-three in the quantitative meta-analysis. The following sources of IR-exposure were considered: atomic bomb, occupational, environmental, and medical exposure. Increased dose-risk relationships were found for cerebrovascular diseases incidence and mortality (ERRpooled per 100 mGy = 0.04; 95% CI: 0.03&amp;amp;ndash;0.05; ERRpooled at 100 mGy = 0.01; 95% CI: &amp;amp;minus;0.00&amp;amp;ndash;0.02, respectively) and for Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (ERRpooled at 100 mGy = 0.11; 95% CI: 0.06&amp;amp;ndash;0.16); Conclusions: Our findings suggest that adult low-to-moderate IR exposure may have effects on non-cancerous CNS diseases. Further research addressing inherent variation issues is encouraged.</p>

	<p>Electroencephalography (EEG) is recorded by electrodes from different areas of the brain and is commonly used to measure neuronal activity. EEG-based methods have been widely used for emotion recognition recently. However, most current methods for EEG-based emotion recognition do not fully exploit the relationship of EEG channels, which affects the precision of emotion recognition. To address the issue, in this paper, we propose a novel method for EEG-based emotion recognition called CR-GCN: Channel-Relationships-based Graph Convolutional Network. Specifically, topological structure of EEG channels is distance-based and tends to capture local relationships, and brain functional connectivity tends to capture global relationships among EEG channels. Therefore, in this paper, we construct EEG channel relationships using an adjacency matrix in graph convolutional network where the adjacency matrix captures both local and global relationships among different EEG channels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CR-GCN method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. In subject-dependent experiments, the average classification accuracies of 94.69% and 93.95% are achieved for valence and arousal. In subject-independent experiments, the average classification accuracies of 94.78% and 93.46% are obtained for valence and arousal.</p>

	<p>Introduction: The melanoma-associated antigen D2 (MAGED2) is one of the melanoma-associated antigen family members. It is commonly overexpressed in a variety of malignancies. However, the mechanism and function of MAGED2 in glioma remain unknown. Methods: The MAGED2 expression level and the correlations between clinical characteristics were analyzed with the data from the CGGA and TCGA datasets. MAGED2 expression in 98 glioma tissues was measured using RT-qPCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry. CCK-8, colony formation, and EdU assays were used to assess the effect of MAGED2 on U251-MG cell proliferation. Flow cytometry was used to track changes in the cell cycle and cell apoptosis following plasmid transfection with CRISPRi. Results: MAGED2 was shown to be highly expressed in glioma tissues, and high MAGED2 expression predicted poor prognosis. Furthermore, MAGED2 knockdown significantly inhibited the proliferation of U251-MG cells by preventing cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase and triggering apoptosis. In line with in vitro findings, the results of the xenograft experiment and immunohistochemistry also showed that MAGED2 suppression inhibited tumor development and decreased Ki-67 expression levels. Conclusions: MAGED2 may be a possible biomarker for glioma and an important prognostic factor for glioma patients.</p>

	<p>Drugs of abuse cause enduring functional disorders in the brain reward circuits, leading to cravings and compulsive behavior. Although people may rehabilitate by detoxification, there is a high risk of relapse. Therefore, it is crucial to illuminate the mechanisms of relapse and explore the therapeutic strategies for prevention. In this research, by using an animal model of morphine self-administration in rats and a whole-cell patch&amp;amp;ndash;clamp in brain slices, we found changes in synaptic plasticity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell were involved in the relapse to morphine-seeking behavior. Compared to the controls, the amplitude of long-term depression (LTD) induced in the medium spiny neurons increased after morphine self-administration was established, recovered after the behavior was extinguished, and increased again during the relapse induced by morphine priming. Intravenous injection of MA, a new peptide obtained by modifying Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) inhibitor &amp;amp;ldquo;myr-AIP&amp;amp;rdquo;, decreased CaMKII activity in the NAc shell and blocked the reinstatement of morphine-seeking behavior without influence on the locomotor activity. Moreover, LTD was absent in the NAc shell of the MA-pretreated rats, whereas it was robust in the saline controls in which morphine-seeking behavior was reinstated. These results indicate that CaMKII regulates morphine-seeking behavior through its involvement in the change of synaptic plasticity in the NAc shell during the relapse, and MA may be of great value in the clinical treatment of relapse to opioid seeking.</p>

	<p>Neurological disorders often cause severe long-term disabilities with substantial activity limitations and participation restrictions such as community integration, family functioning, employment, social interaction and participation. Increasing understanding of brain functioning has opened new perspectives for more integrative interventions, boosting the intrinsic central nervous system neuroplastic capabilities in order to achieve efficient behavioral restitution. Neurorehabilitation must take into account the many aspects of the individual through a comprehensive analysis of actual and potential cognitive, behavioral, emotional and physical skills, while increasing awareness and understanding of the new self of the person being dealt with. The exclusive adoption by the rehabilitator of objective functional measures often overlooks the values and goals of the disabled person. Indeed, each individual has their own rhythm, unique life history and personality construct. In this challenging context, it is essential to deepen the assessment through subjective measures, which more adequately reflect the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s perspective in order to shape genuinely tailored instead of standardized neurorehabilitation approaches. In this overly complex panorama, where confounding and prognostic factors also strongly influence potential functional recovery, the healthcare community needs to rethink neurorehabilitation formats.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Elevated plasma phosphorylated tau 181 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau<sub>181</sub>) is reliably elevated in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but less explored is its specificity relative to other neurodegenerative conditions. Here we find novel evidence that plasma p-tau<sub>181</sub> is elevated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative condition typically lacking tau pathology. We performed a detailed evaluation to identify the clinical correlates of elevated p-tau<sub>181</sub> in ALS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients were clinically or pathologically diagnosed with ALS (n=130) or AD (n=79), or were healthy non-impaired controls (n=26). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were analyzed and area under the curve (AUC) was used to discriminate AD from ALS. Within ALS, Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon tests compared analytes by presence/absence of upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs. Spearman correlations tested associations between plasma p-tau<sub>181</sub> and postmortem neuron loss.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A Wilcoxon test showed plasma p-tau<sub>181</sub> was higher in ALS than controls (W=2600, <i>p</i>=0.000015), and ROC analyses showed plasma p-tau<sub>181</sub> poorly discriminated AD and ALS (AUC=0.60). In ALS, elevated plasma p-tau<sub>181</sub> was associated with LMN signs in cervical (W=827, <i>p</i>=0.0072), thoracic (W=469, <i>p</i>=0.00025), and lumbosacral regions (W=851, <i>p</i>=0.0000029). In support of LMN findings, plasma p-tau<sub>181</sub> was associated with neuron loss in the spinal cord (rho=0.46, <i>p</i>=0.017), but not in the motor cortex (<i>p</i>=0.41). CSF p-tau<sub>181</sub> and plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) were included as reference analytes, and demonstrate specificity of findings.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We found strong evidence that plasma p-tau<sub>181</sub> is elevated in ALS and may be a novel marker specific to LMN dysfunction.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Inter-Animal Variability in Activity Phase Is Constrained by Synaptic Dynamics in an Oscillatory Network</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The levels of voltage-gated and synaptic currents in the same neuron type can vary substantially across individuals. Yet, the phase relationships between neurons in oscillatory circuits are often maintained, even in the face of varying oscillation frequencies. We examined whether synaptic and intrinsic currents are matched to maintain constant activity phases across preparations, using the lateral pyloric (LP) neuron of the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of the crab, <I>Cancer borealis</I>. LP produces stable oscillatory bursts on release from inhibition, with an onset phase that is independent of oscillation frequency. We quantified the parameters that define the shape of the synaptic current inputs across preparations and found no linear correlations with voltage-gated currents. However, several synaptic parameters were correlated with oscillation period and burst onset phase, suggesting they may play a role in phase maintenance. We used dynamic clamp to apply artificial synaptic inputs and found that those synaptic parameters correlated with phase and period were ineffective in influencing burst onset. Instead, parameters that showed the least variability across preparations had the greatest influence. Thus, parameters that influence circuit phasing are constrained across individuals, while those that have little effect simply co-vary with phase and frequency.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Extrahippocampal Seizure and Memory Circuits Overlap</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Seizures cause retrograde amnesia. We have previously demonstrated that seizures erode recently formed memories through shared ensembles and mechanisms in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Here, we tested whether seizure circuits overlap spatial memory circuits outside of the CA. Spatial memory is consolidated by the hippocampal-cortical coupling that are connected via multiple pathways. We tested whether a seizure invades structures involved in memory consolidation by using the activity reporter TRAP2 mice. T-maze alternation learning activated neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG), mediodorsal thalamus (MD), retrosplenial cortex (RSC), and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). This spatial memory relies on the plasticity of the AMPA receptor GluA1 subunit. GluA1 knock-out (KO)/TRAP2 mice did not learn to alternate, and structures interposed between the hippocampus and the cortex were not active. A seizure prevented the recall of alternation memory and activated memory-labeled structures. There was a widespread overlap between learning-activated ensembles and seizure-activated neurons, which likely contributes to retrograde amnesia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Coagulase-negative staphylococci as an evolving mastitis causing organism in cows: A review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The present review attempts to address the emergence of a fast-growing mastitis causing pathogen – coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) – and its multi-facet roles in dairy farms. CNS is divided into numerous species, but only a few succeed in bovine mastitis. The two predominant CNS species causing mastitis are Staphylococcus chromogenes and Staphylococcus simulans. These two mostly known CNS affects dairy cows at varied parities and at different lactation stages. CNS have been judged to be the most common bovine mastitis isolate in several countries of the world. However, CNS may not likely be as pathogenic as the other primary mastitis pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and its infection mostly remains subclinical. Conversely, CNS is capable of triggering persistent infections among dairy herds, resulting in reduced milk quality and high milk somatic cell count (SCC). One negative impact of CNS infection in dairy herds is that it can destroy cow udder tissue, hereby leading to a drop in milk production of dairy cows. CNS mastitis has a high cure rate when treated with anti-biotics as their infection in cows are not known to be a therapeutic problem. Judging from several literatures, it cannot be said whether CNS species act as an ecological or contagious pathogens. Regulator procedures, including pre- and post-milking teat disinfection, may reduce contagious mastitis pathogens of CNS infections in the dairy herd. Phenotypic methods for identification of CNS are not adequately dependable, and molecular techniques of identification may be better substitute for identification. Dairy farmers may benefit greatly from more empirical research on the epidemiology of CNS mastitis and more reliable methods for species identification.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Low back pain and associated risk factors among medical students in Bangladesh: a cross-sectional study [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Low back pain (LBP) is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. Different studies showed the high prevalence of LBP among medical students. However, no study has been conducted on Bangladeshi medical students to estimate the prevalence of LBP. This study determined the prevalence, characteristics, and associated risk factors of LBP among medical students in Bangladesh. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from October to December 2020 among randomly selected 270 medical students and medical interns in Faridpur Medical College, Bangladesh, using an online questionnaire. In data analysis, chi-square test and binary logistic regression were performed, and a p-value of < 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. Results: A total of 207 participants responded fully to the survey, and were included in the analysis. The mean age of the participants was 22.4 ± 1.9 years. The point, 6-month, and 12-month prevalence of LBP was 25.6%, 46.9%, and 63.3%, respectively. In most participants, LBP was localized (53.2%), recurrent (64.9%), non-specific (70.8%), affected for a short period (55%), and relieved without receiving any treatment (60.4%). Participants who had a significantly higher 12-month prevalence of LBP included females (72.2% vs 52.2%), with BMI >25 kg/m2 (73.2% vs 56.7%), those who performed physical activity at low to moderate frequency (72.4% vs 29.5%), those who spent > 6 hours/day by sitting (71.3% vs 45.3%), and those who did not have enough rest time (92.7% vs 56%). Ergonomic features of chairs, such as having back support, adjustable back support, and adjustable sitting surface, significantly (p < 0.05) influenced the outcomes. Conclusion: The prevalence of LBP among medical students in Bangladesh was high, and most of the risk factors associated with the high prevalence of LBP were modifiable. Hence, LBP can be prevented by implementing preventive strategies and providing ergonomic training and physical activity facilities.

                Cardiac metastases are rare. Herein, we report a case of a 37-year-old female patient with a history of borderline breast phyllodes tumor (PT) treated by surgery, admitted to our department for concomitant cardiac and pulmonary metastases of malignant PT. Cardiac metastasis occurred through direct extension from pulmonary metastasis to the left atrium via the right inferior pulmonary vein, causing severe mitral valve obstruction. Although the total surgical removal of metastases, the patient had a huge relapse of the mediastinal metastasis resulting in her death.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effectiveness and safety profile of mesenchymal stem cell secretome as a treatment for severe cases of COVID-19: a randomized controlled trial [version 2; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are known to have immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and angiogenesis effects that are useful for relieving inflammation, recovery, and protection of lung tissues in COVID-19 patients. Secretome, a secretory product of MSCs, has several advantages over MSCs. We conducted a study to investigate secretomes’ effectiveness and safety profile as a treatment for severe COVID-19.  Methods: A double-blind, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted between February 2021 and July 2021 in three top COVID-19 referral hospitals in the Greater Jakarta area, Indonesia. Eligible subjects (n=40) were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to an intervention group (n=20) and a control group (n=20). The primary outcome of this study was the changes in inflammatory markers and the ratio of inflammatory to anti-inflammatory markers. The secondary outcomes of this study included clinical outcome, laboratory outcome, radiological outcome, RT-PCR result conversion, and safety profile of MSC secretome. Results: Our analysis showed that on the 14th day after placebo administration, IL-6 level in the control group was significantly increased [4.110 (2.403–12.820) at baseline to 13.320 (2.958–33.285) on the 14th day after intervention, p=0.017]. The IL-6/IL-10 ratio in the control group was significantly increased (p=0.036) on the 14th day after placebo administration. We also found that most of the subjects who received placebo had high levels of IL-6 and ferritin (p=0.043) on the seventh day after the intervention. However, we found no significant differences in inflammatory marker levels on the seventh day and 14th day after intervention between both groups. There was no adverse event reported. There were no significant differences in the laboratory outcome, radiology outcome, RT-PCR result conversion, and safety profiles between both groups. Conclusions: MSC secretome can control inflammation in patients with severe COVID-19 and has a good safety profile. MSC secretome is a promising treatment modality for severe COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Examining the impact of ICU population interaction structure on modeled colonization dynamics of Staphylococcus aureus</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Matthew S. Mietchen, Christopher T. Short, Matthew Samore, Eric T. Lofgren, CDC Modeling Infectious Diseases in Healthcare Program (MInD-Healthcare) </p>
Background <p>Complex transmission models of healthcare-associated infections provide insight for hospital epidemiology and infection control efforts, but they are difficult to implement and come at high computational costs. Structuring more simplified models to incorporate the heterogeneity of the intensive care unit (ICU) patient-provider interactions, we explore how methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) dynamics and acquisitions may be better represented and approximated.</p> Methods <p>Using a stochastic compartmental model of an 18-bed ICU, we compared the rates of MRSA acquisition across three ICU population interaction structures: a model with nurses and physicians as a single staff type (SST), a model with separate staff types for nurses and physicians (Nurse-MD model), and a Metapopulation model where each nurse was assigned a group of patients. The proportion of time spent with the assigned patient group (γ) within the Metapopulation model was also varied.</p> Results <p>The SST, Nurse-MD, and Metapopulation models had a mean of 40.6, 32.2 and 19.6 annual MRSA acquisitions respectively. All models were sensitive to the same parameters in the same direction, although the Metapopulation model was less sensitive. The number of acquisitions varied non-linearly by values of γ, with values below 0.40 resembling the Nurse-MD model, while values above that converged toward the Metapopulation structure.</p> Discussion <p>Inclusion of complex population interactions within a modeled hospital ICU has considerable impact on model results, with the SST model having more than double the acquisition rate of the more structured metapopulation model. While the direction of parameter sensitivity remained the same, the magnitude of these differences varied, producing different colonization rates across relatively similar populations. The non-linearity of the model’s response to differing values of a parameter gamma (γ) suggests simple model approximations are appropriate in only a narrow space of relatively dispersed nursing assignments.</p> Conclusion <p>Simplifying assumptions around how a hospital population is modeled, especially assuming random mixing, may overestimate infection rates and the impact of interventions. In many, if not most, cases more complex models that represent population mixing with higher granularity are justified.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The dopamine circuit as a reward-taxis navigation system</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Omer Karin, Uri Alon</p>

Studying the brain circuits that control behavior is challenging, since in addition to their structural complexity there are continuous feedback interactions between actions and sensed inputs from the environment. It is therefore important to identify mathematical principles that can be used to develop testable hypotheses. In this study, we use ideas and concepts from systems biology to study the dopamine system, which controls learning, motivation, and movement. Using data from neuronal recordings in behavioral experiments, we developed a mathematical model for dopamine responses and the effect of dopamine on movement. We show that the dopamine system shares core functional analogies with bacterial chemotaxis. Just as chemotaxis robustly climbs chemical attractant gradients, the dopamine circuit performs ‘reward-taxis’ where the attractant is the expected value of reward. The reward-taxis mechanism provides a simple explanation for scale-invariant dopaminergic responses and for matching in free operant settings, and makes testable quantitative predictions. We propose that reward-taxis is a simple and robust navigation strategy that complements other, more goal-directed navigation mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The computational relationship between reinforcement learning, social inference, and paranoia</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Joseph M. Barnby, Mitul A. Mehta, Michael Moutoussis</p>

Theoretical accounts suggest heightened uncertainty about the state of the world underpin aberrant belief updates, which in turn increase the risk of developing a persecutory delusion. However, this raises the question as to how an agent’s uncertainty may relate to the precise phenomenology of paranoia, as opposed to other qualitatively different forms of belief. We tested whether the same population (n = 693) responded similarly to non-social and social contingency changes in a probabilistic reversal learning task and a modified repeated reversal Dictator game, and the impact of paranoia on both. We fitted computational models that included closely related parameters that quantified the rigidity across contingency reversals and the uncertainty about the environment/partner. Consistent with prior work we show that paranoia was associated with uncertainty around a partner’s behavioural policy and rigidity in harmful intent attributions in the social task. In the non-social task we found that pre-existing paranoia was associated with larger decision temperatures and commitment to suboptimal cards. We show relationships between decision temperature in the non-social task and priors over harmful intent attributions and uncertainty over beliefs about partners in the social task. Our results converge across both classes of model, suggesting paranoia is associated with a general uncertainty over the state of the world (and agents within it) that takes longer to resolve, although we demonstrate that this uncertainty is expressed asymmetrically in social contexts. Our model and data allow the representation of sociocognitive mechanisms that explain persecutory delusions and provide testable, phenomenologically relevant predictions for causal experiments.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Chemophoresis engine: A general mechanism of ATPase-driven cargo transport</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Takeshi Sugawara, Kunihiko Kaneko</p>

Cell polarity regulates the orientation of the cytoskeleton members that directs intracellular transport for cargo-like organelles, using chemical gradients sustained by ATP or GTP hydrolysis. However, how cargo transports are directly mediated by chemical gradients remains unknown. We previously proposed a physical mechanism that enables directed movement of cargos, referred to as chemophoresis. According to the mechanism, a cargo with reaction sites is subjected to a chemophoresis force in the direction of the increased concentration. Based on this, we introduce an extended model, the <i>chemophoresis engine</i>, as a general mechanism of cargo motion, which transforms chemical free energy into directed motion through the catalytic ATP hydrolysis. We applied the engine to plasmid motion in a ParABS system to demonstrate the self-organization system for directed plasmid movement and pattern dynamics of ParA-ATP concentration, thereby explaining plasmid equi-positioning and pole-to-pole oscillation observed in bacterial cells and <i>in vitro</i> experiments. We mathematically show the existence and stability of the plasmid-surfing pattern, which allows the cargo-directed motion through the symmetry-breaking transition of the ParA-ATP spatiotemporal pattern. We also quantitatively demonstrate that the chemophoresis engine can work even under <i>in vivo</i> conditions. Finally, we discuss the chemophoresis engine as one of the general mechanisms of hydrolysis-driven intracellular transport.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A model for the intrinsic limit of cancer therapy: Duality of treatment-induced cell death and treatment-induced stemness</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Erin Angelini, Yue Wang, Joseph Xu Zhou, Hong Qian, Sui Huang</p>

Intratumor cellular heterogeneity and non-genetic cell plasticity in tumors pose a recently recognized challenge to cancer treatment. Because of the dispersion of initial cell states within a clonal tumor cell population, a perturbation imparted by a cytocidal drug only kills a fraction of cells. Due to dynamic instability of cellular states the cells not killed are pushed by the treatment into a variety of functional states, including a “stem-like state” that confers resistance to treatment and regenerative capacity. This immanent stress-induced stemness competes against cell death in response to the same perturbation and may explain the near-inevitable recurrence after any treatment. This double-edged-sword mechanism of treatment complements the selection of preexisting resistant cells in explaining post-treatment progression. Unlike selection, the induction of a resistant state has not been systematically analyzed as an immanent cause of relapse. Here, we present a generic elementary model and analytical examination of this intrinsic limitation to therapy. We show how the relative proclivity towards cell death versus transition into a stem-like state, as a function of drug dose, establishes either a window of opportunity for containing tumors or the inevitability of progression following therapy. The model considers measurable cell behaviors independent of specific molecular pathways and provides a new theoretical framework for optimizing therapy dosing and scheduling as cancer treatment paradigms move from “maximal tolerated dose,” which may promote therapy induced-stemness, to repeated “minimally effective doses” (as in adaptive therapies), which contain the tumor and avoid therapy-induced progression.

Graphia is an open-source platform created for the graph-based analysis of the huge amounts of quantitative and qualitative data currently being generated from the study of genomes, genes, proteins metabolites and cells. Core to Graphia’s functionality is support for the calculation of correlation matrices from any tabular matrix of continuous or discrete values, whereupon the software is designed to rapidly visualise the often very large graphs that result in 2D or 3D space. Following graph construction, an extensive range of measurement algorithms, routines for graph transformation, and options for the visualisation of node and edge attributes are available, for graph exploration and analysis. Combined, these provide a powerful solution for the interpretation of high-dimensional data from many sources, or data already in the form of a network or equivalent adjacency matrix. Several use cases of Graphia are described, to showcase its wide range of applications in the analysis biological data. Graphia runs on all major desktop operating systems, is extensible through the deployment of plugins and is freely available to download from https://graphia.app/.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Estimating the transfer rates of bacterial plasmids with an adapted Luria–Delbrück fluctuation analysis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Olivia Kosterlitz, Adamaris Muñiz Tirado, Claire Wate, Clint Elg, Ivana Bozic, Eva M. Top, Benjamin Kerr</p>

To increase our basic understanding of the ecology and evolution of conjugative plasmids, we need reliable estimates of their rate of transfer between bacterial cells. Current assays to measure transfer rate are based on deterministic modeling frameworks. However, some cell numbers in these assays can be very small, making estimates that rely on these numbers prone to noise. Here, we take a different approach to estimate plasmid transfer rate, which explicitly embraces this noise. Inspired by the classic fluctuation analysis of Luria and Delbrück, our method is grounded in a stochastic modeling framework. In addition to capturing the random nature of plasmid conjugation, our new methodology, the Luria–Delbrück method (“LDM”), can be used on a diverse set of bacterial systems, including cases for which current approaches are inaccurate. A notable example involves plasmid transfer between different strains or species where the rate that one type of cell donates the plasmid is not equal to the rate at which the other cell type donates. Asymmetry in these rates has the potential to bias or constrain current transfer estimates, thereby limiting our capabilities for estimating transfer in microbial communities. In contrast, the LDM overcomes obstacles of traditional methods by avoiding restrictive assumptions about growth and transfer rates for each population within the assay. Using stochastic simulations and experiments, we show that the LDM has high accuracy and precision for estimation of transfer rates compared to the most widely used methods, which can produce estimates that differ from the LDM estimate by orders of magnitude.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">LiCl-induced sickness modulates rat gustatory cortical responses</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Bradly T. Stone, Jian-You Lin, Abuzar Mahmood, Alden J. Sanford, Donald B. Katz</p>

Gustatory cortex (GC), a structure deeply involved in the making of consumption decisions, presumably performs this function by integrating information about taste, experiences, and internal states related to the animal’s health, such as illness. Here, we investigated this assertion, examining whether illness is represented in GC activity, and how this representation impacts taste responses and behavior. We recorded GC single-neuron activity and local field potentials (LFPs) from healthy rats and rats made ill (via LiCl injection). We show (consistent with the extant literature) that the onset of illness-related behaviors arises contemporaneously with alterations in 7 to 12 Hz LFP power at approximately 12 min following injection. This process was accompanied by reductions in single-neuron taste response magnitudes and discriminability, and with enhancements in palatability-relatedness—a result reflecting the collapse of responses toward a simple “good-bad” code visible in the entire sample, but focused on a specific subset of GC neurons. Overall, our data show that a state (illness) that profoundly reduces consumption changes basic properties of the sensory cortical response to tastes, in a manner that can easily explain illness’ impact on consumption.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to evaluate functional and safety outcomes for endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) versus medical management (MM) in patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO) and mild neurological deficits, stratified by perfusion imaging mismatch.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The pooled cohort consisted of patients with National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) &lt; 6 and internal carotid artery (ICA), M1, or M2 occlusions from the Extending the Time for Thrombolysis in Emergecy Neurological Deficits - Intra-Arterial (EXTEND-IA) Trial,  Tenecteplase vs Alteplase before Endovascular Thrombectomy in Ischemic Stroke (EXTEND-IA TNK) trials Part I/II and prospective data from 15 EVT centers from October 2010 to April 2020. RAPID software estimated ischemic core and mismatch. Patients receiving primary EVT (EVT<sub>pri</sub>) were compared to those who received primary MM (MM<sub>pri</sub>), including those who deteriorated and received rescue EVT, in overall and propensity score (PS)-matched cohorts. Patients were stratified by target mismatch (mismatch ratio ≥ 1.8 and mismatch volume ≥ 15ml). Primary outcome was functional independence (90-day modified Rankin Scale = 0–2). Secondary outcomes included safety (symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage [sICH], neurological worsening, and mortality).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 540 patients, 286 (53%) received EVT<sub>pri</sub> and demonstrated larger critically hypoperfused tissue (Tmax &gt; 6 seconds) volumes (median [IQR]: 64 [26–96] ml vs MM<sub>pri</sub>: 40 [14–76] ml, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and higher presentation NIHSS (median [IQR]: 4 [2–5] vs MM<sub>pri</sub>: 3 [2–4], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Functional independence was similar (EVT<sub>pri</sub>: 77.4% vs MM<sub>pri</sub>: 75.6%, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.82–2.03, <i>p</i> = 0.27). EVT had worse safety regarding sICH (EVT<sub>pri</sub>: 16.3% vs MM<sub>pri</sub>: 1.3%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and neurological worsening (EVT<sub>pri</sub>: 19.6% vs MM<sub>pri</sub>: 6.7%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). In 414 subjects (76.7%) with target mismatch, EVT was associated with improved functional independence (EVT<sub>pri</sub>: 77.4% vs MM<sub>pri</sub>: 72.7%, aOR = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.01–2.81, <i>p</i> = 0.048), whereas there was a trend toward less favorable outcomes with primary EVT (EVT<sub>pri</sub>: 77.4% vs MM<sub>pri</sub>: 83.3%, aOR = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.12–1.34, <i>p</i> = 0.13) without target mismatch (<i>p</i>
<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.06). Similar findings were observed in a propensity score-matched subpopulation.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Overall, EVT was not associated with improved clinical outcomes in mild strokes due to LVO, and sICH was increased. However, in patients with target mismatch profile, EVT was associated with increased functional independence. Perfusion imaging may be helpful to select mild stroke patients for EVT.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Autism spectrum disorder in architecture perspective: a review of the literature and bibliometric assessment of research indexed in Web of Science [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: An increasing number of scholarly publications on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have urged researcher interest in this topic; however, there is still a lack of quantitative analysis. Therefore, this study aims to cover the knowledge gap between the amount of literature published on ASD research on architectural and designers' perspectives compared to the medical and psychological fields. The study has analyzed global research output on ASD from a designer's perspective to recognize this gap related to designing the physical environment.  Methodology: The bibliometric method was employed to analyze the published literature from 1992–to 2021. 812 papers were downloaded from the Web of Science for analysis based on annual growth of literature, prolific authors, authorship pattern, organizations, countries, international collaboration, and subject development by keywords and thematic map analyses. Various bibliometric and scientometric software was used to analyze the data, namely Bibexcel, Biblioshiny, and VOS viewer. Results: The812 research papers were published in 405 sources. 2019 appeared as a productive year (NP=101), and 2014 received the highest number of citations (TC=6634). Researchers preferred to publish as journal articles (NP=538; TC=24922). The University of Toronto, Canada, was identified as a productive institution with 42 publications and 5358 citations. The USA was the leading producing country with 433 publications, and most of the researchers published in the journal "Scientific Reports" (NP=16). The word autism (NP=257) and architecture (NP=165) were more frequently used keywords. Conclusion: The study identified a massive gap in the development of literature in ASD for architecture design and built environment perspective, the most important and trending keywords are missing, and the analyses also showed a lack of subject development. The authors have suggested areas and keywords for further research to fulfill the gap in the future.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>To identify the clinical characteristics of the subgroup of benign progressive supranuclear palsy with particularly long disease duration; to define neuropathological determinants underlying variability in disease duration in progressive supranuclear palsy.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Clinical and pathological features were compared among 186 autopsy-confirmed cases with progressive supranuclear palsy with ≥10 years and shorter survival times.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>45 cases (24.2%) had a disease duration of ≥10 years. The absence of ocular motor abnormalities within the first 3 years from disease onset was the only significant independent clinical predictor of longer survival. Histopathologically, the neurodegeneration parameters in each survival group were paralleled anatomically by the distribution of neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions, whereas the tufted astrocytes displayed anatomically an opposite severity pattern. Most interestingly, we found significantly less coiled bodies in those who survive longer, in contrast to patients with less favorable course.</p>
<h2>Interpretations</h2>
<p>A considerable proportion of patients had a more ‘benign’ disease course with ≥10 years survival. They had a distinct pattern and evolution of core symptoms compared to patients with short survival. The inverted anatomical patterns of astrocytic tau distribution suggest distinct implications of these cell types in trans-cellular propagation. The tempo of disease progression appeared to be determined mostly by oligodendroglial tau, where high degree of oligodendroglial tau pathology might affect neuronal integrity and function on top of neuronal tau pathology. The relative contribution of glial tau should be further explored in cellular and animal models.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">On the flexibility of the cellular amination network in E. coli</a></h4>

              
                Ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) is essential to generate the nitrogenous building blocks of life. It gets assimilated via the canonical biosynthetic routes to glutamate and is further distributed throughout metabolism via a network of transaminases. To study the flexibility of this network, we constructed an <i>Escherichia coli</i> glutamate auxotrophic strain. This strain allowed us to systematically study which amino acids serve as amine sources and found that several amino acids complement the auxotrophy, either by producing glutamate via transamination reactions or by their conversion to glutamate. In this network, we identified aspartate transaminase AspC as a major connector between many amino acids and glutamate. Additionally, we extended the transaminase network by the amino acids β-alanine, alanine, glycine, and serine as new amine sources and identified d-amino acid dehydrogenase (DadA) as an intracellular amino acid sink removing substrates from transaminase reactions. Finally, ammonium assimilation routes producing aspartate or leucine were introduced. Our study reveals the high flexibility of the cellular amination network, both in terms of transaminase promiscuity and adaptability to new connections and ammonium entry points.

                Replisomes are multi-protein complexes that replicate genomes with remarkable speed and accuracy. Despite their importance, their dynamics is poorly characterized, especially in vivo. In this paper, we present an approach to infer the replisome dynamics from the DNA abundance distribution measured in a growing bacterial population. Our method is sensitive enough to detect subtle variations of the replisome speed along the genome. As an application, we experimentally measured the DNA abundance distribution in Escherichia coli populations growing at different temperatures using deep sequencing. We find that the average replisome speed increases nearly five-fold between 17°C and 37°C. Further, we observe wave-like variations of the replisome speed along the genome. These variations correlate with previously observed variations of the mutation rate, suggesting a common dynamical origin. Our approach has the potential to elucidate replication dynamics in E. coli mutants and in other bacterial species.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">ATP binding facilitates target search of SWR1 chromatin remodeler by promoting one‑dimensional diffusion on DNA</a></h4>

              
                One-dimensional (1D) target search is a well-characterized phenomenon for many DNA binding proteins but is poorly understood for chromatin remodelers. Herein, we characterize the 1D scanning properties of SWR1, a conserved yeast chromatin remodeler that performs histone exchange on +1 nucleosomes adjacent to a nucleosome-depleted region (NDR) at gene promoters. We demonstrate that SWR1 has a kinetic binding preference for DNA of NDR length as opposed to gene-body linker length DNA. Using single and dual color single-particle tracking on DNA stretched with optical tweezers, we directly observe SWR1 diffusion on DNA. We found that various factors impact SWR1 scanning, including ATP which promotes diffusion through nucleotide binding rather than ATP hydrolysis. A DNA binding subunit, Swc2, plays an important role in the overall diffusive behavior of the complex, as the subunit in isolation retains similar, although faster, scanning properties as the whole remodeler. ATP-bound SWR1 slides until it encounters a protein roadblock, of which we tested dCas9 and nucleosomes. The median diffusion coefficient, 0.024 μm<sup>2</sup>/sec, in the regime of helical sliding, would mediate rapid encounter of NDR-flanking nucleosomes at length scales found in cellular chromatin.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Self-organization of kinetochore-fibers in human mitotic spindles</a></h4>

              
                During eukaryotic cell division, chromosomes are linked to microtubules (MTs) in the spindle by a macromolecular complex called the kinetochore. The bound kinetochore microtubules (KMTs) are crucial to ensuring accurate chromosome segregation. Recent reconstructions by electron tomography (Kiewisz et al. 2021) captured the positions and configurations of every MT in human mitotic spindles, revealing that roughly half the KMTs in these spindles do not reach the pole. Here, we investigate the processes that give rise to this distribution of KMTs using a combination of analysis of large-scale electron tomography, photoconversion experiments, quantitative polarized light microscopy, and biophysical modeling. Our results indicate that in metaphase, KMTs grow away from the kinetochores along well-defined trajectories, with the speed of the KMT minus ends continually decreasing as the minus ends approach the pole, implying that longer KMTs grow more slowly than shorter KMTs. The locations of KMT minus ends, and the turnover and movements of tubulin in KMTs, are consistent with models in which KMTs predominately nucleate de novo at kinetochores in metaphase and are inconsistent with substantial numbers of non-KMTs being recruited to the kinetochore in metaphase. Taken together, this work leads to a mathematical model of the self-organization of kinetochore-fibers in human mitotic spindles.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Selective endocytosis controls slit diaphragm maintenance and dynamics in Drosophila nephrocytes</a></h4>

              
                The kidneys generate about 180 liters of primary urine per day by filtration of plasma. An essential part of the filtration barrier is the slit diaphragm, a multiprotein complex containing nephrin as major component. Filter dysfunction typically manifests with proteinuria and mutations in endocytosis regulating genes were discovered as causes of proteinuria. However, it is unclear how endocytosis regulates the slit diaphragm and how the filtration barrier is maintained without either protein leakage or filter clogging. Here we study nephrin dynamics in podocyte-like nephrocytes of <i>Drosophila</i> and show that selective endocytosis either by dynamin- or flotillin-mediated pathways regulates a stable yet highly dynamic architecture. Short-term manipulation of endocytic functions indicates that dynamin-mediated endocytosis of ectopic nephrin restricts slit diaphragm formation spatially while flotillin-mediated turnover of nephrin within the slit diaphragm is needed to maintain filter permeability by shedding of molecules bound to nephrin in endosomes. Since slit diaphragms cannot be studied <i>in vitro</i> and are poorly accessible in mouse models, this is the first analysis of their dynamics within the slit diaphragm multiprotein complex. Identification of the mechanisms of slit diaphragm maintenance will help to develop novel therapies for proteinuric renal diseases that are frequently limited to symptomatic treatment.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A network of cytosolic (co)chaperones promotes the biogenesis of mitochondrial signal-anchored outer membrane proteins</a></h4>

              
                Signal-anchored (SA) proteins are anchored into the mitochondrial outer membrane (OM) via a single transmembrane segment at their N-terminus while the bulk of the proteins is facing the cytosol. These proteins are encoded by nuclear DNA, translated on cytosolic ribosomes, and are then targeted to the organelle and inserted into its OM by import factors. Recently, research on the insertion mechanisms of these proteins into the mitochondrial OM have gained a lot of attention. In contrast, the early cytosolic steps of their biogenesis are unresolved. Using various proteins from this category and a broad set of <i>in vivo</i>,<i> in organello</i>, and<i> in vitro</i> assays, we reconstituted the early steps of their biogenesis. We identified a subset of molecular (co)chaperones that interact with newly synthesized SA proteins, namely, Hsp70 and Hsp90 chaperones and co-chaperones from the Hsp40 family like Ydj1 and Sis1. These interactions were mediated by the hydrophobic transmembrane segments of the SA proteins. We further demonstrate that interfering with these interactions inhibits the biogenesis of SA proteins to a various extent. Finally, we could demonstrate direct interaction of peptides corresponding to the transmembrane segments of SA proteins with the (co)chaperones and reconstitute <i>in vitro</i> the transfer of such peptides from the Hsp70 chaperone to the mitochondrial Tom70 receptor. Collectively, this study unravels an array of cytosolic chaperones and mitochondrial import factors that facilitates the targeting and membrane integration of mitochondrial SA proteins.

                COVID-19 is a respiratory disease affecting multiple organs including the central nervous system (CNS), with a characteristic loss of smell and taste. Although frequently reported, the neurological symptoms remain enigmatic. There is no consensus on the extent of CNS infection. Here, we derived human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) into neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and glutamatergic neurons to study their permissiveness to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Flow cytometry and western blot analysis indicated that NPCs and neurons do not express detectable levels of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2. We thus generated cells expressing ACE2 by lentiviral transduction to analyze in a controlled manner the properties of SARS-CoV-2 infection relative to ACE2 expression. Sensitivity of parental and ACE2 expressing cells was assessed with GFP- or luciferase- carrying pseudoviruses and with authentic SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan, D614G, Alpha or Delta variants. SARS-CoV-2 replication was assessed by microscopy, RT-qPCR and infectivity assays. Pseudoviruses infected only cells overexpressing ACE2. Neurons and NPCs were unable to efficiently replicate SARS-CoV-2, whereas ACE2 overexpressing neurons were highly sensitive to productive infection. Altogether, our results indicate that primary NPCs and glutamatergic neurons remain poorly permissive to SARS-CoV-2 across the SARS-CoV-2 variants inoculated, in the absence of ACE2 expression.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuronal Activity Alters Neuron to OPC Synapses</a></h4>

              
                The mechanisms that drive the timing and specificity of oligodendrocyte myelination during development, or remyelination after injury or immune attack are not well understood. Recent work has shown that oligodendrocyte progenitors receive synapses from neurons, providing a potential mechanism for neuronal-glial communication. We hypothesize that these connections are important both for correct myelination of neurons during development and for myelination during neuronal plasticity. We utilized chemogenetic tools and viral monosynaptic circuit tracing to analyze these neuroglial connections and to examine OPC proliferation, myelination, synapse formation, and neuronal-glial connectivity after increasing or decreasing neuronal activity in vivo. We found that increasing neuronal activity increased OPC activation, but not proliferation. We also found that altering neuronal activity altered neuronal-glial synaptic connections: while it did not impact the total number of neuronal inputs, or the number of inhibitory neuronal inputs, it did alter the number of excitatory neuron to OPC connections. We also found that increasing or decreasing neuronal activity impacted the ratio of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Our data show that neuronal activity affects OPC activation, neuronal synapse formation onto OPCs, as well as the types of neuronal inputs to OPCs, indicating that neuronal activity is important for OPC circuit composition and function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Single neurons in thalamus and subthalamic nucleus process cardiac and respiratory signals in humans</a></h4>

              
                Visceral signals are constantly processed by our central nervous system, enable homeostatic regulation, and influence perception, emotion, and cognition. While visceral processes at cortical level have been extensively studied using non-invasive imaging techniques, very few studies have investigated how this information is processed at the single neuron level, both in humans and animals. Subcortical regions, relaying signals from peripheral interoceptors to cortical structures, are particularly understudied and how visceral information is processed in thalamic and subthalamic structures remains largely unknown. Here, we took advantage of intraoperative microelectrode recordings in patients undergoing surgery for deep brain stimulation (DBS) to investigate the activity of single neurons related to cardiac and respiratory functions in three subcortical regions: Ventral Intermedius nucleus (Vim) and Ventral caudalis nucleus (Vc) of the thalamus, and subthalamic nucleus (STN). We report that the activity of a large portion of the recorded neurons (about 70%) was modulated by either the heartbeat, the cardiac inter-beat interval, or the respiration. These cardiac and respiratory response patterns varied largely across neurons both in terms of timing and their kind of modulation. We observed neurons with increases or decreases in firing rate in response to either the heartbeat or the inter-beat interval. Peaks of neural activity were found at different phases of the cardiac and respiratory cycles. Whereas most neurons only responded to one of the tested signals, a substantial proportion of these visceral neurons (30%) was responsive to more than one of the tested signals, underlining specialization and integration of cardiac and respiratory signals in STN and thalamic neurons. By extensively describing for the first time single unit activity related to cardiorespiratory function in thalamic and subthalamic neurons, our results highlight the major role of these subcortical regions in the processing of visceral signals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brainstem fMRI signaling of surprise across different types of deviant stimuli</a></h4>

              
                The ability to detect deviant stimuli is crucial to adapt our behavior. Previous work showed that infrequent (hence deviant) stimuli elicit phasic activation of the brainstem locus coeruleus (LC), which releases noradrenaline and controls central arousal. However, it is unclear whether deviance detection selectively recruits the LC or also other neuromodulatory systems related to dopamine, acetylcholine, and serotonin. It is also unclear whether deviant-related responses in those systems only track infrequent stimuli in a sequence (which can be computed with bottom-up processes), or also violations of the sequence structure (which requires higher-order processings). Here, we combined human fMRI recordings optimized for brainstem imaging with pupillometry (a peripheral marker of central arousal) to perform a mapping of deviant-related responses in subcortical structures. Participants were exposed to a local-global paradigm that distinguishes between deviance based on the stimulus probability and the sequence structure. fMRI responses to deviant stimuli were quite distributed, detected in the LC but also other subcortical nuclei and many cortical areas. Both types of deviance elicited responses in the pupil, LC and other neuromodulatory systems. Our results reveal that deviance detection in humans recruits several subcortical systems and generalizes across computationally different types of deviance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cognitive aging and categorical representations in visual working memory</a></h4>

              
                A traditional view on cognitive aging is that visual working memory (VWM) capacity declines in older adults. Recent work has shown that visual information can be stored in VWM in different forms of representations. Specifically, VWM becomes more reliant on categorical representations (e.g., a prototypical red) as compared to continuous representations (e.g., a light reddish color) as memory load increases. Here, we replicated these findings and tested whether this holds for older adults. Participants memorized one to four colors; after a delay, an arrow pointed at the location of the color that needed to be reported. We used an extended mixture model (Zhou et al., 2022) to examine the extent to which memory responses were biased in the direction of the category prototypes. Our results showed that for both younger and older adults, VWM became more biased towards category prototypes with increasing memory load. Importantly, we found no difference in the extent to which VWM was biased towards category prototypes between younger and older adults. However, older adults showed an overall lower precision as compared to younger adults. Taken together, our results demonstrated that both younger and older adults became more reliant on categorical representations with increasing memory load; importantly, the extent to which categorical representations were involved in maintaining VWM information was insensitive to age.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Early β-amyloid accumulation and hypoconnectivity in the default mode network are related to its disengagement from global brain activity</a></h4>

              
                Importance: The specific pattern/trajectory of {beta}-amyloid (A{beta}) pathology spreading in Alzheimer's disease (AD), from default mode network (DMN) regions to sensory-motor areas, is well known, but poorly understood. Objective: To determine if resting-state global brain activity is linked to early A{beta} deposition in the DMN. Design: This is a retrospect analysis of multi-modal and longitudinal data from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Setting: The ADNI was a multicenter project involving 63 research centers. Participants: The study included 144 participants (72.6 {+/-} 7.5 years; 73 females) of whom 28 were controls, 21 had significant memory concerns, 72 had cognitive impairment (N=72), and 23 had AD. There were both baseline and 2-year follow-up data for A{beta}-PET for 112 of the subjects. They were classified into following stages based on the CSF A{beta}42 (CSF+: <192 ng/L) and cortical A{beta} (PET+: >0.872 SUVR) levels: non-A{beta}-accumulators (CSF-/PET-); early-A{beta}-accumulators (CSF+/PET-); and late-A{beta}-accumulators (CSF+/PET+). Exposure: Resting-state brain activity was assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI), whereas glymphatic function was estimated by the coupling between fMRI blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals and CSF movements. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cortical A{beta} accumulation measured by 18F-AV45 amyloid-positron emission tomography (PET), CSF A{beta}42, and total and phosphorylated tau protein levels in all participants. Results: Glymphatic function assessed by fMRI was strongly ({rho} > 0.43, P < 0.042) associated with various markers of protein aggregation in early A{beta} accumulators in whom A{beta} just begins to accumulate cortically in the DMN. Among these early accumulators, the preferential A{beta} accumulation in the DMN regions in the subsequent two years was correlated with lower gBOLD signal ({rho} = 0.51, P = 0.027) and lower local glymphatic function ({rho} = 0.48, P = 0.041) in the same regions at baseline. Conclusions and Relevance: Resting-state global brain activity and related glymphatic function are linked to A{beta} pathology, particularly its preferential deposition in the DMN at the earliest AD stages. This suggests potential novel early therapeutic directions that might provide disease modification.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Encoding of Dynamic Facial Information in the Middle Dorsal Face Area</a></h4>

              
                Faces in motion reveal a plethora of information through visual dynamics. Faces can move in complex patterns while transforming facial shape, e.g. during the generation of different emotional expressions. While motion and shape processing have been studied extensively in separate research enterprises, much less is known about their conjunction during biological motion. Here we took advantage of the discovery in brain-imaging studies of an area in the dorsal portion of the macaque monkey superior temporal sulcus (STS), the middle dorsal face area (MD), with selectivity for naturalistic face motion. To gain mechanistic insights into the coding of facial motion, we recorded single-unit activity from MD, testing whether and how MD cells encode face motion. The MD population was highly sensitive to naturalistic facial motion and facial shape. Some MD cells responded only to the conjunction of facial shape and motion, others were selective for facial shape even without movement, and yet others were suppressed by facial motion. We found that this heterogeneous MD population transforms face motion into a higher-dimensional activity space, a representation that would allow for high sensitivity to relevant small-scale movements. Indeed we show that many MD cells carry such sensitivity for eye movements. We further found that MD cells encode motion of head, mouth, and eyes in a separable manner, requiring the use of multiple reference frames. Thus, MD is a bona-fide face-motion area that uses highly heterogeneous cell populations to create codes capturing even complex facial motion trajectories.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Unbiased Classification of the Human Brain Proteome Resolves Distinct Clinical and Pathophysiological Subtypes of Cognitive Impairment</a></h4>

              
                The hallmark amyloid-{beta} and tau deposition of Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents only a fraction of its diverse pathophysiology. Molecular subtyping using large-scale -omic strategies can help resolve this biological heterogeneity. Using quantitative mass spectrometry, we measured ~8,000 proteins across >600 dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissues from Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project participants with clinical diagnoses of no cognitive impairment, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD dementia. Unbiased classification of MCI and AD cases based on individual proteomic profiles resolved three classes whose expression differed across numerous cell types and biological ontologies. Two of these classes displayed molecular signatures atypical of those previously observed in AD neurodegeneration, such as elevated synaptic and decreased inflammatory markers. In one class, these atypical proteomic features were associated with clinical and pathological hallmarks of disease resilience. These results promise to better define disease heterogeneity within the cognitively impaired elderly and meaningfully impact diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic precision.

	<p>Objective: To explore whether deep medullary veins (DMVs) in the unaffected hemisphere were associated with functional outcome in acute cardioembolic stroke patients. Methods: Acute cardioembolic stroke patients at a single center were retrospectively included. DMVs visibility in the unaffected hemisphere was assessed using a well-established four-grade scoring method based on susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI): grades 0&amp;amp;ndash;3 (grade 0 for no visible DMVs; grade 1 for the numbers of conspicuous DMVs &amp;amp;lt; 5; grade 2 for numbers raging from 5 to 10; grade 3 for more than 10). Patients were further divided into mild-to-moderate (grade 0&amp;amp;ndash;2) and severe DMVs (grade 3) groups. Functional outcomes were evaluated using the modified Rankin scale (mRS) score at three months. Poor outcome was defined as mRS &amp;amp;ge; 3. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to explore the association between DMVs grade and functional outcome. Results: A total of 170 patients were finally included. Compared with the mild-to-moderate DMVs group (149 patients), the severe DMVs group (21 patients) had higher baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores (p = 0.002), lower levels of admission systolic blood pressure (BP) (p = 0.031), and elevated rates of large infarction (p = 0.003). At three months, the severe DMVs group had higher mRS (p = 0.002). Patients in the poor outcome group (82/170, 48.2%) had older age, higher baseline NIHSS score, lower admission diastolic BP, higher rates of hemorrhagic transformation and large infarction, and an increased proportion of severe DMVs (all p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). After adjusting for confounders, multivariable regression analysis showed that the severe DMVs grade (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 5.830, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.266&amp;amp;ndash;26.856, p = 0.024) was significantly associated with three-month functional outcomes without interaction with other potential risk factors (p for interaction &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). Conclusions: DMVs grade in the unaffected hemisphere was independently associated with three-month functional outcome in acute cardioembolic stroke patients. Patients with severe DMVs were more likely to have a poor functional outcome at three months.</p>

	<p>Pituitary adenoma (PA) is the most common benign tumor of the pituitary gland. The pathogenesis of most PA is considered as a multifactorial process, that involves genetic mutations, alterations in gene transcription, and epigenetic factors. Their interaction promotes tumorigenesis. The processes are increasingly focused on changes in telomere length. Our study enrolled 126 patients with PA and 368 healthy subjects. DNA samples from peripheral blood leukocytes were purified by the DNA salting-out method. The RT-PCR carried out SNPs and relative leukocyte telomere lengths (RLTL). ELISA determined the level of TEP1 in blood serum. Binary logistic regression revealed that TERC rs35073794 is likely associated with increased odds of PA development and macro-PA development. It is also associated with decreased odds of active PA, non-invasive PA, and PA without relapse development. Also, we discovered that PA patients with at least one G allele of the TEP1 gene polymorphism rs1713418 have lower serum TEP1 levels than healthy individuals (p = 0.035). To conclude, the study revealed that TERC rs35073794 might be a potential biomarker for PA development.</p>

	<p>Background: We aimed to assess the retinal structural and choroidal changes in carotid artery stenosis (CAS) patients and their association with cerebral hemodynamic changes. Asymptomatic and symptomatic patients with unilateral CAS were enrolled in our study. Material and methods: Swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) was used to image the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GCIPL), while SS-OCT angiography (SS-OCTA) was used to image and measure the choroidal vascular volume (CVV) and choroidal vascular index (CVI). Computed Tomography Perfusion (CTP) was used to assess the cerebral perfusion parameters; relative perfusion (r) was calculated as the ratio of the value on the contralateral side to that on the ipsilateral side. Results: Compared with contralateral eyes, ipsilateral eyes showed significantly thinner RNFL (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), GCIPL (p = 0.013) and CVV (p = 0.001). Relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) showed a significant correlation with RNFL (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), GCIPL (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and CVI (p = 0.027), while the relative permeability surface (rPS) correlated with RNFL (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and GCIPL (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Our report suggests that retinal and choroidal changes have the potential to detect hemodynamic changes in CAS patients and could predict the risk of stroke.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Phosphorylation Determines Whether Neuroligin-3 is at Excitatory or Inhibitory Synapses in Different Regions of the Brain</a></h4>

              
                Neuroligin-3 is a postsynaptic adhesion molecule involved in development, function, and pathologies of synapses in the brain. It is a genetic cause of autism and a potent component of the tumor microenvironment in gliomas. There are four Neuroligins that operate at distinct synapse types, selectively interacting with presynaptic adhesion and postsynaptic scaffold proteins. We investigated the subcellular localization and scaffold specificities of synaptic Neuroligin-3 and demonstrate an unexpected pattern of localization to excitatory synapses in cortical areas, and inhibitory synapses in subcortical areas. Using phosphoproteomics, we identify Neuroligin-3-specific serine phosphorylation in cortex and hippocampus that obstructs a key binding site for inhibitory synapse scaffolds. Using in utero CRISPR/Cas9 knockout and replacement with phosphomimetic mutants, we demonstrate that phosphorylation at this site determines excitatory versus inhibitory synapse localization of Neuroligin-3 in vivo. Our data reveal a mechanism that differentially regulates the balance of Neuroligin-3 between excitatory and inhibitory synapses, adding to our emerging understanding of their role in the development of brain connectivity and associated pathologies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mouse primary visual cortex neurons respond to the illusory ''darker than black'' in neon color spreading.</a></h4>

              
                Illusions are a powerful tool for studying the single neuron correlates of perception. Here, we introduce the neon color spreading (NCS) illusion in mice and report the neuronal correlates of illusory brightness, which has heretofore only been studied using human fMRI. We designed a novel NCS paradigm to evoke the percept of an illusory drifting grating and analyzed the activity of 520 single units in the mouse primary visual cortex (V1). A substantial proportion of V1 single units (60.5%) responded to illusory gratings with direction tuning matched to their preferred direction, which was determined using physically presented luminance-defined gratings (LDG). Moreover, by presenting LDG gratings with a 180{degrees} phase shift relative to NCs gratings, we show that spatial phase tuning shifted 180{degrees} for most single units. This finding conclusively demonstrates that V1 single units respond to illusory brightness. Using this novel mouse paradigm, we show that responses to illusory gratings have a lower magnitude and are delayed relative to physical gratings. We determined where V1 single units fell in the V1 cellular hierarchy (based on their susceptibility to surround suppression, their putative classification as interneuron or pyramidal neuron, and designation as a simple or complex cell) and found that higher-level V1 single units are more responsive to NCS stimuli. These findings resolve the debate of whether V1 is involved in illusory brightness processing and reveal a V1 hierarchical organization in which higher-level neurons are pivotal to the processing of illusory qualities, such as brightness.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Efficient in vivo neuronal genome editing in the mouse brain using nanocapsules containing CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoproteins</a></h4>

              
                Genome editing of somatic cells via clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) offers promise for new therapeutics to treat a variety of genetic disorders, including neurological diseases. However, the dense and complex parenchyma of the brain and the post-mitotic state of neurons make efficient genome editing challenging. In vivo delivery systems for CRISPR-Cas proteins and single guide RNA (sgRNA) include both viral vectors and non-viral strategies, each presenting different advantages and disadvantages for clinical application. We developed non-viral and biodegradable PEGylated nanocapsules (NCs) that deliver preassembled Cas9-sgRNA ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). Here, we show that the RNP NCs led to robust genome editing in neurons following intracerebral injection into the mouse striatum. Genome editing was predominantly observed in medium spiny neurons (>80%), with occasional editing in cholinergic, calretinin, and parvalbumin interneurons. Glial activation was minimal and was localized along the needle tract. Our results demonstrate that the RNP NCs are capable of safe and efficient neuronal genome editing in vivo.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTModifying the DNA of cells in the brain could present opportunities for new treatments of neurological diseases. In this report, we describe a nanocapsule system designed to deliver the elements needed to modify the DNA of brain cells, also known as genome editing. These nanocapsules are created by chemically encapsulating the genome editing components, such that the nanocapsules are stable when prepared and biodegradable to release their payload upon entering cells. When injected into the mouse brain, our research shows that the nanocapsules lead to safe and efficient editing of DNA in neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Changes in gamma bursts supporting working memory development through adolescence derived from EEG spectral processing</a></h4>

              
                Adolescence is a stage of development characterized by neurodevelopmental specialization of cognitive processes. In particular, working memory continues to improve through adolescence, with increases in response accuracy and decreases in response latency continuing well into the twenties. Human electroencephalogram (EEG) studies indicate that gamma oscillations (30-75 Hz) during the working memory delay period support the maintenance of mnemonic information guiding subsequent goal driven behavior, which decreases in power with development. Importantly, recent electrophysiological studies have shown that gamma bursts, and not sustained activity, reinstate working memory during the delay period. Developmental changes in gamma bursts during working memory, have not been studied. Thus, we used EEG in conjunction with a novel spectral event processing approach to investigate age-related changes in transient gamma band activity during a memory guided saccade (MGS) task in 164 10- to 30-year-olds. As expected, accuracy improved, and latency decreased with age. EEG results indicated robust age-related decreases in mean gamma power and the number of gamma band events during both the working memory delay epoch but also the fixation epoch before working memory encoding, suggesting age-related change in core aspects of information processing. Relationships between gamma events and behavior however were only evident during the working memory delay period and only during adolescence where more gamma events were associated with faster latency and trial level event variability was associated with latency variability. These results suggest a process of specialization where developmental decreases in gamma events into adulthood support working memory responses reflecting optimization of executive function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Closed-loop brain stimulation to reduce pathologic fear</a></h4>

              
                Maladaptive processing of trauma related memory engrams leads to dysregulated fear reactions. In post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), dysfunctional extinction learning prevents discretization of trauma-related memory engrams and leads to generalized fear responses. PTSD is postulated as a mnemonic-based disorder, but we lack markers or treatments targeting pathological fear memory processing. Hippocampal sharp wave-ripples (SWRs) and concurrent neocortical oscillations are scaffolds to consolidate contextual memory, but their role during fear processing remains poorly understood. We demonstrate that closed-loop SWRs triggered neuromodulation of the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) can enhance the consolidation of fear extinction. It modified fear memories that became resistant to induced recall (i.e.,  renewal and  reinstatement) and did not reemerge spontaneously as a PTSD-like phenotype. The effects are mediated by D2 receptor signaling induced synaptic remodeling in the basolateral amygdala. These results suggest that SWRs help consolidating fear extinction memories. Furthermore, enhancing the consolidation of extinction engrams by SWR-triggered induction of reward signals can alleviate pathologic fear reactions in a rodent model of PSTD. No adverse effects were seen, suggesting this potential therapy for PTSD and anxiety disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Structural plasticity of axon initial segment in spinal cord neurons underlies inflammatory pain</a></h4>

              
                Activity-dependent structural plasticity of axon initial segment (AIS) regulates neuronal excitability, thus fine-tuning neuronal and overall network output. Here using behavioral, immunohistochemical, electrophysiological and computational approaches, we describe the structural plasticity of AIS in rats superficial spinal cord dorsal horn (SDH) neurons, which underlies inflammatory pain. We show an inflammation-mediated distal shift of the AIS away from the soma in inhibitory but not excitatory SDH neurons, concomitant with the peak of inflammatory pain. This AIS translocation was accompanied by a decrease in excitability of the inhibitory neurons. Following recovery from inflammatory hyperalgesia, the AIS location and neuronal excitability reversed to baseline levels. The computational model of SDH inhibitory neurons predicts that the distal shift of AIS is sufficient to decrease the intrinsic excitability of these neurons. Our results provide evidence of differential inflammation-mediated AIS plasticity, reducing the excitability of inhibitory but not excitatory SDH neurons and contributing to inflammatory hyperalgesia.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An intestinal sphingolipid promotes neuronal health across generations</a></h4>

              
                Maternal diet and environment can influence the neuronal health of offspring. Here, we report that diet-induced intestinal sphingolipid biosynthesis reduces adult-onset neurodegeneration intergenerationally in Caenorhabditis elegans. Feeding C. elegans with ursolic acid (UA), a natural plant product, provides neuroprotection by enhancing maternal provisioning of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) - a bioactive sphingolipid. S1P promotes neuronal health across generations by upregulating transcription of the acid ceramidase-1 (asah-1) gene in the intestine. Intergenerational intestine-to-oocyte S1P transfer is essential for promoting neuronal health and is dependent on the lipoprotein yolk receptor RME-2 (Receptor-Mediated Endocytosis-2). Spatially regulating sphingolipid biosynthesis is critical, as inappropriate asah-1 neuronal expression causes developmental axon outgrowth defects. Our results reveal that sphingolipid homeostasis impacts the development and intergenerational health of the nervous system.

One-Sentence SummaryAn intestinal lipid prevents neurodegeneration across generations.

	<p>Humans and rodents have sexually dimorphic immune responses, which could influence the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s response to a systemic inflammatory insult. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a stimulator of the innate immune system and is routinely used in animal models to study blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction under inflammatory conditions. Therefore, we examined whether inflammatory response to LPS and the associated BBB disruption differed in male and female adult rats. Rats were treated with saline or two injections of 1 mg/kg LPS and studied 24 h after the second LPS injection. Plasma isolated from trunk blood and brain tissue homogenates of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), dorsal striatum (DS), hippocampus, and cerebellum were analyzed for cytokines and chemokines using a 9-plex panel from Meso Scale Discovery. BBB disruption was analyzed with tight junction proteins claudin-5 and VE-cadherin via Western blotting and VEGF by ELISA. This allowed us to compare sex differences in the levels of individual cytokines as well as associations among cytokines and expression of tight junction proteins between the plasma and specific brain regions. Higher levels of interferon-&amp;amp;gamma;, interleukin-10 (IL-10), IL-13, IL-4, CXCL-1, and VEGF in the plasma were revealed compared to the brain homogenates, and higher levels of TNF&amp;amp;alpha;, IL-1&amp;amp;beta;, IL-6, and IL-5 in the PFC were seen compared with plasma and other brain regions in males. Females showed higher levels of plasma CXCL1 and VEGF compared to males, and males showed higher levels of PFC TNF&amp;amp;alpha;, IL-6, IL-4, and VEGF compared to females. LPS induced significant increases in plasma cytokines and VEGF in both sexes. LPS did not significantly alter cytokines in brain tissue homogenates, however, it increased chemokines in the PFC, DS, and hippocampus. In the PFC, LPS produced BBB disruption, which is evident as reduced expression of claudin-5 in males and reduced expression of VE-cadherin in both sexes. Taken together, our results reveal significant sex differences in pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels in plasma and brain that were associated with BBB disruption after LPS, and validate the use of multiplex assay for plasma and brain tissue samples.</p>

	<p>The use of electroencephalography to recognize human emotions is a key technology for advancing human&amp;amp;ndash;computer interactions. This study proposes an improved deep convolutional neural network model for emotion classification using a non-end-to-end training method that combines bottom-, middle-, and top-layer convolution features. Four sets of experiments using 4500 samples were conducted to verify model performance. Simultaneously, feature visualization technology was used to extract the three-layer features obtained by the model, and a scatterplot analysis was performed. The proposed model achieved a very high accuracy of 93.7%, and the extracted features exhibited the best separability among the tested models. We found that adding redundant layers did not improve model performance, and removing the data of specific channels did not significantly reduce the classification effect of the model. These results indicate that the proposed model allows for emotion recognition with a higher accuracy and speed than the previously reported models. We believe that our approach can be implemented in various applications that require the quick and accurate identification of human emotions.</p>

	<p>Post-stroke depression (PSD) is a kind of prevalent emotional disorder following stroke that usually results in slow functional recovery and even increased mortality. We had reported that the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 2 (CysLT2R) antagonist HAMI3379 (HM3379) contributes to the improvement of neurological injury. The present study was designed to investigate the role of HM3379 in PSD-induced chronic neuroinflammation and related mechanisms in gerbils. The gerbils were subjected to transient global cerebral ischemia (tGCI) and spatial restraint stress to induce the PSD model. They were randomized to receive the vehicle or HM3379 (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) for a consecutive 14 days. In the PSD-treated gerbils, HM3379 had noteworthy efficacy in improving the modified neurological severity score (mNSS) and depression-like behaviors, including the sucrose preference test and the forced swim test. HM3379 administration significantly mitigated neuron loss, lessened TUNEL-positive neurons, and reduced the activation of microglia in the cerebral cortex. Importantly, HM3379 downregulated protein expressions of the NOD-like receptor pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and pyroptosis including NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1, interleukin-1&amp;amp;beta; (IL-1&amp;amp;beta;), IL-18, cleaved gasdermin-N domain (GSDMD-N), and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activation and recruitment domain (ASC). Mechanistically, HM3379 could repress pyroptosis via inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation under oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) stimulation. Knockdown of CysLT2R by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or overexpression of CysLT2R by lentivirus (LV)-CysLT2R could abolish or restore the anti-depression effect of HM3379. Our results demonstrated that the selective CysLT2R antagonist HM3379 has beneficial effects on PSD, partially by suppressing the NLRP3 inflammasome/pyroptosis pathway.</p>

	<p>Acute or chronic exposures to pesticides have been linked to neurotoxicity and the potential development of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). This study aimed to consider the neurotoxicity of three widely utilized pesticides: malathion, chlorpyrifos, and paraquat within the hippocampus (HC), corpus striatum (CS), cerebellum (CER), and cerebral cortex (CC). Neurotoxicity was evaluated at relatively low, medium, and high pesticide dosages. All pesticides inhibited acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and neuropathy target esterase (NTE) in each of the brain regions, but esterase inhibition was greatest in the HC and CS. Each of the pesticides also induced greater disruption to cellular bioenergetics within the HC and CS, and this was monitored via inhibition of mitochondrial complex enzymes I and II, reduced ATP levels, and increased lactate production. Similarly, the HC and CS were more vulnerable to redox stress, with greater inhibition of the antioxidant enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase and increased lipid peroxidation. All pesticides induced the production of nuclear Nrf2 in a dose-dependent manner. Collectively, these results show that pesticides disrupt cellular bioenergetics and that the HC and CS are more susceptible to pesticide effects than the CER and CC.</p>

	<p>Methamphetamine use disorder (MUD) is a chronic brain disorder that involves frequent failures of inhibitory control and relapses into methamphetamine intake. However, it remains unclear whether the impairment of inhibitory control in MUD is proactive, reactive or both. To address this issue, the current study used the conditional stop-signal task to assess proactive and reactive inhibitory control in 35 MUD patients with long-term abstinence and 35 matched healthy controls. The results showed that MUD patients with long-term abstinence had greater preparation costs than healthy controls, but did not differ in performance, implying a less efficient utilization of proactive inhibitory control. In contrast, MUD patients exhibited intact reactive inhibitory control; reactive but not proactive inhibitory control was associated with high sensation seeking in MUD patients with long-term abstinence. These findings suggest that proactive and reactive inhibitory control may be two different important endophenotypes of addiction in MUD patients with long-term abstinence. The current study provides new insight into the uses of proactive and reactive inhibitory control to effectively evaluate and precisely treat MUD patients with long-term abstinence.</p>

	<p>Previous studies have indicated that vitamin (Vit) D deficiency is frequent in psychiatric patients, regardless of diagnostic category. We aimed to assess whether acute psychiatric relapses in inpatients was associated with Vit D deficiency compared to stabilized outpatients. The cohort (152 total patients, 75 males and 77 females) had a mean age of 47.3 &amp;amp;plusmn; 14.4 years at admission and was grouped according to psychiatric diagnosis. Psychopathological symptom severity was assessed by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), a multidimensional symptom inventory. Total calcium serum levels were measured using standard laboratory methods, while plasma levels of 25-OH-Vit D and parathyroid hormone (PTH) were measured by automated chemiluminescence immunoassays. The psychiatric inpatient subgroup showed a significant difference in serum levels of 25-OH-Vit D and PTH (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Correlation analysis between serum levels of 25-OH-Vit D and BPRS total and subitem scores indicated a significantly negative relationship. In addition, linear regression analysis evidenced that the inpatient condition might predict low PTH and 25-OH-Vit D serum levels. Hospitalized psychiatric patients are at increased risk for Vit D deficiency regardless of their diagnostic categories. The mechanism underlying the association between acute psychiatric relapses and Vit D deficiency remains unclear. Therefore, screening for Vit D deficiency should pertain to the health assessment of patients with major psychiatric disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Risk factors for hippocampal cavities in a marginally housed population</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cavities in the hippocampus are morphological variants of uncertain significance. Aberrant neurodevelopment along with vascular and inflammatory etiologies have been proposed. We sought to characterize these cavities and their potential risk factors in a marginally housed population, with high rates of viral infection, addiction, and mental illness. (1) The volume of hippocampal cavities (HCavs) is greater in this highly multimorbid population compared to the general population. (2) Conventional vascular risk factors such as greater age and systolic blood pressure are associated with higher HCav volume. (3) Nonprescribed substance-related risk factors such as stimulant use or dependence, and smoking are associated with increased HCav volume independent of vascular risk factors. This is a retrospective analysis of an ongoing prospective study. We analyzed baseline data, including medical history, physical exam, psychiatric diagnosis, and MRI from a total of 375 participants. Hippocampal cavities were defined as spaces isointense to CSF on T1 MRI sequences, bounded on all sides by hippocampal tissue, with a volume of at least 1 mm<sup>3</sup>. Risk factors were evaluated using negative binomial multiple regression. Stimulant use was reported by 87.3% of participants, with stimulant dependence diagnosed in 83.3% of participants. Prevalence of cavities was 71.6%, with a mean total bilateral HCav volume of 13.89 mm<sup>3</sup>. On average, a 1 mmHg greater systolic blood pressure was associated with a 2.17% greater total HCav volume (95% CI = [0.57%, 3.79%], p = .0076), while each cigarette smoked per day trended toward a 2.69% greater total HCav volume (95% CI = [−0.87%, 5.54%], p = .058). A diagnosis of stimulant dependence was associated with a 95.6% greater total HCav volume (95% CI = [5.39%, 263.19%], p = .0335). Hypertension and diagnosis of stimulant dependence were associated with a greater total volume of HCav.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Debate continues regarding the possible role of the hippocampus across short-term and working memory tasks. The current study examined the possibility of a hippocampal contribution to precise, high-resolution cognition and conjunctive memory. We administered visual working memory tasks featuring a continuous response component to a well-established developmental amnesic patient with relatively selective bilateral hippocampal damage (Jon) and healthy controls. The patient was able to produce highly accurate response judgments regarding conjunctions of color and orientation or color and location, using simultaneous or sequential presentation of stimuli, with no evidence of any impairment in working memory binding, categorical accuracy, or continuous precision. These findings indicate that hippocampal damage does not necessarily lead to deficits in high-resolution cognitive performance, even when the damage is severe and bilateral.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Complementary representations of time in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Episodic memory binds the spatial and temporal relationships between the elements of experience. The hippocampus encodes space through place cells that fire at specific spatial locations. Similarly, time cells fire sequentially at specific time points within a temporally organized experience. Recent studies in rodents, monkeys, and humans have identified time cells with discrete firing fields and cells with monotonically changing activity in supporting the temporal organization of events across multiple timescales. Using in vivo electrophysiological tetrode recordings, we simultaneously recorded neurons from the prefrontal cortex and dorsal CA1 of the hippocampus while rats performed a delayed match to sample task. During the treadmill mnemonic delay, hippocampal time cells exhibited sparser firing fields with decreasing resolution over time, consistent with previous results. In comparison, temporally modulated cells in the prefrontal cortex showed more monotonically changing firing rates, ramping up or decaying with the passage of time, and exhibited greater temporal precision for Bayesian decoding of time at long time lags. These time cells show exquisite temporal resolution both in their firing fields and in the fine timing of spikes relative to the phase of theta oscillations. Here, we report evidence of theta phase precession in both the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus during the temporal delay, however, hippocampal cells exhibited steeper phase precession slopes and more punctate time fields. To disentangle whether time cell activity reflects elapsed time or distance traveled, we varied the treadmill running speed on each trial. While many neurons contained multiplexed representations of time and distance, both regions were more strongly influenced by time than distance. Overall, these results demonstrate the flexible integration of spatiotemporal dimensions and reveal complementary representations of time in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus in supporting memory-guided behavior.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Rett syndrome is a leading cause of intellectual disability in females primarily caused by loss of function mutations in the transcriptional regulator MeCP2. Loss of MeCP2 leads to a host of synaptic phenotypes that are believed to underlie Rett syndrome pathophysiology. Synaptic deficits vary by brain region upon MeCP2 loss, suggesting distinct molecular alterations leading to disparate synaptic outcomes. In this study, we examined the contribution of MeCP2's newly described role in miRNA regulation to regional molecular and synaptic impairments. Two miRNAs, miR-101a and miR-203, were identified and confirmed as upregulated in MeCP2 KO mice in the hippocampus and cortex, respectively. miR-101a overexpression in hippocampal cultures led to opposing effects at excitatory and inhibitory synapses and in spontaneous and evoked neurotransmission, revealing the potential for a single miRNA to broadly regulate synapse function in the hippocampus. These results highlight the importance of regional alterations in miRNA expression and the specific impact on synaptic function with potential implications for Rett syndrome.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The ability to discriminate between one's own and others' body parts can be lost after brain damage, as in patients who misidentify someone else's hand as their own (pathological embodiment). Surprisingly, these patients do not use visual information to discriminate between the own and the alien hand. We asked whether this impaired visual discrimination emerges only in the ecological evaluation when the pathological embodiment is triggered by the physical alien hand (the examiner's one) or whether it emerges also when hand images are displayed on a screen. Forty right brain-damaged patients, with (E+ = 20) and without (E− = 20) pathological embodiment, and 24 healthy controls underwent two tasks in which stimuli depicting self and other hands was adopted. In the Implicit task, where participants judged which of two images matched a central target, the self-advantage (better performance with Self than Other stimuli) selectively emerges in controls, but not in patients. Moreover, E+ patients show a significantly lower performance with respect to both controls and E− patients, whereas E− patients were comparable to controls. In the Explicit task, where participants judged which stimuli belonged to themselves, both E− and E+ patients performed worst when compared to controls, but only E+ patients hyper-attributed others' hand to themselves (i.e., false alarms) as observed during the ecological evaluation. The VLSM revealed that SLF damage was significantly associated with the tendency of committing false alarm errors. We demonstrate that, in E+ patients, the ability to visually recognize the own body is lost, at both implicit and explicit level.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Foundations and implications of astrocyte heterogeneity during brain development and disease</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes play crucial roles in regulating brain circuit formation and physiology. Recent technological advances have revealed unprecedented levels of astrocyte diversity encompassing molecular, morphological, and functional differences. This diversification is initiated during embryonic specification events and (in rodents) continues into the early postnatal period where it overlaps with peak synapse development and circuit refinement. In fact, several lines of evidence suggest astrocyte diversity both influences and is a consequence of molecular crosstalk among developing astrocytes and other cell types, notably neurons and their synapses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Identification of pre-existing microbiome and metabolic vulnerabilities to escalation of oxycodone self-administration and identification of a causal role of short-chain fatty acids in addiction-like behaviors.</a></h4>

              
                The gut brain axis is thought to play a role in behavior and physiological responses through chemical, immunological, and metabolite signaling. Antibiotics, diet, and drugs can alter the transit time of gut contents as well as the makeup of the microbiome. Heterogeneity in genetics and environment are also well-known factors involved in the initiation and perpetuation of substance use disorders. Few viable genetic or biological markers are available to identify individuals who are at risk of escalating opioid intake. Primarily, the addiction field has focused on the nervous system, limiting the discovery of peripheral factors that contribute to addiction. To address this gap, we characterized the microbiome before and after drug exposure, and after antibiotics depletion in male and female heterogenous stock rats to determine if microbiome constituents are protective of escalation. We hypothesized that individuals that are prone to escalation of opioid self-administration will have distinct microbial and metabolic profiles. The fecal microbiome and behavioral responses were measured over several weeks of oxycodone self-administration and after antibiotic treatment. Antibiotic treatment reduces circulating short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) by depleting microbes that ferment fiber into these essential signaling molecules for the gut-brain axis. Depletion of the microbiome increased oxycodone self-administration in a subpopulation of animals (Responders). Supplementation of SCFAs in antibiotic depleted animals decreased elevated oxycodone self-administration. Phylogenetic functional analysis reveals distinct metabolic differences in the subpopulations of animals that are sensitive to antibiotic depletion and animals rescued by SCFA supplementation. In conclusion, this study identifies pre-existing microbiome and metabolic vulnerabilities to escalation of oxycodone self-administration, demonstrates that escalation of oxycodone self-administration dysregulates the microbiome and metabolic landscape, and identifies a causal role of short-chain fatty acids in addiction-like behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Identification of individual differences in response to methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone in animal models of opioid use disorder</a></h4>

              
                RationaleCurrent medications for opioid use disorder include buprenorphine, methadone, and naltrexone. While these medications show significant efficacy in reducing craving and opioid use, there are substantial individual differences in response to these treatments in humans. The reason for such difference is poorly known.

ObjectivesHere, we tested the hypothesis that similar individual differences may be observed in a large population of heterogenous stock rats, that have been bred to maximize genetic diversity, using a behavioral paradigm relevant to opioid use disorder.

MethodsOver 500 rats were given intermittent (4d/week) and extended access (12h/day) to oxycodone self-administration for 14 sessions to establish oxycodone dependence and escalation of intake. We then measured the effect of buprenorphine (0.5mg/kg), methadone (3mg/kg) and naltrexone (3mg/kg) on the motivation to self-administer oxycodone by using a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement.

ResultsWe found that naltrexone and buprenorphine significantly decreased motivation to oxycodone rewards. While naltrexone reduced oxycodone intake in both males and females, systemic administration with buprenorphine reduced progressive ratio responses only in males. Methadone reduced motivation to oxycodone self-administration in nearly 25% of the population, without reaching statical significance. Our results showed that the efficacy of these medications depends on the severity of addiction like behaviors, indicated by the addiction index.

ConclusionsThese results demonstrate individual differences in response to medications to treat opioid use disorder in a genetically diverse population of rats.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Differential effects of oxytocin receptor antagonist on social rank and other social behavior in mice</a></h4>

              
                Social rank within a group is essential for survival in many animals. Rank in the community helps to avoid unnecessary conflicts and establish stable relationships with others. Recently, oxytocin has received increasing attention for its function in social behavior. However, the causal relationship between oxytocin levels and social rank has remained unclear. Here, we examined the effects of intraperitoneal injection of the oxytocin receptor antagonist L-368-899 on (1) social rank, (2) sex preference, and (3) dyadic interaction in male mice. In the tube test, injection of the oxytocin receptor antagonist had no effect on first-place mice, but caused rank fluctuation of the social rank in second-place mice, suggesting that the function of oxytocin in the maintenance of the social rank is rank-dependent. Second, injection of the oxytocin receptor antagonist dose-dependently impaired the sex preference of the male mice, confirming that oxytocin is essential in sexual behavior. Third, injection of the oxytocin receptor antagonist had no effect on the dyadic interaction between the male mice, suggesting that oxytocin is not necessary in direct social interaction. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the role of the oxytocin in male mice is limited to a specific context of social behavior.

HighlightsO_LIThe stable social rank of the male mice in their cages was clearly observed in the tube test.
C_LIO_LIAdministration of an oxytocin receptor antagonist to first-place mice caused no change in social rank.
C_LIO_LIAdministration of an oxytocin receptor antagonist to second-place mice caused changes in social rank in some groups.
C_LIO_LISex preference, but not social and dyadic interactions, were impaired after the injection of the oxytocin receptor antagonist.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortico-thalamo-cortical interactions modulate electrically evoked EEG responses in mice</a></h4>

              
                Perturbational complexity analysis predicts the presence of consciousness in humans by stimulating the brain with a brief pulse, recording cortical responses with electroencephalography (EEG), and measuring their spatiotemporal complexity. Measures reflecting perturbational complexity are low when consciousness vanishes in deep sleep, general anesthesia, or after widespread brain damage, and are high during wake, dreaming sleep and after recovery from brain injury. Here we examine the neural circuits underlying perturbational complexity in a mouse model by directly stimulating the cortex and recording high-density EEG, as well as spiking activity throughout the cortico-thalamo-cortical system with up to three Neuropixels probes, while subjects are awake or anesthetized via isoflurane. We find that when the mouse is awake, stimulation of deep cortical layers reliably evokes locally a brief pulse of excitation, followed by a bi-phasic sequence of a 120 ms profound off period and a rebound excitation. A similar pattern of spiking activity, some of which can be attributed to burst spiking, is seen in the connected thalamic nuclei. These spiking patterns are associated with a pronounced late component in the evoked EEG. We infer that cortico-thalamo-cortical interactions drive the long-lasting evoked EEG signals elicited by deep cortical stimulation during the awake state. The cortical and thalamic off period and rebound excitation, as well as the late component in the EEG, are reduced in running mice and are absent in animals anesthetized with isoflurane. This is also mirrored in the perturbational complexity indices computed during quiet wakefulness, running, and anesthetized states. Taken together, these results suggest that cortico-thalamo-cortical interactions contribute to ongoing activity in the conscious state that leads to highly complex global responses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Plasticity manifolds and ion-channel degeneracy govern circadian oscillations of neuronal intrinsic properties in the suprachiasmatic nucleus</a></h4>

              
                Motivation and methodsThe suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the master circadian clock of the mammalian brain that sustains a neural code for circadian time through oscillations in the firing rate of constituent neurons. These cell-autonomous oscillations in intrinsic properties are mediated by plasticity in a subset of ion-channels expressed in SCN neurons and are maintained despite widespread neuron-to-neuron variability in ion channel expression profiles. How do SCN neurons undergo stable transitions and maintain precision in intrinsic properties spanning the day-night cycle if several ion channels change concomitantly in a heterogeneous neuronal population? Here, we address this important question using unbiased stochastic searches on the parametric and the plasticity spaces using populations of SCN models, each explored for multiple valid transitions spanning one complete circadian cycle (day-to-night followed by night-to-day transitions).

ResultsOur analyses provided three fundamental insights about the impact of heterogeneities on the circadian oscillations of SCN intrinsic properties. First, SCN neurons could achieve signature electrophysiological characteristics (day-like or night-like) despite pronounced heterogeneity in ion channel conductances, with weak pairwise correlations between their conductance values. This ion-channel degeneracy precluded the need to maintain precise ionchannel expression profiles for achieving characteristic electrophysiological signatures of SCN neurons, thus allowing for parametric heterogeneities despite functional precision. Second, it was not essential that specific conductances had to change by precise values for obtaining valid day-to-night or night-to-day transitions. This plasticity degeneracy, the ability of disparate combinations of ion-channel plasticity to yield the same functional transition, confers flexibility on individual neurons to take one of several routes to achieve valid transitions. Finally, we performed nonlinear dimensionality reduction analyses on the valid plasticity spaces and found the manifestation of a low-dimensional plasticity manifold in day-to-night transitions, but not in night-to-day transitions. These observations demonstrated that the concomitant changes in multiple ion channels are not arbitrary, but follow a structured plasticity manifold that provides a substrate for stability in achieving stable circadian oscillations.

ImplicationsOur analyses unveil an elegant substrate, involving a synthesis of the degeneracy and the plasticity manifold frameworks, to effectuate stable circadian oscillations in a heterogeneous population of SCN neurons. Within this framework, the ability of multiple ion channels to change concomitantly provides robustness and flexibility to effectively achieve precise transitions despite widespread heterogeneities in ion-channel expression and plasticity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain-based Lifespan Trajectories of Social Cognition: From Resting-state fMRI Perspective</a></h4>

              
                Brain lifespan trajectories of intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) in social cognition (SC) provide comprehensive insight and effective reference for normal development and clinical intervention. Unfortunately, for a lack of lifespan samples, the neural mechanism underlying SC in a lifespan developmental perspective is largely unknown, though relative behavior evidence has been investigated well. We, based on common functional networks, aim to map out voxel-wise iFC features between the SC networks and the entire cerebral cortex and further chart its corresponding trajectory patterns across the lifespan. Three networks, namely moral cognition, theory of mind (ToM), and empathy, are chosen as representatives of core SC networks. NKI-RS Enhanced (N = 316, ages 8-83 years old) dataset is selected as a lifespan resting-state fMRI dataset to delineate iFC characteristics and construct developmental trajectories. The result shows that the SC networks represent dissociable and network-specific connectivity profiles. Empathy network, as the most age-related susceptible network, shows a linear up trend with dorsal attention network, a linear decrease with ventral attention network, and a quadric-concave with somatomotor and dorsal attention networks. In addition, the sex effect is also discovered in empathy network, which exhibits linear and quadric gender differences with frontoparietal and vision networks respectively. ToM network follows a pronounced quadric-convex (inverted U-shape) trajectory with ventral attention network. No linear and quadric trajectory is found in moral cognition network. These findings indicate that SC networks display a wide range of iFC both with the fundamental networks (e.g., somatomotor, vision) and advanced networks (e.g., attention and control) in specific developmental trajectories, which will provide a better understanding of SC neural mechanism and life-span developmental trajectories also give valuable references for SC abnormal detection and effective therapy.

                Sign-tracking rats show enhanced cue sensitivity before drug experience that predicts greater discrete cue-induced drug-seeking compared to goal-tracking or intermediate- rats. Cue-evoked dopamine in the nucleus Accumbens (NAc) is a neurobiological signature of sign-tracking behaviors. Here, we examine a critical regulator of the dopamine system; endocannabinoids, which bind the cannabinoid receptor-1 (CB1R) in the Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) to control cue-evoked striatal dopamine levels. We use cell-type specific optogenetics, intra-VTA pharmacology and fiber photometry to test the hypothesis that VTA CB1R receptor signaling regulates NAc dopamine levels to control sign-tracking. We trained rats in a Pavlovian lever autoshaping task (PLA) to determine their tracking groups before testing the effect of VTAeNAc dopamine inhibition. We found this circuit is critical for mediating the vigor of the ST response. Upstream of this circuit, intra-VTA infusions of rimonabant, a CB1R inverse agonist, during PLA decrease lever and increase foodcup approach in sign-tracking rats. Using fiber photometry to measure fluorescent signals from dopamine sensor, GRABDA, we tested the effects of intra-VTA rimonabant on NAc dopamine dynamics during autoshaping. We found that intra-VTA rimonabant-induced decreases in sign-tracking behaviors are not associated with changes to phasic cue(CS)-evoked NAc dopamine activity. Instead, intra-VTA rimonabant increases NAc shell, but not core, dopamine levels during reward delivery (US). Our results suggest that CB1R signaling in the VTA influences the balance between the CS- and US-evoked dopamine responses in the NAc shell and biases behavioral responding to cues in sign-tracking rats.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTSubstance Use Disorder is a chronically relapsing neurobiological disorder that affects a subset of individuals that engage in drug use. Recent research suggests that there are individual behavioral and neurobiological differences prior to drug experience that predict addiction and relapse vulnerabilities. Here, we investigate how midbrain endocannabinoids regulate a brain pathway that is exclusively involved in driving cue- motivated behaviors of sign-tracking rats. This work contributes to our mechanistic understanding of individual vulnerabilities to cue-triggered natural reward seeking that have relevance for drug motivated behaviors.

                Mesial Temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) is a life-threatening condition characterized by recurrent epileptic seizures initiating in the hippocampus. mTLE can develop after exposure to risk factors such as seizure, trauma, and infection. Within the latent period between exposure and onset of recurrent seizures, pathological remodeling events occur which are believed to contribute to epileptogenesis. The molecular mechanisms responsible for epileptogenesis in the seizure network are currently unclear. We used the mouse intrahippocampal kainate model of mTLE to investigate transcriptional dysregulation in the ipsilateral-injected epileptogenic zone (EZ), and contralateral peri-ictal zone (PIZ) in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus during the first 14-days after induction of status epilepticus (SE). DG were micro-dissected 3, 7 and 14-days after SE for high-throughput RNA-sequencing. In the EZ, dynamic transcriptional dysregulation was evident over 2-weeks with early expression of genes representing cell signaling, migration and proliferation. In the PIZ, gene dysregulation was most prominent at 3-days in similar domains. Inflammatory gene groups were also prominent over the 2-week epileptogenic period in the EZ and PIZ. We uncovered that the Wnt signaling pathway was dysregulated in the EZ and PIZ at 3-days and we validated these changes via immunohistochemistry. This suggests that critical gene changes occur early after neurological insult and that canonical Wnt signaling may play a role within this latent period. These findings offer new insights into gene expression changes that occur in the hippocampal DG early after SE and may help to identify novel therapeutic targets that could prevent epileptogenesis.

Significance statementMesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) is a severe life-threatening condition that is often medically refractory. While risk factors for the delayed development of mTLE are well-known, there are currently no therapeutic interventions that prevent epileptogenesis. Knowledge of the gene dysregulation events that occur during the latent period between exposure and epilepsy is critical to understanding epileptogenesis and developing new therapies. We utilized a mouse model of adult focal mTLE, the most common form of adult clinical epilepsy, and investigated transcriptional changes in the dentate gyrus during the first 2-weeks after status epilepticus. These data provide new insights into specific gene changes and pathways within different regions of the seizure network that could be targeted to prevent the development of epilepsy.

                In this study, the quantitative and qualitative effects of nitrogen monoxide on cerebellar histopathology, by increasing or decreasing in vivo production of this substance, were investigated. In this study, forty Wistar female rats (RAT) with a weight of about 200 to 250 grams and an average age of eight weeks were used. Rats were divided into five groups of eight, including control groups, normal saline, L-NAME, L-Arginine, L-NAME + L-Arginine. On the third, fourth and fifth days, the injection was performed intraperitoneally and on the eighteenth day, after anesthesia with ether and then craniotomy, the brain and cerebellum of the animals were removed and After quantitative measurements including weight and volume, organs were fixed in 10% formalin and after tissue preparation steps, to prepare the slide, sections with a thickness of 5 to 6 microns were prepared from the samples and by general method such as Hematoxylin-eosin and special techniques like Mason trichrome and toluidine blue were stained and evaluated. The results of this study show that in the case of cerebellum, there is no significant difference in the quantitative weight parameter between the control groups, normal saline, L-Arg, L-NAME and L-NAME + L-Arg groups. Regarding the volume parameter, a significant increase (P <0.01) was observed in L-Arg group compared to L-NAME, L-Arg + L-NAME and normal saline groups. In microscopic qualitative parameters, the most changes in the L-Arg group were seen as follows: The granular and molecular layers of the cerebellum became slightly thickened, some of the nuclei in the granular and molecular layers became severely hyperchromatized, and Purkinje cell accumulation was seen with lymphocytic invasion. In the other groups, there were no significant changes. It is inferred from this study that L-Arginine can cause histopathological changes in cerebellar tissue by increasing NO levels in cerebellum. However, in this study, unlike other similar studies, L-NAME injection did not cause significant histopathological change.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A large-scale brain network of species-specific dynamic human body perception</a></h4>

              
                This ultrahigh field 7T fMRI study addressed the question of whether there exists a core network of brain areas at the service of different aspects of body perception. Participants viewed naturalistic videos of monkey and human faces, bodies, and objects along with mosaic-scrambled videos for control of low-level features. ICA-based network analysis was conducted to find body and species modulations at both the voxel and the network levels. Among the body areas, the highest species selectivity was found in the middle frontal gyrus and amygdala. Two large-scale networks were highly selective to bodies, dominated by the lateral occipital cortex and right superior temporal sulcus (STS) respectively. The right STS network showed high species selectivity, and its significant human body-induced node connectivity was focused around the extrastriate body area (EBA), STS, temporoparietal junction (TPJ), premotor cortex, and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). The human body-specific network discovered here may serve as a brain-wide internal model of the human body serving as an entry point for a variety of processes relying on body descriptions as part of their more specific categorization, action, or expression recognition functions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">FT-GO: a multiplex fluorescent tyramide signal amplification system for histochemical analysis</a></h4>

              
                Tyramide signal amplification (TSA) is a highly sensitive method for histochemical analysis. Previously, we reported a TSA system, BT-GO, for bright-filed imaging. Here, we develop FT-GO (Fluorochromized Tyramide-Glucose Oxidase) as a multiplex fluorescent TSA system. FT-GO involves peroxidase-catalyzed deposition of FT with hydrogen peroxide produced in enzymatic reaction between glucose and glucose oxidase. We showed that FT-GO enhanced immunofluorescence signals while maintaining low background signals. Compared with indirect immunofluorescence detections, FT-GO demonstrated a more widespread distribution of monoaminergic projection systems in mouse and marmoset brains. For multiplex labeling with FT-GO, we quenched Ab-conjugated peroxidase using sodium azide. We applied FT-GO to multiplex fluorescent in situ hybridization, and succeeded in labeling neocortical interneuron subtypes by coupling with immunofluorescence. FT-GO immunofluorescence further increased the detectability of an adeno-associated virus tracer. Given its simplicity and a staining with a high signal-to-noise ratio, FT-GO would provide a versatile platform for histochemical analysis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical surface electrical potentials are composed of multiple bandlimited frequency components, including high-gamma</a></h4>

              
                A common challenge in neuroscience is how to decompose noisy, multi-source signals measured in experiments into biophysically interpretable components. Analysis of cortical surface electrical potentials (CSEPs) measured using electrocorticography arrays (ECoG) typifies this problem. We hypothesized that high frequency (70-1,000 Hz) CSEPs are composed of broadband (i.e., power-law) and bandlimited components with potentially differing biophysical origins. In particular, the high-gamma band (70-150 Hz) has been shown to be highly predictive for encoding and decoding behaviors and stimuli. Despite its demonstrated importance, whether high-gamma is composed of a bandlimited signal is poorly understood. To address this gap, we recorded CSEPs from rat auditory cortex and demonstrate that the evoked CSEPs are composed of multiple distinct frequency components, including high-gamma. We then show, using a novel robust regression method, that at fast timescales and on single trials during speech production, human high-gamma amplitude cannot be explained by a modulating power-law component; thus, high-gamma is band-limited. Furthermore, we show that the power-law component is less predictive of produced speech compared to the raw high-gamma amplitude. Finally, we show that the largest variance component of human ECoG signals is low-frequency and band-limited, not broadband. Together these results demonstrate that there are multiple, band-limited components of high frequency power in cortical surface electrical potentials, including the high-gamma band, which may have different biophysical origins.

Significance StatementElectrocortigraphy (ECoG) records cortical surface electrical potentials (CSEPs). ECoG is utilized in both humans and animal models to understand distributed cortical processing and for brain machine interfaces. The spectral structure of evoked CSEPs is greatly debated. To address this issue, we recorded from rat auditory cortex using {micro}ECoG and human ventral sensory-motor cortex during speech production with high-density ECoG. Using novel analytic approaches, we found that evoked CSEPs are composed of multiple band-limited components, including high-gamma. These results contrast with the dominant thinking in the field that the high-frequency power in ECoG is broadband. Our results raise the possibility that distinct frequency components of ECoG are biomarkers of processing in different cortical layers.

                Despite continuation of some controversies, Alzheimers disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia nowadays, has been widely believed to derive mainly from excessive {beta}-amyloid (A{beta}) aggregation, that would increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induce neuroinflammation, leading to neuron loss and cognitive impairment. Existing drugs on A{beta} have been ineffective or offer only temporary relief at best, due to blood-brain barrier or severe side effects. The study employed thermal cycling-hyperthermia (TC-HT) as an alternative AD therapy and compared its effect with continuous hyperthermia (HT) in vivo. It established an AD mice model via intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of A{beta}25-35, proving that TC-HT is much more effective in alleviating its performance decline in Y-maze and NOR test, in comparison with HT. In addition, TC-HT also exhibits a better performance in decreasing the hippocampal A{beta} and BACE1 expressions as well as the neuroinflammation markers Iba-1 and GFAP levels. Furthermore, the study finds that TC-HT can elevate more protein expressions of IDE and antioxidative enzyme SOD2 than HT. Besides, after establishment of neuroprotective mechanism, removal of TC-HT-induced ROS can further augment protection of neural cells against A{beta}. In sum, the study proves the potential of TC-HT in AD treatment, which can be put into clinical application with the use of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU).

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical grey matter mediates increases in model-based control and learning from positive feedback from adolescence to adulthood</a></h4>

              
                Adolescents undergo maturation in cognition and brain structure. Model-based (MB) control is known to increase from childhood to young adulthood, which is mediated by cognitive abilities. Here, we asked two questions unaddressed in previous developmental studies: Firstly, what are the brain structural correlates of age-related increases in MB control? Secondly, how are age-related increases in MB control from adolescence to adulthood influenced by motivational context? A developmental sample (n=103, age: 12-42) completed structural MRI and an established task to capture MB control. The task was modified with respect to outcome valence by including (1) reward and punishment blocks to manipulate the motivational context and (2) an additional choice test to assess learning from positive vs. negative feedback. After replicating that an age-dependent increase in MB control is mediated by cognitive abilities, we demonstrate first-time evidence that grey matter density (GMD) in the parietal cortex mediates the increase of MB control with age. While motivational context did not relate to age-related changes in MB control, learning from positive feedback improved with age. Meanwhile, negative feedback learning showed no age effects. We present a first report that an age-related increase in learning from positive feedback was mediated by reduced GMD in the parietal, medial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Our findings indicate that efficient brain maturation, as putatively reflected in lower GMD, in distinct and partially overlapping brain regions is a key developmental step towards age-related increases in planning and value-based choice.

Significance StatementAdolescents undergo extensive maturation in cognition and brain structure. Interestingly, model-based decision-making is also known to increase from childhood to adulthood. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that grey matter density in the parietal cortex mediates an age-dependent increase in model-based control. An age-related increase in positive feedback learning was mediated by reduced grey matter density in the parietal, medial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Interestingly, a manipulation of motivational context (gain reward vs. avoid punishment) did not impact age-related changes in model-based control. These findings highlight that efficient brain maturation in distinct and overlapping cortical brain regions constitutes a key developmental step towards increases in model-based planning and value-based choice.

                Summary ParagraphBiomarkers of behavior and psychiatric illness for cognitive and clinical neuroscience remain out of reach1-4. Suboptimal reliability of biological measurements, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), is increasingly cited as a primary culprit for discouragingly large sample size requirements and poor reproducibility of brain-based biomarker discovery1,5-7. In response, steps are being taken towards optimizing MRI reliability and increasing sample sizes8-11, though this will not be enough. Optimizing biological measurement reliability and increasing sample sizes are necessary but insufficient steps for biomarker discovery; this focus has overlooked the  other side of the equation - the reliability of clinical and cognitive assessments - which are often suboptimal or unassessed. Through a combination of simulation analysis and empirical studies using neuroimaging data, we demonstrate that the joint reliability of both biological and clinical/cognitive phenotypic measurements must be optimized in order to ensure biomarkers are reproducible and accurate. Even with best-case scenario high reliability neuroimaging measurements and large sample sizes, we show that suboptimal reliability of phenotypic data (i.e., clinical diagnosis, behavioral and cognitive measurements) will continue to impede meaningful biomarker discovery for the field. Improving reliability through development of novel assessments of phenotypic variation is needed, but it is not the sole solution. We emphasize the potential to improve the reliability of established phenotypic methods through aggregation across multiple raters and/or measurements12-15, which is becoming increasingly feasible with recent innovations in data acquisition (e.g., web- and smart-phone-based administration, ecological momentary assessment, burst sampling, wearable devices, multimodal recordings)16-20. We demonstrate that such aggregation can achieve better biomarker discovery for a fraction of the cost engendered by large-scale samples. Although the current study has been motivated by ongoing developments in neuroimaging, the prioritization of reliable phenotyping will revolutionize neurobiological and clinical endeavors that are focused on brain and behavior.

                Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is often applied to the motor cortex to stimulate a collection of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in groups of peripheral muscles. The causal interface between TMS and MEP is the selective activation of the neurons in the motor cortex; moving the TMS 'spot' around over the motor cortex causes different MEP responses. A question of interest is whether a collection of MEP responses can be used to identify the stimulated locations on the cortex, which could potentially be used to then place the TMS coil to produce chosen sets of MEPs. In this work we leverage our previous report on a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that predicted MEPs from the induced electric field, to tackle an inverse imaging task in which we start with the MEPs and estimate the stimulated regions on the motor cortex. We present and evaluate five different inverse imaging CNN architectures, both conventional and variational, in terms of several measures of reconstruction accuracy. We found that one architecture, which we denote as M2M-InvNet, consistently achieved the best performance.

                Understanding object representations requires a broad, comprehensive sampling of the objects in our visual world with dense measurements of brain activity and behavior. Here we present THINGS-data, a multimodal collection of large-scale datasets comprising functional MRI, magnetoencephalographic recordings, and 4.70 million similarity judgments in response to thousands of photographic images for up to 1,854 object concepts. THINGS-data is unique in its breadth of richly-annotated objects, allowing for testing countless hypotheses at scale while assessing the reproducibility of previous findings. Beyond the unique insights promised by each individual dataset, the multimodality of THINGS-data allows combining datasets for a much broader view into object processing than previously possible. Our analyses demonstrate the high quality of the datasets and provide five examples of hypothesis-driven and data-driven applications. THINGS-data constitutes the core release of the THINGS initiative (https://things-initiative.org) for bridging the gap between disciplines and the advancement of cognitive neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Kv2 conductances are not required for C-bouton mediated enhancement of motoneuron output</a></h4>

              
                Neural motor systems have evolved complex circuits that afford animals a range 1 of behaviours essential for survival. C-bouton synapses arising from cholinergic V0C interneurons amplify motoneuron activity via muscarine type 2 receptors, thus increasing muscle contraction force. Recent work in neonatal mouse motoneurons suggests that delayed rectifier currents carried by post-synaptically clustered KV2.1 channels are crucial to C-bouton amplification. Here we use a motoneuron conditional KV2.1 knockout to show that while KV2.1 modulates maximal firing in neonatal mice, its removal minimally affects either mature motoneuron firing or the enhanced firing rates in response to exogenously applied muscarine. In keeping with this, pharmacological blockade of KV2 currents has minimal electrophysiological effects on mature motoneurons. Furthermore, amplification of electromyography activity during high force tasks was unchanged following KV2.1 deletion. We next show that KV2.2 is also expressed by spinal motoneurons and colocalises with KV2.1 opposite C-boutons. We suggest that the primary function of KV2 proteins -- KV2.1 and KV2.2 -- is non-conducting in motoneurons, and that KV2.2 can function in the absence of KV2.1, perhaps to ensure the integrity of the synapse.

                Traumatic brain injury-induced axonal degeneration leads to acute and chronic neuropsychiatric impairment, neuronal death, and accelerated neurodegenerative diseases of aging, including Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases. Thus, there is much interest in developing treatments that protect axons after injury. For this endeavor, extended comprehensive evaluation of axonal integrity in experimental systems is required to evaluate the efficacy of putative interventions in preclinical models. However, traditional histological tissue proccessing techniques are logistically prohibitive for assessments of long-term pathology. Here, we report a new method of longitudinally monitoring the functional activity of thalamocortical axons before and after injury in vivo in the same animal over an extended period of time. Specifically, we expressed an axonal-targeting genetically-encoded calcium indicator in the mouse dorsolateral geniculate nucleus and then recorded axonal activity patterns in the visual cortex in response to visual stimulation. We demonstrate the utility of this method for assessing in vivo aberrant axonal activity patterns after traumatic brain injury, as well as for evaluating the therapuetic efficacy of the neuroprotective P7C3-A20 pharmacologic agent in vivo. We found that P7C3-A20 treatment minimized most, but not all, of the pathological changes in axonal activity patterns after traumatic brain injury.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural substrates of body ownership and agency during voluntary movement</a></h4>

              
                Body ownership and the sense of agency are two central aspects of bodily self-consciousness. While multiple neuroimaging studies have investigated the neural correlates of body ownership and agency in isolation, few have investigated their relationship during voluntary movement when such experiences naturally combine. By eliciting the moving rubber hand illusion with active or passive finger movements during functional magnetic resonance imaging, we isolated activations reflecting the sense of body ownership and agency, respectively, as well as their interaction, and assessed their overlap and anatomical segregation. We found that perceived hand ownership was associated with activity in premotor, posterior parietal and cerebellar regions whereas the sense of agency over the hand's movements was related to activity in the dorsal premotor cortex and superior temporal cortex. Moreover, one section of the dorsal premotor cortex showed overlapping activity for ownership and agency, and somatosensory cortical activity reflected the interaction of ownership and agency with higher activity when both agency and ownership was experienced. We further found that activations previously attributed to agency in the left insular cortex and right temporoparietal junction reflected the synchrony or asynchrony of the visuo-proprioceptive stimuli rather than agency. Collectively, these results identify the neural bases of agency and ownership during voluntary movement. Although the neural representations of these two experiences are largely distinct, there are functional neuroanatomical overlap and interactions during their combination, which has bearing on theories on bodily self-consciousness.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain fingerprint is based on the aperiodic, scale-free, neuronal activity</a></h4>

              
                The possibility to identify subjects from their brain activity was met enthusiastically, as it bears the possibility to individualize brain analyses. However, the nature of the processes generating subject-specific features remains unknown, as the literature does not point to specific mechanisms. In particular, most of the current literature uses techniques that are based on the assumption of stationarity (e.g. Pearson's correlation), which do not hypothesize any mechanisms, and crashes against a large body of literature showing the complex, highly non-linear nature of brain activity. In this paper, we hypothesize that intermittent moments when large, non-linear perturbations spread across the brain (defined as neuronal avalanches in the context of critical dynamics) are the ones that carry subject-specific information, and that contribute the most to identifiability. To test this hypothesis, we apply the recently-developed avalanche transition matrix (ATM) to source reconstructed magnetoencephalographic data, as to characterize subject-speficic fast dynamics. Then, we perform identifiability analysis based on the ATMs, and compared the performance to more classical ways of estimating large-scale connections (which assume stationareity). We demonstrate that selecting the moments and places where neuronal avalanches spread improves identifiability (p<0.0001, permutation testing), despite the fact that most ot the data (i.e. the linear part) are discarded. Our results show that the non-linear part of the brain signals carries most of the subject-specific information, shading light on the nature of the processes that underlie subject-identifiability. Borrowing from statistical mechanics, a solid branch of physics, we provide a principled way to link emergent large-scale personalized activations to non-observable, microscopic processes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Displacement experiments provide evidence for path integration in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Like many other animals, insects are capable of returning to previously visited locations using path integration. Recently, Drosophila has been added to the list of insects thought capable of this navigational memory. Existing experimental evidence, however, has a potential confound. Here we show that pheromones deposited at the site of reward might enable flies to find previously rewarding locations even without memory. Thus, we designed an experiment to determine if flies can use path integration memory despite potential pheromonal cues by displacing the flies shortly after an optogenetic reward. We found that rewarded flies returned to the location predicted by a memory-based model. Several analyses are consistent with path integration as the mechanism by which flies returned to the reward. We conclude that while pheromones may often be important in fly navigation and must be carefully controlled in future experiments, Drosophila may indeed be capable of performing path integration.

                There is increasing interest in the therapeutic potential of psilocybin in psychiatric disorders. In common with other serotonergic psychedelics, psilocybin is thought to act via the 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR). Serotonin is the endogenous ligand of 5-HTR. In rodents, the serotonin precursor, 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), and psilocybin, induce a characteristic head twitch response (HTR), which is correlated with the human psychedelic trip in intensity and duration. We examined the role of other serotonergic receptors and the trace amine associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) in modulating HTR induced by 5-HTP and psilocybin. Male C57BL/6J mice (11 weeks old, ~30g) were administered 5-HTP, 50-250 mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.) or 200 mg/kg i.p. after pretreatment with 5-HT/TAAR1 receptor modulators. Psilocybin was administered at 0.1-51.2 mg/kg i.p. or at 4.4 mg/kg i.p. preceded by 5-HT/TAAR1 receptor modulators. HTR was assessed in a custom-built magnetometer. 5-HTP and psilocybin induced a dose dependent increase in the frequency of HTR over 20 minutes with attenuation by the 5-HT2AR antagonist, M100907 (volanserin), and the 5-HT1AR agonist, 8-OH-DPAT. The 5-HT2CR antagonist, RS102221, enhanced HTR at lower doses but reduced it at higher doses for 5-HTP and psilocybin. The TAAR1 antagonist, EPPTB, reduced 5-HTP- but not psilocybin-induced HTR. We have confirmed the key role of 5-HT2AR in HTR and have demonstrated an effect of 5-HT1AR and a bimodal contribution of 5-HT2CR as well as a role of TAAR1 in modulating HTR induced by 5-HTP. Compounds that modulate HTR induced by psychedelics have a potentially important role in the emerging therapeutic use of these compounds.

                Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, affecting millions each year. Most PD cases (90%) are sporadic, resulting from the age-dependent accumulation of pathogenic effects. One key pathological hallmark of PD progression is the accumulation of alpha-synuclein (-syn), which has been shown to negatively affect neuronal function and viability. Here, using 3- and 6-month-old Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2-/- mice over expressing human -syn (PD model), we show that loss of NRF2 increases markers of ferroptosis across PD-relevant brain regions Increased ferroptosis was associated with an age- and genotype-dependent increase in -syn pathology and behavioral deficits. Finally, we demonstrate that -syn over expression sensitizes neuronal cells and ex vivo brain slices to ferroptosis induction, which may be due to -syn suppression of NRF2 at the protein level. Altogether, these results indicate that NRF2 is a critical anti-ferroptotic mediator of neuronal survival, and that the vicious cycle of -syn over expression and NRF2 suppression, leading to enhanced neuronal ferroptotic cell death, could represent a targetable and currently untapped means of preventing PD onset and progression.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Comparing visual cortex of children and adults reveals a late-stage change in the architecture of V1</a></h4>

              
                Adult visual ability differs markedly with stimulus polar angle: relative to the point of fixation, visual performance is best for stimuli to the left or right, intermediate for stimuli below, and poorest for stimuli above. These polar angle asymmetries in performance are paralleled by cortical asymmetries in the visual field representation in primary visual cortex (V1). Whereas children, like adults, show better performance for stimuli along the horizontal than the vertical meridian, they show no performance difference for stimuli above vs below fixation. Is the difference in visual performance between children and adults matched by a difference in the amount of V1 surface area representing these regions? We used fMRI to measure the distribution of the cortical surface representing the visual field in children and adults. Two properties of the V1, V2, and V3 maps were mature in children -overall map surface area and variation in surface area as a function of eccentricity. Further, like adults, children had much greater V1 surface area representing the horizontal than vertical meridian. However, unlike adults, children did not have greater V1 surface area for the lower than upper vertical meridian. These data indicate a late-stage change in the architecture of V1 that may drive the emergence of a visual performance asymmetry along the vertical meridian by adulthood.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Nanoscale phosphoinositide distribution on cell membranes of mouse cerebellar neurons</a></h4>

              
                Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) plays an essential role in neuronal activities through interaction with various proteins involved in signaling at membranes. However, the distribution pattern of PI(4,5)P2 and the co-clustering with these proteins on the neuronal cell membranes remain elusive at the electron microscopic level. In this study, we quantitatively investigated the nanoscale distribution of PI(4,5)P2 on the neuronal cell membranes by SDS-digested freeze-fracture replica labeling with cryo-fixed mouse cerebellum. We demonstrate that PI(4,5)P2 makes clusters with a mean size of ~ 1,000 nm2 and these clusters show preferential accumulation in specific membrane compartments depending on cell types. Purkinje cell (PC) spines and granule cell (GC) presynaptic active zones are particularly rich in the PI(4,5)P2 clusters. Furthermore, these clusters are extensively associated with clusters of CaV2.1 and GIRK3 throughout different membrane compartments of PCs, GCs, and molecular layer interneurons. In contrast, these clusters showed compartment-specific association with mGluR1 in PC spines. These results suggest that visualization of the nanoscale PI(4,5)P2 distribution may provide insight into the physiological functions of PI(4,5)P2 in neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Context matters: Changes in memory over a period of sleep are driven by encoding context</a></h4>

              
                During sleep, recently acquired episodic memories (i.e., autobiographical memories for specific events) are strengthened and transformed, a process termed consolidation. These memories are contextual in nature, with details of specific features interwoven with more general properties such as the time and place of the event. In this study, we hypothesized that the context in which a memory is embedded would guide the process of consolidation during sleep. To test this idea, we employed a spatial memory task and considered changes in memory over a 10-hour period including either sleep or wake. In both conditions, participants (N = 62) formed stories that contextually bound four objects together, and then encoded the on-screen spatial position of all objects. Results showed that the changes in memory over the sleep period were correlated among contextually linked objects, whereas no such effect was identified for the wake group. These results suggest that contexts binding different memories together play an active role in consolidation during sleep.
