<p>Causality testing, the act of determining cause and effect from measurements,
is widely used in physics, climatology, neuroscience, econometrics and other
disciplines. As a result, a large number of causality testing methods based on
various principles have been developed. Causal relationships in complex systems
are typically accompanied by entropic exchanges which are encoded in patterns
of dynamical measurements. A data compression algorithm which can extract these
encoded patterns could be used for inferring these relations. This motivates us
to propose, for the first time, a generic causality testing framework based on
data compression. The framework unifies existing causality testing methods and
enables us to innovate a novel Compression-Complexity Causality measure. This
measure is rigorously tested on simulated and real-world time series and is
found to overcome the limitations of Granger Causality and Transfer Entropy,
especially for noisy and non-synchronous measurements. Additionally, it gives
insight on the `kind' of causal influence between input time series by the
notions of positive and negative causality.

<p>Evaluating human brain potentials during watching different images can be
used for memory evaluation, information retrieving, guilty-innocent
identification and examining the brain response. In this study, the effects of
watching images, with different levels of familiarity, on subjects'
Electroencephalogram (EEG) have been studied. Three different groups of images
with three familiarity levels of "unfamiliar", "familiar" and "very familiar"
have been considered for this study. EEG signals of 21 subjects (14 men) were
recorded. After signal acquisition, pre-processing, including noise and
artifact removal, were performed on epochs of data. Features, including
spatial-statistical, wavelet, frequency and harmonic parameters, and also
correlation between recording channels, were extracted from the data. Then, we
evaluated the efficiency of the extracted features by using p-value and also an
orthogonal feature selection method (combination of Gram-Schmitt method and
Fisher discriminant ratio) for feature dimensional reduction. As the final step
of feature selection, we used 'add-r take-away l' method for choosing the most
discriminative features. For data classification, including all two-class and
three-class cases, we applied Support Vector Machine (SVM) on the extracted
features. The correct classification rates (CCR) for "unfamiliar-familiar",
"unfamiliar-very familiar" and "familiar-very familiar" cases were 85.6%,
92.6%, and 70.6%, respectively. The best results of classifications were
obtained in pre-frontal and frontal regions of brain. Also, wavelet, frequency
and harmonic features were among the most discriminative features. Finally, in
three-class case, the best CCR was 86.8%.

<p>We study dynamics of a reverberating neural net by means of computer
simulation. The net, which is composed of 9 leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF)
neurons arranged in a square lattice, is fully connected with interneuronal
communication delay proportional to the corresponding distance. The network is
initially stimulated with different stimuli and then goes freely. For each
stimulus, in the course of free evolution, activity either dies out completely
or the network converges to a periodic trajectory, which may be different for
different stimuli. The latter is observed for a set of 285290 initial stimuli
which constitutes 83% of all stimuli applied. By applying each stimulus from
the set, we found 102 different periodic end-states. By analyzing the
trajectories, we conclude that neuronal firing is the necessary prerequisite
for merging different trajectories into a single one, which eventually
transforms into a periodic regime. Observed phenomena of self-organization in
the time domain are discussed as a possible model for processes taking place
during perception. The repetitive firing in the periodic regimes could underpin
memory formation.

<p>One of the main current issues in Neurobiology concerns the understanding of
interrelated spiking activity among multineuronal ensembles and differences
between stimulus-driven and spontaneous activity in neurophysiological
experiments. Multi electrode array recordings that are now commonly used
monitor neuronal activity in the form of spike trains from many well identified
neurons. A basic question when analyzing such data is the identification of the
directed graph describing "synaptic coupling" between neurons. In this article
we deal with this matter working with a high quality multielectrode array
recording dataset (Pouzat et al., 2015) from the first olfactory relay of the
locust, $Schistocerca$ $americana$. From a mathematical point of view this
paper presents two novelties. First we propose a procedure allowing to deal
with the small sample sizes met in actual datasets. Moreover we address the
sensitive case of partially observed networks. Our starting point is the
procedure introduced in Duarte et al. (2016). We evaluate the performance of
both original and improved procedures through simulation studies, which are
also used for parameter tuning and for exploring the effect of recording only a
small subset of the neurons of a network.

Simultaneous changes in ion concentrations, glutamate, and cell volume together with exchange of matter between cell network and vasculature are ubiquitous in numerous brain pathologies. A complete understanding of pathological conditions as well as normal brain function, therefore, hinges on elucidating the molecular and cellular pathways involved in these mostly interdependent variations. In this paper, we develop the first computational framework that combines the HodgkinâHuxley type spiking dynamics, dynamic ion concentrations and glutamate homeostasis, neuronal and astroglial volume changes, and ion exchange with vasculature into a comprehensive model to elucidate the role of glutamate uptake in the dynamics of spreading depolarization (SD)âthe electrophysiological event underlying numerous pathologies including migraine, ischemic stroke, aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hematoma, and trauma. We are particularly interested in investigating the role of glutamate in the duration and termination of SD caused by K<sup>+</sup> perfusion and oxygen-glucose deprivation. Our results demonstrate that glutamate signaling plays a key role in the dynamics of SD, and that impaired glutamate uptake leads to recovery failure of neurons from SD. We confirm predictions from our model experimentally by showing that inhibiting astrocytic glutamate uptake using TFB-TBOA nearly quadruples the duration of SD in layers 2-3 of visual cortical slices from juvenile rats. The model equations are either derived purely from first physical principles of electroneutrality, osmosis, and conservation of particles or a combination of these principles and known physiological facts. Accordingly, we claim that our approach can be used as a future guide to investigate the role of glutamate, ion concentrations, and dynamics cell volume in other brain pathologies and normal brain function.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AsuHPRHYqL0" width="1" />

<p>by Phuong Dao, Yoo-Ah Kim, Damian Wojtowicz, Sanna Madan, Roded Sharan, Teresa M. Przytycka</p>

The analysis of the mutational landscape of cancer, including mutual exclusivity and co-occurrence of mutations, has been instrumental in studying the disease. We hypothesized that exploring the interplay between co-occurrence, mutual exclusivity, and functional interactions between genes will further improve our understanding of the disease and help to uncover new relations between cancer driving genes and pathways. To this end, we designed a general framework, BeWith, for identifying modules with different combinations of mutation and interaction patterns. We focused on three different settings of the BeWith schema: (i) BeME-WithFun, in which the relations between modules are enriched with mutual exclusivity, while genes within each module are functionally related; (ii) BeME-WithCo, which combines mutual exclusivity between modules with co-occurrence within modules; and (iii) BeCo-WithMEFun, which ensures co-occurrence between modules, while the within module relations combine mutual exclusivity and functional interactions. We formulated the BeWith framework using Integer Linear Programming (ILP), enabling us to find optimally scoring sets of modules. Our results demonstrate the utility of BeWith in providing novel information about mutational patterns, driver genes, and pathways. In particular, BeME-WithFun helped identify functionally coherent modules that might be relevant for cancer progression. In addition to finding previously well-known drivers, the identified modules pointed to other novel findings such as the interaction between NCOR2 and NCOA3 in breast cancer. Additionally, an application of the BeME-WithCo setting revealed that gene groups differ with respect to their vulnerability to different mutagenic processes, and helped us to uncover pairs of genes with potentially synergistic effects, including a potential synergy between mutations in TP53 and the metastasis related DCC gene. Overall, BeWith not only helped us uncover relations between potential driver genes and pathways, but also provided additional insights on patterns of the mutational landscape, going beyond cancer driving mutations.

<p>by Kevin Drew, Christian L. MÃ¼ller, Richard Bonneau, Edward M. Marcotte</p>

Determining the three dimensional arrangement of proteins in a complex is highly beneficial for uncovering mechanistic function and interpreting genetic variation in coding genes comprising protein complexes. There are several methods for determining co-complex interactions between proteins, among them co-fractionation / mass spectrometry (CF-MS), but it remains difficult to identify directly contacting subunits within a multi-protein complex. Correlation analysis of CF-MS profiles shows promise in detecting protein complexes as a whole but is limited in its ability to infer direct physical contacts among proteins in sub-complexes. To identify direct protein-protein contacts within human protein complexes we learn a sparse conditional dependency graph from approximately 3,000 CF-MS experiments on human cell lines. We show substantial performance gains in estimating direct interactions compared to correlation analysis on a benchmark of large protein complexes with solved three-dimensional structures. We demonstrate the methodâs value in determining the three dimensional arrangement of proteins by making predictions for complexes without known structure (the exocyst and tRNA multi-synthetase complex) and by establishing evidence for the structural position of a recently discovered component of the core human EKC/KEOPS complex, GON7/C14ORF142, providing a more complete 3D model of the complex. Direct contact prediction provides easily calculable additional structural information for large-scale protein complex mapping studies and should be broadly applicable across organisms as more CF-MS datasets become available.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pvQ962AXtfg" width="1" />

Biological networks entail important topological features and patterns critical to understanding interactions within complicated biological systems. Despite a great progress in understanding their structure, much more can be done to improve our inference and network analysis. Spectral methods play a key role in many network-based applications. Fundamental to spectral methods is the Laplacian, a matrix that captures the global structure of the network. Unfortunately, the Laplacian does not take into account intricacies of the networkâs local structure and is sensitive to noise in the network. These two properties are fundamental to biological networks and cannot be ignored. We propose an alternative matrix <i>Vicus</i>. The Vicus matrix captures the local neighborhood structure of the network and thus is more effective at modeling biological interactions. We demonstrate the advantages of Vicus in the context of spectral methods by extensive empirical benchmarking on tasks such as single cell dimensionality reduction, protein module discovery and ranking genes for cancer subtyping. Our experiments show that using Vicus, spectral methods result in more accurate and robust performance in all of these tasks.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/N-68mvTRJW4" width="1" />

A large fraction of the proteins that are being identified as key tumor dependencies represent poor pharmacological targets or lack clinically-relevant small-molecule inhibitors. Availability of fully generalizable approaches for the systematic and efficient prioritization of tumor-context specific protein activity inhibitors would thus have significant translational value. Unfortunately, inhibitor effects on protein activity cannot be directly measured in systematic and proteome-wide fashion by conventional biochemical assays. We introduce OncoLead, a novel network based approach for the systematic prioritization of candidate inhibitors for arbitrary targets of therapeutic interest. <i>In vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> validation confirmed that OncoLead analysis can recapitulate known inhibitors as well as prioritize novel, context-specific inhibitors of difficult targets, such as <i>MYC</i> and <i>STAT3</i>. We used OncoLead to generate the first unbiased drug/regulator interaction map, representing compounds modulating the activity of cancer-relevant transcription factors, with potential in precision medicine.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VxPfG32FVlU" width="1" />

<p>by Daniel E. Carlin, Barry Demchak, Dexter Pratt, Eric Sage, Trey Ideker</p>

Network propagation is an important and widely used algorithm in systems biology, with applications in protein function prediction, disease gene prioritization, and patient stratification. However, up to this point it has required significant expertise to run. Here we extend the popular network analysis program Cytoscape to perform network propagation as an integrated function. Such integration greatly increases the access to network propagation by putting it in the hands of biologists and linking it to the many other types of network analysis and visualization available through Cytoscape. We demonstrate the power and utility of the algorithm by identifying mutations conferring resistance to Vemurafenib.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UR4nnjuvuFI" width="1" />

<p>by Aziz M. Mezlini, Anna Goldenberg</p>

Discovering genetic mechanisms driving complex diseases is a hard problem. Existing methods often lack power to identify the set of responsible genes. Protein-protein interaction networks have been shown to boost power when detecting gene-disease associations. We introduce a Bayesian framework, Conflux, to find disease associated genes from exome sequencing data using networks as a prior. There are two main advantages to using networks within a probabilistic graphical model. First, networks are noisy and incomplete, a substantial impediment to gene discovery. Incorporating networks into the structure of a probabilistic models for gene inference has less impact on the solution than relying on the noisy network structure directly. Second, using a Bayesian framework we can keep track of the uncertainty of each gene being associated with the phenotype rather than returning a fixed list of genes. We first show that using networks clearly improves gene detection compared to individual gene testing. We then show consistently improved performance of Conflux compared to the state-of-the-art diffusion network-based method Hotnet2 and a variety of other network and variant aggregation methods, using randomly generated and literature-reported gene sets. We test Hotnet2 and Conflux on several network configurations to reveal biases and patterns of false positives and false negatives in each case. Our experiments show that our novel Bayesian framework Conflux incorporates many of the advantages of the current state-of-the-art methods, while offering more flexibility and improved power in many gene-disease association scenarios.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kUw0rxsgQDw" width="1" />

<p>by Emine Guven-Maiorov, Chung-Jung Tsai, Ruth Nussinov</p>

Hundreds of different species colonize multicellular organisms making them âmetaorganismsâ. A growing body of data supports the role of microbiota in health and in disease. Grasping the principles of host-microbiota interactions (HMIs) at the molecular level is important since it may provide insights into the mechanisms of infections. The crosstalk between the host and the microbiota may help resolve puzzling questions such as how a microorganism can contribute to both health and disease. Integrated superorganism networks that consider host and microbiota as a wholeâmay uncover their code, clarifying perhaps the most fundamental question: how they modulate immune surveillance. Within this framework, structural HMI networks can uniquely identify potential microbial effectors that target distinct host nodes or interfere with endogenous host interactions, as well as how mutations on either host or microbial proteins affect the interaction. Furthermore, structural HMIs can help identify master host cell regulator nodes and modules whose tweaking by the microbes promote aberrant activity. Collectively, these data can delineate pathogenic mechanisms and thereby help maximize beneficial therapeutics. To date, challenges in experimental techniques limit large-scale characterization of HMIs. Here we highlight an area in its infancy which we believe will increasingly engage the computational community: predicting interactions across kingdoms, and mapping these on the host cellular networks to figure out how commensal and pathogenic microbiota modulate the host signaling and broadly cross-species consequences.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/I1eNXPCZnzk" width="1" />

<p>by Kevin S. Bonham, Melanie I. Stefan</p>

While women are generally underrepresented in STEM fields, there are noticeable differences between fields. For instance, the gender ratio in biology is more balanced than in computer science. We were interested in how this difference is reflected in the interdisciplinary field of computational/quantitative biology. To this end, we examined the proportion of female authors in publications from the PubMed and arXiv databases. There are fewer female authors on research papers in computational biology, as compared to biology in general. This is true across authorship position, year, and journal impact factor. A comparison with arXiv shows that quantitative biology papers have a higher ratio of female authors than computer science papers, placing computational biology in between its two parent fields in terms of gender representation. Both in biology and in computational biology, a female last author increases the probability of other authors on the paper being female, pointing to a potential role of female PIs in influencing the gender balance.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6WjygxNvj58" width="1" />

<p>Many studies in the neurosciences have dealt with the semantic processing of
words or categories, but few have looked into the semantic organization of the
lexicon thought as a system. The present study was designed to try to move
towards this goal, using both electrophysiological and corpus-based data, and
to compare two languages from different families: French and Mandarin Chinese.
</p>
<p>We conducted an EEG-based semantic-decision experiment using 240 words from
eight categories (clothing, parts of a house, tools, vehicles,
fruits/vegetables, animals, body parts, and people) as the material. A
data-analysis method (correspondence analysis) commonly used in computational
linguistics was applied to the electrophysiological signals.
</p>
<p>The present cross-language comparison indicated stability for the following
aspects of the languages' lexical semantic organizations: (1) the
living/nonliving distinction, which showed up as a main factor for both
languages; (2) greater dispersion of the living categories as compared to the
nonliving ones; (3) prototypicality of the \emph{animals} category within the
living categories, and with respect to the living/nonliving distinction; and
(4) the existence of a person-centered reference gradient. Our
electrophysiological analysis indicated stability of the networks at play in
each of these processes. Stability was also observed in the data taken from
word usage in the languages (synonyms and associated words obtained from
textual corpora).

<p>The properties of functional brain networks strongly depend on how their
nodes are chosen. Commonly, nodes are defined by Regions of Interest (ROIs),
pre-determined groupings of fMRI measurement voxels. Earlier, we have
demonstrated that the functional homogeneity of ROIs, captured by their spatial
consistency, varies widely across ROIS in commonly-used brain atlases. Here, we
ask how ROIs behave as nodes of dynamic brain networks. To this end, we use two
measures: spatiotemporal consistency measures changes in spatial consistency
across time and network turnover quantifies the changes in the local network
structure around a ROI. We find that spatial consistency varies non-uniformly
in space and time, which is reflected in the variation of spatiotemporal
consistency across ROIs. Further, we see time-dependent changes in the ROIs'
network neighborhoods, resulting in high network turnover. This turnover is
nonuniformly distributed across ROIs: ROIs with high spatiotemporal consistency
have low network turnover. Finally, we reveal rich internal, voxel-level
correlation structure inside ROIs.Because the internal structure and
connectivity of ROIs vary in time, the common approach of using static node
definitions may be surprisingly inaccurate. Therefore, network neuroscience
would greatly benefit from node definition strategies tailored for dynamical
networks.

<p>Patterns of waxing and waning oscillations, called spindles, are observed in
multiple brain regions during sleep. Spindle are thought to be involved in
memory consolidation. The origin of spindle oscillations is ongoing work but
experimental results point towards the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) as a
likely candidate. The TRN is rich in electrical synapses, also called gap
junctions, which promote synchrony in neural activity. Moreover, gap junctions
undergo activity-dependent long-term plasticity. We hypothesized that gap
junction plasticity can modulate spindle oscillations. We developed a
computational model of gap junction plasticity in recurrent networks of TRN and
thalamocortical neurons (TC). We showed that gap junction coupling can modulate
the TRN-TC network synchrony and that gap junction plasticity is a plausible
mechanism for the generation of sleep-spindles. Finally, our results are robust
to the simulation of pharmacological manipulation of spindles, such as the
administration of propofol, an anesthetics known to generate spindles in
humans.

<p>This paper proposes Deep Hyperalignment (DHA) as a regularized, deep
extension, scalable Hyperalignment (HA) method, which is well-suited for
applying functional alignment to fMRI datasets with nonlinearity,
high-dimensionality (broad ROI), and a large number of subjects. Unlink
previous methods, DHA is not limited by a restricted fixed kernel function.
Further, it uses a parametric approach, rank-$m$ Singular Value Decomposition
(SVD), and stochastic gradient descent for optimization. Therefore, DHA has a
suitable time complexity for large datasets, and DHA does not require the
training data when it computes the functional alignment for a new subject.
Experimental studies on multi-subject fMRI analysis confirm that the DHA method
achieves superior performance to other state-of-the-art HA algorithms.

A long-standing question has been how presynaptic NMDA receptors influence high-frequency evoked neurotransmission but spontaneous release at low rates. Providing resolution, Abrahamsson etÂ al. show that these receptors regulate evoked and spontaneous release via distinct RIM1Î±Î²- and JNK2-dependent mechanisms, respectively.

Single-trial analyses have the potential to uncover meaningful brain dynamics that are obscured when averaging across trials. However, low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can impede the use of single-trial analyses and decoding methods. In this study, we investigate the applicability of a single-trial approach to decode stimulus modality from magnetoencephalography (MEG) high frequency activity. In order to classify the auditory versus visual presentation of words, we combine beamformer source reconstruction with the random forest classification method. To enable group level inference, the classification is embedded in an across-subjects framework. We show that single-trial gamma SNR allows for good classification performance (accuracy across subjects: 66.44%). This implies that the characteristics of high frequency activity have a high consistency across trials and subjects. The random forest classifier assigned informational value to activity in both auditory and visual cortex with high spatial specificity. Across time, gamma power was most informative during stimulus presentation. Among all frequency bands, the 75-95 Hz band was the most informative frequency band in visual as well as in auditory areas. Especially in visual areas, a broad range of gamma frequencies (55-125 Hz) contributed to the successful classification. Thus, we demonstrate the feasibility of single-trial approaches for decoding the stimulus modality across subjects from high frequency activity and describe the discriminative gamma activity in time, frequency, and space.

The ability to process structured sequences is a central feature of natural language but also characterizes many other domains of human cognition. In this fMRI study, we measured brain metabolic response in musicians as they generated structured and non-structured sequences in language and music. We employed a univariate and multivariate cross-classification approach to provide evidence that a common neural code underlies the production of structured sequences across the two domains. Crucially, the common substrate includes the Broca area, a region well known for processing structured sequences in language. These findings have several implications. First, they directly support the hypothesis that language and music share syntactic integration mechanisms. Second, they show that the Broca area is capable of operating supramodally across these two domains. Finally, these results dismiss the recent hypothesis that domain general processes or proximal neural substrates explain the previously observed overlap between neuroimaging activations across the two domains.

We previously demonstrated that the phase of oscillations modulates neural activity representing categorical information using human intracranial recordings and high-frequency activity from local field potentials (Watrous et al., 2015b). We extend these findings here using human single-neuron recordings during a navigation task. Cells with firing rate modulations were observed primarily in entorhinal and frontal cortices. Using a novel oscillation detection algorithm, we identify phase-locked neural firing that encodes information about a person's prospective navigational goal. These results provide evidence for contextual accounts of human MTL function at the single-neuron level and identify phase-coded neuronal firing as a component of the human neural code.

Sleep promotes memory consolidation through unique neuromodulatory activity. However, little is known about the impact of attention during presleep memory encoding on later memory performance. The current study aimed to address the question of whether attentional state prior to encoding, as indexed by alpha oscillatory activity, modulates the consolidation of images across periods of sleep and wake. 22 participants aged 18 to 41 years (mean age = 27.3) viewed 120 emotionally valenced images (positive, negative, neutral) before a 2hr afternoon sleep opportunity and an equivalent period of wake. Following the sleep and wake conditions, participants were required to distinguish between 120 previously seen (target) images and 120 new (distractor) images. Relative alpha power (adjusted according to participants individual alpha frequency) was computed to index attentional state prior to the learning phase. Generalised linear mixed effects modelling revealed memory performance was modulated by attention, such that greater pre-encoding alpha synchronisation promoted memory consolidation after wake, but not sleep. There was no difference in memory performance between positive, negative and neutral stimuli. Modulations in alpha oscillatory activity may help coordinate the flow of information between task-relevant cortical regions and a thalamo-cortical loop that subserves the formation of memory during times of wake but not sleep.

It has been proposed that sleep's contribution to memory consolidation is to reactivate prior encoded information. To elucidate the neural mechanisms carrying reactivation-related mnemonic information, we investigated whether content-specific memory signatures associated with memory reactivation during wakefulness reoccur during subsequent sleep. We show that theta oscillations orchestrate the reactivation of memories, irrespective of the physiological state. Reactivation patterns during sleep autonomously re-emerged at a rate of 1 Hz, indicating a coordination by slow oscillatory activity.

We propose a mathematical and computational model that captures the stimulus-generated Ca2+ transients in the C. elegans ASH sensory neuron. The model is built based on biophysical events and molecular cascades known to unfold as part of neurons' Ca2+ homeostasis mechanism, as well as on Ca2+ signaling events. The state of ion channels is described by their probability of being activated or inactivated, and the remaining molecular states are based on biochemically defined kinetic equations with phenomenological adjustments. We estimate the parameters of the model using experimental data of hyperosmotic stimulus-evoked Ca2++ transients detected with a FRET sensor in young and aged worms, unstressed and exposed to oxidative stress. We use a hybrid optimization method composed of a multi-objective genetic algorithm and nonlinear least-squares to estimate the model parameters. We first obtain the model parameters for young unstressed worms. Next, we use these values of the parameters as a starting point to identify the model parameters for stressed and aged worms. We show that the model, in combination with experimental data, corroborates literature results. In addition, we demonstrate that our model can be used to predict ASH response to complex combinations of stimulation pulses. The proposed model includes for the first time the ASH Ca2+ dynamics observed during both "on" and "off" responses. This mathematical and computational effort is the first to propose a dynamic model of the Ca2+ transients' mechanism in C. elegans neurons, based on biochemical pathways of the cell's Ca2+ homeostasis machinery.

<p>by Mark L. Ioffe, Michael J. Berry II</p>

Recent advances in experimental techniques have allowed the simultaneous recordings of populations of hundreds of neurons, fostering a debate about the nature of the collective structure of population neural activity. Much of this debate has focused on the empirical findings of a phase transition in the parameter space of maximum entropy models describing the measured neural probability distributions, interpreting this phase transition to indicate a critical tuning of the neural code. Here, we instead focus on the possibility that this is a first-order phase transition which provides evidence that the real neural population is in a âstructuredâ, collective state. We show that this collective state is robust to changes in stimulus ensemble and adaptive state. We find that the pattern of pairwise correlations between neurons has a strength that is well within the strongly correlated regime and does not require fine tuning, suggesting that this state is generic for populations of 100+ neurons. We find a clear correspondence between the emergence of a phase transition, and the emergence of attractor-like structure in the inferred energy landscape. A collective state in the neural population, in which neural activity patterns naturally form clusters, provides a consistent interpretation for our results.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/B5PqSxk57oU" width="1" />

<p>Language comprehension engages a cortical network of left frontal and temporal regions. Activity in this network is language-selective, showing virtually no modulation by nonlinguistic tasks. In addition, language comprehension engages a second network consisting of bilateral frontal, parietal, cingulate, and insular regions. Activity in this "multiple demand" (MD) network scales with comprehension difficulty, but also with cognitive effort across a wide range of nonlinguistic tasks in a domain-general fashion. Given the functional dissociation between the language and MD networks, their respective contributions to comprehension are likely distinct, yet such differences remain elusive. Prior neuroimaging studies have suggested that activity in each network covaries with some linguistic features that, behaviorally, influence on-line processing and comprehension. This sensitivity of the language and MD networks to local input characteristics has often been interpreted, implicitly or explicitly, as evidence that both networks track linguistic input closely, and in a manner consistent across individuals. Here, we used fMRI to directly test this assumption by comparing the BOLD signal time courses in each network across different people (<i>n</i> = 45, men and women) listening to the same story. Language network activity showed fewer individual differences, indicative of closer input tracking, whereas MD network activity was more idiosyncratic and, moreover, showed lower reliability within an individual across repetitions of a story. These findings constrain cognitive models of language comprehension by suggesting a novel distinction between the processes implemented in the language and MD networks.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Language comprehension recruits both language-specific mechanisms and domain-general mechanisms that are engaged in many cognitive processes. In the human cortex, language-selective mechanisms are implemented in the left-lateralized "core language network", whereas domain-general mechanisms are implemented in the bilateral "multiple demand" (MD) network. Here, we report the first direct comparison of the respective contributions of these networks to naturalistic story comprehension. Using a novel combination of neuroimaging approaches we find that MD regions track stories less closely than language regions. This finding constrains the possible contributions of the MD network to comprehension, contrasts with accounts positing that this network has continuous access to linguistic input, and suggests a new typology of comprehension processes based on their extent of input tracking.</p>

<p>Classical schemes of basal ganglia organization posit that parkinsonian movement difficulties presenting after striatal dopamine depletion stem from the disproportionate firing rates of spiny projection neurons (SPNs) therein. There remains, however, a pressing need to elucidate striatal SPN firing in the context of the synchronized network oscillations that are abnormally exaggerated in corticalâbasal ganglia circuits in parkinsonism. To address this, we recorded unit activities in the dorsal striatum of dopamine-intact and dopamine-depleted rats during two brain states, respectively defined by cortical slow-wave activity (SWA) and activation. Dopamine depletion escalated striatal net output but had contrasting effects on "direct pathway" SPNs (dSPNs) and "indirect pathway" SPNs (iSPNs); their firing rates became imbalanced, and they disparately engaged in network oscillations. Disturbed striatal activity dynamics relating to the slow (~1 Hz) oscillations prevalent during SWA partly generalized to the exaggerated beta-frequency (15â30 Hz) oscillations arising during cortical activation. In both cases, SPNs exhibited higher incidences of phase-locked firing to ongoing cortical oscillations, and SPN ensembles showed higher levels of rhythmic correlated firing, after dopamine depletion. Importantly, in dopamine-depleted striatum, a widespread population of iSPNs, which often displayed excessive firing rates and aberrant phase-locked firing to cortical beta oscillations, preferentially and excessively synchronized their firing at beta frequencies. Conversely, dSPNs were neither hyperactive nor synchronized to a large extent during cortical activation. These data collectively demonstrate a cell type-selective entrainment of SPN firing to parkinsonian beta oscillations. We conclude that a population of overactive, excessively synchronized iSPNs could orchestrate these pathological rhythms in basal ganglia circuits.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Chronic depletion of dopamine from the striatum, a part of the basal ganglia, causes some symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Here, we elucidate how dopamine depletion alters striatal neuron firing <i>in vivo</i>, with an emphasis on defining whether and how spiny projection neurons (SPNs) engage in the synchronized beta-frequency (15â30 Hz) oscillations that become pathologically exaggerated throughout basal ganglia circuits in parkinsonism. We discovered that a select population of so-called "indirect pathway" SPNs not only fire at abnormally high rates, but are also particularly prone to being recruited to exaggerated beta oscillations. Our results provide an important link between two complementary theories that explain the presentation of disease symptoms on the basis of changes in firing rate or firing synchronization/rhythmicity.</p>

<p>Dendritic spines are key elements underlying synaptic integration and cellular plasticity, but many features of these important structures are not known or are controversial. We examined these properties using newly developed simultaneous sodium and calcium imaging with single-spine resolution in pyramidal neurons in rat hippocampal slices from either sex. Indicators for both ions were loaded through the somatic patch pipette, which also recorded electrical responses. Fluorescence changes were detected with a high-speed, low-noise CCD camera. Following subthreshold electrical stimulation, postsynaptic sodium entry is almost entirely through AMPA receptors with little contribution from entry through NMDA receptors or voltage-gated sodium channels. Sodium removal from the spine head is through rapid diffusion out to the dendrite through the spine neck with a half-removal time of ~16 ms, which suggests the neck has low resistance. Peak [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> changes during single EPSPs are ~5 mm. Stronger electrical stimulation evoked small plateau potentials that had significant longer-lasting localized [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increases mediated through NMDA receptors.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Dendritic spines, small structures that are difficult to investigate, are important elements in the fundamental processes of synaptic integration and plasticity. The main tool for examining these structures has been calcium imaging. However, the kinds of information that calcium imaging reveals is limited. We used newly developed, high-speed, simultaneous sodium and calcium imaging to examine ion dynamics in spines in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. We found that following single subthreshold synaptic activation most sodium entry was through AMPA receptors and not through NMDA receptors or through voltage-gated sodium channels and that the spine neck is not a significant resistance barrier. Most spine mechanisms are linear. However, regenerative NMDA conductances can be activated with stronger stimulation.</p>

<p>The regulated transport of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) to the synaptic membrane is a key mechanism to determine the strength of excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain. In this work, we uncovered a new role for the microtubule-associated protein MAP1B in modulating access of AMPARs to the postsynaptic membrane. Using mice and rats of either sex, we show that MAP1B light chain (LC) accumulates in the somatodendritic compartment of hippocampal neurons, where it forms immobile complexes on microtubules that limit vesicular transport. These complexes restrict AMPAR dendritic mobility, leading to the intracellular trapping of receptors and impairing their access to the dendritic surface and spines. Accordingly, increasing MAP1B-LC expression depresses AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission. This effect is specific for the GluA2 subunit of the AMPAR and requires glutamate receptor interacting protein 1 (GRIP1) interaction with MAP1B-LC. Therefore, MAP1B-LC represents an alternative link between GRIP1-AMPARs and microtubules that does not result in productive transport, but rather limits AMPAR availability for synaptic insertion, with a direct impact on synaptic transmission.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The ability of neurons to modify their synaptic connections, known as synaptic plasticity, is accepted as the cellular basis for learning and memory. One mechanism for synaptic plasticity is the regulated addition and removal of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) at excitatory synapses. In this study, we found that a microtubule-associated protein, MAP1B light chain (MAP1B-LC), participates in this process. MAP1B-LC forms immobile complexes along dendrites. These complexes limit intracellular vesicular trafficking and trap AMPARs inside the dendritic shaft. In this manner, MAP1B restricts the access of AMPARs to dendritic spines and the postsynaptic membrane, contributing to downregulating synaptic transmission.</p>

<p>Declarative memory recall is thought to involve the reinstatement of neural activity patterns that occurred previously during encoding. Consistent with this view, greater similarity between patterns of activity recorded during encoding and retrieval has been found to predict better memory performance in a number of studies. Recent models have argued that neural oscillations may be crucial to reinstatement for successful memory retrieval. However, to date, no causal evidence has been provided to support this theory, nor has the impact of oscillatory electrical brain stimulation during encoding and retrieval been assessed. To explore this we used transcranial alternating current stimulation over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of human participants [<i>n</i> = 70, 45 females; age mean (SD) = 22.12 (2.16)] during a declarative memory task. Participants received either the same frequency during encoding and retrieval (60â60 or 90â90 Hz) or different frequencies (60â90 or 90â60 Hz). When frequencies matched there was a significant memory improvement (at both 60 and 90 Hz) relative to sham stimulation. No improvement occurred when frequencies mismatched. Our results provide support for the role of oscillatory reinstatement in memory retrieval.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Recent neurobiological models of memory have argued that large-scale neural oscillations are reinstated to support successful memory retrieval. Here we used transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to test these models. tACS has recently been shown to induce neural oscillations at the frequency stimulated. We stimulated over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during a declarative memory task involving learning a set of words. We found that tACS applied at the same frequency during encoding and retrieval enhances memory. We also find no difference between the two applied frequencies. Thus our results are consistent with the proposal that reinstatement of neural oscillations during retrieval supports successful memory retrieval.</p>

<p>Remyelination failure by oligodendrocytes contributes to the functional impairment that characterizes the demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis (MS). Since incomplete remyelination will irreversibly damage axonal connections, treatments effectively promoting remyelination are pivotal in halting disease progression. Our previous findings suggest that fibronectin aggregates, as an environmental factor, contribute to remyelination failure by perturbing oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) maturation. Here, we aim at elucidating whether exogenously added gangliosides (i.e., cell surface lipids with a potential to modulate signaling pathways) could counteract fibronectin-mediated inhibition of OPC maturation. Exclusive exposure of rat oligodendrocytes to GD1a, but not other gangliosides, overcomes aggregated fibronectin-induced inhibition of myelin membrane formation, <i>in vitro</i>, and OPC differentiation in fibronectin aggregate containing cuprizone-induced demyelinated lesions in male mice. GD1a exerts its effect on OPCs by inducing their proliferation and, at a late stage, by modulating OPC maturation. Kinase activity profiling revealed that GD1a activated a protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent signaling pathway and increased phosphorylation of the transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein. Consistently, the effect of GD1a in restoring myelin membrane formation in the presence of fibronectin aggregates was abolished by the PKA inhibitor H89, whereas the effect of GD1a was mimicked by the PKA activator dibutyryl-cAMP. Together, GD1a overcomes the inhibiting effect of aggregated fibronectin on OPC maturation by activating a PKA-dependent signaling pathway. Given the persistent presence of fibronectin aggregates in MS lesions, ganglioside GD1a might act as a potential novel therapeutic tool to selectively modulate the detrimental signaling environment that precludes remyelination.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> As an environmental factor, aggregates of the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin perturb the maturation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), thereby impeding remyelination, in the demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis (MS). Here we demonstrate that exogenous addition of ganglioside GD1a overcomes the inhibiting effect of aggregated fibronectin on OPC maturation, both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, by activating a PKA-dependent signaling pathway. We propose that targeted delivery of GD1a to MS lesions may act as a potential novel molecular tool to boost maturation of resident OPCs to overcome remyelination failure and halt disease progression.</p>

<p>Increased p25, a proteolytic fragment of the regulatory subunit p35, is known to induce aberrant activity of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), which is associated with neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease. Previously, we showed that replacing endogenous p35 with the noncleavable mutant p35 (p35) attenuated amyloidosis and improved cognitive function in a familial Alzheimer's disease mouse model. Here, to address the role of p25/Cdk5 in tauopathy, we generated double-transgenic mice by crossing mice overexpressing mutant human tau (P301S) with <i>p35KI</i> mice. We observed significant reduction of phosphorylated tau and its seeding activity in the brain of double transgenic mice compared with the P301S mice. Furthermore, synaptic loss and impaired LTP at hippocampal CA3 region of <i>P301S</i> mice were attenuated by blocking p25 generation. To further validate the role of p25/Cdk5 in tauopathy, we used frontotemporal dementia patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) carrying the Tau P301L mutation and generated P301L:p35KI isogenic iPSC lines using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. We created cerebral organoids from the isogenic iPSCs and found that blockade of p25 generation reduced levels of phosphorylated tau and increased expression of synaptophysin. Together, these data demonstrate a crucial role for p25/Cdk5 in mediating tau-associated pathology and suggest that inhibition of this kinase can remedy neurodegenerative processes in the presence of pathogenic tau mutation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Accumulation of p25 results in aberrant Cdk5 activation and induction of numerous pathological phenotypes, such as neuroinflammation, synaptic loss, AÎ² accumulation, and tau hyperphosphorylation. However, it was not clear whether p25/Cdk5 activity is necessary for the progression of these pathological changes. We recently developed the <i>p35KI</i> transgenic mouse that is deficient in p25 generation and Cdk5 hyperactivation. In this study, we used this mouse model to elucidate the role of p25/Cdk5 in FTD mutant tau-mediated pathology. We also used a frontotemporal dementia patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell carrying the Tau P301L mutation and generated isogenic lines in which p35 is replaced with noncleavable mutant p35. Our data suggest that p25/Cdk5 plays an important role in tauopathy in both mouse and human model systems.</p>

<p>Different cortical regions processing distinct information, such as the hippocampus and the neocortex, share common cellular components and circuit motifs but form unique networks by modifying these cardinal units. Cortical circuits include diverse types of GABAergic interneurons (INs) that shape activity of excitatory principal neurons (PNs). Canonical IN types conserved across distinct cortical regions have been defined by their morphological, electrophysiological, and neurochemical properties. However, it remains largely unknown whether canonical IN types undergo specific modifications in distinct cortical regions and display "regional variants." It is also poorly understood whether such phenotypic variations are shaped by early specification or regional cellular environment. The chandelier cell (ChC) is a highly stereotyped IN type that innervates axon initial segments of PNs and thus serves as a good model with which to address this issue. Here, we show that Cadherin-6 (Cdh6), a homophilic cell adhesion molecule, is a reliable marker of ChCs and <i>Cdh6-CreER</i> mice (both sexes) provide genetic access to hippocampal ChCs (h-ChCs). We demonstrate that, compared with neocortical ChCs (nc-ChCs), h-ChCs cover twice as much area and innervate twice as many PNs. Interestingly, a subclass of h-ChCs exhibits calretinin (CR) expression, which is not found in nc-ChCs. Furthermore, we find that h-ChCs appear to be born earlier than nc-ChCs. Surprisingly, despite the difference in temporal origins, ChCs display host-region-dependent axonal/synaptic organization and CR expression when transplanted heterotopically. These results suggest that local cellular environment plays a critical role in shaping terminal phenotypes of regional IN variants in the hippocampus and the neocortex.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Canonical interneuron (IN) types conserved across distinct cortical regions such as the hippocampus and the neocortex are defined by morphology, physiology, and gene expression. However, it remains unknown whether they display phenotypic variations in different cortical regions. In addition, it is unclear whether terminal phenotypes of regional IN variants belonging to a canonical IN type are determined intrinsically or extrinsically. Our results provide evidence of striking differences in axonal/synaptic organization and calretinin expression between hippocampal chandelier cells (ChCs) and neocortical ChCs. They also reveal that local cellular environment in distinct cortical regions regulates these terminal phenotypes. Therefore, our study suggests that local cortical environment shapes the phenotypes of regional IN variants, which may be required for unique circuit operations in distinct cortical regions.</p>

<p>Neurotransmission plays an essential role in neural circuit formation in the central nervous system (CNS). Although neurotransmission has been recently clarified as a key modulator of retinal circuit development, the roles of individual synaptic transmissions are not yet fully understood. In the current study, we investigated the role of neurotransmission from photoreceptor cells to ON bipolar cells in development using mutant mouse lines of both sexes in which this transmission is abrogated. We found that deletion of the ON bipolar cation channel TRPM1 results in the abnormal contraction of rod bipolar terminals and a decreased number of their synaptic connections with amacrine cells. In contrast, these histological alterations were not caused by a disruption of total glutamate transmission due to loss of the ON bipolar glutamate receptor mGluR6 or the photoreceptor glutamate transporter VGluT1. In addition, <i>TRPM1</i> deficiency led to the reduction of total dendritic length, branch numbers, and cell body size in AII amacrine cells. Activated GoÎ±, known to close the TRPM1 channel, interacted with TRPM1 and induced the contraction of rod bipolar terminals. Furthermore, overexpression of Channelrhodopsin-2 partially rescued rod bipolar cell development in the <i>TRPM1</i><sup>â/â</sup> retina, whereas the rescue effect by a constitutively closed form of TRPM1 was lower than that by the native form. Our results suggest that TRPM1 channel opening is essential for rod bipolar pathway establishment in development.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neurotransmission has been recognized recently as a key modulator of retinal circuit development in the CNS. However, the roles of individual synaptic transmissions are not yet fully understood. In the current study, we focused on neurotransmission between rod photoreceptor cells and rod bipolar cells in the retina. We used genetically modified mouse models which abrogate each step of neurotransmission: presynaptic glutamate release, postsynaptic glutamate reception, or transduction channel function. We found that the TRPM1 transduction channel is required for the development of rod bipolar cells and their synaptic formation with subsequent neurons, independently of glutamate transmission. This study advances our understanding of neurotransmission-mediated retinal circuit refinement.</p>

<p>Activity-dependent synaptic plasticity plays a critical role in the refinement of circuitry during postnatal development and may be disrupted in conditions that cause intellectual disability, such as Down syndrome (DS). To test this hypothesis, visual cortical plasticity was assessed in Ts65Dn mice that harbor a chromosomal duplication syntenic to human chromosome 21q. We find that Ts65Dn mice demonstrate a defect in ocular dominance plasticity (ODP) following monocular deprivation. This phenotype is similar to that of transgenic mice that express amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is duplicated in DS and in Ts65DN mice; however, normalizing <i>APP</i> gene copy number in Ts65Dn mice fails to rescue plasticity. Ts1Rhr mice harbor a duplication of the telomeric third of the Ts65Dn-duplicated sequence and demonstrate the same ODP defect, suggesting a gene or genes sufficient to drive the phenotype are located in that smaller duplication. In addition, we find that Ts65Dn mice demonstrate an abnormality in olfactory system connectivity, a defect in the refinement of connections to second-order neurons in the olfactory bulb. Ts1Rhr mice do not demonstrate a defect in glomerular refinement, suggesting that distinct genes or sets of genes underlie visual and olfactory system phenotypes. Importantly, these data suggest that developmental plasticity and connectivity are impaired in sensory systems in DS model mice, that such defects may contribute to functional impairment in DS, and that these phenotypes, present in male and female mice, provide novel means for examining the genetic and molecular bases for neurodevelopmental impairment in model mice <i>in vivo</i>.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our understanding of the basis for intellectual impairment in Down syndrome is hindered by the large number of genes duplicated in Trisomy 21 and a lack of understanding of the effect of disease pathology on the function of neural circuits <i>in vivo</i>. This work describes early postnatal developmental abnormalities in visual and olfactory sensory systems in Down syndrome model mice, which provide insight into defects in the function of neural circuits <i>in vivo</i> and provide an approach for exploring the genetic and molecular basis for impairment in the disease. In addition, these findings raise the possibility that basic dysfunction in primary sensory circuitry may illustrate mechanisms important for global learning and cognitive impairment in Down syndrome patients.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/41/9871?rss=1">Visual Responses in FEF, Unlike V1, Primarily Reflect When the Visual Context Renders a Receptive Field Salient</a></h4>

<p>When light falls within a neuronal visual receptive field (RF) the resulting activity is referred to as the visual response. Recent work suggests this activity is in response to both the visual stimulation and the abrupt appearance, or salience, of the presentation. Here we present a novel method for distinguishing the two, based on the timing of random and nonrandom presentations. We examined these contributions in frontal eye field (FEF; <i>N</i> = 51) and as a comparison, an early stage in the primary visual cortex (V1; <i>N</i> = 15) of male monkeys (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>). An array of identical stimuli was presented within and outside the neuronal RF while we manipulated salience by varying the time between stimulus presentations. We hypothesized that the rapid presentation would reduce salience (the sudden appearance within the visual field) of a stimulus at any one location, and thus decrease responses driven by salience in the RF. We found that when the interstimulus interval decreased from 500 to 16 ms there was an approximate 79% reduction in the FEF response compared with an estimated 17% decrease in V1. This reduction in FEF response for rapid presentation was evident even when the random sequence preceding a stimulus did not stimulate the RF for 500 ms. The time course of these response changes in FEF suggest that salience is represented much earlier (&lt;100 ms following stimulus onset) than previously estimated. Our results suggest that the contribution of salience dominates at higher levels of the visual system.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The neuronal responses in early visual processing [e.g., primary visual cortex (V1)] reflect primarily the retinal stimulus. Processing in higher visual areas is modulated by a combination of the visual stimulation and contextual factors, such as salience, but identifying these components separately has been difficult. Here we quantified these contributions at a late stage of visual processing [frontal eye field (FEF)] and as a comparison, an early stage in V1. Our results suggest that as visual information continues through higher levels of processing the neural responses are no longer driven primarily by the visual stimulus in the receptive field, but by the broader context that stimulus definesâvery different from current views about visual signals in FEF.</p>

<p>Astrocytes spontaneously release glutamate (Glut) as a gliotransmitter (GT), resulting in the generation of extrasynaptic NMDAR-mediated slow inward currents (SICs) in neighboring neurons, which can increase local neuronal excitability. However, there is a deficit in our knowledge of the factors that control spontaneous astrocyte GT release and the extent of its influence. We found that, in rat brain slices, increasing the supply of the physiological transmitter Glut increased the frequency and signaling charge of SICs over an extended period. This phenomenon was replicated by exogenous preexposure to the amino acid D-aspartate (D-Asp). Using D-Asp as a "false" GT, we determined the extent of local neuron excitation by GT release in ventrobasal thalamus, CA1 hippocampus, and somatosensory cortex. By analyzing synchronized neuronal NMDAR-mediated excitation, we found that the properties of the excitation were conserved in different brain areas. In the three areas, astrocyte-derived GT release synchronized groups of neurons at distances of &gt;;200 Î¼m. Individual neurons participated in more than one synchronized population, indicating that individual neurons can be excited by more than one astrocyte and that individual astrocytes may determine a neuron's synchronized network. The results confirm that astrocytes can act as excitatory nodes that can influence neurons over a significant range in a number of brain regions. Our findings further suggest that chronic elevation of ambient Glut levels can lead to increased GT Glut release, which may be relevant in some pathological states.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Astrocytes spontaneously release glutamate (Glut) and other gliotransmitters (GTs) that can modify neuronal activity. Exposing brain slices to Glut and D-aspartate (D-Asp) before recording resulted in an increase in frequency of GT-mediated astrocyteâneuron signaling. Using D-Asp, it was possible to investigate the effects of specific GT release at neuronal NMDARs. Calcium imaging showed synchronized activity in groups of neurons in cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus. The size of these populations was similar in all areas and some neurons were involved in more than one synchronous group. The findings show that GT release is supply dependent and that the properties of the signaling and activated networks are largely conserved between different brain areas.</p>

<p>Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) loss causes Fragile X syndrome (FXS), a major disorder characterized by autism, intellectual disability, hyperactivity, and seizures. FMRP is both an RNA- and channel-binding regulator, with critical roles in neural circuit formation and function. However, it remains unclear how these FMRP activities relate to each other and how dysfunction in their absence underlies FXS neurological symptoms. In testing circuit level defects in the <i>Drosophila</i> FXS model, we discovered a completely unexpected and highly robust neuronal dye iontophoresis phenotype in the well mapped giant fiber (GF) circuit. Controlled dye injection into the GF interneuron results in a dramatic increase in dye uptake in neurons lacking FMRP. Transgenic wild-type FMRP reintroduction rescues the mutant defect, demonstrating a specific FMRP requirement. This phenotype affects only small dyes, but is independent of dye charge polarity. Surprisingly, the elevated dye iontophoresis persists in <i>shaking B</i> mutants that eliminate gap junctions and dye coupling among GF circuit neurons. We therefore used a wide range of manipulations to investigate the dye uptake defect, including timed injection series, pharmacology and ion replacement, and optogenetic activity studies. The results show that FMRP strongly limits the rate of dye entry via a cytosolic mechanism. This study reveals an unexpected new phenotype in a physical property of central neurons lacking FMRP that could underlie aspects of FXS disruption of neural function.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> FXS is a leading heritable cause of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders. Although researchers established the causal link with FMRP loss &gt;;25 years ago, studies continue to reveal diverse FMRP functions. The <i>Drosophila</i> FXS model is key to discovering new FMRP roles, because of its genetic malleability and individually identified neuron maps. Taking advantage of a well characterized <i>Drosophila</i> neural circuit, we discovered that neurons lacking FMRP take up dramatically more current-injected small dye. After examining many neuronal properties, we determined that this dye defect is cytoplasmic and occurs due to a highly elevated dye iontophoresis rate. We also report several new factors affecting neuron dye uptake. Understanding how FMRP regulates iontophoresis should reveal new molecular factors underpinning FXS dysfunction.</p>

<p>The proper formation of synapsesâspecialized unitary structures formed between two neuronsâis critical to mediating information flow in the brain. Synaptic cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) are thought to participate in the initiation of the synapse formation process. However, <i>in vivo</i> functional analysis demonstrates that most well known synaptic CAMs regulate synaptic maturation and plasticity rather than synapse formation, suggesting that either CAMs work synergistically in the process of forming synapses or more CAMs remain to be found. By screening for unknown CAMs using a co-culture system, we revealed that protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type O (PTPRO) is a potent CAM that induces the formation of artificial synapse clusters in co-cultures of human embryonic kidney 293 cells and hippocampal neurons cultured from newborn mice regardless of gender. PTPRO was enriched in the mouse brain and localized to postsynaptic sites at excitatory synapses. The overexpression of PTPRO in cultured hippocampal neurons increased the number of synapses and the frequency of miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs). The knock-down (KD) of PTPRO expression in cultured neurons by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) reduced the number of synapses and the frequencies of the mEPSCs. The effects of shRNA KD were rescued by expressing either full-length PTPRO or a truncated PTPRO lacking the cytoplasmic domain. Consistent with these results, the N-terminal extracellular domain of PTPRO was required for its synaptogenic activity in the co-culture assay. Our data show that PTPRO is a synaptic CAM that serves as a potent initiator of the formation of excitatory synapses.</p>

Using loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches, we show that PTPRO promotes the formation of excitatory synapses. The N-terminal extracellular domain of PTPRO was required for its synaptogenic activity in cultured hippocampal neurons and the co-culture assay. Together, our data show that PTPRO is a synaptic CAM that serves as a potent initiator of synapse formation.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/41/9819?rss=1">T-Cell Mediation of Pregnancy Analgesia Affecting Chronic Pain in Mice</a></h4>

<p>It has been reported consistently that many female chronic pain sufferers have an attenuation of symptoms during pregnancy. Rats display increased pain tolerance during pregnancy due to an increase in opioid receptors in the spinal cord. Past studies did not consider the role of non-neuronal cells, which are now known to play an important role in chronic pain processing. Using an inflammatory (complete Freund's adjuvant) or neuropathic (spared nerve injury) model of persistent pain, we observed that young adult female mice in early pregnancy switch from a microglia-independent to a microglia-dependent pain hypersensitivity mechanism. During late pregnancy, female mice show no evidence of chronic pain whatsoever. This pregnancy-related analgesia is reversible by intrathecal administration of naloxone, suggesting an opioid-mediated mechanism; pharmacological and genetic data suggest the importance of -opioid receptors. We also observe that T-cell-deficient (<i>nude</i> and <i>Rag1</i>-null mutant) pregnant mice do not exhibit pregnancy analgesia, which can be rescued with the adoptive transfer of CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from late-pregnant wild-type mice. These results suggest that T cells are a mediator of the opioid analgesia exhibited during pregnancy.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Chronic pain symptoms often subside during pregnancy. This pregnancy-related analgesia has been demonstrated for acute pain in rats. Here, we show that pregnancy analgesia can produce a complete cessation of chronic pain behaviors in mice. We show that the phenomenon is dependent on pregnancy hormones (estrogen and progesterone), -opioid receptors, and T cells of the adaptive immune system. These findings add to the recent but growing evidence of sex-specific T-cell involvement in chronic pain processing.</p>

<p>In Parkinson's disease, intracellular Î±-synuclein inclusions form in neurons. We suggest that prion-like behavior of Î±-synuclein is a key component in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis. Although multiple molecular changes are involved in the triggering of the disease process, we propose that neuron-to-neuron transfer is a crucial event that is essential for Lewy pathology to spread from one brain region to another. In this review, we describe key findings in human postmortem brains, cultured cells, and animal models of disease that support the idea that Î±-synuclein can act as a prion. We consider potential triggers of the Î±-synuclein misfolding and why the aggregates escape cellular degradation under disease conditions. We also discuss whether different strains of Î±-synuclein fibrils can underlie differences in cellular and regional distribution of aggregates in different synucleinopathies. Our conclusion is that Î±-synuclein probably acts as a prion in human diseases, and a deeper understanding of this step in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease can facilitate the development of disease-modifying therapies in the future.</p>

<p>The notion that prion-like spreading of misfolded Î±-synuclein (Î±-SYN) causes Parkinson's disease (PD) has received a great deal of attention. Although attractive in its simplicity, the hypothesis is difficult to reconcile with postmortem analysis of human brains and connectome-mapping studies. An alternative hypothesis is that PD pathology is governed by regional or cell-autonomous factors. Although these factors provide an explanation for the pattern of neuronal loss in PD, they do not readily explain the apparently staged distribution of Lewy pathology in many PD brains, the feature of the disease that initially motivated the spreading hypothesis by Braak and colleagues. While each hypothesis alone has its shortcomings, a synthesis of the two can explain much of what we know about the etiopathology of PD.</p>

<p>Adaptation of neural responses due to the history of sensory input has been observed across all sensory modalities. However, the computational role of adaptation is not fully understood, especially when one considers neural coding problems in which adaptation increases the ambiguity of the neural responses to simple stimuli. To address this, we quantified the impact of adaptation on the information conveyed by thalamic neurons about paired whisker stimuli in male rat. At the single neuron level, although paired-pulse adaptation reduces the information about the present stimulus, the information per spike increases. Moreover, the adapted response can convey significant amounts of information about whether, when and where a previous stimulus occurred. At the population level, ambiguity of the adapted responses about the present stimulus can be compensated for by large numbers of neurons. Therefore, paired-pulse adaptation does not reduce the discriminability of simple stimuli. It provides information about the spatiotemporal context of stimulus history.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The present work provides a computational framework that demonstrates how adaptation allows neurons to encode spatiotemporal dynamics of stimulus history.</p>

<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>: To retrospectively analyze the effect of plasma exchange (PLEX, yes=PLEX+, no=PLEX-) and steroids administration timing (prophylactically âproST- or therapeutically âtherST-) on the longitudinal clinical course of patients with natalizumab related progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and full blown immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (PML-IRIS).</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b>: Clinical and radiological data of 42 Italian patients with PML were analyzed. Patient's data are available until 12 months after PML diagnosis. PLEX and steroids treatment as time-dependent covariates were entered in: i) a Cox model to investigate their impact on full blown PML-IRIS latency; ii) an ANOVA to investigate their impact on IRIS duration; iii) a linear mixed model to assess their impact on the longitudinal clinical course (measured by means of EDSS).</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>: Treatment with PLEX was not associated to PML-IRIS latency (HR=1.05, p=0.92), but once IRIS emerged, its duration was significantly longer in patients who underwent PLEX (101 vs 54 days in PLEX+ and PLEX- patients, p=0.028). Receiving proST vs therST was not associated to IRIS latency (HR=0.67, p=0.39) or duration (p=0.95). Patients who underwent proST had a significant higher EDSS increase during PML (0.09 EDSS points per month, p=0.04) as compared to those who had therST.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation</b>: this study highlights that: i) caution on the use of PLEX should be considered as the current data do not support a beneficial effect of PLEX; ii) caution on the early use of steroids is suggested since their prophylactic use to prevent full blown PML-IRIS seems to negatively impact on the longitudinal disability course.

<p>We perform an average case analysis of the generalization dynamics of large
neural networks trained using gradient descent. We study the
practically-relevant "high-dimensional" regime where the number of free
parameters in the network is on the order of or even larger than the number of
examples in the dataset. Using random matrix theory and exact solutions in
linear models, we derive the generalization error and training error dynamics
of learning and analyze how they depend on the dimensionality of data and
signal to noise ratio of the learning problem. We find that the dynamics of
gradient descent learning naturally protect against overtraining and
overfitting in large networks. Overtraining is worst at intermediate network
sizes, when the effective number of free parameters equals the number of
samples, and thus can be reduced by making a network smaller or larger.
Additionally, in the high-dimensional regime, low generalization error requires
starting with small initial weights. We then turn to non-linear neural
networks, and show that making networks very large does not harm their
generalization performance. On the contrary, it can in fact reduce
overtraining, even without early stopping or regularization of any sort. We
identify two novel phenomena underlying this behavior in overcomplete models:
first, there is a frozen subspace of the weights in which no learning occurs
under gradient descent; and second, the statistical properties of the
high-dimensional regime yield better-conditioned input correlations which
protect against overtraining. We demonstrate that naive application of
worst-case theories such as Rademacher complexity are inaccurate in predicting
the generalization performance of deep neural networks, and derive an
alternative bound which incorporates the frozen subspace and conditioning
effects and qualitatively matches the behavior observed in simulation.

<p>Infants with autism were recently found to have prolonged Auditory Brainstem
Response (ABR); however, at older ages, findings are contradictory. We compared
ABR differences between participants with autism and controls with respect to
age using a meta-analysis. Data sources included MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of
Science, Google Scholar, HOLLIS and ScienceDirect from their inception to June
2016. The 25 studies that were included had a total of 1349 participants (727
participants with autism and 622 controls) and an age range of 0-40 years.
Prolongation of wave V in autism had a significant negative correlation with
age (R2=0.23; P=.01). The 22 studies below age 18 years showed a significantly
prolonged wave V in autism (Standard Mean Difference=0.6 [95% CI, 0.5 to 0.8];
P&lt;.001). The 3 studies above 18 years of age showed a significantly shorter
wave V in autism (SMD=-0.6 [95% CI, -1.0 to -0.2]; P=.004). Prolonged ABR was
consistent in infants and children with autism, suggesting it can serve as an
autism biomarker at infancy. As the ABR is routinely used to screen infants for
hearing impairment, the opportunity for replication studies is extensive.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05522">A novel method linking neural connectivity to behavioral fluctuations: Behavior-Regressed Connectivity. (arXiv:1606.05522v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</a></h4>

<p>Background: During an experimental session, behavioral performance
fluctuates, yet most neuroimaging analyses of functional connectivity derive a
single connectivity pattern. These conventional connectivity approaches assume
that since the underlying behavior of the task remains constant, the
connectivity pattern is also constant.
</p>
<p>New Method: We introduce a novel method, behavior-regressed connectivity
(BRC), to directly examine behavioral fluctuations within an experimental
session and capture their relationship to changes in functional connectivity.
This method employs the weighted phase lag index (WPLI) applied to a window of
trials with a weighting function. Using two datasets, the BRC results are
compared to conventional connectivity results during two time windows: the one
second before stimulus onset to identify predictive relationships, and the one
second after onset to capture task-dependent relationships.
</p>
<p>Results: In both tasks, we replicate the expected results for the
conventional connectivity analysis, and extend our understanding of the
brain-behavior relationship using the BRC analysis, demonstrating
subject-specific connectivity patterns that correspond to both positive and
negative relationships with behavior.
</p>
<p>Comparison with Existing Method(s): Conventional connectivity analyses assume
a consistent relationship between behaviors and functional connectivity, but
the BRC method examines performance variability within an experimental session
to understand dynamic connectivity and transient behavior.
</p>
<p>Conclusion: The BRC approach examines connectivity as it covaries with
behavior to complement the knowledge of underlying neural activity derived from
conventional connectivity analyses. Within this framework, BRC may be
implemented for the purpose of understanding performance variability both
within and between participants.

Neuroscience as a broad and growing discipline encompasses many fields of study, from molecular to systems-level, including cognitive and theoretical domains. These are exciting times for neuroscience, when many of these traditionally separate efforts are beginning to converge, and one can envision the day we may be able to respond to some fundamental questions, such as how molecules, cells, and circuits interplay to make us feel, act, and ultimately understand who we are. I am delighted to be the new Editor-in-Chief of Neuron, whose mission is to continue to disseminate the highest quality work in neuroscience.

How nuclear architecture contributes to transcriptional regulation in neural progenitor cells (NeuPCs) is poorly understood. A study by Toda etÂ al. (2017) now shows that the nuclear pore protein Nup153 associates with the Sox2 transcription factor in the regulation of NeuPC maintenance and neural fate.

Pease-Raissi etÂ al. show that the anti-apoptotic Bcl2 family protein Bclw plays a unique role in preventing IP3R1-dependent axon degeneration and that the chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel diminishes trafficking and translation of bclw, thereby removing the brakes on this degenerative cascade.

Emotion is known to activate different areas of the cortex; nevertheless, how activation represents the variety of emotion is unknown. We asked whether functional activation in Heschl's gyrus and amygdala subdivisions could differentiate happy and sad acoustic stimuli. A sparse sampling fMRI paradigm assessing hemispheric laterality by subdivision was employed to investigate this question. Differences between left Heschl's gyrus subdivisions Te1.1 and Te1.0 compared to Te1.2 were significant for sad acoustic stimuli and right Heschl's gyrus subdivisions Te1.0 different than Te1.1 and Te1.2 for sad acoustic stimuli, with no subdivision specificity for happy greater than sad. A prominent right greater than left difference was notable for centromedial, laterobasal, and superficial amygdala subdivisions for sad, while happy was more bilaterally activated. Activation and deactivation profiles of Heschl's gyrus and amygdala subdivisions added to the explanation of left/right asymmetry by emotion with activation profiles significant for Heschl's gyrus and amygdala response to sad.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/201905v1?rss=1">Geometric Classification of Brain Network Dynamics via Donic Derivative Discriminants</a></h4>

Background: Over the past decade, pattern decoding techniques have granted neuroscientists improved anatomical specificity in mapping neural representations associated with function and cognition. Dynamical patterns are of particular interest, as evidenced by the proliferation and success of frequency domain methods that reveal structured spatiotemporal rhythmic brain activity. One drawback of such approaches, however, is the need to estimate spectral power, which limits the temporal resolution of classification. New Method: We propose an alternative method that enables classification of dynamical patterns with high temporal fidelity. The key feature of the method is a conversion of time-series into their temporal derivatives. By doing so, dynamically-coded information may be revealed in terms of geometric patterns in the phase space of the derivative signal. Results: We derive a geometric classifier for this problem which simplifies into a straightforward calculation in terms of covariances. We demonstrate the relative advantages and disadvantages of the technique with simulated data and benchmark its performance with an EEG dataset of covert spatial attention. By mapping the weights anatomically we reveal a retinotopic organization of covert spatial attention. Comparison with Existing Method: We especially highlight the ability of the method to provide strong group-level classification performance compared to existing benchmarks, while providing information that is synergistic to classical spectral-based techniques. The robustness and sensitivity of the method to noise is also examined relative to spectral-based techniques. Conclusion: The proposed classification technique enables decoding of dynamic patterns with high temporal resolution, performs favorably to benchmark methods, and facilitates anatomical inference.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/201863v1?rss=1">The Opportunity Cost of Time Modulates Cognitive Effort</a></h4>

A spate of recent work demonstrates that humans seek to avoid the expenditure of cognitive effort, much like physical effort or economic resources. Less is clear, however, about the circumstances dictating how and when people decide to expend cognitive effort. Here we adopt a popular theory of opportunity costs and response vigor and to elucidate this question. This account, grounded in Reinforcement Learning, formalizes a trade-off between two costs: the harder work assumed necessary to emit faster actions and the opportunity cost inherent in acting more slowly (i.e., the delay that results to the next reward and subsequent rewards). Recent work reveals that the opportunity cost of time--operationalized as the average reward rate per unit time, theorized to be signaled by tonic dopamine levels, modulates the speed with which a person responds in a simple discrimination tasks. We extend this framework to cognitive effort in a diverse range of cognitive tasks, for which 1) the amount of cognitive effort demanded from the task varies from trial to trial and 2) the expenditure of cognitive effort holds measureable consequences in terms of accuracy and response time. In the domains of cognitive control, perceptual decision-making, and task-switching, we found that subjects tuned their level of effort exertion in accordance with the experienced average reward rate: when the opportunity cost of time was high, subjects made more errors and responded more quickly. That is, expenditure of cognitive effort appeared to be modulated by the opportunity cost of time. Further, and consistent with our account, the strength of this modulation was predicted by individual differences in efficacy of cognitive control. Taken together, our results elucidate the circumstances dictating how and when people expend cognitive effort.

Background: We previously provided initial evidence for cognitive and event-related potential markers of persistence/remission of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) from childhood to adolescence and adulthood. In this follow-up study, using a novel brain-network connectivity approach, we aimed to examine whether functional connectivity reflects a marker of ADHD remission, or an enduring deficit unrelated to ADHD outcome. Methods: High-density EEG was recorded in 110 adolescents and young adults with childhood ADHD (87 persisters, 23 remitters) and 169 typically-developing individuals during an arrow-flanker task, eliciting cognitive control. Functional connectivity was quantified with network-based graph-theory metrics before target onset (pre-stimulus), during target processing (post-stimulus) and in the degree of change between pre-stimulus/post-stimulus. ADHD outcome was examined with parent-reported symptoms and impairment using both a categorical (DSM-IV) and a dimensional approach. Results: Graph-theory measures converged in indicating that, compared to controls, ADHD persisters showed increased connectivity in pre-stimulus theta, alpha and beta and in post-stimulus beta (all p&lt;.01), and reduced pre-stimulus/post-stimulus change in theta connectivity (p&lt;.01). In the majority of indices showing ADHD persister-control differences, ADHD remitters differed from controls (all p&lt;.05), but not from persisters. Similarly, connectivity measures were not associated with continuous outcome measures of ADHD symptoms and impairment in participants with childhood ADHD. Conclusions: Adolescents and young adults with persistent and remitted ADHD share atypical over-connectivity profiles and reduced ability to modulate connectivity patterns with task demands, compared to controls. Brain connectivity impairments may represent enduring deficits in individuals with childhood ADHD irrespective of diagnostic status in adolescence/young adulthood.

Despite great efforts over several decades, our best models of primary visual cortex (V1) still predict neural responses quite poorly when probed with natural stimuli, highlighting our limited understanding of the nonlinear computations in V1. At the same time, recent advances in machine learning have shown that deep neural networks can learn highly nonlinear functions for visual information processing. Two approaches based on deep learning have recently been successfully applied to neural data: transfer learning for predicting neural activity in higher areas of the primate ventral stream and data-driven models to predict retina and V1 neural activity of mice. However, so far there exists no comparison between the two approaches and neither of them has been used to model the early primate visual system. Here, we test the ability of both approaches to predict neural responses to natural images in V1 of awake monkeys. We found that both deep learning approaches outperformed classical linear- nonlinear and wavelet-based feature representations building on existing V1 encoding theories. On our dataset, transfer learning and data-driven models performed similarly, while the data-driven model employed a much simpler architecture. Thus, multi-layer CNNs set the new state of the art for predicting neural responses to natural images in primate V1. Having such good predictive in-silico models opens the door for quantitative studies of yet unknown nonlinear computations in V1 without being limited by the available experimental time.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/201756v1?rss=1">Temporal expectation modulates cortical dynamics of sensory memory</a></h4>

Increased memory load is often signified by enhanced neural oscillatory power in the alpha range (8-13 Hz), taken to reflect inhibition of task-irrelevant brain regions. The corresponding neural correlates of memory decay, however, are not yet well-understood. Here, we investigated auditory sensory memory decay using a delayed matching-to-sample task with pure-tone sequences. First, in a behavioral experiment we modeled memory behavior over six different delay-phase durations. Second, in a magnetoencephalography (MEG) experiment, we assessed alpha-power modulations over three different delay-phase durations. In both experiments, the temporal expectation for the to be remembered sound was manipulated, so that it was either temporally expected or not. In both studies, memory performance declined over time but this decline was less strong under a more precise temporal expectation. Similarly, patterns of alpha power in and alpha-tuned connectivity between sensory cortices changed parametrically with delay duration (i.e., decrease in occipito-parietal regions, increase in temporal regions). Notably, temporal expectation counteracted alpha-power decline in heteromodal brain areas (i.e., supramarginal gyrus), in line with its memory-decay counteracting effect on performance. Correspondingly, temporal expectation also boosted alpha connectivity within attention networks known to play an active role during memory maintenance. The present data outline how patterns of alpha power orchestrate sensory memory decay, and encourage a refined perspective on alpha power and its inhibitory role across brain space and time.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/201749v1?rss=1">Tonic and transient oscillatory brain activity during acute exercise</a></h4>

The physiological changes that occur in the main body systems and organs during physical exercise are well described in the literature. Despite the key role of brain in processing afferent and efferent information from organ systems to coordinate and optimize their functioning, little is known about how the brain works during exercise. The present study investigated tonic and transient oscillatory brain activity during a single bout of aerobic exercise. Twenty young males (19-32 years old) were recruited for two experimental sessions on separate days. Electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was recorded during a session of cycling at 80% (moderate-to-high intensity) of VO2max (maximum aerobic capacity) while performing an oddball task where participants had to detect infrequent targets presented among frequent non-targets. This was compared to a (baseline) light intensity session (30% VO2max). The light intensity session was included to control for any potential effect of dual-tasking (i.e., pedaling and performing the oddball task). A warm-up and cool down periods were completed before and after exercise, respectively. A cluster-based nonparametric permutations test showed an increase in power across the entire frequency spectrum during the moderate-to-high intensity exercise, with respect to light intensity. Further, we found that the more salient target lead to lower increase in (stimulus-evoked) theta power in the 80% VO2max with respect to the light intensity condition. On the contrary, higher decrease alpha and lower beta power was found for standard trials in the moderate-to-high exercise condition than in the light exercise condition. The present study unveils, for the first time, a complex brain activity pattern during acute exercise (at 80% of maximum aerobic capacity). These findings might help to elucidate the nature of changes that occur in the brain during physical exertion.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/201707v1?rss=1">Long-range inputs and H-current regulate different modes of operation in a multiscale model of mouse M1 microcircuits</a></h4>

We developed a biologically detailed multiscale model of mouse primary motor cortex (M1) microcircuits, incorporating data from several recent experimental studies. The model simulates at scale a cylindrical volume with a diameter of 300 m and cortical depth 1350 m of M1. It includes over 10,000 cells distributed across cortical layers based on measured cell densities, with close to 30 million synaptic connections. Neuron models were optimized to reproduce electrophysiological properties of major classes of M1 neurons. Layer 5 corticospinal and corticostriatal neuron morphologies with 700+ compartments reproduced cell 3D reconstructions, and their ionic channel distributions were optimized within experimental constraints to reproduce in vitro recordings. The network was driven by the main long-range inputs to M1: posterior nucleus (PO) and ventrolateral (VL) thalamus PO, primary and secondary somatosensory cortices (S1, S2), contralateral M1, secondary motor cortex (M2), and orbital cortex (OC). The network local and long-range connections depended on pre- and post-synaptic cell class and cortical depth. Data was based on optogenetic circuit mapping studies which determined that connection strengths vary within layer as a function of the neuron's cortical depth. The synaptic input distribution across cell dendritic trees -- likely to subserve important neural coding functions -- was also mapped using optogenetic methods and incorporated into the model. We employed the model to study the effect on M1 of increased activity from each of the long-range inputs, and of different levels of H-current in pyramidal tract-projecting (PT) corticospinal neurons. Microcircuit dynamics and information flow were quantified using firing rates, oscillations, and information transfer measures (Granger causality and normalized transfer entropy). Simulation results support the hypothesis that M1 operates along a continuum of modes characterized by the degree of activation of intratelencephalic (IT), corticothalamic (CT) and PT neurons. The particular subset of M1 neurons targeted by different long-range inputs and the level of H-current in PT neurons regulated the different modes. Downregulation of H-current facilitated synaptic integration of inputs and increased PT output activity. Therefore, VL, cM1 and M2 inputs with downregulated H-current promoted an PT-predominant mode; whereas PO, S1 and S2 inputs with upregulated H-current favored an IT/CT-predominant mode, but a mixed mode where upper layer IT cells in turn activated PT cells if H-current was downregulated. This evidenced two different pathways that can generate corticospinal output: motor-related inputs bypassing upper M1 layers and directly projecting to PT cells, and sensory-related inputs projecting to superficial IT neurons in turn exciting PT cells. These findings provide a hypothetical mechanism to translate action planning into action execution. Overall, our model serves as an extensible framework to combine experimental data at multiple scales and perform in silico experiments that help us understand M1 microcircuit dynamics, information flow and biophysical mechanisms, and potentially develop treatments for motor disorders.

In the hippocampus, episodic memories are thought to be encoded by the formation of ensembles of synaptically coupled CA3 pyramidal cells driven by sparse but powerful mossy fiber inputs from dentate gyrus granule cells. Since CA3 network capacity is finite, a mechanism for enhancing memory encoding during important events would ensure greater efficiency, but the salient signal that might determine this memory selectivity filter is unknown. Using experimental and computational methods we show that the cholinergic system can operate as a memory selectivity filter by combining 3 separate mechanisms: disinhibition of feed-forward mossy fiber inhibition enables synaptic plasticity at CA3-CA3 recurrent synapses; Increasing cellular excitability lowers the threshold for ensemble formation; Reduction of overall CA3-CA3 recurrent synapse strength allows for an increase in overlap between ensembles. Thus, we show that acetylcholine release enables the selective encoding of salient high-density episodic memories in the hippocampus.

The idea of fMRI-based personalized medicine is emerging to characterize brain disorders at the patient level and to develop tailored therapeutic protocols. A main limitation in this direction, as well as with fundamental studies of brain function, is the variability observed in fMRI data. In practice, such measurements exhibit a mixture of session-to-session variability with subject- and condition-related information. Disentangling these contributions is crucial for real-life applications where only a few sessions per subject are available. The present study aims to define a new reliable standard for the extraction of signatures from fMRI data. These signatures correspond to subnetworks of directed interactions between brain regions (typically 100 covering the whole brain) supporting the subject and condition identification for single fMRI sessions. The key is to step from functional connectivity to effective connectivity, which is estimated using a whole-brain dynamic model. Our method shows that as few as 4 sessions per subject are sufficient to perfectly identify more than 40 other sessions of 6 subjects. We also demonstrate the good generalization capability for 30 subjects. Using another dataset with resting state and movie viewing, we show that the two extracted signatures correspond to distinct subnetworks, suggesting some sort of orthogonality. Our results set solid foundations to follow longitudinally a subject's condition from fMRI data.

The brain generates cognition and behavior through firing changes of its neurons, yet, with enormous firing variability, the organizing principle underlying real-time neural code remains unclear. Here, we test the Neural Self-Information Theory that neural code is constructed via the self-information principle under which each inter-spike-interval (ISI) is inherently self-tagged with discrete information based on its relation to ISI variability-probability distribution - higher-probability ISIs, which reflect the balanced excitation-inhibition ground state, convey minimal information, whereas lower-probability ISIs, which signify statistical surprisals, carry more information. Moreover, temporally coordinated ISI surprisals across neural cliques intrinsically give rise to real-time cell-assembly neural code. As a result, this self-information-based neural coding is uniquely intrinsic to the neurons themselves, with no need for outside observers to set any reference point to manually mark external or internal inputs. Applying this neural self-information concept, we devised an unbiased general decoding strategy and successfully uncovered 15 distinct cell-assembly patterns from multiple cortical and hippocampal circuits associated with different sleep cycles, earthquake, elevator-drop, foot-shock experiences, navigation or various actions in five-choice visual-discrimination operant-conditioning tasks. Detailed analyses of all 15 cell assemblies revealed that ~20% of the skewed ISI distribution tails were responsible for the emergence of robust cell-assembly codes, conforming to the Pareto Principle. These findings support the notion that neural coding is organized via the self-information principle to generate real-time information across brain regions, cognitive modalities, and behaviors.

Sensory maps are representations of the sensory epithelia in the brain. Despite the intuitive explanatory power behind sensory maps as being neuronal precursors to sensory perception, and sensory cortical plasticity as a neural correlate of perceptual learning, molecular mechanisms that regulate map plasticity are not well understood. Here we perform a meta-analysis of transcriptional and translational changes during altered whisker use to nominate the major molecular correlates of experience-dependent map plasticity in the barrel cortex. We argue that brain plasticity is a systems level response, involving all cell classes, from neuron and glia to non-neuronal cells including endothelia. Using molecular pathway analysis, we further propose a gene regulatory network that could couple activity dependent changes in neurons to adaptive changes in neurovasculature, and finally we show that transcriptional regulations observed in major brain disorders target genes that are modulated by altered sensory experience. Thus understanding the molecular mechanisms of experience-dependent plasticity of sensory maps might help to unravel the cellular events that shape brain plasticity in health and disease.

The hippocampus is involved in aspects of both working and episodic memory, and is a central region of interest in diseases affecting these processes. While the role of the hippocampus in memory is studied predominantly in rodents, rodent neurological disease models have not historically translated well to human treatment. Non-human primate disease models, while highly translational, present both economic and ethical challenges. Therefore, an alternative research model is required to study memory and cognition during development and to follow disease progression. Because pig models are widely used in other translational research, they may provide an excellent compromise between rodents and non-human primates due in part to the gyrencephalic neuroanatomy and significant white matter composition of the porcine brain. In addition, the porcine hippocampal anatomy and cytoarchitecture more closely resembles that of primates than rodents. To advance the study of the neurophysiology of the pig hippocampus and related structures, we utilized stereotaxis combined with single-unit electrophysiological mapping to precisely place laminar silicon depth probes into the dorsal hippocampus of miniature pigs without the need for image guidance. We then implemented an in vivo, electrophysiology-based methodology to identify hippocampal layers and to examine hippocampal neurophysiology using these depth probes. This methodology allowed for the simultaneous recording of laminar field potentials and single-cell activity in multiple layers in the dorsal hippocampus. The laminar structure of dorsal hippocampus and the precise location of the probes were confirmed by electrophysiology and histopathology, eliminating the need to recover electrode tracks in future animals. This methodology allows us to investigate hippocampal electrophysiology under anesthesia, with potential expansion into awake behaving neurophysiology. Accessible neurophysiology of the pig hippocampus may allow for the development of new translational models of neurological disorders, with the possibility of evaluating the neuronal and circuitry disruptions that underlie cognitive and memory dysfunction.

Understanding the relationship between external stimuli and the spiking activity of cortical populations is a central problem in neuroscience. Dense recurrent connectivity in local cortical circuits can lead to counterintuitive response properties, raising the question of whether there are simple arithmetical rules for relating circuits' connectivity structure to their response properties. One such arithmetic is provided by the mean field theory of balanced networks, which is derived in a limit where excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents precisely balance on average. However, balanced network theory is not applicable to some biologically relevant connectivity structures. We show that cortical circuits with such structure are susceptible to an amplification mechanism arising when excitatory-inhibitory balance is broken at the level of local subpopulations, but maintained at a global level. This amplification, which can be quantified by a linear correction to the classical mean field theory of balanced networks, explains several response properties observed in cortical recordings.

<p>by Jiawen Chen, Steven C. Almo, Yinghao Wu</p>

The interactions between membrane receptors and extracellular ligands control cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion, and environmental responsiveness by representing the initial steps of cell signaling pathways. These interactions can be spatial-temporally regulated when different extracellular ligands are tethered. The detailed mechanisms of this spatial-temporal regulation, including the competition between distinct ligands with overlapping binding sites and the conformational flexibility in multi-specific ligand assemblies have not been quantitatively evaluated. We present a new coarse-grained model to realistically simulate the binding process between multi-specific ligands and membrane receptors on cell surfaces. The model simplifies each receptor and each binding site in a multi-specific ligand as a rigid body. Different numbers or types of ligands are spatially organized together in the simulation. These designs were used to test the relation between the overall binding of a multi-specific ligand and the affinity of its cognate binding site. When a variety of ligands are exposed to cells expressing different densities of surface receptors, we demonstrated that ligands with reduced affinities have higher specificity to distinguish cells based on the relative concentrations of their receptors. Finally, modification of intramolecular flexibility was shown to play a role in optimizing the binding between receptors and ligands. In summary, our studies bring new insights to the general principles of ligand-receptor interactions. Future applications of our method will pave the way for new strategies to generate next-generation biologics.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/x-8iK-8w2t8" width="1" />

<p>by Alex D. M. Dewar, Antoine Wystrach, Andrew Philippides, Paul Graham</p>

All organisms wishing to survive and reproduce must be able to respond adaptively to a complex, changing world. Yet the computational power available is constrained by biology and evolution, favouring mechanisms that are parsimonious yet robust. Here we investigate the information carried in small populations of visually responsive neurons in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. These so-called âring neuronsâ, projecting to the ellipsoid body of the central complex, are reported to be necessary for complex visual tasks such as pattern recognition and visual navigation. Recently the receptive fields of these neurons have been mapped, allowing us to investigate how well they can support such behaviours. For instance, in a simulation of classic pattern discrimination experiments, we show that the pattern of output from the ring neurons matches observed fly behaviour. However, performance of the neurons (as with flies) is not perfect and can be easily improved with the addition of extra neurons, suggesting the neuronsâ receptive fields are not optimised for recognising abstract shapes, a conclusion which casts doubt on cognitive explanations of fly behaviour in pattern recognition assays. Using artificial neural networks, we then assess how easy it is to decode more general information about stimulus shape from the ring neuron population codes. We show that these neurons are well suited for encoding information about size, position and orientation, which are more relevant behavioural parameters for a fly than abstract pattern properties. This leads us to suggest that in order to understand the properties of neural systems, one must consider how perceptual circuits put information at the service of behaviour.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DGYmgqBhDFo" width="1" />

Mycobacterium tuberculosisâ success as a pathogen comes from its ability to evade degradation by macrophages. Normally macrophages clear microorganisms that activate pathogen-recognition receptors (PRRs) through a lysosomal-trafficking pathway called âLC3-associated phagocytosisâ (LAP). Although M. tuberculosis activates numerous PRRs, for reasons that are poorly understood LAP does not substantially contribute to...<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/6XsYSkwP7l4" width="1" />

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p>Objective: Previous work measures spinal cord thinning in chronic progressive myelopathies, including HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) and multiple sclerosis (MS). Quantitative measurements of spinal cord atrophy are important in fully characterizing these and other spinal cord diseases. We aimed to investigate patterns of spinal cord atrophy and correlations with clinical markers.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Methods: Spinal cord cross sectional area was measured in individuals (24 healthy controls (HC), 17 asymptomatic carriers of HTLV-1 (AC), 47 HAM/TSP, 74 RRMS, 17 SPMS, and 40 PPMS) from C1 to T10. Clinical disability scores, viral markers, and immunological parameters were obtained for patients and correlated with representative spinal cord cross sectional area regions at the C2-C3, C4-C5, and T4-T9 levels. In two HAM/TSP patients, spinal cord cross sectional area was measured over three years.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Results: All spinal cord regions are thinner in HAM/TSP (56 mm<sup>2</sup> [SD 10], 59 [10], 23 [5]) than in HC (76 [7], 83 [8], 38 [4]) and AC (71 [7], 78 [9], 36 [7]). SPMS (62 [9], 66 [9], 32 [6]) and PPMS (65 [11], 68 [10], 35 [7]) have thinner cervical cords than HC and RRMS (73 [9], 77 [10], 37 [6]). Clinical disability scores (EDSS (p=0.009) and IPEC(p=0.03)) and CD8+ T cell frequency (p=0.04) correlate with T4-T9 spinal cord cross sectional area in HAM/TSP. Higher CSF HTLV-1 proviral load (p=0.01) was associated with thinner spinal cord cross sectional area. Both HAM/TSP patients followed longitudinally showed thoracic thinning followed by cervical thinning.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Interpretation: Group average spinal cord cross sectional area in HAM/TSP and progressive MS show spinal cord atrophy. We further hypothesize that is possible that neuroglial loss from a thoracic inflammatory process results in anterograde and retrograde degeneration of axons, leading to the temporal progression of thoracic to cervical atrophy described here.

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>: Cardiac diseases are established risk factors for ischemic stroke incidence and severity. Conversely, there is increasing evidence that brain ischemia can cause cardiac dysfunction. The mechanisms underlying this neurogenic heart disease are incompletely understood. While it is established that ischemic stroke is associated with cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial damage, elevated cardiac enzymes and plasma catecholamines in the acute phase, nothing is known about the delayed consequences of ischemic stroke on cardiovascular function.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b>: To determine the long-term cardiac consequences of a focal cerebral ischemia, we subjected young and aged mice to a 30-minute transient middle cerebral artery occlusion and analyzed cardiac function by serial transthoracic echocardiography and hemodynamic measurements up to week 8 after surgery. Finally, animals were treated with metoprolol to evaluate a pharmacologic treatment option to prevent the development of heart failure.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>: Focal cerebral ischemia induced a long-term cardiac dysfunction with a reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction and an increase in left ventricular volumes; this development was associated with higher peripheral sympathetic activity. Metoprolol treatment prevented the development of chronic cardiac dysfunction by decelerating extracellular cardiac remodeling and inhibiting sympathetic signaling relevant to chronic autonomic dysfunction.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation</b>: Focal cerebral ischemia in mice leads to the development of chronic systolic dysfunction driven by increased sympathetic activity. If these results can be confirmed in a clinical setting, treating physicians should be attentive to clinical signs of heart failure in every patient after ischemic stroke. Therapeutically, the successful Î²-blockade with metoprolol in mice could also have future clinical implications. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p></div>

<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>: Studies suggest a greater risk of Parkinson disease (PD) after traumatic brain injury (TBI), but it is possible that the risk of TBI is greater in the prodromal period of PD. We aimed to examine the time-to-TBI in PD patients in their prodromal period compared to population-based controls.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b>: We identified 89,790 incident PD cases and 118,095 comparable controlsâ&gt;â65 years of age in 2009 using Medicare claims data. Using data from the preceding five years, we compared time-to-TBI in PD patients in their prodromal period to controls. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for TBI in a Cox regression, while adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, modified Charlson comorbidity index, smoking, and alcohol use.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>: Risk of TBI was greater in PD patients in their prodromal period across all age and sex groups, with HRs consistently increasing with proximity to PD diagnosis. HRs ranged from 1.64 (95% CI 1.52, 1.77) five years prior to diagnosis to 3.93 (95% CI 3.74, 4.13) in the year prior. The interaction between PD, TBI, and time was primarily observed for TBI attributed to falls. Motor dysfunction and cognitive impairment, suggested by corresponding ICD-9 codes, partially mediated the PD-TBI association.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation</b>: There is a strong association between PD and a recent TBI in the prodromal period of PD. This association strengthens as PD diagnosis approaches and may be a result of undetected non-motor and motor symptoms, but confirmation will be required. This article is protected by copyright.

<div class="para"><p><b>METHODS</b>: We identified 430 individuals along the cognitive continuum aged&gt;60 years with amyloid-PET, Tau-PET, and MRI scans from the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. A subset of 329 individuals had FDG-PET. We ascertained presently existing cardiovascular and metabolic conditions (CMC) from healthcare records and used the summation of presence/absence of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiac-arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and stroke as a surrogate for vascular health. We used global amyloid from PiB-PET, entorhinal cortex tau uptake (ERC-tau) from Tau-PET, and neurodegeneration in AD signature regions from MRI and FDG-PET as surrogates for AD pathophysiology. We dichotomized participants into CMC=0 (CMC-) vs. CMC&gt;0 (CMC+) and tested for age-adjusted group differences in AD biomarkers. Using structural equation models (SEM), we assessed the impact of vascular health on AD biomarker cascade (amyloid leads to tau leads to neurodegeneration) after considering the direct and indirect age, sex, and APOE effects.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>RESULTS</b>: CMC+ participants had significantly greater neurodegeneration than CMC- participants but did not differ by amyloid or ERC-tau. The SEM models showed that i) vascular health had a significant direct and indirect impact on neurodegeneration but not on amyloid; and ii) vascular health specifically the presence of hyperlipidemia had a significant direct impact on ERC-tau.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>INTERPRETATION</b>: Vascular health had quantifiably greater impact on neurodegeneration in AD regions than on amyloid deposition. Longitudinal studies are warranted to clarify the relationship between tau deposition and vascular health. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p></div>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p><em>Objective</em>: Mucopolysaccharidosis IIIA or Sanfilippo disease type A is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder presenting in early childhood, caused by an inherited deficiency of the lysosomal hydrolase sulfamidase. New missense mutations, for which genotype-phenotype correlations are currently unknown, are frequently reported, hampering early prediction of phenotypic severity and efficacy assessment of new disease-modifying treatments. We aimed to design a method to determine phenotypic severity early in the disease course. <em>Methods</em>: Fifty-three patients were included of whom skin fibroblasts and data on disease course and mutation analysis were available. Patients were phenotypically characterized on clinical data as ârapidly progressing' or âslowly progressing'. Sulfamidase activity was measured in fibroblasts cultured at 37Â°C and at 30Â°C. <em>Results</em>: Sulfamidase activity in fibroblasts from patients homozygous or compound heterozygous for a combination of known severe mutations remained below the limit of quantification under both culture conditions. In contrast, sulfamidase activity in fibroblasts from patients homozygous or compound heterozygous for a known mild mutation increased above the limit of quantification when cultured at 30Â°C. With division on the basis of the patients phenotype, fibroblasts from âslowly progressing' patients could be separated from ârapid progressing' patients by increase in sulfamidase activity when cultured at 30Â°C (p&lt;0.001, sensitivity 96%, specificity 93%). <em>Interpretation</em>: Phenotypic severity strongly correlates with the potential to increase sulfamidase activity in fibroblasts cultured at 30Â°C, allowing reliable distinction between patients with ârapidly progressing' or âslowly progressing' phenotypes. This method may provide an essential tool for assessment of treatment effects and for healthcare and life planning decisions. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p></div>

<div class="section" id="ana25047-sec-0001"><h4>Objective</h4><div class="para"><p>Freezing of gait is a poorly understood symptom of Parkinson disease, and can severely disrupt the locomotion of affected patients. However, bicycling ability remains surprisingly unaffected in most patients suffering from freezing, suggesting functional differences in the motor network. The purpose of this study was to characterize and contrast the oscillatory dynamics underlying bicycling and walking in the basal ganglia.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25047-sec-0002"><h4>Methods</h4><div class="para"><p>We present the first local field potential recordings directly comparing bicycling and walking in Parkinson disease patients with electrodes implanted in the subthalamic nuclei for deep brain stimulation. Low (13â22Hz) and high (23â35Hz) beta power changes were analyzed in 22 subthalamic nuclei from 13 Parkinson disease patients (57.5âÂ±â5.9 years old, 4 female). The study group consisted of 5 patients with and 8 patients without freezing of gait.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25047-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>In patients without freezing of gait, both bicycling and walking led to a suppression of subthalamic beta power (13â35Hz), and this suppression was stronger for bicycling. Freezers showed a similar pattern in general. Superimposed on this pattern, however, we observed a movement-induced, narrowband power increase around 18Hz, which was evident even in the absence of freezing.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25047-sec-0004"><h4>Interpretation</h4><div class="para"><p>These results indicate that bicycling facilitates overall suppression of beta power. Furthermore, movement leads to exaggerated synchronization in the low beta band specifically within the basal ganglia of patients susceptible to freezing. Abnormal â¼18Hz oscillations are implicated in the pathophysiology of freezing of gait, and suppressing them may form a key strategy in developing potential therapies.

<p>Research showed that, the information transmitted in biological neurons is
encoded in the instants of successive action potentials or their firing rate.
In addition to that, in-vivo operation of the neuron makes measurement
difficult and thus continuous data collection is restricted. Due to those
reasons, classical mean square estimation techniques that are frequently used
in neural network training is very difficult to apply. In such situations,
point processes and related likelihood methods may be beneficial. In this
study, we will present how one can apply certain methods to use the
stimulus-response data obtained from a neural process in the mathematical
modeling of a neuron. The study is theoretical in nature and it will be
supported by simulations. In addition it will be compared to a similar study.

<p>Trained recurrent networks are powerful tools for modeling dynamic neural
computations. We present a target-based method for modifying the full
connectivity matrix of a recurrent network to train it to perform tasks
involving temporally complex input/output transformations. The method
introduces a second network during training to provide suitable "target"
dynamics useful for performing the task. Because it exploits the full recurrent
connectivity, the method produces networks that perform tasks with fewer
neurons and greater noise robustness than traditional least-squares (FORCE)
approaches. In addition, we show how introducing additional input signals into
the target-generating network, which act as task hints, greatly extends the
range of tasks that can be learned and provides control over the complexity and
nature of the dynamics of the trained, task-performing network.

<p>The spiking activity of principal cells in mammalian hippocampus encodes an
internalized neuronal representation of the ambient space---a cognitive map.
Once learned, such a map enables the animal to navigate a given environment for
a long period. However, the neuronal substrate that produces this map remains
transient: the synaptic connections in the hippocampus and in the downstream
neuronal networks never cease to form and to deteriorate at a rapid rate. How
can the brain maintain a robust, reliable representation of space using a
network that constantly changes its architecture? Here, we demonstrate, using
novel Algebraic Topology techniques, that cognitive map's stability is a
generic, emergent phenomenon. The model allows evaluating the effect produced
by specific physiological parameters, e.g., the distribution of connections'
decay times, on the properties of the cognitive map as a whole. It also points
out that spatial memory deterioration caused by weakening or excessive loss of
the synaptic connections may be compensated by simulating the neuronal
activity. Lastly, the model explicates functional importance of the
complementary learning systems for processing spatial information at different
levels of spatiotemporal granularity, by establishing three complementary
timescales at which spatial information unfolds. Thus, the model provides a
principal insight into how can the brain develop a reliable representation of
the world, learn and retain memories despite complex plasticity of the
underlying networks and allows studying how instabilities and memory
deterioration mechanisms may affect learning process.

<p>Sensory stimuli can be recognized more rapidly when they are expected. This
phenomenon depends on expectation affecting the cortical processing of sensory
information. However, virtually nothing is known on the mechanisms responsible
for the effects of expectation on sensory networks. Here, we report a novel
computational mechanism underlying the expectation-dependent acceleration of
coding observed in the gustatory cortex (GC) of alert rats. We use a recurrent
spiking network model with a clustered architecture capturing essential
features of cortical activity, including the metastable activity observed in GC
before and after gustatory stimulation. Relying both on network theory and
computer simulations, we propose that expectation exerts its function by
modulating the intrinsically generated dynamics preceding taste delivery. Our
model, whose predictions are confirmed in the experimental data, demonstrates
how the modulation of intrinsic metastable activity can shape sensory coding
and mediate cognitive processes such as the expectation of relevant events.
Altogether, these results provide a biologically plausible theory of
expectation and ascribe a new functional role to intrinsically generated,
metastable activity.

<p>by Peter Ashcroft, Markus G. Manz, Sebastian Bonhoeffer</p>

Hematopoietic stem cells in mammals are known to reside mostly in the bone marrow, but also transitively passage in small numbers in the blood. Experimental findings have suggested that they exist in a dynamic equilibrium, continuously migrating between these two compartments. Here we construct an individual-based mathematical model of this process, which is parametrised using existing empirical findings from mice. This approach allows us to quantify the amount of migration between the bone marrow niches and the peripheral blood. We use this model to investigate clonal hematopoiesis, which is a significant risk factor for hematologic cancers. We also analyse the engraftment of donor stem cells into non-conditioned and conditioned hosts, quantifying the impact of different treatment scenarios. The simplicity of the model permits a thorough mathematical analysis, providing deeper insights into the dynamics of both the model and of the real-world system. We predict the time taken for mutant clones to expand within a host, as well as chimerism levels that can be expected following transplantation therapy, and the probability that a preconditioned host is reconstituted by donor cells.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rXyJusEBHNY" width="1" />

<p>by Thomas G. Fai, Alejandra Leo-Macias, David L. Stokes, Charles S. Peskin</p>

We simulate deformable red blood cells in the microcirculation using the immersed boundary method with a cytoskeletal model that incorporates structural details revealed by tomographic images. The elasticity of red blood cells is known to be supplied by both their lipid bilayer membranes, which resist bending and local changes in area, and their cytoskeletons, which resist in-plane shear. The cytoskeleton consists of spectrin tetramers that are tethered to the lipid bilayer by ankyrin and by actin-based junctional complexes. We model the cytoskeleton as a random geometric graph, with nodes corresponding to junctional complexes and with edges corresponding to spectrin tetramers such that the edge lengths are given by the end-to-end distances between nodes. The statistical properties of this graph are based on distributions gathered from three-dimensional tomographic images of the cytoskeleton by a segmentation algorithm. We show that the elastic response of our model cytoskeleton, in which the spectrin polymers are treated as entropic springs, is in good agreement with the experimentally measured shear modulus. By simulating red blood cells in flow with the immersed boundary method, we compare this discrete cytoskeletal model to an existing continuum model and predict the extent to which dynamic spectrin network connectivity can protect against failure in the case of a red cell subjected to an applied strain. The methods presented here could form the basis of disease- and patient-specific computational studies of hereditary diseases affecting the red cell cytoskeleton.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0HEAkCv60RE" width="1" />

<p>by Emre Akbas, Miguel P. Eckstein</p>

Humans and many other species sense visual information with varying spatial resolution across the visual field (foveated vision) and deploy eye movements to actively sample regions of interests in scenes. The advantage of such varying resolution architecture is a reduced computational, hence metabolic cost. But what are the performance costs of such processing strategy relative to a scheme that processes the visual field at high spatial resolution? Here we first focus on visual search and combine object detectors from computer vision with a recent model of peripheral pooling regions found at the V1 layer of the human visual system. We develop a foveated object detector that processes the entire scene with varying resolution, uses retino-specific object detection classifiers to guide eye movements, aligns its fovea with regions of interest in the input image and integrates observations across multiple fixations. We compared the foveated object detector against a non-foveated version of the same object detector which processes the entire image at with homogeneous high spatial resolution. We evaluated the accuracy of the foveated and non-foveated object detectors identifying 20 different objects classes in scenes from a standard computer vision data set (the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset). We show that the foveated object detector can approximate the performance of the object detector with homogeneous high spatial resolution processing while bringing significant computational cost savings. Additionally, we assessed the impact of foveation on the computation of bottom-up saliency. An implementation of a simple foveated bottom-up saliency model with eye movements showed agreement in the selection of top salient regions of scenes with those selected by a non-foveated high resolution saliency model. Together, our results might help explain the evolution of foveated visual systems with eye movements as a solution that preserves perceptual performance in visual search while resulting in computational and metabolic savings to the brain.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aI5auQXLGpk" width="1" />

<p>We study the electro-diffusion properties of a domain containing a
cusp-shaped structure in three dimensions when one ionic specie is dominant.
The mathematical problem consists in solving the steady-state
Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equation with an integral constraint for the number
of charges. A non-homogeneous Neumann boundary condition is imposed on the
boundary. We construct an asymptotic approximation for certain singular limits
that agree with numerical simulations. Finally, we analyse the consequences of
non-homogeneous surface charge density. We conclude that the geometry of
cusp-shaped domains influences the voltage profile, specifically inside the
cusp structure. The main results are summarized in the form of new
three-dimensional electrostatic laws for non-electroneutral electrolytes. We
discuss applications to dendritic spines in neuroscience.

<p>We introduce new techniques to the analysis of neural spatiotemporal dynamics
via applying $\epsilon$-machine reconstruction to electroencephalography (EEG)
microstate sequences. Microstates are short duration quasi-stable states of the
dynamically changing electrical field topographies recorded via an array of
electrodes from the human scalp, and cluster into four canonical classes. The
sequence of microstates observed under particular conditions can be considered
an information source with unknown underlying structure. $\epsilon$-machines
are discrete dynamical system automata with state-dependent probabilities on
different future observations (in this case the next measured EEG microstate).
They artificially reproduce underlying structure in an optimally predictive
manner as generative models exhibiting dynamics emulating the behaviour of the
source. Here we present experiments using both simulations and empirical data
supporting the value of associating these discrete dynamical systems with
mental states (e.g. mind-wandering, focused attention, etc.) and with clinical
populations. The neurodynamics of mental states and clinical populations can
then be further characterized by properties of these dynamical systems,
including: i) statistical complexity (determined by the number of states of the
corresponding $\epsilon$-automaton); ii) entropy rate; iii) characteristic
sequence patterning (syntax, probabilistic grammars); iv) duration, persistence
and stability of dynamical patterns; and v) algebraic measures such as
Krohn-Rhodes complexity or holonomy length of the decompositions of these. The
potential applications include the characterization of mental states in
neurodynamic terms for mental health diagnostics, well-being interventions,
human-machine interface, and others on both subject-specific and
group/population-level.

<p>One of the crucial questions in neuroscience is how a rich functional
repertoire of brain states relates to its underlying structural organization.
How to study the associations between these structural and functional layers is
an open problem that involves novel conceptual ways of tackling this question.
We here propose an extension of the Connectivity Independent Component Analysis
(connICA) framework, to identify joint structural-functional connectivity
traits. Here, we extend connICA to integrate structural and functional
connectomes by merging them into common -hybrid- connectivity patterns that
represent the connectivity fingerprint of a subject. We test this extended
approach on the 100 unrelated subjects from the Human Connectome Project. The
method is able to extract main independent structural-functional connectivity
patterns from the entire cohort that are sensitive to the realization of
different tasks. The hybrid connICA extracted two main task-sensitive hybrid
traits. The first, encompassing the within and between connections of dorsal
attentional and visual areas, as well as fronto-parietal circuits. The second,
mainly encompassing the connectivity between visual, attentional, DMN and
subcortical networks. Overall, these findings confirms the potential of the
hybrid connICA for the compression of structural/functional connectomes into
integrated patterns from a set of individual brain networks.

<p>White matter structures composed of myelinated axons in the living human
brain are primarily studied by diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI). These long-range
projections are typically characterized in a two-step process: dMRI is used to
estimate the orientation of axons within each voxel, then these local
orientations are linked together to estimate the spatial extent of putative
white matter bundles. Tractography, the process of tracing bundles across
voxels, either requires computationally expensive (probabilistic) simulations
to model uncertainty in fiber orientation or ignores it completely
(deterministic). Probabilistic simulation necessarily generates a finite number
of trajectories, introducing "simulation error" to trajectory estimates. Here
we introduce a method to analytically (via a closed-form solution) take an
orientation distribution function (ODF) from each voxel and calculate the
probabilities that a trajectory projects from a voxel into each directly
adjacent voxel. We validate our method by demonstrating that probabilistic
simulations converge to our analytically computed probabilities at the voxel
level as the number of simulated seeds increases. We show that our method
accurately calculates the ground-truth transition probabilities from a phantom
dataset. As a demonstration, we incoroporate our analytic method for voxel
transition probabilities into the Voxel Graph framework, creating a
quantitative framework for assessing white matter structure that we call
"analytic tractography". The long-range connectivity problem is reduced to
finding paths in a graph whose adjacency structure reflects voxel-to-voxel
analytic transition probabilities. We demonstrate this approach performs
comparably to many current probabilistic and deterministic approaches at a
fraction of the computational cost. Open source software software is provided.

A dramatic maturational process ongoing in adolescence is prefrontal cortex development, including its dopamine innervation. Dopamine axons grow from the striatum to the prefrontal cortex, the only known case of long-distance axon growth during adolescence. This is coordinated by the Netrin-1 guidance cue receptor DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer), which in turn controls the intrinsic development of the prefrontal cortex itself. Stimulant drugs in adolescence alter DCC in dopamine neurons and, in turn prefrontal cortex maturation, impacting cognitive abilities.

<p>by Agne TilÅ«naitÄ, Wayne Croft, Noah Russell, Tomas C. Bellamy, RÃ¼diger Thul</p>

Calcium responses have been observed as spikes of the whole-cell calcium concentration in numerous cell types and are essential for translating extracellular stimuli into cellular responses. While there are several suggestions for how this encoding is achieved, we still lack a comprehensive theory. To achieve this goal it is necessary to reliably predict the temporal evolution of calcium spike sequences for a given stimulus. Here, we propose a modelling framework that allows us to quantitatively describe the timing of calcium spikes. Using a Bayesian approach, we show that Gaussian processes model calcium spike rates with high fidelity and perform better than standard tools such as peri-stimulus time histograms and kernel smoothing. We employ our modelling concept to analyse calcium spike sequences from dynamically-stimulated HEK293T cells. Under these conditions, different cells often experience diverse stimuli time courses, which is a situation likely to occur <i>in vivo</i>. This single cell variability and the concomitant small number of calcium spikes per cell pose a significant modelling challenge, but we demonstrate that Gaussian processes can successfully describe calcium spike rates in these circumstances. Our results therefore pave the way towards a statistical description of heterogeneous calcium oscillations in a dynamic environment.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0pkioumH9Mg" width="1" />

<p>by Gudrun Gygli, Maria FÃ¡tima Lucas, Victor Guallar, Willem J. H. van Berkel</p>

Vanillyl alcohol oxidase (VAO) is a homooctameric flavoenzyme belonging to the VAO/PCMH family. Each VAO subunit consists of two domains, the FAD-binding and the cap domain. VAO catalyses, among other reactions, the two-step conversion of <i>p-</i>creosol (2-methoxy-4-methylphenol) to vanillin (4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde). To elucidate how different ligands enter and exit the secluded active site, Monte Carlo based simulations have been performed. One entry/exit path via the subunit interface and two additional exit paths have been identified for phenolic ligands, all leading to the <i>si</i> side of FAD. We argue that the entry/exit path is the most probable route for these ligands. A fourth path leading to the <i>re</i> side of FAD has been found for the co-ligands dioxygen and hydrogen peroxide. Based on binding energies and on the behaviour of ligands in these four paths, we propose a sequence of events for ligand and co-ligand migration during catalysis. We have also identified two residues, His466 and Tyr503, which could act as concierges of the active site for phenolic ligands, as well as two other residues, Tyr51 and Tyr408, which could act as a gateway to the <i>re</i> side of FAD for dioxygen. Most of the residues in the four paths are also present in VAOâs closest relatives, eugenol oxidase and <i>p</i>-cresol methylhydroxylase. Key path residues show movements in our simulations that correspond well to conformations observed in crystal structures of these enzymes. Preservation of other path residues can be linked to the electron acceptor specificity and oligomerisation state of the three enzymes. This study is the first comprehensive overview of ligand and co-ligand migration in a member of the VAO/PCMH family, and provides a proof of concept for the use of an unbiased method to sample this process.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Muxexz4UbOk" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/VhFO6g8iZto/article">Inferring oscillatory modulation in neural spike trains</a></h4>

<p>by Kensuke Arai, Robert E. Kass</p>

Oscillations are observed at various frequency bands in continuous-valued neural recordings like the electroencephalogram (EEG) and local field potential (LFP) in bulk brain matter, and analysis of spike-field coherence reveals that spiking of single neurons often occurs at certain phases of the global oscillation. Oscillatory modulation has been examined in relation to continuous-valued oscillatory signals, and independently from the spike train alone, but behavior or stimulus triggered firing-rate modulation, spiking sparseness, presence of slow modulation not locked to stimuli and irregular oscillations with large variability in oscillatory periods, present challenges to searching for temporal structures present in the spike train. In order to study oscillatory modulation in real data collected under a variety of experimental conditions, we describe a flexible point-process framework we call the Latent Oscillatory Spike Train (LOST) model to decompose the instantaneous firing rate in biologically and behaviorally relevant factors: spiking refractoriness, event-locked firing rate non-stationarity, and trial-to-trial variability accounted for by baseline offset and a stochastic oscillatory modulation. We also extend the LOST model to accommodate changes in the modulatory structure over the duration of the experiment, and thereby discover trial-to-trial variability in the spike-field coherence of a rat primary motor cortical neuron to the LFP theta rhythm. Because LOST incorporates a latent stochastic auto-regressive term, LOST is able to detect oscillations when the firing rate is low, the modulation is weak, and when the modulating oscillation has a broad spectral peak.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VhFO6g8iZto" width="1" />

The hippocampus community, and the wider groups of neuroscientists studying learning and memory, were shocked to learn of the sudden and unexpected death of Dr Howard Eichenbaum on 21 July 2017. An immensely respected and well-liked figure, Howard made major contributions to our understanding of the neurobiology of memory at a systems level. In addition to his scientific contributions, he was also a diligent member and steward of the neuroscience community as Editor of the journal Hippocampus and in many other ways.

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>: To test serum tau as a predictor of neurological outcome after cardiac arrest.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b>: We measured the neuronal protein tau in serum at 24, 48, and 72 h after cardiac arrest in 689 patients in the prospective international Target Temperature Management trial. The main outcome was poor neurological outcome, defined as Cerebral Performance Category 3-5 at 6 months.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>: Increased tau was associated with poor outcome at 6 months after cardiac arrest (median 38.5 [IQR 5.7-245] ng/L in poor versus 1.5 [0.7-2.4] ng/L in good outcome, for tau at 72 h, p&lt;0.0001). Tau improved prediction of poor outcome compared to using clinical information (p&lt;0.0001). Tau cut-offs had low false positive rates (FPR) for good outcome while retaining high sensitivity for poor outcome. For example, tau at 72 h had FPR 2% (95% CI 1-4%) with sensitivity 66% (95% CI 61-70%). Tau had higher accuracy than serum NSE (the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.91 for tau versus 0.86 for NSE at 72 hours, p=0.00024). During follow-up (up to 956 days), tau was significantly associated with overall survival. The accuracy to predict outcome by serum tau was equally high for patients randomized to 33Â°C and 36Â°C targeted temperature after cardiac arrest.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation</b>: Serum tau is a promising novel biomarker for prediction of neurological outcome in patients with cardiac arrest. It may be significantly better than serum NSE, which is recommended in guidelines and currently used in clinical practice in several countries to predict outcome after cardiac arrest.

<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>: Inflammatory response plays an important role in Parkinson's disease (PD). Previous studies have reported an association between human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-<em>DRB1</em> and the risk of PD. There has also been growing interest in investigating whether inflammation-related genes interact with environmental factors such as smoking to influence PD risk. We performed a pooled analysis of the interaction between <em>HLA-DRB1</em> and smoking in PD in three population-based case-control studies from Denmark and France.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b>: We included 2,056 cases and 2,723 controls from three PD studies (Denmark, France) that obtained information on smoking through interviews. Genotyping of the rs660895 polymorphism in the <em>HLA-DRB1</em> region was based on saliva or blood DNA samples. To assess interactions, we used logistic regression with product terms between rs660895 and smoking. We performed random-effects meta-analysis of marginal associations and interactions.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>: Both carrying rs660895-G (AG vs. AA: OR= 0.81; GG vs. AA: OR= 0.56; p-trend=0.003) and ever smoking (OR=0.56, p&lt;0.001) were inversely associated with PD. A multiplicative interaction was observed between rs660895 and smoking using codominant, additive (interaction parameter=1.37, p=0.005), and dominant (interaction parameter=1.54, p=0.001) genetic models without any heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup>=0.0%): the inverse association of rs660895-(AG+GG) with PD seen in never smokers (OR=0.64, p&lt;0.001) disappeared among ever smokers (OR=1.00, p=0.99). Similar interactions were observed when we investigated light and heavy smokers separately.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation</b>: Our study provides the first evidence that smoking modifies the previously reported inverse association of rs660895-G with PD, and suggests that smoking and <em>HLA-DRB1</em> are involved in common pathways, possibly related to neuroinflammation.

<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>: <sup>18</sup>F-flortaucipir (formerly <sup>18</sup>F-AV1451 or <sup>18</sup>F-T807) binds to neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but tissue studies assessing binding to tau aggregates in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) have yielded mixed results. We compared <em>in vivo</em> <sup>18</sup>F-flortaucipir uptake in patients meeting clinical research criteria for PSP (N=33) to normal controls (N=46) and patients meeting criteria for Parkinson's disease (PD, N=26).</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b>: Participants underwent MRI and positron emission tomography for amyloid-Î² (<sup>11</sup>C-PiB or <sup>18</sup>F-florbetapir) and tau (<sup>18</sup>F-flortaucipir). <sup>18</sup>F-flortaucipir Standardized Uptake Value Ratios were calculated (t=80-100 min, cerebellum gray matter reference). Voxelwise and region-of-interest group comparisons were performed in template space, with Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analyses to assess single-subject discrimination. Qualitative comparisons with postmortem tau are reported in one patient who died nine months after <sup>18</sup>F-flortaucipir.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>: Clinical PSP patients showed bilaterally elevated <sup>18</sup>F-flortaucipir uptake in globus pallidus, putamen, subthalamic nucleus, midbrain and dentate nucleus relative to controls and PD patients (voxelwise p&lt;0.05 family-wise-error-corrected). Globus pallidus binding best distinguished PSP patients from controls and PD (Area Under the Curve (AUC)=0.872 vs. controls, AUC=0.893 vs. PD). PSP clinical severity did not correlate with <sup>18</sup>F-flortaucipir in any region. A patient with clinical PSP and pathological diagnosis of corticobasal degeneration had severe tau-pathology in PSP-related brain structures with good correspondence between <em>in vivo</em> <sup>18</sup>F-flortaucipir and postmortem tau neuropathology.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation</b>: <sup>18</sup>F-flortaucipir uptake was elevated in PSP versus controls and PD patients in a pattern consistent with the expected distribution of tau pathology. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p></div>

Inhibitory interneurons comprise a diverse subpopulation of cells that are critical to circuit function. How distinct inhibitory microcircuits control long-range projections remains poorly understood. A recent study by Lu and colleagues uncovered a unidirectional microcircuit of prefrontal chandelier cells that preferentially innervate and suppress long-range amygdala-projecting pyramidal cells.

Self representation is fundamental to mental functions. While the self has mostly been studied in traditional psychophilosophical terms (âself as subjectâ), recent laboratory work suggests that the self can be measured quantitatively by assessing biases towards self-associated stimuli (âself as objectâ). Here, we summarize new quantitative paradigms for assessing the self, drawn from psychology, neuroeconomics, embodied cognition, and social neuroscience. We then propose a neural model of the self as an emerging property of interactions between a core âself networkâ (e.g., medial prefrontal cortex; mPFC), a cognitive control network [e.g., dorsolateral (dl)PFC], and a salience network (e.g., insula).

While clues have existed that endosomal trafficking is associated with Alzheimerâs disease (AD), whether it plays a central role in the disease and if so how has remained unknown. Here we rely on recent genetic and cellular findings to construct a model proposing that traffic jams in the early endosome can act as an upstream pathogenic hub in AD. We also rely on an independent series of findings to suggest how the traffic jams can act as a unified mediator of downstream pathophysiology. The model predicts, therefore, that interventions designed to unjam the endosome carry high therapeutic promise.

Over the past few years our understanding of estrogen signaling in the brain has expanded rapidly. Estrogens are synthesized in the periphery and in the brain, acting on multiple receptors to regulate gene transcription, neural function, and behavior. Various estrogen-sensitive signaling pathways often operate in concert within the same cell, increasing the complexity of the system. In females, estrogen concentrations fluctuate over the estrous/menstrual cycle, dynamically modulating estrogen receptor (ER) expression, activity, and trafficking.
