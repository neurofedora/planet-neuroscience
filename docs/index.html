              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05211">Language-specific Tonal Features Drive Speaker-Listener Neural Synchronization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.05211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Verbal communication transmits information across diverse linguistic levels, with neural synchronization (NS) between speakers and listeners emerging as a putative mechanism underlying successful exchange. However, the specific speech features driving this synchronization and how language-specific versus universal characteristics facilitate information transfer remain poorly understood. We developed a novel content-based interbrain encoding model to disentangle the contributions of acoustic and linguistic features to speaker-listener NS during Mandarin storytelling and listening, as measured via magnetoencephalography (MEG). Results revealed robust NS throughout frontotemporal-parietal networks with systematic time lags between speech production and perception. Crucially, suprasegmental lexical tone features (tone categories, pitch height, and pitch contour), essential for lexical meaning in Mandarin, contributed more significantly to NS than either acoustic elements or universal segmental units (consonants and vowels). These tonal features generated distinctive spatiotemporal NS patterns, creating language-specific neural "communication channels" that facilitated efficient representation sharing between interlocutors. Furthermore, the strength and patterns of NS driven by these language-specific features predicted communication success. These findings demonstrate the neural mechanisms underlying shared representations during verbal exchange and highlight how language-specific features can shape neural coupling to optimize information transfer during human communication.

                arXiv:2503.05564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural encoding of objects and cognitive states remains an elusive yet crucial aspect of brain function. While traditional feed-forward machine learning neural networks have enormous potential to encode information, modern architectures provide little insight into the brain's mechanisms. In this work, a Jansen and Rit neural mass model was constructed to encode different sets of inputs, aiming to understand how simple neural circuits can represent information. A genetic algorithm was used to optimize parameters that maximized the differences in responses to particular inputs. These differences in responses manifested as phase-shifted oscillations across the set of inputs. By delivering impulses of excitation synchronized with a particular phase-shifted oscillation, we demonstrated that the encoded phase could be decoded by measuring oscillatory power. These findings demonstrate the capability of neural dynamical circuits to encode and decode information through phase.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05645">The Amplitude Modulation Structure of Japanese Infant- and Child-Directed Speech: Longitudinal Data Reveal Universal Acoustic Physical Structures Underpinning Moraic Timing</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.05645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infant-directed speech (IDS) is highly rhythmic, and in European languages IDS is dominated by patterns of amplitude modulation (AM) at ~2Hz (reflecting prosody) and ~5Hz (reflecting individual syllables). The rhythm structure of spoken Japanese is thought to differ from European stress-timed and syllable-timed languages, depending on moraic units. Morae comprise any onset phoneme and vowel phonemes within a syllable, PA-N-DA. Arguably, initial speech encoding via cortical tracking by infants is likely to utilize language-universal physical acoustic structures in speech rather than language-specific structures like morae, since the infant brain must be prepared to acquire any human language. Here a language-blind computational model of linguistic rhythm based on features of the amplitude envelope is used to compute these physical acoustic stimulus characteristics for Japanese. Using ~18,000 samples of natural IDS and child-directed speech (CDS) recorded longitudinally from 6 parents while speaking to their children over the ages 0-5 years, we find that the temporal modulation patterns that characterise the amplitude envelope of Japanese are highly similar to those found for stress-timed and syllable-timed European languages. However, the AM band corresponding to the syllabic level in CDS/IDS in European languages (~2-12Hz, theta-rate cortical tracking) was elongated in Japanese (2.5-17Hz). Further, the phase synchronization ratios between the two slowest AM bands were as likely to be 1:3 as 1:2, which differs from European languages where 1:2 ratios are dominant. Accordingly, the language-universal amplitude-driven physical acoustic structures important for cortical speech tracking flexibly accommodate language-specific differences in core rhythmic units.

                arXiv:2503.05031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major neurodegenerative condition that affects millions around the world. As one of the main biomarkers in the AD diagnosis procedure, brain amyloid positivity is typically identified by positron emission tomography (PET), which is costly and invasive. Brain structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) may provide a safer and more convenient solution for the AD diagnosis. Recent advances in geometric deep learning have facilitated sMRI analysis and early diagnosis of AD. However, determining AD pathology, such as brain amyloid deposition, in preclinical stage remains challenging, as less significant morphological changes can be observed. As a result, few AD classification models are generalizable to the brain amyloid positivity classification task. Blood-based biomarkers (BBBMs), on the other hand, have recently achieved remarkable success in predicting brain amyloid positivity and identifying individuals with high risk of being brain amyloid positive. However, individuals in medium risk group still require gold standard tests such as Amyloid PET for further evaluation. Inspired by the recent success of transformer architectures, we propose a geometric deep learning model based on transformer that is both scalable and robust to variations in input volumetric mesh size. Our work introduced a novel tokenization scheme for tetrahedral meshes, incorporating anatomical landmarks generated by a pre-trained Gaussian process model. Our model achieved superior classification performance in AD classification task. In addition, we showed that the model was also generalizable to the brain amyloid positivity prediction with individuals in the medium risk class, where BM alone cannot achieve a clear classification. Our work may enrich geometric deep learning research and improve AD diagnosis accuracy without using expensive and invasive PET scans.

                arXiv:2406.15665v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Any treatment of multiple sclerosis should preserve mental function, considering how cognitive deterioration interferes with quality of life. However, mental assessment is still realized with neuro-psychological tests without monitoring cognition on neurobiological grounds whereas the ongoing neural activity is readily observable and readable.
  Objectives: The proposed method deciphers electrical brain states which as multi-dimensional cognetoms quantitatively discriminate normal from pathological patterns in an EEG.
  Methods: Baseline recordings from a prior EEG study of 93 subjects, 37 with MS, were analyzed. Spectral bands served to compute cognetoms and categorize subsequent feature combination sets.
  Results: A significant correlation arose between brain states predictors, clinical data and disease duration. Using cognetoms and spectral bands, a cross-sectional comparison separated patients from controls with a precision of 82% while using bands alone arrived at 64%.
  Conclusions: Brain states analysis successfully distinguishes controls from patients with MS. The congruity with disease duration is a neurobiological indicator for disease accumulation over time. Our results imply that data-driven comparisons of EEG data may complement customary diagnostic methods in neurology and psychiatry. However, thinking ahead for quantitative monitoring of disease time course and treatment efficacy, we hope to have established the analytic principles applicable to longitudinal clinical studies.

                arXiv:2410.17620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brain perceptual rivalry, exemplified by auditory stream segregation of competing tones (A_, B__, ABA_), serves as a core mechanism of brain perception formation. While increasingly recognized as determining by neural connections rather than specific neural groups, the mechanism of brain perception remains uncertain. We demonstrate that auditory stream segregation arises from the topological structure of holistic neural pathways. By constructing a holistic pathway model using existing neurophysiological data, combining nonlinear neural dynamics and nonequilibrium physics, we uncover the biophysical mechanism of perceptual phase transitions from integrated (ABA_) to segregated streams (A_ or B_), as well as the mechanism of temporal dynamics, perceptual switching path, and attention regulation underlying these transitions. Further, we demonstrate how our framework reveals energy consumption of the auditory system and combines it with neuroelectrophysiology. Two psycho-acoustic experiments validate our predictions of perception alternation and attention modulation. Our framework provides a transformative perspective on how brain networks generate complex perceptual experiences, emphasizing the significance of neural pathway structure in the process of brain function realization.

                arXiv:2412.04191v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans perform exquisite sensorimotor skills, both individually and in teams, from athletes performing rhythmic gymnastics to everyday tasks like carrying a cup of coffee. The "predictive brain" framework suggests that mastering these skills relies on predictive mechanisms, raising the question of how we deploy predictions for real-time control and coordination. This review highlights two research lines, showing that during the control of complex objects people make the interaction with 'tools' predictable; and that during dyadic coordination people make their behavior predictable and legible for their partners. These studies demonstrate that to achieve sophisticated motor skills, we play "prediction tricks": we select subspaces of predictable solutions and make sensorimotor interactions more predictable and legible by and for others. This synthesis underscores the critical role of predictability in optimizing control strategies across contexts. Furthermore, it emphasizes the need for novel studies on the scope and limits of predictive mechanisms in motor control.

                arXiv:2503.01906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a model inspired by the Global Workspace Theory that integrates specialized modules to perform a sequential reasoning task. A controller selectively routes information between modules through the workspace using a gating mechanism. This approach allows the model to chain operations by iteratively broadcasting information between specialized domains, mimicking System-2 reasoning. We evaluate the model's performance on a simple addition task, where two addends must be summed. The task can be solved by routing information sequentially through an Input module, an Increment module (multiple times), and finally an Output module. We consider two implementations of this system with increasing complexity. First, using hand-designed modules operating on one-hot digit representations, the controller (a LSTM recurrent network) learns to select the appropriate modules (input, increment, output) in the appropriate sequence. Second, we replace the hand-designed modules with learned representation modules for MNIST images and an increment module trained on the task objectives; here again, the controller learns the appropriate sequential module selection to solve the task. Finally, we show that the Global Workspace model, while having fewer parameters, outperforms LSTMs and Transformers when tested on unseen addition operations (both interpolations and extrapolations of addition operations seen during training). Our results highlight the potential of architectures inspired by the Global Workspace Theory to enhance deep learning's reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Specific empirical phenomena spanning human natural language, and mathematical and logical abilities, are rigorously situated in the well-studied grammar-automata (G-A) hierarchy. We identify three tiers and corresponding two transitions within the hierarchy and show their correspondence to the emergence of particular abilities in humans and in transformer-based language models (LMs). These emergent abilities have often been described in terms of "scaling"; we show that it is the transition between tiers, rather than size itself, that determines a system's capabilities. Specifically, humans effortlessly process language yet require specific training to perform arithmetic or logical reasoning tasks; and LMs possess language abilities absent from predecessor systems yet still struggle with logical processing. The resulting principled analyses provide underlying explanatory accounts of both the abilities and shortfalls of these systems, and suggest actionable insights into the expansion of logic abilities in AI systems.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems address issues of accessibility and scalability of artificial intelligence (AI) foundation models, which are often represented by large language models. We develop a framework - the "Society of HiveMind" (SOHM) - that orchestrates the interaction between multiple AI foundation models, imitating the observed behavior of animal swarms in nature by following modern evolutionary theories. On the one hand, we find that the SOHM provides a negligible benefit on tasks that mainly require real-world knowledge. On the other hand, we remark a significant improvement on tasks that require intensive logical reasoning, indicating that multi-agent systems are capable of increasing the reasoning capabilities of the collective compared to the individual agents. Our findings demonstrate the potential of combining a multitude of diverse AI foundation models to form an artificial swarm intelligence capable of self-improvement through interactions with a given environment.

Abstract: Animals achieve sophisticated behavioral control through dynamic coupling of the brain, body, and environment. Accordingly, the co-design approach, in which both the controllers and the physical properties are optimized simultaneously, has been suggested for generating refined agents without designing each component separately. In this study, we aim to reveal how the function of the information processing is distributed between brains and bodies while applying the co-design approach. Using a framework called ``backpropagation through soft body," we developed agents to perform specified tasks and analyzed their mechanisms. The tasks included classification and corresponding behavioral association, nonlinear dynamical system emulation, and autonomous behavioral generation. In each case, our analyses revealed reciprocal relationships between the brains and bodies. In addition, we show that optimized brain functionalities can be embedded into bodies using physical reservoir computing techniques. Our results pave the way for efficient designs of brain--body coupling systems.

                arXiv:2503.04901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiscale homogenization of woven composites requires detailed micromechanical evaluations, leading to high computational costs. Data-driven surrogate models based on neural networks address this challenge but often suffer from big data requirements, limited interpretability, and poor extrapolation capabilities. This study introduces a Hierarchical Physically Recurrent Neural Network (HPRNN) employing two levels of surrogate modeling. First, Physically Recurrent Neural Networks (PRNNs) are trained to capture the nonlinear elasto-plastic behavior of warp and weft yarns using micromechanical data. In a second scale transition, a physics-encoded meso-to-macroscale model integrates these yarn surrogates with the matrix constitutive model, embedding physical properties directly into the latent space. Adopting HPRNNs for both scale transitions can avoid nonphysical behavior often observed in predictions from pure data-driven recurrent neural networks and transformer networks. This results in better generalization under complex cyclic loading conditions. The framework offers a computationally efficient and explainable solution for multiscale modeling of woven composites.

                arXiv:2503.05573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model-based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for autonomous driving, where data efficiency and robustness are critical. Yet, existing solutions often rely on carefully crafted, task specific extrinsic rewards, limiting generalization to new tasks or environments. In this paper, we propose InDRiVE (Intrinsic Disagreement based Reinforcement for Vehicle Exploration), a method that leverages purely intrinsic, disagreement based rewards within a Dreamer based MBRL framework. By training an ensemble of world models, the agent actively explores high uncertainty regions of environments without any task specific feedback. This approach yields a task agnostic latent representation, allowing for rapid zero shot or few shot fine tuning on downstream driving tasks such as lane following and collision avoidance. Experimental results in both seen and unseen environments demonstrate that InDRiVE achieves higher success rates and fewer infractions compared to DreamerV2 and DreamerV3 baselines despite using significantly fewer training steps. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of purely intrinsic exploration for learning robust vehicle control behaviors, paving the way for more scalable and adaptable autonomous driving systems.

                arXiv:2303.11949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting body fat can provide medical practitioners and users with essential information for preventing and diagnosing heart diseases. Hybrid machine learning models offer better performance than simple regression analysis methods by selecting relevant body measurements and capturing complex nonlinear relationships among selected features in modelling body fat prediction problems. There are, however, some disadvantages to them. Current machine learning. Modelling body fat prediction as a combinatorial single- and multi-objective optimisation problem often gets stuck in local optima. When multiple feature subsets produce similar or close predictions, avoiding local optima becomes more complex. Evolutionary feature selection has been used to solve several machine-learning-based optimisation problems. A fuzzy set theory determines appropriate levels of exploration and exploitation while managing parameterisation and computational costs. A weighted-sum body fat prediction approach was explored using evolutionary feature selection, fuzzy set theory, and machine learning algorithms, integrating contradictory metrics into a single composite goal optimised by fuzzy adaptive evolutionary feature selection. Hybrid fuzzy adaptive global learning local search universal diversity-based feature selection is applied to this single-objective feature selection-machine learning framework (FAGLSUD-based FS-ML). While using fewer features, this model achieved a more accurate and stable estimate of body fat percentage than other hybrid and state-of-the-art machine learning models. A multi-objective FAGLSUD-based FS-MLP is also proposed to analyse accuracy, stability, and dimensionality conflicts simultaneously. To make informed decisions about fat deposits in the most vital body parts and blood lipid levels, medical practitioners and users can use a well-distributed Pareto set of trade-off solutions.

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) exhibit powerful capabilities for generating natural text. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) can discover diverse solutions to complex real-world problems. Motivated by the common collective and directionality of text generation and evolution, this paper first illustrates the conceptual parallels between LLMs and EAs at a micro level, which includes multiple one-to-one key characteristics: token representation and individual representation, position encoding and fitness shaping, position embedding and selection, Transformers block and reproduction, and model training and parameter adaptation. These parallels highlight potential opportunities for technical advancements in both LLMs and EAs. Subsequently, we analyze existing interdisciplinary research from a macro perspective to uncover critical challenges, with a particular focus on evolutionary fine-tuning and LLM-enhanced EAs. These analyses not only provide insights into the evolutionary mechanisms behind LLMs but also offer potential directions for enhancing the capabilities of artificial agents.

                arXiv:2406.16976v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular discovery, when formulated as an optimization problem, presents significant computational challenges because optimization objectives can be non-differentiable. Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), often used to optimize black-box objectives in molecular discovery, traverse chemical space by performing random mutations and crossovers, leading to a large number of expensive objective evaluations. In this work, we ameliorate this shortcoming by incorporating chemistry-aware Large Language Models (LLMs) into EAs. Namely, we redesign crossover and mutation operations in EAs using LLMs trained on large corpora of chemical information. We perform extensive empirical studies on both commercial and open-source models on multiple tasks involving property optimization, molecular rediscovery, and structure-based drug design, demonstrating that the joint usage of LLMs with EAs yields superior performance over all baseline models across single- and multi-objective settings. We demonstrate that our algorithm improves both the quality of the final solution and convergence speed, thereby reducing the number of required objective evaluations.

Abstract: In the evolutionary computing community, the remarkable language-handling capabilities and reasoning power of large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced the functionality of evolutionary algorithms (EAs), enabling them to tackle optimization problems involving structured language or program code. Although this field is still in its early stages, its impressive potential has led to the development of various LLM-based EAs. To effectively evaluate the performance and practical applicability of these LLM-based EAs, benchmarks with real-world relevance are essential. In this paper, we focus on LLM-based recommender systems (RSs) and introduce a benchmark problem set, named RSBench, specifically designed to assess the performance of LLM-based EAs in recommendation prompt optimization. RSBench emphasizes session-based recommendations, aiming to discover a set of Pareto optimal prompts that guide the recommendation process, providing accurate, diverse, and fair recommendations. We develop three LLM-based EAs based on established EA frameworks and experimentally evaluate their performance using RSBench. Our study offers valuable insights into the application of EAs in LLM-based RSs. Additionally, we explore key components that may influence the overall performance of the RS, providing meaningful guidance for future research on the development of LLM-based EAs in RSs.

Abstract: A variety of defenses have been proposed against Trojans planted in (backdoor attacks on) deep neural network (DNN) classifiers. Backdoor-agnostic methods seek to reliably detect and/or to mitigate backdoors irrespective of the incorporation mechanism used by the attacker, while inversion methods explicitly assume one. In this paper, we describe a new detector that: relies on embedded feature representations to estimate (invert) the backdoor and to identify its target class; can operate without access to the training dataset; and is highly effective for various incorporation mechanisms (i.e., is backdoor agnostic). Our detection approach is evaluated -- and found to be favorable - in comparison with an array of published defenses for a variety of different attacks on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 image-classification domains.

Abstract: The well-known generalization problem hinders the application of artificial neural networks in continuous-time prediction tasks with varying latent dynamics. In sharp contrast, biological systems can neatly adapt to evolving environments benefiting from real-time feedback mechanisms. Inspired by the feedback philosophy, we present feedback neural networks, showing that a feedback loop can flexibly correct the learned latent dynamics of neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs), leading to a prominent generalization improvement. The feedback neural network is a novel two-DOF neural network, which possesses robust performance in unseen scenarios with no loss of accuracy performance on previous tasks.} A linear feedback form is presented to correct the learned latent dynamics firstly, with a convergence guarantee. Then, domain randomization is utilized to learn a nonlinear neural feedback form. Finally, extensive tests including trajectory prediction of a real irregular object and model predictive control of a quadrotor with various uncertainties, are implemented, indicating significant improvements over state-of-the-art model-based and learning-based methods.

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing is a relatively new discipline of computer science, where the principles of biological brain's computation and memory are used to create a new way of processing information, based on networks of spiking neurons. Those networks can be implemented as both analog and digital implementations, where for the latter, the Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are a frequent choice, due to their inherent flexibility, allowing the researchers to easily design hardware neuromorphic architecture (NMAs). Moreover, digital NMAs show good promise in simulating various spiking neural networks because of their inherent accuracy and resilience to noise, as opposed to analog implementations. This paper presents an overview of digital NMAs implemented on FPGAs, with a goal of providing useful references to various architectural design choices to the researchers interested in digital neuromorphic systems. We present a taxonomy of NMAs that highlights groups of distinct architectural features, their advantages and disadvantages and identify trends and predictions for the future of those architectures.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Activation of cannabinoid CB1 or CB2 receptors induces the death of glial progenitors from the chick retina in culture. Here, by using an enriched retinal glial cell culture, we characterized some mechanisms underlying glial death promoted by cannabinoids. Methods and Results: Retinal cultures obtained from 8-day-old (E8) chick embryos and maintained for 12&amp;amp;ndash;15 days (C12&amp;amp;ndash;15) were used. MTT assays revealed that the CB1/CB2 agonist WIN 55,212-2 (WIN) decreased cell viability in the cultures in a time-dependent manner, with a concomitant increase in extracellular LDH activity, suggesting membrane integrity loss. Cell death was also dose-dependently induced by cannabidiol (CBD), &amp;amp;Delta;9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and CP55940, another CB1/CB2 agonist. In contrast to WIN-induced cell death that was not blocked by either antagonist, the deleterious effect of CBD was blocked by the CB2 receptor antagonist SR144528, but not by PF514273, a CB1 receptor antagonist. WIN-treated cultures showed glial cells with large vacuoles in cytoplasm that were absent in cultures incubated with WIN plus 4-phenyl-butyrate (PBA), a chemical chaperone. Since cannabinoids induced the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2-alfa (eIF2&amp;amp;alpha;), these results suggest a process of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) swelling and stress. Incubation of the cultures with WIN for 4 h induced a ~five-fold increase in the number of cells labeled with the ROS indicator CM-H2DCFDA. WIN induced the phosphorylation of JNK but not of p38 in the cultures, and also induced an increase in the number of glial cells expressing cleaved-caspase 3 (c-CASP3). The decrease in cell viability and the expression of c-CASP3 was blocked by salubrinal, an inhibitor of eIF2&amp;amp;alpha; dephosphorylation. Conclusions: These data suggest that cannabinoids induce the apoptosis of glial cells in culture by promoting ROS production, ER stress, JNK phosphorylation, and caspase-3 processing.

	<p>Background: Middle-aged and elderly individuals may experience detrimental health effects due to ischemic stroke (IS). The inflammatory response triggered during IS exacerbates neuronal damage, becoming a barrier to effective IS treatment and leading to poor patient prognosis. Nevertheless, the specific role of microglia in the inflammatory response triggered by IS remains mostly unclear. The primary target of this investigation is to study the neuroinflammatory impact of lycorine (LYC) during the IS process. Our objective is to evaluate whether LYC deploys its anti-inflammatory effect with modulation of the NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B signaling pathway, thereby reducing IS symptoms. Methods: In this research, BV-2 cells were pre-treated with LYC for 24 h before LPS was added to induce inflammation. Results: It has been discovered that LYC suppresses BV-2 cell polarization and reduces the levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1&amp;amp;beta;, IL-6, TNF-&amp;amp;alpha;), showing its potential anti-inflammatory effects in vitro. Furthermore, I&amp;amp;kappa;B&amp;amp;alpha; and p65 play crucial roles in regulating the inflammatory response within the NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B signaling pathway. Mechanistic exploration indicates that LYC can activate the expression of I&amp;amp;kappa;B&amp;amp;alpha; in LPS-induced BV-2 cells. I&amp;amp;kappa;B&amp;amp;alpha; inhibits NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B by binding to its p65 subunit, sequestering it in the cytoplasm and preventing its translocation to the nucleus, thereby inhibiting inflammation. Additionally, p65 is a key transcription factor for pro-inflammatory genes, and its downregulation leads to decreased transcriptional activity of these genes. The combined effect of increased I&amp;amp;kappa;B&amp;amp;alpha; and decreased p65 results in significantly reduced NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B activity, thereby alleviating the inflammatory response. Meanwhile, in vivo studies indicate that LYC pre-treatment significantly reduces the infarct size caused by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats. The assessment of cerebral infarction volume, neurological scores, brain edema rate and inflammation levels in MCAO rats pre-treated with LYC indicates positive therapeutic effects. Conclusions: In summary, our research indicates that LYC pre-treatment has significant anti-inflammatory effects by attenuating inflammation levels through NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B inhibition, which contributes to potential therapeutic benefits in ischemic stroke (IS) and may improve disease prognosis. LYC may serve as an adjunctive clinical pre-treatment for IS, which has to be confirmed by clinical trials in the future.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: In many societies, especially in highly masculine societies like Japan, being a man, getting older, engaging in knowledge work, and earning a high annual salary are seen as conditions for success. On the other hand, an increasing number of studies have shown that incorporating kawaii-ness into our lives can help maintain and improve happiness and well-being. Methods: Therefore, in this study, we employed a variable expressing the response to kawaii-ness together with four demographic variables (sex, age, income, and knowledge work), happiness, and fractional anisotropy brain healthcare quotient (FA-BHQ) which is derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images calculations to analyze the relationship between them. Results: The results of a path analysis using data obtained from 182 healthy men and women showed that kawaii-ness mediates the association between demographic variables and happiness, which is in turn associated with FA-BHQ. Furthermore, with the correlation analysis between happiness and individual FA regions, we were able to confirm that FA regions, including the limbic-thalamo-cortical pathway, which is responsible for emotional regulation, are related to happiness. Conclusions: These results indicate the following: Men, older people, people engaged in knowledge work, and people with high annual incomes avoid kawaii-ness; As a result, they are unable to obtain the sense of happiness that they should have; as a result, they are unable to keep their brains healthy, and their brain functions, including emotional regulation, are not functioning properly; This may prevent them from maintaining or improving their performance. This study is the first attempt to clarify the relationship between demographic scales, kawaii-ness, happiness, and brain conditions.</p>

                <p>Congenital titinopathy has recently emerged as one of the most common congenital muscle disorders.</p>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To better understand the presentation and clinical needs of the under-characterized extreme end of the congenital titinopathy severity spectrum.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We comprehensively analyzed the clinical, imaging, pathology, autopsy, and genetic findings in 15 severely affected individuals from 11 families.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Prenatal features included hypokinesia or akinesia and growth restriction. Six pregnancies were terminated. Nine infants were born at or near term with severe-to-profound weakness and required resuscitation. Seven died following withdrawal of life support. Two surviving children require ongoing respiratory support. Most cohort members had at least 1 disease-causing variant predicted to result in some near-normal-length titin expression. The exceptions, from 2 unrelated families, had homozygous truncating variants predicted to induce complete nonsense mediated decay. However, subsequent analyses suggested that the causative variant in each family had an additional previously unrecognized impact on splicing likely to result in some near-normal-length titin expression. This impact was confirmed by minigene assay for 1 variant.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study confirms the clinical variability of congenital titinopathy. Severely affected individuals succumb prenatally/during infancy, whereas others survive into adulthood. It is likely that this variability is because of differences in the amount and/or length of expressed titin. If confirmed, analysis of titin expression could facilitate clinical prediction and increasing expression might be an effective treatment strategy. Our findings also further-support the hypothesis that some near-normal-length titin expression is essential to early prenatal survival. Sometimes expression of normal/near-normal-length titin is due to disease-causing variants having an additional impact on splicing. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:611–628</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Many neurodegenerative disorders share a common pathologic feature involving the deposition of abnormal tau protein in the brain (tauopathies). This suggests that there may be some shared pathophysiologic mechanism(s). The largest risk factor for the majority of these disorders is aging, suggesting involvement of the aging process in the shared pathophysiology. We test the hypothesis that an increase in bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling that occurs during aging contributes to the onset and progression of tauopathies.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons from patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) were used to investigate the effects of BMP signaling on tau phosphorylation and release and the mechanisms underlying these effects. Wildtype mice were used to examine effects of BMP signaling <i>in vivo</i>. P301S (PS19) mice were examined for the effects of BMP signaling in a model of tauopathy.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Here, we show that BMP signaling, mediated by non-canonical p38 signaling, increases tau phosphorylation and release of p-tau in human iPSC-derived AD neurons. Further, there is an interaction between BMP signaling and apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) that significantly increases tau phosphorylation and release compared with ApoE3 neurons. Inhibiting BMP signaling reduces the changes in tau in the cultured human neurons, and it limits tau pathology and prevents cognitive decline in PS19 mice.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our study suggests that the age-related increase in BMP signaling may participate in the onset and progression of tau pathology. Thus, therapeutic interventions that reduce BMP signaling in the aging brain could potentially slow or prevent development of diseases involving tau hyperphosphorylation.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a major cause of perinatal brain injury. Creatine is a dietary supplement that can increase intracellular phosphocreatine to improve the provision of intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to meet the increase in metabolic demand of oxygen deprivation. Here, we assessed prophylactic fetal creatine supplementation in reducing acute asphyxia-induced seizures, disordered electroencephalography (EEG) activity and cerebral inflammation and cell death histopathology.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Fetal sheep (118 ± 1 days’ gestational age [dGA]; 0.8 gestation) were implanted with electrodes to continuously record EEG and nuchal electromyogram activity. At 121 dGA, fetuses were randomly assigned to sham control (i.v. saline infusion without umbilical cord occlusion [UCO]; SalCon), continuous i.v. creatine infusion (6 mg/kg/h; CrUCO) or isovolumetric saline (SalUCO) followed by UCO at 128 ± 2 dGA that lasted until the mean arterial blood pressure reached 19 mmHg. Brain tissue was collected for histopathology after 72 hours of recovery.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Creatine supplementation had no effects on basal systemic or neurological physiology. UCO duration did not differ between CrUCO and SalUCO. After reperfusion, CrUCO fetuses had improved EEG power and frequency recovery and reduced electrographic seizure incidence (SalUCO, 86% vs CrUCO, 29%) and burden. At 72 hours after UCO, cell death in the cerebral cortex and astrogliosis in the periventricular white matter were reduced in CrUCO fetuses compared with SalUCO.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Creatine supplementation reduced post-asphyxial seizures and improved EEG recovery. Improvements in functional recovery with creatine were associated with regional reductions in cell death and astrogliosis. Prophylactic creatine treatment has the potential to mitigate functional indices of HIE in the late gestation fetal brain. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:673–687</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27151?af=R">Critical Care Decisions After Large Core Cerebral Infarctions: A Secondary Analysis From the SELECT2 Trial</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Among patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO) and large ischemic cores, critical decisions often need to be made about decompressive hemicraniectomy (DHC) or early withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy (WLST). In this study, we aimed to evaluate utilization of DHC and early WLST and factors associated with them in patients with large strokes from the SELECT2 trial.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed the entire SELECT2 trial population, which randomized 352 patients with stroke due to LVO and large ischemic cores to endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) or medical management. We used the as-treated principle to compare the use of DHC and early WLST within 7 days after randomization. We further assessed functional outcomes (modified Rankin Score) after these decisions.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 352 patients enrolled in this study, 55 received DHC and 81 transitioned to early WLST. Patients treated with EVT were as likely to undergo DHC (16% vs 15%, adjusted relative risk [aRR] = 1.19, 95% CI:0.75–1.88, <i>p</i> = 0.46) or WLST (22% vs 24%, aRR = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.66–1.34, <i>p</i> = 0.72) as those given medical management. DHC was used more frequently in younger patients and WLST more in older patients. EVT efficacy was maintained after adjusting for DHC (adjusted generalized odds ratio [aGenOR] = 1.68, 95% CI: 1.24–2.11, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), with no interaction between DHC and treatment (p-interaction = 0.93). At 1 year, 21% of DHC-treated patients were ambulatory; the outcomes were universally poor after early WLST.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In the SELECT2 trial of patients with large ischemic core, DHC was performed in ~1 of 6 patients and early WLST in ~1 of 5 patients, without differences based on treatment with EVT or medical management, nor successful reperfusion. DHC or WLST did not detract from thrombectomy treatment benefit. Additionally, ~20% of patients achieved independent ambulation despite receiving DHC by the 1-year follow-up. The similar distribution of these critical care decisions provides reassurance that the overall trial outcomes were not biased by open-label treatment allocation.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy is a serious neurologic condition associated with death or neurodevelopmental impairments. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is routinely used for neuroprognostication, but there is substantial subjectivity and uncertainty about neurodevelopmental outcome prediction. We sought to develop an objective and automated approach for the analysis of newborn brain MRI to improve the accuracy of prognostication.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We created an anatomic MRI template from a sample of 286 infants treated with therapeutic hypothermia, and labeled the deep gray-matter structures. We extracted quantitative information, including shape-related information, and information represented by complex patterns (radiomic measures), from each of these structures in all infants. We then trained an elastic net model to use either only these measures, only the infants’ demographic and laboratory data, or both, to predict neurodevelopmental outcomes, as measured by the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development at 18 months of age.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among those infants for whom Bayley scores were available for cognitive, language, and motor outcomes, we found sets of MRI-based measures that could predict their Bayley scores with correlations that were greater than the correlations based on only the demographic and laboratory data, explained more of the variance in the observed scores, and generated a smaller error; predictions based on the combination of the demographic-laboratory and MRI-based measures were similar or marginally better.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings show that machine learning models using MRI-based measures can predict neurodevelopmental outcomes in neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy across all neurodevelopmental domains and across the full spectrum of outcomes. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:791–802</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27156?af=R">Association that Neuroimaging and Clinical Measures Have with Change in Arm Impairment in a Phase 3 Stroke Recovery Trial</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) paired with rehabilitation therapy improved motor status compared to rehabilitation alone in the phase III VNS-REHAB stroke trial, but treatment response was variable and not associated with any clinical measures acquired at baseline, such as age or side of paresis. We hypothesized that neuroimaging measures would be associated with treatment-related gains, examining performance of regional injury measures versus global brain health measures in parallel with clinical measures.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans in the VNS-REHAB trial were used to derive regional injury measures (extent of injury to corticospinal tract, the primary regional measure; plus extent of injury to precentral gyrus and postcentral gyrus; lesion volume; and lesion topography) and global brain health measures (degree of white matter hyperintensities, the primary global brain measure; plus volumes of cerebrospinal fluid, cortical gray matter, white matter, each thalamus, and total brain). Eight clinical measures assessed at baseline were also evaluated (treatment group, age, race, gender, paretic side, pre-stroke dominant hand, time since stroke, and baseline Fugl-Meyer upper extremity score). Bivariate analyses compared each measure with the primary trial end point (change in Fugl-Meyer upper extremity score from baseline to end of 6 weeks of treatment) across all subjects, with secondary analyses examining trial groups separately.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>MRIs were available from 80 patients (age = 59.8 ± 9.5 years, 29 women). Across all patients, less white matter hyperintensities (<i>r</i> = −0.25, <i>p</i> = 0.028) at baseline was associated with larger Fugl-Meyer score change. In the VNS group, less white matter hyperintensities (<i>r</i> = −0.37, <i>p</i> = 0.018) and larger ipsilesional thalamus volume (<i>r</i> = 0.33, <i>p</i> = 0.046) were each associated with larger Fugl-Meyer score change. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) analyses tested the interaction that each baseline measure had with treatment group and found that the model examining white matter hyperintensities had a significant interaction term, indicating 2.3 less change in Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity (FM-UE) points in the VNS group relative to the control group for each point increase in modified Fazekas scale.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Neuroimaging measures are associated with extent of gains on the primary endpoint of a phase III stroke recovery trial. Among the neuroimaging measures examined, a measure of global brain health (extent of white matter hyperintensities) was better at explaining the change in arm impairment as compared with measures of regional injury; this was true when examining all study subjects as well as only those in the VNS group and is consistent with the global mechanism of action that VNS has throughout the cerebrum. Future studies can evaluate additional measures that further predict response to VNS therapy. The current findings suggest that individual patient neuroimaging results may be useful for a personalized medicine approach to stroke recovery therapeutics.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) provides unique insights into the brain and neurological diseases. However, the potential of CSF flow cytometry applied on a large scale remains unknown.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used data-driven approaches to analyze paired CSF and blood flow cytometry measurements from 8,790 patients (discovery cohort) and CSF only data from 3,201 patients (validation cohort) collected across neurological diseases in a real-world setting.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In somatoform controls (n = 788), activation of T cells increased with age in both CSF and blood, whereas double negative blood T cells (CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>−</sup>CD8<sup>−</sup>) decreased with age. A machine learning model of CSF and blood immune cells defined immune age, which correlated strongly with true biological age (<i>r</i> = 0.71). Classifying all diseases solely based on the CSF/blood parameters in 8,790 patients resulted in clusters of 4 disease categories: healthy, autoimmune, meningoencephalitis, and neurodegenerative. This clustering was validated in an analytically independent test dataset (8,790 patients) and in a temporally independent cohort (3,201 patients). Patients with multiple sclerosis were more likely to have progressive disease when assigned to the neurodegeneration cluster and to have lower disability in the autoimmune cluster. Patients with dementia in the neurodegeneration cluster showed more severe disease progression. Flow cytometry helped differentiate dementia from controls, thereby enhancing the diagnostic power of routine CSF diagnostics.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Flow cytometry of CSF and blood thus identifies site-specific aging patterns and disease-overarching patterns of neurodegeneration. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:779–790</p>

We evaluated the performance of a staged screening paradigm using remote smell testing to enrich for abnormal dopamine transporter single-photon emission computed tomography imaging (DAT-SPECT) and alpha-synuclein aggregation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) recruited participants for the prodromal cohort who were 60-years and older without a Parkinson's disease diagnosis. Participants were invited to complete a University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) independently through an online portal. Hyposmic participants were invited to complete DAT-SPECT, which determined eligibility for enrollment in longitudinal assessments and further biomarker evaluation including cerebrospinal fluid alpha-synuclein seed amplification assay (aSynSAA).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>As of January 29, 2024, 49,843 participants were sent an UPSIT and 31,293 (63%) completed it. Of UPSIT completers, 8,301 (27%) scored &lt;15th percentile. Of 1,546 who completed DAT-SPECT, 1,060 (69%) had DAT-SPECT binding &lt;100% expected for age and sex. Participants with an UPSIT &lt;10th percentile (n = 1,221) had greater likelihood of low DAT-SPECT binding compared to participants with an UPSIT in the 10th to 15th percentile (odds ratio, 3.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.85–4.91). Overall, 55% (198/363) of cases with UPSIT &lt;15th percentile and DAT-SPECT &lt;100% had positive aSynSAA, which increased to 70% (182/260) when selecting for more severe hyposmia (UPSIT &lt;10th percentile).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Remote screening for hyposmia and reduced DAT-SPECT binding identifies participants with a high proportion positive aSynSAA. Longitudinal data will be essential to define progression patterns in these individuals to ultimately inform recruitment into disease modification clinical trials.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Parkinson's disease (PD) resting tremor is thought to be initiated in the basal ganglia and amplified in the cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit. Because stress worsens tremor, the noradrenergic system may play a role in amplifying tremor. We tested if and how propranolol, a non-selective beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist, reduces PD tremor and whether or not this effect is specific to stressful conditions.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In a cross-over, double-blind intervention study, participants with PD resting tremor received propranolol (40 mg, single dose) or placebo (counter-balanced) on 2 different days. During both days, we assessed tremor severity (with accelerometry) and tremor-related brain activity (with functional magnetic resonance imaging), as well as heart rate and pupil diameter, while subjects performed a stressful cognitive load task that has been linked to the noradrenergic system. We tested for effects of drug (propranolol vs placebo) and stress (cognitive load vs rest) on tremor power and tremor-related brain activity.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 27 PD patients with prominent resting tremor. Tremor power significantly increased during cognitive load versus rest (<i>F</i>[1,19] = 13.8; <i>p</i> = 0.001; ηp2 = 0.42) and decreased by propranolol versus placebo (<i>F</i>[1,19] = 6.4; <i>p</i> = 0.02; ηp2 = 0.25), but there was no interaction. We observed task-related brain activity in a stress-sensitive cognitive control network and tremor power-related activity in the cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit. Propranolol significantly reduced tremor-related activity in the motor cortex compared to placebo (<i>F</i>[1,21] = 5.3; <i>p</i> = 0.03; ηp2 = 0.20), irrespective of cognitive load.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings indicate that propranolol has a general, context-independent, tremor-reducing effect that may be implemented at the level of the primary motor cortex. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:741–752</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27161?af=R">Early‐Life Adversity Predicts Markers of Aging‐Related Neuroinflammation, Neurodegeneration, and Cognitive Impairment in Women</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Despite the overwhelming evidence for profound and longstanding effects of early-life stress (ELS) on inflammation, brain structure, and molecular aging, its impact on human brain aging and risk for neurodegenerative disease is poorly understood. We examined the impact of ELS severity in interaction with age on blood-based markers of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, brain volumes, and cognitive function in middle-aged women.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We recruited 179 women (aged 30–60 years) with and without ELS exposure before the onset of puberty. Using Simoa technology, we assessed blood-based markers of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, including serum concentrations of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament light chain (NfL). We further obtained T1-weighted and T2-weighted magnetic resonance images to assess brain volumes and we assessed cognitive performance sensitive to early impairments associated with the development of dementia, using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Automated Test Battery. We used generalized additive models to examine nonlinear interaction effects of ELS severity and age on these outcomes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Analyses revealed significant nonlinear interaction effects of ELS severity and age on NfL and GFAP serum concentrations, total and subcortical gray matter volume loss, increased third ventricular volume, and cognitive impairment.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings suggest that ELS profoundly exacerbates peripheral, neurostructural, and cognitive markers of brain aging. Our results are critical for the development of novel early prevention strategies that target the impact of developmental stress on the brain to mitigate aging-related neurological diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27165?af=R">Increased White Matter Aerobic Glycolysis in Multiple Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Despite treatments which reduce relapses in multiple sclerosis (MS), many patients continue to experience progressive disability accumulation. MS is associated with metabolic disruptions and cerebral metabolic stress predisposes to tissue injury and possibly impaired remyelination. Additionally, myelin homeostasis is metabolically expensive and reliant on glycolysis. We investigated cerebral metabolic changes in MS and when in the disease course they occurred, and assessed their relationship with microstructural changes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This study used combined fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure cerebral metabolic rate of glucose and oxygen, thereby quantifying glycolysis. Twelve healthy controls, 20 patients with relapsing MS, and 13 patients with non-relapsing MS were studied. Relapsing patients with MS were treatment naïve and scanned pre- and post-initiation of high efficacy disease modifying therapy.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In normal appearing white matter, we observed increased glucose utilization and reduced oxygen utilization in newly diagnosed MS, consistent with increased glycolysis. Increased glycolysis was greater in patients with a longer disease duration course and higher disability. Among newly diagnosed patients, different treatments had differential impacts on glucose utilization. Last, whereas hypermetabolism within lesions was clearly associated with inflammation, no such relationship was found within normal appearing white matter.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Increased white matter glycolysis is a prominent feature of cerebral metabolism in MS. It begins early in the disease course, increases with disease duration and is independent of microstructural evidence of inflammation in normal appearing white matter. Optimization of the metabolic environment may be an important component of therapies designed to reduce progressive disability. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:766–778</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We prospectively evaluated how well combinations of signs and symptoms can identify individuals in the prodromal phase of Parkinson's disease (PD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The study comprised 6,108 men who underwent repeated assessments of key prodromal features and were prospectively followed for the development of PD. Two composite measures of prodromal PD were evaluated: (i) the co-occurrence of constipation, probable rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (pRBD), and hyposmia, and (ii) the probability of prodromal PD based on the Movement Disorders Society (MDS) research criteria. We also examined the progression and heterogeneity of the prodromal PD phase.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>One hundred three individuals were newly diagnosed with PD over an average follow-up of 3.4 years. Men with constipation, pRBD, and hyposmia had a 23-fold higher risk of receiving a PD diagnosis in the subsequent 3 years, compared with men without these features (risk ratio [RR] = 23.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 10.62–51.33). The risk of PD was 21-fold higher in men with a probability of prodromal PD ≥ 0.8 compared with those with a probability &lt; 0.2 (RR = 21.96, 95% CI = 11.17–43.17). Both the co-occurrence of the 3 non-motor features and an MDS-based probability ≥ 0.8 had comparable predictive values, and both were stronger predictors of PD than any of the features individually. We identified 2 prodromal PD subtypes where RBD and visual color impairment were key discriminators.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our study demonstrates that combinations of key signs and symptoms strongly predict future clinically manifest PD. These measures may be integrated into screening strategies to identify individuals who could be targeted for enrollment into PD prevention trials. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:720–729</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27167?af=R">Loss of TDP‐43 Splicing Repression Occurs in Myonuclei of Inclusion Body Myositis Patients</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Inclusion body myositis (IBM) is an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy with muscle pathology characterized by endomysial inflammation, rimmed vacuoles, and cytoplasmic mislocalization of transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43). We aimed to determine whether loss of TDP-43 splicing repression led to the production of “cryptic peptides” that could be detected in muscle biopsies as a useful biomarker for IBM.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used an antisera against a neoepitope encoded by a TDP-43-dependent cryptic exon within hepatoma-derived growth factor-like protein 2 (<i>HDGFL2</i>) for immunohistochemical analysis on muscle biopsy samples of 122 patients with IBM, 181 disease controls, and 16 healthy controls without abnormal muscle pathology. In situ hybridization was also utilized to detect the localization of cryptic <i>HDGFL2</i> transcripts.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found cryptic <i>HDGFL2</i> peptides localized within myonuclei from muscle biopsies in 79 of 122 patients with IBM (65%), and this staining correlated with TDP-43 depletion. In contrast, cryptic <i>HDGFL2</i> immunoreactivity was absent in 197 muscle biopsies from a variety of disease controls, except for 2 patients with vacuolar myopathies. Notably, we show that cryptic <i>HDGFL2</i> transcripts are accompanied by the detection of cryptic <i>HDGFL2</i> in muscle fibers of IBM without rimmed vacuoles and TDP-43 aggregates.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Together, our findings establish that loss of TDP-43 splicing repression occurs in myonuclei of IBM skeletal muscle and suggest that detection of cryptic peptides in muscle biopsies may be a useful biomarker. We suggest that a therapeutic strategy designed to restore TDP-43 function should be considered to attenuate the degeneration of skeletal muscle in this devastating disease.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27155?af=R">The Utility of Long‐Read Sequencing in Diagnosing Early Onset Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Variants in <i>PRKN</i> and <i>PINK1</i> are the leading cause of early-onset autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease, yet many cases remain genetically unresolved. We previously identified a 7 megabases complex structural variant in a pair of monozygotic twins using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read sequencing. This study aims to determine if ONT long-read sequencing can detect a second variant in other unresolved early-onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD) cases with 1 heterozygous <i>PRKN</i> or <i>PINK1</i> variant.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>ONT long-read sequencing was performed on EOPD patients with 1 reported <i>PRKN</i>/<i>PINK1</i> pathogenic variant, with onset age under 50. Positive controls included EOPD patients with 2 known <i>PRKN</i> pathogenic variants. Initial testing involved short-read targeted panel sequencing for single nucleotide variants and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification for copy number variants.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 47 patients were studied (<i>PRKN</i> “one-variant,” n = 23; <i>PINK1</i> “one-variant,” n = 12; <i>PRKN</i> “two-variants,” n = 12). ONT long-read sequencing identified a second pathogenic variant in 26% of <i>PRKN</i> “one-variant” patients (6/23), but none in <i>PINK1</i> “one-variant” patients (0/12). Detected variants included 1 complex inversion, 2 structural variant overlaps, and 3 duplications. In the <i>PRKN</i> “two-variants” group, both variants were identified in all patients (100%, 12/12).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>ONT long-read sequencing effectively identifies pathogenic structural variants in the <i>PRKN</i> locus missed by conventional methods. It should be considered for unresolved EOPD cases when a second variant is not detected through conventional approaches. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:753–765</p>

                Tavano et al. discovered a novel mechanism controlling lateral mesendoderm (LME) migration during zebrafish gastrulation. LME uses the lateral ectoderm as a permissive substrate for its migration. At the animal pole, LME migration is halted due to bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling modulating ectoderm tissue properties, rendering it non-permissive for LME migration.

	<p>Background: When engaging with the environment, multisensory cues interact and are integrated to create a coherent representation of the world around us, a process that has been suggested to be affected by the lack of visual feedback in blind individuals. In addition, the presence of voluntary movement can be responsible for suppressing somatosensory information processed by the cortex, which might lead to a worse encoding of tactile information. Objectives: In this work, we aim to explore how cross-modal interaction can be affected by active movements and the role of vision in this process. Methods: To this end, we measured the precision of 18 blind individuals and 18 age-matched sighted controls in a velocity discrimination task. The participants were instructed to detect the faster stimulus between a sequence of two in both passive and active touch conditions. The sensory stimulation could be either just tactile or audio&amp;amp;ndash;tactile, where a non-informative sound co-occurred with the tactile stimulation. The measure of precision was obtained by computing the just noticeable difference (JND) of each participant. Results: The results show worse precision with the audio&amp;amp;ndash;tactile sensory stimulation in the active condition for the sighted group (p = 0.046) but not for the blind one (p = 0.513). For blind participants, only the movement itself had an effect. Conclusions: For sighted individuals, the presence of noise from active touch made them vulnerable to auditory interference. However, the blind group exhibited less sensory interaction, experiencing only the detrimental effect of movement. Our work should be considered when developing next-generation haptic devices.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Suicidal behaviors (SBs) and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) are significant mental health concerns in children and adolescents. The hypothalamic&amp;amp;ndash;pituitary&amp;amp;ndash;adrenal (HPA) axis, of which cortisol is a key hormone, has been implicated in these behaviors. This narrative review aims to explore whether cortisol levels play a role in SBs and NSSI in youth and to synthesize current evidence on this topic. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted on studies published through November 2024, using PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases. Studies were screened for eligibility, including only human studies published in English, with no animal models or studies excluding cortisol levels. A narrative synthesis approach was used due to the methodological diversity across studies. Due to limited adolescent-focused research, studies involving adults were also considered. Results: Findings indicate inconsistent cortisol patterns in relation to SBs and NSSI. Elevated cortisol levels are linked to SBs, with some studies suggesting they may predict future suicide attempts, though no definitive cause-and-effect relationship is established. Conversely, cortisol levels in relation to NSSI show mixed results, with some studies reporting no differences. Cortisol responses to stress, measured by saliva, blood, and hair, reveal complex interactions with psychological factors such as depression and impulsivity, influencing cortisol secretion. Discussion: Despite some evidence pointing to a role of cortisol dysregulation in SBs and NSSI, the relationship remains unclear due to study heterogeneity, including small sample sizes and methodological variations. Gender and the type of stressor used in studies also complicate the findings. Future research should prioritize longitudinal studies, better control for confounding factors, and utilize more diverse cortisol assessment methods to clarify these links. Conclusions: While cortisol may play a role in the pathophysiology of SBs and NSSI, further research is needed to establish clearer, more reliable patterns. Identifying alterations in cortisol levels may aid in early detection and targeted interventions for at-risk adolescents.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/12/3/ENEURO.0376-24.2024?rss=1">Hawkmoth Pheromone Transduction Involves G-Protein-Dependent Phospholipase C{beta} Signaling</a></h4>

              
                <p>Evolutionary pressures adapted insect chemosensation to their respective physiological needs and tasks in their ecological niches. Solitary nocturnal moths rely on their acute olfactory sense to find mates at night. Pheromones are detected with maximized sensitivity and high temporal resolution through mechanisms that are mostly unknown. While the inverse topology of insect olfactory receptors and heteromerization with the olfactory receptor coreceptor suggest ionotropic transduction via odorant-gated receptor&ndash;ion channel complexes, contradictory data propose amplifying G-protein&ndash;coupled transduction. Here, we used in vivo tip-recordings of pheromone-sensitive sensilla of male <I>Manduca sexta</I> hawkmoths at specific times of day (rest vs activity). Since the olfactory receptor neurons distinguish signal parameters in three consecutive temporal windows of their pheromone response (phasic; tonic; late, long-lasting), respective response parameters were analyzed separately. Disruption of G-protein&ndash;coupled transduction and block of phospholipase C decreased and slowed the phasic response component during the activity phase of hawkmoths without affecting any other component of the response during activity and rest. A more targeted disruption of G<SUB>&alpha;</SUB> subunits by blocking G<SUB>&alpha;o</SUB> or sustained activation of G<SUB>&alpha;s</SUB> using bacterial toxins affected the phasic pheromone response, while toxins targeting G<SUB>&alpha;q</SUB> and G<SUB>&alpha;12/13</SUB> were ineffective. Consistent with these data, the expression of phospholipase C&beta;4 depended on zeitgeber time, which indicates circadian clock-modulated metabotropic pheromone transduction cascades that maximize sensitivity and temporal resolution of pheromone transduction during the hawkmoth's activity phase. Thus, discrepancies in the literature on insect olfaction may be resolved by considering circadian timing and the distinct odor response components.</p>

                <p>Humans and nonhumans alike often make choices to gain information, even when the information cannot be used to change the outcome. Prior research has shown that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is important for evaluating options involving reward-predictive information. Here we studied the role of ACC in information choices using optical inhibition to evaluate the contribution of this region during specific epochs of decision-making. Rats could choose between an uninformative option followed by a cue that predicted reward 50% of the time versus a fully informative option that signaled outcomes with certainty but was rewarded only 20% of the time. Reward seeking during the informative S+ cue decreased following ACC inhibition, indicating a causal contribution of this region in supporting reward expectation to a cue signaling reward with certainty. Separately in a positive control experiment and in support of a known role for this region in sustaining high-effort behavior for preferred rewards, we observed reduced lever presses and lower breakpoints in effort choices following ACC inhibition. The lack of changes in reward latencies in both types of decisions indicate the motivational value of rewards remained intact, revealing instead a common role for ACC in maintaining persistence toward certain and valuable rewards.</p>

                <p>Vestibular research is essential for understanding and treating disorders such as vertigo and Meniere's disease. The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) is a key method for assessing vestibular function and an essential tool for diagnosing vertigo. Traditionally, the VOR comprises angular VOR (aVOR) and translational VOR (tVOR), which originate from the vestibular semicircular canals (SCCs) and otolith organs, respectively. VOR consists of both fast-phase and slow-phase eye movements, which functionally interact to contribute to gaze control. However, to calculate the gain and phase parameters of the VOR, it is common practice to exclude fast-phase information superimposed on slow-phase eye movements. As a result, the information contained in the fast phase has not been fully utilized. OVAR is primarily used to evaluate otolith function, as there is no SCC input during its steady state. It is widely accepted that fast-phase nystagmus (FPN) during OVAR is generated by periodic otolith inputs via the central vestibular velocity storage mechanism. Surprisingly, we discovered in this study that SCC input can modify the generation of FPN in mouse OVAR test, as demonstrated by testing <I>Zpld1</I> (Zona pellucida-like domain containing 1 protein) mutant mice with SCC deficits. This finding was further confirmed using both unilateral and bilateral semicircular canals dehiscence surgical models. In addition to revealing the dependence of FPN on SCC input, we demonstrated that FPN can be used to evaluate vestibular function, particularly in conditions that are difficult to assess using slow-phase eye movements, such as unilateral vestibular lesions and central modulation via baclofen treatment.</p>

                Background Interest in alternative sources of tubers and legumes has increased due to the search for raw materials with bioactive antioxidant compounds. The objective of this study was to characterize taro (TF) and sacha inchi (Plukenetia volubilis) flours obtained by the wet (SIF-WM) and defatted (SIF-DM) methods, as alternatives for the formulation of functional foods. Methods Proximal tests were conducted to determine basic chemical composition, quantification of free polyphenols, antioxidant activity using the ABTS* radical method (2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)) with Trolox as a standard, and rheological analyses, including pasting curves, flow profiles, and viscoelastic properties. Microbiological characterization of the flours was also performed. Results The highest protein content was found in sacha inchi flour obtained by the defatted method (72.62%), while carbohydrates were the main component in taro flour (85.4%). In terms of antioxidant activity, taro flour showed higher values of 2.71 µmol ET/g and 7.47 mg EAG/g. Rheological analysis showed that adding taro flour increased the viscosity peak and reduced breakdown, improving gel stability. Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella spp. were detected in taro flour. Conclusions Taro and sacha inchi flours have great potential for the development of functional products like protein snacks, with good expansion due to taro starch and are naturally gluten-free, making them suitable for people with celiac disease.

                Appendicularians are planktonic tunicates abundant all over the world. Currently, only two complete annotated mitochondrial genome assemblies are available for appendicularians, both for cryptic species of Oikopleura dioica. This underrepresentation of available appendicularian mitochondrial genomes limits environmental DNA sequencing (eDNA) studies that rely on mitochondrial markers as a taxonomic barcode. We report the complete mitochondrial genome assembly and annotation of an unknown appendicularian species isolated from the Amami Oshima island, Kagoshima prefecture, Japan, that has significant sequence difference with other currently available assemblies and will serve as a useful resource for ecological studies and further mitochondrial studies of appendicularians.

                Background Higher education at the university level is essential for advanced learning, enhancing academic knowledge, and precipitating significant life changes. These include lifestyle adjustments, relocation from one’s primary residence, and the acquisition of autonomy in decision-making. Numerous students opt to reside in dormitories, resulting in notable alterations in dietary habits. Campus cuisine differs substantially from their previous domestic diets, potentially influencing their overall growth and development during their academic tenure. Method The study uses the theory of planned behavior to conceptualize and understand university students’ food choices, employing qualitative research and a phenomenological approach. Snowball sampling selected 26 undergraduate and postgraduate students in technical and health science programs from a private university in Udupi who were residing on campus for two to four years. Online interviews were audio-recorded with participants’ consent. Results Transcribed interviews were coded and categorized to identify themes, which were subsequently conceptualized to develop a model based on the theory of planned behavior. The duration of students’ campus residence provided insight into their perspectives on food events and consumption at the university dining facility (UDF), influenced by factors such as palatal preferences, cost considerations, temporal constraints (during academic activities), accessibility of nutritious options, academic-related stress, and insufficient nutritional knowledge. Two primary findings emerged: first, there was an absence of nutritional information displayed in the dining facility; second, students exhibited a preference for consuming less healthy food options off-campus due to their lower monetary cost. Conclusion The investigation provides insights into the role of UDF in offering nutritionally balanced meals to students, potentially contributing to improved health outcomes and enhanced academic performance. This research elucidates the relationship between students’ dietary choices and their subsequent impact on scholastic achievement.

                Background First line (1L) TP-Ex-like regimen followed by 2nd-line (2L) immunotherapy represents one of the standards of care in platinum-sensitive recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (R/M SCCHN). We report our experience from 2 tertiary care institutions of India. Methods This is a retrospective analysis of consecutive patients of platinum-sensitive R/M SCCHN treated with 1L weekly paclitaxel, carboplatin, and cetuximab (PCC) regimen followed by cetuximab maintenance (if non-progressive) or 2L nivolumab or oral metronomic chemotherapy (OMCT) on progression. Overall response rates (ORR), progression-free survival after 1L and 2L (PFS-1 & PFS-2), overall survival (OS), and safety were evaluated. Results The study included 54 patients; median age 56.5 years; 89% men; 11% had cardiac dysfunction; 13% had renal dysfunction. After 1L PCC, ORR was 59.3%; median PFS-1 was 7.031 months; 61% had progression; 35% were treated with nivolumab and 18% with OMCT. The ORR was 26.3% (nivolumab) and 10% (OMCT). Median PFS-2 was 6.5 months (nivolumab) and 2 months (OMCT). The median OS was 15.01 months (entire cohort), 20.6 months (nivolumab), and 7 months (OMCT). Grade III/IV adverse events on PCC included neutropenia (31.4%), anaemia (35.1%), thrombocytopenia (7.4%), febrile neutropenia (11.1%), and skin reaction (16.6%); no Grade-III/IV treatment-related toxicities on 2L. Conclusions  1L weekly PCC is an effective regimen for palliative therapy of platinum- sensitive R/MSCCHN with an acceptable toxicity profile. The addition of 2L nivolumab on progression further improves the outcomes.

                Rab1 is a highly conserved small GTPase that exists in humans as two isoforms: Rab1A and Rab1B, sharing 92% sequence identity. These proteins regulate vesicle trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi and within the Golgi stacks. Rab1A and Rab1B may be oncogenes, as they are frequently dysregulated in various human cancers. Moreover, they contribute to the progression of Parkinson’s disease. The availability of high-quality antibodies specific for Rab1A or Rab1B is essential to understand the distinct functions of these Rab1 proteins in both health and diseaseand to enhance the reproducibility of research involving these proteins. In this study, we characterized seven antibodies targeting Rab1A and five antibodies targeting Rab1B for Western Blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a much larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address the antibody reproducibility issue by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a valuable resource for the scientific community. While uses of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

Mesh erosion and migration are considered the most serious complications of mesh repairs. Case presentation It has not yet been well described in the literature. We describe a case of mesh erosion of stomach, many years later after a prosthetic repair of a diaphragmatic rupture associated to hiatal hernia, is presented here because of its rarity. Conclusion Few explanations have been put forward to explain this incident. Could it be due to inflammatory processes, or to the composition of the Meshes? As yet, there is no definitive explanation.

                Background Dental identification methods are employed to determine a person’s identity in forensic odontology. Additionally, analyzing a person’s teeth can provide insights into their socioeconomic status, which may assist in the process of identification. Our study aimed to assess the correlation between dental health status and SES among individuals, with a focus on identifying predictors of SES based on dental health indicators Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate the correlation between dental health status and socioeconomic status among 135 individuals. who had visited the Department of Oral Medicine for various forms of dental care. SES was measured according to a modified Kuppuswamy scale. The associations between SES and dental health indicators were analyzed using chi-square tests for categorical variables and t-tests for continuous variables. Results Dental caries is more common in lower SES groups, attributed to factors like poor nutrition and hygiene. Partial and complete edentulism are also more prevalent in lower SES populations, often due to financial constraints and lack of awareness, leading to extractions rather than restorations. However, urban populations, regardless of SES, show greater utilization of dental restorations, likely due to the concentration of dentists in cities and access to community-based dental camps offering low-cost treatments. Periodontal diseases further reflect SES disparities. Studies show that individuals from lower SES backgrounds report more severe periodontal issues, such as gingival swelling, while higher SES groups report milder symptoms like gingival bleeding, indicating earlier intervention. Conclusion SES plays a vital role in shaping health and lifestyle outcomes. The findings in our study demonstrate the value of incorporating SES indicators, such as education, occupation, marital status, and residence, into forensic investigations to enhance the precision of identification processes.

Understanding the large-scale information processing that underlies complex human cognition is the central goal of cognitive neuroscience. While emerging activity flow models demonstrate that cognitive task information is transferred by interregional functional or structural connectivity, graph-theory-based models typically assume that neural communication occurs via the shortest path of brain networks. However, whether the shortest path is the optimal route for empirical cognitive information transmission remains unclear. Based on a large-scale activity flow mapping framework, we found that the performance of activity flow prediction with the shortest path was significantly lower than that with the direct path. The shortest path routing was superior to other network communication strategies, including search information, path ensembles, and navigation. Intriguingly, the shortest path outperformed the direct path in activity flow prediction when the physical distance constraint and asymmetric routing contribution were simultaneously considered. This study not only challenges the shortest path assumption through empirical network models but also suggests that cognitive task information routing is constrained by the spatial and functional embedding of the brain network.

Gene expression studies often use bulk RNA sequencing of mixed cell populations because single cell or sorted cell sequencing may be prohibitively expensive. However, mixed cell studies may miss expression patterns that are restricted to specific cell populations. Computational deconvolution can be used to estimate cell fractions from bulk expression data and infer average cell-type expression in a set of samples (e.g., cases or controls), but imputing sample-level cell-type expression is required for more detailed analyses, such as relating expression to quantitative traits, and is less commonly addressed. Here, we assessed the accuracy of imputing sample-level cell-type expression using a real dataset where mixed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and sorted (CD4, CD8, CD14, CD19) RNA sequencing data were generated from the same subjects (N=158), and pseudobulk datasets synthesised from eQTLgen single cell RNA-seq data. We compared three domain-specific methods, CIBERSORTx, bMIND and debCAM/swCAM, and two cross-domain machine learning methods, multiple response LASSO and ridge, that had not been used for this task before. We also assessed the methods according to their ability to recover differential gene expression (DGE) results. LASSO/ridge showed higher sensitivity but lower specificity for recovering DGE signals seen in observed data compared to deconvolution methods, although LASSO/ridge had higher area under curves than deconvolution methods. Machine learning methods have the potential to outperform domain-specific methods when suitable training data are available.

Aberrant alternative splicing, prevalent in cancer, impacts various cancer hallmarks involving proliferation, angiogenesis, and invasion. Splicing disruption often results from somatic point mutations rewiring functional pathways to support cancer cell survival. We introduce iSoMAs (iSoform expression and somatic Mutation Association), an efficient computational pipeline leveraging principal component analysis technique, to explore how somatic mutations influence transcriptome-wide gene expression at the isoform level. Applying iSoMAs to 33 cancer types comprising 9,738 tumor samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas, we identified 908 somatically mutated genes significantly associated with altered isoform expression across three or more cancer types. Mutations linked to differential isoform expression occurred through both <i>cis</i>- and <i>trans</i>-acting mechanisms, involving well-known oncogenes/suppressor genes, RNA binding protein and splicing factor genes. With wet-lab experiments, we verified direct association between <i>TP53</i> mutations and differential isoform expression in cell cycle genes. Additional iSoMAs genes have been validated in the literature with independent cohorts and/or methods. Despite the complexity of cancer, iSoMAs attains computational efficiency via dimension reduction strategy and reveals critical associations between regulatory factors and transcriptional landscapes.

                <p>by Giuseppe de Alteriis, Oliver Sherwood, Alessandro Ciaramella, Robert Leech, Joana Cabral, Federico E Turkheimer, Paul Expert</p>

A crucial challenge in neuroscience involves characterising brain dynamics from high-dimensional brain recordings. Dynamic Functional Connectivity (dFC) is an analysis paradigm that aims to address this challenge. dFC consists of a time-varying matrix (dFC matrix) expressing how pairwise interactions across brain areas change over time. However, the main dFC approaches have been developed and applied mostly empirically, lacking a common theoretical framework and a clear view on the interpretation of the results derived from the dFC matrices. Moreover, the dFC community has not been using the most efficient algorithms to compute and process the matrices efficiently, which has prevented dFC from showing its full potential with high-dimensional datasets and/or real-time applications. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamic Symmetric Connectivity Matrix analysis framework (DySCo), with its associated repository. DySCo is a framework that presents the most commonly used dFC measures in a common language and implements them in a computationally efficient way. This allows the study of brain activity at different spatio-temporal scales, down to the voxel level. DySCo provides a single framework that allows to: (1) Use dFC as a tool to capture the spatio-temporal interaction patterns of data in a form that is easily translatable across different imaging modalities. (2) Provide a comprehensive set of measures to quantify the properties and evolution of dFC over time: the amount of connectivity, the similarity between matrices, and their informational complexity. By using and combining the DySCo measures it is possible to perform a full dFC analysis. (3) Leverage the Temporal Covariance EVD algorithm (TCEVD) to compute and store the eigenvectors and values of the dFC matrices, and then also compute the DySCo measures from the EVD. Developing the framework in the eigenvector space is orders of magnitude faster and more memory efficient than naïve algorithms in the matrix space, without loss of information. The methodology developed here is validated on both a synthetic dataset and a rest/N-back task experimental paradigm from the fMRI Human Connectome Project dataset. We show that all the proposed measures are sensitive to changes in brain configurations and consistent across time and subjects. To illustrate the computational efficiency of the DySCo toolbox, we performed the analysis at the voxel level, a task which is computationally demanding but easily afforded by the TCEVD.

                <p>by Joseph A Heng, Michael Woodford, Rafael Polania</p>

The ability to rapidly estimate non-symbolic numerical quantities is a well-conserved sense across species with clear evolutionary advantages. However, despite its importance, this sense is surprisingly imprecise and biased, and a formal explanation for this seemingly irrational behavior remains unclear. We develop a unified normative theory of numerosity estimation that parsimoniously incorporates in a single framework information processing constraints alongside (i) Brownian diffusion noise to capture the effects of time exposure of sensory information, (ii) logarithmic encoding of numerosity representations, and (iii) optimal inference via Bayesian decoding. We show that for a given allowable biological capacity constraint our model naturally endogenizes time perception during noisy efficient encoding to predict the complete posterior distribution of numerosity estimates. This model accurately predicts many features of human numerosity estimation as a function of temporal exposure, indicating that humans can rapidly and efficiently sample numerosity information over time. Additionally, we demonstrate how our model fundamentally differs from a thermodynamically-inspired formalization of bounded rationality, where information processing is modeled as acting to shift away from default states. The mechanism we propose is the likely origin of a variety of numerical cognition patterns observed in humans and other animals.

                <p>by Joseph Masison, Pedro Mendes</p>

Intestinal mucosal block is the transient reduction in iron absorption ability of intestinal epithelial cells (enterocytes) in response to previous iron exposures that occur at the cell scale. The block characteristics have been shown to depend both on iron exposure magnitude and temporality, and understanding block control will enable deeper understanding of how intestinal iron absorption contributes to pathological iron states. Three biochemical mechanisms implicated in driving the block behavior are divalent metal transporter 1 endocytosis, ferritin iron sequestration, and iron regulatory protein regulation of iron related protein expression. In this work, a model of enterocyte iron metabolism is built based on published experimental data that is capable of reproducing the mucosal block phenomena. The model is then used to estimate the quantitative contribution of each of the three mechanisms on the properties of the mucosal block. Analysis reveals that ferritin and iron regulatory proteins are the main intracellular mechanisms contributing to the mucosal block, findings congruent with experimental predictions. Lastly, DMT1 endocytosis is shown to play a role in limiting total iron uptake by enterocytes but does not contribute to the decrease in total iron transfer across their basal membrane seen in the mucosal block.

                <p>by Panpan Li, Manfeng Zhang, Yihua Huang</p>

The prokaryote-specific ATP-binding cassette (ABC) peptide transporters are involved in various physiological processes and plays an important role in transporting naturally occurring antibiotics across the membrane to their intracellular targets. The dipeptide transporter DppABCDF in Gram-negative bacteria is composed of five distinct subunits, yet its assembly and underlying peptide import mechanism remain elusive. Here, we report the cryo-EM structures of the DppBCDF translocator from <i>Escherichia coli</i> in both its apo form and in complexes bound to nonhydrolyzable or slowly hydrolyzable ATP analogs (AMPPNP and ATPγS), as well as the ATPγS-bound DppABCDF full transporter. Unlike the reported heterotrimeric <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> DppBCD translocator, the <i>E. coli</i> DppBCDF translocator is a heterotetramer, with a [4Fe-4S] cluster at the C-terminus of each ATPase subunit. Structural studies reveal that ATPγS/AMPPNP-bound DppBCDF adopts an inward-facing conformation, similar to that of apo-DppBCDF, with only one ATPγS or AMPPNP molecule bound to DppF. By contrast, ATPγS-bound DppABCDF adopts an outward-facing conformation, with two ATPγS molecules glueing DppD and DppF at the interface. Consistent with structural observations, ATPase activity assays show that the DppBCDF translocator itself is inactive and its activation requires concurrent binding of DppA and ATP. In addition, bacterial complementation experiments imply that a unique periplasmic scoop motif in DppB may play important roles in ensuring dipeptide substrates import across the membrane, presumably by preventing dipeptide back-and-forth binding to DppA and avoiding dipeptides escaping into the periplasm upon being released from DppA.

                Background Handwritten digit recognition is a fundamental task in computer vision, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used for this purpose due to their ability to automatically extract relevant features. However, the role of hyperparameter tuning in enhancing CNN performance for this task remains underexplored. Methods This study evaluates the impact of hyperparameter tuning on CNN performance using the MNIST dataset, a standard benchmark for digit recognition. The framework involves varying hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, number of convolutional layers, and optimization techniques. The Adam optimizer was employed to optimize the network, and experiments were conducted to assess the effect of adding extra convolutional layers on recognition accuracy. Results Our experiments achieved a 99.89% recognition rate on the MNIST dataset, surpassing prior benchmarks. This high accuracy was attained through systematic hyperparameter analysis and optimization. The addition of convolutional layers significantly contributed to improving the model’s performance by enabling deeper feature extraction and enhanced pattern recognition. Conclusions This study highlights the critical role of hyperparameter tuning in CNN-based handwritten digit recognition. By providing insights into the impact of hyperparameters and architectural adjustments, it demonstrates how careful optimization can simplify processes and enhance accuracy in computer vision tasks. These findings pave the way for more effective and streamlined approaches to pattern recognition using deep learning techniques.

                Crowley et al. investigated the evolutionary origins of the pluripotency gene Nanog. Their research suggests that a single Vent gene capable of programming both pluripotency and germline competency was present in the last common ancestor of deuterostomes. In vertebrates, these activities sub-functionalized into the Vent and Nanog gene families, respectively.

                Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a commonly used biomarker in neurodegenerative disease. Kahn et al. describe the mechanism of release from degenerating neurons. They also demonstrate that loss of NfL reduces inflammation in a mouse ALS model and that NfL exposure causes cytokine release and transcriptional changes in immune cells.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(25)00164-0?rss=yes">BATF2 is a regulator of interferon-γ signaling in astrocytes during neuroinflammation</a></h4>

              
                Tinkey et al. demonstrate that the upregulation of BATF2 downstream of IFNγ regulates the inflammatory potential of astrocytes during neuroinflammation. In vivo evidence suggests that BATF2 limits CNS autoimmunity and the expression of IFNγ-driven inflammatory mediators. These data suggest that BATF2 contributes to protective mechanisms in astrocytes during chronic neuroinflammation.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(25)00165-2?rss=yes">Modular mechanisms of immune priming and growth inhibition mediated by plant effector-triggered immunity</a></h4>

              
                Chhillar et al. explore effector-triggered immunity (ETI) in plants, highlighting the distinct roles of EDS1 signaling modules. PAD4-ADR1 regulates immune priming and growth inhibition, while SAG101-NRG1 mediates cell death. Their findings offer strategies to enhance crop resistance while minimizing yield loss, advancing sustainable agriculture.

                Spargo et al. analyzed whole-genome sequence data from ∼900,000 individuals and found that protein-truncating variants in ITSN1 confer a ∼10-fold increased risk of Parkinson’s disease. Functional studies suggest that ITSN1 physically interacts with α-synuclein and its loss exacerbates α-synuclein toxicity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90347">ThermoMaze behavioral paradigm for assessing immobility-related brain events in rodents</a></h4>

              
                Brain states fluctuate between exploratory and consummatory phases of behavior. These state changes affect both internal computation and the organism’s responses to sensory inputs. Understanding neuronal mechanisms supporting exploratory and consummatory states and their switching requires experimental control of behavioral shifts and collecting sufficient amounts of brain data. To achieve this goal, we developed the ThermoMaze, which exploits the animal’s natural warmth-seeking homeostatic behavior. By decreasing the floor temperature and selectively heating unmarked areas, we observed that mice avoided the aversive state by exploring the maze and finding the warm spot. In its design, the ThermoMaze is analogous to the widely used water maze but without the inconvenience of a wet environment and, therefore, allows the collection of physiological data in many trials. We combined the ThermoMaze with electrophysiology recording, and report that spiking activity of hippocampal CA1 neurons during sharp-wave ripple events encode the position of mice. Thus, place-specific firing is not confined to locomotion and associated theta oscillations but persist during waking immobility and sleep at the same location. The ThermoMaze will allow for detailed studies of brain correlates of immobility, preparatory–consummatory transitions, and open new options for studying behavior-mediated temperature homeostasis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96890">Adult neurogenesis through glial transdifferentiation in a CNS injury paradigm</a></h4>

              
                As the global population ages, the prevalence of neurodegenerative disorders is fast increasing. This neurodegeneration as well as other central nervous system (CNS) injuries cause permanent disabilities. Thus, generation of new neurons is the rosetta stone in contemporary neuroscience. Glial cells support CNS homeostasis through evolutionary conserved mechanisms. Upon damage, glial cells activate an immune and inflammatory response to clear the injury site from debris and proliferate to restore cell number. This glial regenerative response (GRR) is mediated by the neuropil-associated glia (NG) in <i>Drosophila</i>, equivalent to vertebrate astrocytes, oligodendrocytes (OL), and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). Here, we examine the contribution of NG lineages and the GRR in response to injury. The results indicate that NG exchanges identities between ensheathing glia (EG) and astrocyte-like glia (ALG). Additionally, we found that NG cells undergo transdifferentiation to yield neurons. Moreover, this transdifferentiation increases in injury conditions. Thus, these data demonstrate that glial cells are able to generate new neurons through direct transdifferentiation. The present work makes a fundamental contribution to the CNS regeneration field and describes a new physiological mechanism to generate new neurons.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99545">Efficient coding in biophysically realistic excitatory-inhibitory spiking networks</a></h4>

              
                The principle of efficient coding posits that sensory cortical networks are designed to encode maximal sensory information with minimal metabolic cost. Despite the major influence of efficient coding in neuroscience, it has remained unclear whether fundamental empirical properties of neural network activity can be explained solely based on this normative principle. Here, we derive the structural, coding, and biophysical properties of excitatory-inhibitory recurrent networks of spiking neurons that emerge directly from imposing that the network minimizes an instantaneous loss function and a time-averaged performance measure enacting efficient coding. We assumed that the network encodes a number of independent stimulus features varying with a time scale equal to the membrane time constant of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The optimal network has biologically plausible biophysical features, including realistic integrate-and-fire spiking dynamics, spike-triggered adaptation, and a non-specific excitatory external input. The excitatory-inhibitory recurrent connectivity between neurons with similar stimulus tuning implements feature-specific competition, similar to that recently found in visual cortex. Networks with unstructured connectivity cannot reach comparable levels of coding efficiency. The optimal ratio of excitatory vs inhibitory neurons and the ratio of mean inhibitory-to-inhibitory vs excitatory-to-inhibitory connectivity are comparable to those of cortical sensory networks. The efficient network solution exhibits an instantaneous balance between excitation and inhibition. The network can perform efficient coding even when external stimuli vary over multiple time scales. Together, these results suggest that key properties of biological neural networks may be accounted for by efficient coding.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102205">Plectin-mediated cytoskeletal crosstalk as a target for inhibition of hepatocellular carcinoma growth and metastasis</a></h4>

              
                The most common primary malignancy of the liver, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is a heterogeneous tumor entity with high metastatic potential and complex pathophysiology. Increasing evidence suggests that tissue mechanics plays a critical role in tumor onset and progression. Here, we show that plectin, a major cytoskeletal crosslinker protein, plays a crucial role in mechanical homeostasis and mechanosensitive oncogenic signaling that drives hepatocarcinogenesis. Our expression analyses revealed elevated plectin levels in liver tumors, which correlated with poor prognosis for HCC patients. Using autochthonous and orthotopic mouse models we demonstrated that genetic and pharmacological inactivation of plectin potently suppressed the initiation and growth of HCC. Moreover, plectin targeting potently inhibited the invasion potential of human HCC cells and reduced their metastatic outgrowth in the lung. Proteomic and phosphoproteomic profiling linked plectin-dependent disruption of cytoskeletal networks to attenuation of oncogenic FAK, MAPK/Erk, and PI3K/Akt signatures. Importantly, by combining cell line-based and murine HCC models, we show that plectin inhibitor plecstatin-1 (PST) is well-tolerated and potently inhibits HCC progression. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that plectin-controlled cytoarchitecture is a key determinant of HCC development and suggests that pharmacologically induced disruption of mechanical homeostasis may represent a new therapeutic strategy for HCC treatment.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100424">UNC-6/Netrin promotes both adhesion and directed growth within a single axon</a></h4>

              
                During development axons undergo long-distance migrations as instructed by guidance molecules and their receptors, such as UNC-6/Netrin and UNC-40/DCC. Guidance cues act through long-range diffusive gradients (chemotaxis) or local adhesion (haptotaxis). However, how these discrete modes of action guide axons in vivo is poorly understood. Using time-lapse imaging of axon guidance in <i>C. elegans</i>, we demonstrate that UNC-6 and UNC-40 are required for local adhesion to an intermediate target and subsequent directional growth. Exogenous membrane-tethered UNC-6 is sufficient to mediate adhesion but not directional growth, demonstrating the separability of haptotaxis and chemotaxis. This conclusion is further supported by the endogenous UNC-6 distribution along the axon’s route. The intermediate and final targets are enriched in UNC-6 and separated by a ventrodorsal UNC-6 gradient. Continuous growth through the gradient requires UNC-40, which recruits UNC-6 to the growth cone tip. Overall, these data suggest that UNC-6 stimulates stepwise haptotaxis and chemotaxis in vivo.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104460">Multi-dimensional social relationships shape social attention in monkeys</a></h4>

              
                Social relationships guide individual behavior and ultimately shape the fabric of society. Primates exhibit particularly complex, differentiated, and multidimensional social relationships, which form interwoven social networks, reflecting both individual social tendencies and specific dyadic interactions. How the patterns of behavior that underlie these social relationships emerge from moment-to-moment patterns of social information processing remains unclear. Here, we assess social relationships among a group of four monkeys, focusing on aggression, grooming, and proximity. We show that individual differences in social attention vary with individual differences in patterns of general social tendencies and patterns of individual engagement with specific partners. Oxytocin administration altered social attention and its relationship to both social tendencies and dyadic relationships, particularly grooming and aggression. Our findings link the dynamics of visual information sampling to the dynamics of primate social networks.

                Conjugated linoleic acids (CLAs) can serve as a nutritional intervention to regulate quality, function, and fat infiltration in skeletal muscles, but the specific cytological mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we applied single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) to characterize the cytological mechanism of CLAs regulates fat infiltration in skeletal muscles based on pig models. We investigated the regulatory effects of CLAs on cell populations and molecular characteristics in pig muscles and found CLAs could promote the transformation of fast glycolytic myofibers into slow oxidative myofibers. We also observed three subpopulations including SCD<sup>+</sup>/DGAT2<sup>+</sup>, FABP5<sup>+</sup>/SIAH1<sup>+</sup>, and PDE4D<sup>+</sup>/PDE7B<sup>+</sup> subclusters in adipocytes and CLAs could increase the percentage of SCD<sup>+</sup>/DGAT2<sup>+</sup> adipocytes. RNA velocity analysis showed FABP5<sup>+</sup>/SIAH1<sup>+</sup> and PDE4D<sup>+</sup>/PDE7B<sup>+</sup> adipocytes could differentiate into SCD<sup>+</sup>/DGAT2<sup>+</sup> adipocytes. We further verified the differentiated trajectory of mature adipocytes and identified PDE4D<sup>+</sup>/PDE7B<sup>+</sup> adipocytes could differentiate into SCD<sup>+</sup>/DGAT2<sup>+</sup> and FABP5<sup>+</sup>/SIAH1<sup>+</sup> adipocytes by using high intramuscular fat (IMF) content Laiwu pig models. The cell-cell communication analysis identified the interaction network between adipocytes and other subclusters such as fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs). Pseudotemporal trajectory analysis and RNA velocity analysis also showed FAPs could differentiate into PDE4D<sup>+</sup>/PDE7B<sup>+</sup> preadipocytes and we discovered the differentiated trajectory of preadipocytes into mature adipocytes. Besides, we found CLAs could promote FAPs differentiate into SCD<sup>+</sup>/DGAT2<sup>+</sup> adipocytes via inhibiting c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway in vitro. This study provides a foundation for regulating fat infiltration in skeletal muscles by using nutritional strategies and provides potential opportunities to serve pig as an animal model to study human fat infiltrated diseases.

">Breathing-Driven Modulation of Reticulospinal Tract Activity</a></h4>

              
                The reticulospinal tract (RST) plays a pivotal role in motor control, especially during recovery after neurological injuries such as stroke and spinal cord injury (SCI). Understanding how RST activity is modulated offers valuable insights into improving motor function recovery. Recent studies have demonstrated that breathing rhythms influence brain activity. This study explores how respiratory rhythms modulate RST excitability during motor tasks, using the StartReact paradigm to examine reaction times (RTs) across visual (VRT), visual-auditory (VART), and visual-auditory startling (VSRT) conditions. We measured RTs in three muscles (first dorsal interosseous, flexor digitorum superficialis, and biceps) in healthy adult participants (n=13, both sexes) performing multi-joint movements. RTs were longest in the VRT condition and significantly decreased when auditory stimuli were added (VART), with further reductions observed in the VSRT condition. Additionally, respiratory phase transitions, particularly from inspiration to expiration (IE), significantly influenced RTs, with the shortest RTs observed during these transitions in the VSRT condition. These findings suggest that RST excitability is dynamically modulated by respiratory rhythms. This modulation of the RST by respiratory phase transitions could inform future neurorehabilitation strategies, such as respiratory-phase-aligned stimulation, to enhance motor recovery following corticospinal lesions. Ultimately, this approach may optimize the timing of interventions, improving outcomes in conditions such as stroke and SCI.

">TBCK-deficiency leads to compartment-specific mRNA and lysosomal trafficking defects in patient-derived neurons</a></h4>

              
                Monogenic pediatric neurodegenerative disorders can reveal fundamental cellular mechanisms that underlie selective neuronal vulnerability. TBCK-Encephaloneuronopathy (TBCKE) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by stop-gain variants in the TBCK gene. Clinically, patients show evidence of profound neurodevelopmental delays, but also symptoms of progressive encephalopathy and motor neuron disease. Yet, the physiological role of TBCK protein remains unclear. We report a human neuronal TBCKE model, derived from iPSCs homozygous for the Boricua variant (p.R126X). Using unbiased proteomic analyses of human neurons, we find TBCK interacts with PPP1R21, C12orf4, and Cryzl1, consistent with TBCK being part of the FERRY mRNA transport complex. Loss of TBCK leads to depletion of C12ORF4 protein levels across multiple cell types, suggesting TBCK may also play a role regulating at least some members of the FERRY complex. We find that TBCK preferentially, but not exclusively, localizes to the surface of endolysosomal vesicles and can colocalize with mRNA in lysosomes. Furthermore, TBCK-deficient neurons have reduced mRNA content in the axonal compartment relative to the soma. TBCK-deficient neurons show reduced levels of the lysosomal dynein/dynactin adapter protein JIP4, which functionally leads to TBCK-deficient neurons exhibiting striking lysosomal axonal retrograde trafficking defects. Hence, our work reveals that TBCK can mediate endolysosomal trafficking of mRNA, particularly along lysosomes in human axonal compartments. TBCK-deficiency leads to compartment-specific mRNA and lysosomal trafficking defects in neurons, which likely contribute to the preferential susceptibility to neurodegeneration.

">NADPH oxidase inhibitor enhances brain resilience in Alzheimer's disease by reducing tauopathy and neuroinflammation</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease associates closely with activation of NADPH oxidase (Nox) isozymes. We identified that CRB-2131, a novel oxadiazole derivative, potently suppresses Nox isozymes. It inhibits reactive oxygen species production (ROS) by hippocampal neuronal and microglial cells and reduces microglial activation. Prophylactic (starting at 3.5 months of age) and therapeutic (starting at 6 months of age) oral administration with CRB-2131 for 10 weeks in 5XFAD mice reduced hippocampal superoxide levels, lipid peroxidation, Tau phosphorylation, and neuroinflammation. Prophylactic and therapeutic CRB-2131 treatment of 5XFAD mice restored their impaired cognition as shown by the novel-object recognition, Y-maze, and Morris water-maze tests. CRB-2131 treatment increased mature neurons, reduced apoptotic mature neurons, and elevated immature neurons in the hippocampus. Positron-emission tomography/computed-tomography imaging confirmed that CRB-2131 stimulated neuronal regeneration. CRB-2131 suppresses brain oxidation, tauopathy, and neuroinflammation, thereby preventing mature neuron death and promoting neuron regeneration. Ultimately, this fosters a resilient brain and protects cognition.

">Gamma frequency neuronal oscillations modulate microglia morphology via colony stimulating factor 1 receptor and NFκB pathway signalling</a></h4>

              
                Within the brain, neurons and glial cells engage in dynamic crosstalk to maintain homeostasis and regulate neuroimmune responses. Recent studies have implicated rhythmic neuronal network activity, most notably at gamma oscillation frequencies (approx. 25-100 Hz), in modulating the morphology and function of microglia, the brain's primary immune cells. Little is known, however, about the cellular mechanisms underlying this form of neuroimmune communication. Using pharmacological and optogenetic models of gamma oscillations in mouse brain slices, we found that gamma oscillations stimulate microglia to adopt a reactive morphological phenotype via activation of colony stimulation factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) and nuclear factor kappa B-mediated signalling. Surprisingly, inhibition of two downstream mediators of CSF1R signalling - phosphoinositide-3-kinase or phospholipase C - did not prevent this effect, suggesting that neuron-microglia interactions in this context may occur via compensatory or alternative CSF1R-linked pathways. These findings provide important insights into how rhythmic brain activity regulates neuroimmune function, with potential implications for neurological health and disease.

">Parity and APOEε4 genotype contribute distinct changes to functional connectivity across the middle-aged brain</a></h4>

              
                Cognition and its underlying neurobiology change throughout the trajectory of aging, with prominent sex differences and influences of sex-specific factors. Research has shown that parity (pregnancy and parenthood) uniquely altered various biomarkers of brain health in middle age depending on presence of Alzheimers disease (AD) risk. The present study builds on prior work by providing a comprehensive view of functional connectivity changes and elucidating how network-level dynamics contribute to cognitive outcomes depending on primiparity and APOEe4 genotype, the top genetic risk factor for late-onset sporadic AD risk. We assessed neural activation in middle-aged wildtype and hAPOEe4 rats that were either nulliparous (0 litters) or primiparous (1 litter). Activation of the immediate early gene zif268 was quantified across 19 brain regions implicated in memory and AD. Primiparous hAPOEe4 rats exhibited widespread reductions in neural activation, particularly in the dorsal striatum, nucleus accumbens, frontal cortex, and retrosplenial cortex. Network analyses further revealed that primiparous wildtype rats had the most cohesive and efficient functional connectivity networks. Notably, the hierarchy of influence of brain regions within the neural network shifted based on parity and hAPOEe4 genotype. Activation of hippocampal new-born neurons in conjunction with subregions of the dorsal striatum, frontal cortex, and retrosplenial cortex dynamically predicted cognitive performance in a parity- and genotype-dependent manner. These findings underscore the lasting impact of reproductive history on brain health and cognitive aging, highlighting the need to consider sex-specific experiences in aging and AD research.

">Designing optimal perturbation inputs for system identification in neuroscience</a></h4>

              
                Investigating the dynamics of neural networks, which are governed by connectivity between neurons, is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. Perturbation-based approaches allow the precise estimation of neural dynamic models and have been extensively applied in studies of brain functions and neural state transitions. However, the question of how optimal perturbations which most effectively identify dynamical models in neuroscience should be designed remains unclear. To address this, we propose a novel theoretical framework for estimating optimal perturbation inputs for system identification in linear time-invariant systems. The model represents neural dynamics using a connectivity matrix and an input matrix. Our framework derives an objective function to optimize perturbation inputs, which minimizes estimation errors in the model matrices. Building upon this, we further explore the relationship of this function with stimulation patterns commonly used in neuroscience, such as frequency, impulse, and step inputs. We then outline an iterative approach to perturbation input design. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating perturbation inputs significantly improves system identification accuracy as dictated by the objective function. Moreover, perturbation inputs tuned to a parameter related to the eigenvalues and a network structure of the intrinsic model enhance system identification. Through this iterative approach, the estimated model matrix gradually approaches the true matrix. As an application, we confirmed that the framework also contributes to the optimal control theory. This study highlights the potential of designing perturbation inputs to achieve the advanced identification of neural dynamics. By providing a framework for optimizing perturbations, our work facilitates deeper insights into brain functions and advances in the study of complex neural systems.

">Signaling of trans-saccadic prediction error by foveal neurons of the monkey superior colliculus</a></h4>

              
                Across saccades, neurons in retinotopically organized visual representations experience drastically different images, but visual percepts remain stable. Here we investigated whether such stability can be mediated, in part, via prediction-error signaling by neurons processing post-saccadic visual images. We specifically recorded from foveal superior colliculus (SC) neurons when a visual image only overlapped with their response fields (RF's) after foveating saccades but not pre-saccadically. When we rapidly changed the target features intra-saccadically, the foveal neurons' post-saccadic visual reafferent responses were elevated, even though the neurons did not directly sample the pre-saccadic extrafoveal target features. This effect did not occur in the absence of saccades, and it also scaled with the extent of the introduced intra-saccadic image feature discrepancies. These results suggest that foveal SC neurons may signal a trans-saccadic prediction error when the foveated image stimulating them is inconsistent with that expected from pre-saccadic extrafoveal representations, a potential perceptual stability mechanism.

">Bodily perception links memory and self: a case study of an amnesic patient</a></h4>

              
                Episodic autobiographical memory (EAM) is a building block of self-consciousness, involving recollection and subjective re-experiencing of personal past experiences. Any life episode is originally encoded by a subject within a body. This raises the possibility that memory encoding is shaped by bodily self-consciousness (BSC), a basic form of self-consciousness arising from the multisensory and sensorimotor perceptual signals from the body. Recent studies in healthy subjects showed that embodied encoding improves EAM, with the involvement of the hippocampus. However, there are only few imaging studies to date, hippocampal data are not consistent, and the role of hippocampal damage is not understood. We investigated how different BSC states during encoding, modulate later EAM retrieval, in a patient with severe amnesia caused by rare bilateral hippocampal damage. We performed three separate behavioral experiments using immersive virtual reality. The patient showed consistently more difficulties recollecting information encoded in embodied vs. disembodied states, particularly when asked to recall her perspective experienced at encoding. These results contrasted with the usual beneficial effect of BSC on EAM, and significantly differed from controls. These data provide consistent evidence that BSC impacts encoding and later reliving, and shows that the hippocampus is not just a critical structure for EAM, but also for effects of embodiment on memory. Additional fMRI data extend these findings by revealing that hippocampal-parietal connectivity mediates BSC-EAM coupling. Our findings plead for an important role of BSC in EAM, mediated by the hippocampus and its connectivity, leading to embodied memories that are experienced as belonging to the self.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Synchronized beta-band oscillations (14&amp;amp;ndash;30 Hz) are critical for sensorimotor processing and motor performance. Modulating beta activity either locally in targeted brain regions or globally across sensorimotor networks may enhance motor function. This study aimed to explore whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and alternating current stimulation (tACS) could enhance sensorimotor responses by modulating beta-band synchronization. Methods: Eight participants performed a stimulus&amp;amp;ndash;response task requiring a quick keypress to a visual cue. Response times (RTs) and electroencephalography (EEG) data were recorded during pre-, in-, and post-stimulation sessions for five conditions: motor-anodal tDCS, visual-anodal tDCS, alpha (10 Hz) tACS, beta (20 Hz) tACS, and sham, with a one-week interval between conditions. Results: Significant RT reductions were observed only after motor-anodal tDCS. EEG analysis revealed a positive correlation between these RT reductions and increased beta-phase synchronization between visual and motor areas. In contrast, tACS conditions did not yield significant RT improvements or beta-phase synchronization changes. Conclusions: These findings indicate that motor-anodal tDCS has the potential to enhance sensorimotor performance by facilitating beta-phase synchronization across the visual-motor network. The observed effects likely extend beyond localized neuronal modulation, emphasizing the importance of network-level connectivity in sensorimotor integration. Beta-phase synchronization appears to play a critical role in integrating visual and motor information, contributing to task-related performance improvements. Further research is warranted to build upon these findings and fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Advancements in biomedical imaging technologies over the past few decades have made it increasingly possible to measure the long-term effects of exercise on the central nervous system. This study aims to compare the brain morphology and functional connectivity of wrestlers and handball players, exploring sport-specific neural adaptations. Methods: Here, we examined 26 elite male athletes (13 wrestlers and 13 handball players) using anatomical and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurements. Connectivity maps are derived using the seed-based correlation analysis of resting-state fMRI, while voxel-based morphometry (VBM) is employed to identify anatomical differences. Additionally, the cortical thickness and global volumetric values of the segmented images are examined to determine the distinctions between elite wrestlers and handball players using non-parametric statistical tests. Results: Wrestlers exhibited greater grey matter volume (GMV) in the right middle temporal gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus, and right posterior cingulate gyrus (uncorr., p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). On the other hand, wrestlers showed increased functional connectivity in the left superior temporal gyrus, left parahippocampal gyrus, the left anterior orbital gyrus, and right superior frontal gyrus&amp;amp;ndash;medial frontal region (P(FWE) &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). In addition, wrestlers showed greater cortical thickness in several brain regions. Conclusions: The increased GMV, cortical thickness, and functional connectivity observed in wrestlers highlight the presence of sport-specific neural adaptations. While this research provides valuable insights into the neuroplastic effects of various athletic disciplines, further studies involving additional sports and control groups are needed for a more comprehensive understanding.</p>

	<p>Background: Childhood is a crucial period for brain development, and short-term juvenile stress has demonstrated long-lasting effects on cognitive and cellular functions in the hippocampus. However, the influence of such stress on the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s overall network remains unclear. Methods: In this study, we employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to explore the effects of transient wild stress on juvenile male rats. Pregnant rats were purchased and housed in a specific pathogen-free (SPF) environment, with pups separated by sex on postnatal day 21 (PD21). From PD27 to PD29, male rats were subjected to transient wild stress, which included forced swimming, elevated platform exposure, and restraint stress. Following stress exposure, all animals were carefully maintained and scanned at 42 days of age (PD42) using fMRI. Structural analysis was performed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to assess changes in gray matter volume, while functional activity was evaluated through regional homogeneity (ReHo) and voxel-wise functional connectivity. Results: The results showed significant reductions in gray matter volume in several brain regions in the stress group, including the periaqueductal gray (PAG), entorhinal cortex (Ent), and dentate gyrus (DG). In terms of functional activity, cortical regions, particularly the primary somatosensory areas, exhibited decreased activity, whereas increased activity was observed in the PAG, DG, and medulla. Furthermore, functional connectivity analysis revealed a significant reduction in connectivity between the DG and entorhinal cortex, while the DG-PAG connectivity was significantly enhanced. Conclusions: These findings suggest that juvenile stress leads to profound alterations in both brain structure and function, potentially disrupting emotional regulation and memory processing by affecting the development and connectivity of key brain regions.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: The widespread phenomenon of &amp;amp;ldquo;brain rot&amp;amp;rdquo;, named the Oxford Word of the Year 2024, refers to the cognitive decline and mental exhaustion experienced by individuals, particularly adolescents and young adults, due to excessive exposure to low-quality online materials, especially on social media. The present study is exploratory and interpretative in nature, aiming to investigate the phenomenon of &amp;amp;ldquo;brain rot&amp;amp;rdquo;, with a focus on its key pillars, psychological factors, digital behaviors, and the cognitive impact resulting from the overconsumption of low-quality digital content. Methods: This study employs a rapid review approach, examining research published between 2023 and 2024 across PubMed, Google Scholar, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science. It explores the causes and effects of brain rot, focusing on the overuse of social media, video games, and other digital platforms. Results: The findings reveal that brain rot leads to emotional desensitization, cognitive overload, and a negative self-concept. It is associated with negative behaviors, such as doomscrolling, zombie scrolling, and social media addiction, all linked to psychological distress, anxiety, and depression. These factors impair executive functioning skills, including memory, planning, and decision-making. The pervasive nature of digital media, driven by dopamine-driven feedback loops, exacerbates these effects. Conclusions: The study concludes by offering strategies to prevent brain rot, such as controlling screen time, curating digital content, and engaging in non-digital activities. Given the increasing prevalence of digital engagement, it is essential to explore a variety of strategies, including mindful technology use, to support cognitive health and emotional well-being. The results can guide various stakeholders&amp;amp;mdash;policymakers, practitioners, researchers, educators, and parents or caregivers&amp;amp;mdash;in addressing the pervasive impact of brain rot and promoting a balanced approach to technology use that fosters cognitive resilience among adolescents and young adults.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-155/v2?src=rss">Enhancing prostate cancer detection: The role of b-value and apparent diffusion coefficient in DWI [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a highly effective tool for the detection of prostate cancer (PCa). Diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) is a sensitive technique that depends on the b value and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value for the diagnosis of PCa. The main objective of this study was to determine the optimal b-value and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value in DW-MRI for the diagnosis of prostate cancer. Methods A prospective study including 26 male participants were conducted. MRI examinations were performed with T2 fat saturation sequences, and Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) sequences with b-values (800, 1000, 1500, and 2000 mm2/s) were used, and the corresponding ADC maps were calculated. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were conducted. Results According to the present study, a b-value of 0,1500 mm2/s exhibited the highest Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), Signal Intensity Ratio (SIR), and Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR). Area Under the Curve (AUC) for 0,1500 mm2/s was 0.80, indicating a high diagnostic accuracy for prostate cancer. Conclusion DWI with a b-value of 1500 mm2/s provides good diagnostic accuracy for differential diagnosis of prostate lesions. DWI is a crucial sequence in multiparametric MRI of the prostate and offers detailed information that enhances the accuracy of prostate cancer diagnosis and management.

                Background Vancomycin is an effective first-line therapy primarily in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection and Clostridium difficile, however, it has been shown that its effectiveness and the reduction of nephrotoxicity depend on maintaining adequate therapeutic levels. Population pharmacokinetic (PopPk) models attempt to parameterize the behavior of plasma concentrations in different target populations and scenarios such as renal replacement therapy, to successful therapeutic outcome and avoid these side effects. Methods A scoping review was conducted following the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR), through a search in PubMed, LILACS, OVID Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, SAGE Journals, Google Scholar and previous known registers of PopPk models in non-critically ill adult patients, published between 1998 and 2024. Results A total of 190 papers were fully screened, of which were included 36 studies conducted in different populations; 12 in general population, 23 in special populations (surgical, with impaired renal function, obese, elderly, with cancer and cystic fibrosis), and 1 in mixed population (general and with cancer). The main parameters in the models were renal clearance and volume of distribution. The principal covariables that affected the models were creatinine clearance and weight. All studies used internal evaluation and 4 of them used an external group. Discussion The technology for the development and implementation of PopPk models requires experts in clinical pharmacology and is limited to university and research centers. The software is mostly expensive and, in most cases, the pharmacokinetic models and the heterogeneity in the parameters and evaluation methods depend on which compartmental model, parameters, covariates and software have been used. Conclusions These models require validation in the clinical context and conducting experiments to adapt them for precision dosing in different subpopulations.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1507/v3?src=rss">Complications following miniplate insertion in maxillofacial fractures: a systematic review [version 3; peer review: 3 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Maxillofacial fractures, frequently arising from road traffic incidents, falls, and acts of interpersonal aggression, are a considerable public health issue, exhibiting diverse epidemiological patterns according to demographic factors. The application of miniplates for fracture stabilization is a recognized technique, with innovative methods such as 3D plate systems emerging. Nonetheless, consequences including infections and hardware malfunctions persist. This systematic review seeks to present current evidence regarding the complications linked to miniplate placement in maxillofacial fractures over the last ten years. Methods A systematic review was performed in accordance with PRISMA principles. Databases such as the Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Scopus were examined from September 2014 to September 2024. Studies documenting problems related to miniplate placement were included, without language constraints. The ROBINS-I tool was utilized for non-randomized studies, whereas the Cochrane risk of bias tool was applied to randomized controlled trials. Results From 2,289 initially found studies, 56 satisfied the inclusion criteria. Among these, 28 employed interventional designs, whilst the remaining 28 were observational research. The predominant problems documented in several investigations encompassed infection, wound dehiscence, malocclusion, paraesthesia, malunion/non-union, segment movement, hardware failure, and palpable hardware. Advanced methodologies such as 3D plate systems and locking mechanisms were linked to diminished complication rates. Conclusion This systematic analysis presents a decade of updated research about problems associated with miniplate placement in maxillofacial fractures. Novel methodologies such as 3D plate systems and locking mechanisms demonstrate promise in mitigating problems relative to conventional techniques. These findings can facilitate informed decision-making in clinical practice. Additional study utilizing standardized outcomes and prospective designs is essential to enhance comprehension of the long-term effects of miniplate utilization.

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/12/3/ENEURO.0005-24.2025?rss=1">Detection of Mitotic Neuroblasts Provides Additional Evidence of Steady-State Neurogenesis in the Adult Small Intestinal Myenteric Plexus</a></h4>

              
                <p>Maintenance of normal structure of the enteric nervous system (ENS), which regulates key gastrointestinal functions, requires robust homeostatic mechanisms, since by virtue of its location within the gut wall, the ENS is subject to constant mechanical, chemical, and biological stressors. Using transgenic and thymidine analog-based experiments, we previously discovered that neuronal turnover&mdash;where continual neurogenesis offsets ongoing neuronal loss at steady state&mdash;represents one such mechanism. Although other studies confirmed that neuronal death continues into adulthood in the myenteric plexus of the ENS, the complicated nature of thymidine analog presents challenges in substantiating the occurrence of adult neurogenesis. Therefore, it is vital to employ alternative, well-recognized techniques to substantiate the existence of adult enteric neurogenesis in the healthy gut. Here, by using established methods of assessing nuclear DNA content and detecting known mitotic marker phosphor-histone H3 (pH3) in Hu<sup>+</sup> adult ENS cells, we show that ~10% of adult small intestinal myenteric Hu<sup>+</sup> cells in mice and ~20% of adult human small intestinal myenteric Hu<sup>+</sup> cells show evidence of mitosis and hence are cycling neuroblasts. We observe that proportions of Hu<sup>+</sup> cycling neuroblasts in the adult murine ENS neither vary with ganglionic size nor do they differ significantly between two intestinal regions, duodenum and ileum, or between sexes. Confocal microscopy provides further evidence of cytokinesis in Hu<sup>+</sup> cells. The presence of a significant population of cycling neuroblasts in adult ENS provides further evidence of steady-state neurogenesis in the adult ENS.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/12/3/ENEURO.0008-25.2025?rss=1">Continuous Auditory Feedback Promotes Fine Motor Skill Learning in Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>Motor skill learning enables organisms to interact effectively with their environment, relying on neural mechanisms that integrate sensory feedback with motor output. While sensory feedback, such as auditory cues linked to motor actions, enhances motor performance in humans, its mechanism of action is poorly understood. Developing a reliable animal model of augmented motor skill learning is crucial to begin dissecting the biological systems that underpin this enhancement. We hypothesized that continuous auditory feedback during a motor task would promote complex motor skill acquisition in mice. We developed a closed-loop system using DeepLabCut for real-time markerless tracking of mouse forepaw movements with high processing speed and low latency. By encoding forepaw movements into auditory tones of different frequencies, mice received continuous auditory feedback during a reaching task requiring vertical displacement of the left forepaw to a target. Adult mice were trained over 4&nbsp;d with either auditory feedback or no feedback. Mice receiving auditory feedback exhibited significantly enhanced motor skill learning compared with controls. Clustering analysis of reaching trajectories showed that auditory feedback mice established consistent reaching trajectories by Day 2 of motor training. These findings demonstrate that real-time, movement-coded auditory feedback effectively promotes motor skill learning in mice. This closed-loop system, leveraging advanced machine learning and real-time tracking, offers new avenues for exploring motor control mechanisms and developing therapeutic strategies for motor disorders through augmented sensory feedback.</p>

                <p>How humans achieve such a high degree of prosocial behavior is a subject of considerable interest. Exploration of the neural foundations of human prosociality has garnered significant attention in recent decades. Nevertheless, the neural mechanisms underlying human prosociality remain to be elucidated. To address this knowledge gap, we analyzed multimodal brain imaging data and data from 15 economic games. The results revealed several significant associations between brain characteristics and prosocial behavior, including stronger interhemispheric connectivity and larger corpus callosum volume. Greater functional segregation and integration, alongside fewer myelin maps combined with a thicker cortex, were linked to prosocial behavior, particularly within the social brain regions. The current study demonstrates that these metrics serve as brain markers of human prosocial behavior and provides novel insights into the structural and functional brain basis of human prosocial behavior.</p>

                Research funding committees play an integral role in the research funding process, consisting of a range of skills, knowledge, and expertise (e.g., professional, and public contributors). Although there is some evidence that has explored the efficiency and effectiveness of funding committees in terms of the funding process, there is a lack of published evidence about the purpose, role, and function of funding committees, from the perspective of committee members. A subset of survey data from a cohort of six National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) research programmes, exploring the purpose of a funding committee, and the expectations and role of a funding committee member between October 2020 to December 2021. All committee members were eligible to participate in the survey. Using an inductive approach, 50 completed responses (22.5% response rate) were analysed, focusing on the role of a funding committee member and the functions of a funding committee. Participants highlighted seven key areas for the purpose of a funding committee: prioritising and recommending what research to fund (n=36) and assessment of quality (n=24) being the most common responses. Four areas were considered important to the expectations and role of funding committee members, with reviewing, critically appraising, and discussing applications (n=44); and being fair, objective, and unbiased (n=27) being the most common responses. The findings offer a unique insight into committee members’ expectations about the role, purpose and function of a funding committee and their contribution to the funding recommendation process. There was high agreement that the purpose and role of committees and their members was to offer expert advice to make fair, impartial decisions on which research should be prioritised. Exploring the purpose, role, and function of funding committees has relevance and importance for funding organisations seeking to enhance and optimise the decision-making practice of funding committees.

                Background The approach to estimating mandibular age has been widely used, although it has shown age estimation disparities in diverse populations, including Indians. Objective Our goal was to test the Demirjian 8-teeth approach utilizing orthopantomogram to estimate age reliably after incorporating the third molar. We also used Chaillet and Demirjian’s regression equations to estimate age estimation accuracy in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. Methods The retrospective study included 196 people. Individuals were 8–24 years old. The left mandibular teeth were staged using an orthopantomographs utilizing the Demirjian 8-teeth approach. The Chaillet and Demirjian’s regression models determined dental age, and statistical methods compared dental age to chronological age. Results The gender breakdown was 49.5% male and 50.5% female. Gender did not significantly affect chronological mean age or estimated mean age (13.39±3.77 vs. 13.10±3.51, p = 0.583; 11.75±2.92 vs. 11.58±2.70, p = 0.674). Statistically substantial differences in chronological and estimated mean ages between male and female individuals (p<0.001). Out of the total participants, 31.6% had a difference in age of ±1 year, 30.6% had a difference of 1-2 years, and 37.8% had a difference of more than 2 years. Compared to chronological and estimated ages, these variations in age between males and females were not statistically significant (p=0.557). Conclusions The findings of this study support the use of Demirjian’s 8-teeth approach in the Saudi population residing in the Eastern Province of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, employing Chaillet and Demirjian’s regression equations.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-273/v1?src=rss">Microsatellite instability and early onset colorectal cancer in an emerging economy: A study in an Indonesian tertiary hospital. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers globally, ranking 4th in men and 2nd in women. While once rare in Asian countries, the incidence of CRC has increased in these populations, likely due to risk factors such as a Western diet, smoking, sedentary lifestyles, and aging. In Indonesia, early-onset CRC (EOCRC) has risen alarmingly, with a previous study reporting an annual percentage change of 1.98% from 2009 to 2019. Several studies have linked EOCRC with Microsatellite Instability (MSI), which is gaining attention for its role in CRC diagnosis and treatment. This study aims to explore MSI status in Indonesian CRC patients to better understand its role in the rise of EOCRC and its potential in CRC screening. Methods Fixed formalin paraffin-embedded samples and corresponding clinical data were retrieved from 100 patients diagnosed with CRC between 2018 and 2020. DNA extraction was performed on the samples, and subsequent analysis utilized the N_lynch panel, real-time PCR, and HRM analysis. MSI status was determined based on the presence of two positive markers. Results As much as 12.4% of our subjects were MSI-H and 34% of the subjects were early onset cases. There is a significant difference of tumor location between MSI-H and MSS, in which larger percentage of MSI-H tumor was right-sided (33.3%) than left-sided (9.7%). No significant difference was found in terms of gender, age, onset, stage, and performance status. No significant difference between gender, tumor location, stage, MSI status, and performance status between early onset and late onset group. Conclusion There is a high rate of early onset CRC in Indonesia that is not caused by MSI but rather, possibly, by an undiscovered factor. Further study is needed to explore novel pathway that could explain this phenomenon.

                Introduction People with Parkinson’s disease (PwPD) suffer from a number of motor and non-motor disorders. Research in the field of motor learning suggests the superiority of an external focus of attention (EFA) compared to an internal focus of attention (IFA), including for PwPD. However, no systematic review with meta-analysis has yet examined the effectiveness of different attentional foci across medication states (ON & OFF) for this population. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an EFA versus an IFA on balance, gait, and motor symptom severity in PwPD during both medication states. Methods The study design was a systematic review with meta-analysis. Four electronic databases were searched for eligible studies. Methodological quality was assessed with the PEDro scale. Results Nine studies with a total of 240 subjects were used for the analyses. The meta-analysis for the ON/normal medication status did not indicate an effect in favour of any attentional focus for balance (SMD: 0.00; 95% CI between -0.46 and 0.46), gait (SMD: 0.11; 95% CI between - 0.30 and 0.53), and motor symptom severity (SMD: -0.16; 95% CI between -0.55 and 0.22). The meta-analysis for the OFF medication status did not indicate an effect in favour of any attentional focus for balance (SMD: 0.15; 95% CI between -0.24 and 0.54), gait (SMD: 0.16; 95% CI between -0.56 and 0.88), and motor symptom severity (SMD: -0.15; 95% CI between -0.53 and 0.24). Conclusion Neither attentional focus showed a significant benefit over the other for balance, gait, or motor symptom severity in PwPD regardless of medication state. In the absence of a group effect, the choice of attentional focus may be determined by a person-cantered approach, considering aspects such as individual preferences, training duration, and medication. The results of this work should only be interpreted considering the risk of bias.

                Introduction Perforation of mature ovarian teratomas is rare. This revelation may be misleading. We report a unique case of a ruptured teratoma mimicking an appendicular abscess, emphasizing the value of sharing such an experience to learn from our mistakes as well as the importance of a conservative approach in the treatment of these tumors in children. Case description A 12-year-old-girl presented to the emergency room with a 3-days history of worsening abdominal pain. She reported a fever associated with vomiting and diarrhea. On physical examination, the patient was feverish and displayed generalized tenderness, especially in the right iliac fossa where there was a palpable mass. white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels were significantly elevated. Abdominal ultrasonography confirmed appendicular abscess. Intraoperatively, a perforated right ovarian teratoma was found, and ovarian sparing surgery was performed. No postoperative complications were noted, and histology confirmed the diagnosis of a mature teratoma. Conclusion The differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain in girls is broad and includes gynecological disorders. Ovarian teratomas can progress silently. In this case, the diagnosis can be made intraoperatively when a complication has occurred. Surgeons and radiologists are not always able to establish a positive diagnosis when there are no obvious clinicoradiological features. Even when the diagnosis is made intraoperatively, treatment must be appropriate and conservative surgery remains a therapeutic option.

                Femoral artery pseudoaneurysms are a well-known complication of vascular access procedures and account for the majority of pseudoaneurysm presentations. To mitigate open surgical risk, the current mainstays of endovascular treatment include direct percutaneous thrombin injection or selective embolization or stenting which are contingent on favourable pseudoaneurysm characteristics. We present a case of a comorbid 91-year-old woman with a large refractory iatrogenic superficial femoral artery pseudoaneurysm with a narrow neck following elective coronary angiography with successful vascular closure device-assisted repair following attempted direct thrombin injection. This case presents a novel technique for the endovascular repair of refractory femoral pseudoaneurysms in patients on anticoagulation and at high risk for open surgical repair.

                Introduction We examined the predictors of tobacco smoking initiation considering factors such as age, gender, pocket money, exposure to smoke in public outdoor places, anti-tobacco media, smoking parents, smoking teachers, and smoking friends among adolescents in Indonesia. Methods Using data from the 2014–2019 National Youth Tobacco Survey grades 7–12, data from 9,655 teenagers were analyzed. The research used the Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS) questionnaire. The analysis used univariate, chi-square and logistic regression with the STATA application version 15. Results In total, 9655 adolescent respondents participated. Multivariate tests indicated that teenagers aged 13-15 years (AOR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.08-1.66) and teenagers aged> 15 years (AOR: 1.65, 95% CI: 1.25-2.17), teenagers who were male (AOR: 13.99, 95% CI: 11.11-17.63), teenagers who were exposed to cigarette smoke in public places outside the room (AOR: 2.00, 95% CI: 1.74-2.29), teenagers who had never seen anti-tobacco messages in the mass media (AOR: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.02-1.48), Teenagers who had parents who smoke (AOR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.08-1.46), teenagers who saw teachers smoking in the school area (AOR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.18-1.71), and teenagers who accepted offers of cigarettes from friends (AOR: 15.11, 95% CI: 10.33-22.11). Conclusion The initiation of tobacco smoking among teenagers in Indonesia can be predicted by various factors such as age, gender, exposure to smoke in outdoor public places, exposure to anti-tobacco media, and influence of parents, teachers, and friends.

                Background Bangladesh is an emerging country where teachers and students of public and private universities have started using technology in the classrooms. Many teachers and students of social science faculty have an inclination to use ChatGPT for educational and research purposes. By focusing on this specific context, the study aims to bring insights into the perception and integration of ChatGPT into the educational practices in an emerging country. Methods This study employed a mixed method approach. Quantitative data were collected through questionnaire survey from 402 teachers and 440 students of eight different public and private universities following a stratified sampling approach. A convenience sampling technique was followed with a view to collecting qualitative data through in-depth interviews of 32 participants, including 16 teachers and 16 students from both public and private universities. Results The research presents that students and teachers both have proficiency, but there is a gap in expertise. Students perceive ChatGPT as beneficial for better learning outcomes, and teachers find it helpful in preparing for classes and instructional materials. Both teachers and students consider ChatGPT requirng minimal effort. Though students are influenced by their peers to use it, teachers are not. On the other hand, teachers have more behavioral intentions to use it in the future than the students have. Yet worries over ethical use, reliance, and information accuracy prevail. High cost and language barriers are also listed as reasons for level of accessibility . Conclusion The findings of this study have significant implications for the development of policies, research endeavors, and teaching-learning practices in the higher education sector covering both public and private universities in Bangladesh and similar contexts.

                Background Transitioning from national service to mainstream employment can be daunting, especially in this era of high unemployment in Ghana. Most universities found the need to incorporate entrepreneurship education into their curriculum hoping to get graduates to take up entrepreneurship activities instead of being employed by someone else. This study investigated Ghanaian tertiary-level graduates’ education and work intentions as they work through their mandatory national service program. Methods Graduates from across Ghana’s tertiary institutions were sampled (n=1011; males=73%, females=27%) from various tertiary institutions via the National Service Scheme website. An online questionnaire with questions on work and postgraduate study intentions, perceptions of tertiary education received, and whether they would like to start their own business or expect to be employed was filled out. Results The results revealed that despite calls for graduates to venture into self-employment, graduates still had hopes for formal sector employment (64%) and fewer had entrepreneurship intentions (8%). Entrepreneurship intentions were significantly related to gender as more males than females had intentions of starting their own businesses regardless of having taken entrepreneurship courses. Graduates expressed satisfaction (83%) with their tertiary education however called for additional services like attachment opportunities and internship positions within industry. Conclusions The study concludes that though the graduates were satisfied with their education, yet they wished they had received more practical hands-on training in addition, and more career and job fairs, however, none of these desires were to help them set themselves up but rather to help them to be employed by someone. The study recommendations reiterate calls for enhanced industry-educational institutions’ collaboration to provide graduates with more industry-specific skills and ease the transition to labour market. Intensify entrepreneurship learning opportunities but also at the national level address barriers to successful entrepreneurship including access to low-interest rate funding and favourable policies and infrastructure.

                <p>by Yifan Yao, Scott Pauls, Duncan Foley, Tomoko Yoshikawa, Sato Honma, Ken-Ichi Honma, Ellie McVeigh, Nicolas C. Foley, Rae Silver</p>

The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), locus of a circadian clock, is a small nucleus of approximately 20,000 neurons that oscillate with a period of about 24 hours. While individual neurons produce circadian oscillations even when dispersed in culture, the coherence and robustness of oscillation of the SCN as a whole is dependent on its circuitry. Surprisingly, the individual neurons of the intact SCN do not all oscillate in phase with each other. To understand the oscillatory dynamics across the intact nucleus, we develop a model of the relation of the phase of neurons to their PER2 expression at a particular subjective time (CT1900) using <i>time series data</i> from SCN slice preparations. Next, we use the model, which produces a surprisingly good fit in the SCN slice data, to estimate oscillator phase at a single time point (CT1900) in <i>snapshot</i> data from PER2 expression measurements in intact, unsliced SCN-wide tissue. To monitor temporal changes in phase in time series data, we use PER2::LUC imaging in an ex vivo SCN slice preparation. To study phase in the intact SCN at a fixed time point we use data generated by PER2 staining and a tissue clearing protocol. Because PER2 expression, as measured in the time series slices and the snapshot intact SCN are not directly comparable, the model estimated from time series slices to the snapshot intact SCN data requires a calibrating constant. The results indicate that our model provides a surprisingly good fit to the SCN slice data and is therefore a meaningful method for estimating phase in the intact SCN snapshot data, permitting the study of virtual interventions such as virtual tissue slicing. We next compare oscillation in circuits in the SCN-wide tissue to those that have been disrupted by virtual slicing using a Kuramoto model to simulate the dynamics. The results support prior evidence that the damage done by coronal slicing has the most disruptive impact on SCN oscillation, while horizontal slicing has the least damage. The results point to the importance of connectivity along the caudal-to-rostral axis and indicate that SCN circuit organization depends on the caudal-to-rostral flow of information. In summary, the construction of this model is a major finding of the paper. Our modeling allows us to perform the previously impossible analysis of oscillatory dynamics in static data in an intact SCN captured at a single time point.

                Background The neoliberal approach to higher education management has significantly transformed collegiality and university governance. This study identifies and analyzes how and where these changes have occurred, as well as their impact on the efficiency and competitiveness of universities. It addresses existing research gaps and provides new insights for adaptation strategies. Methods We selected all retrieved sources based on the keywords and analyzed all the documents we obtained. This study obtained data from Scopus retrieved on October 27, 2023, using the following keywords: (TITLE-ABS-KEY (“collegiality”) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY (“change management”) OR TITLE-ABS-KEY (“neolibelism”)) AND TITLE-ABS-KEY (“higher education”). This study utilized bibliometric analysis to ensure a structured review of the literature on collegiality, change management, and neoliberalism in higher education. Results The findings show that organizational management, leadership, education, technology, curriculum, innovation, organizational change, decision-making, and human beings are significant trajectories of neoliberalism in higher education. Conclusions This study offers other constructs for accelerating leadership success in higher education. This relates to how change leadership can navigate changes resulting from neoliberal ideology.
