Here the authors show that, in experimental models of cell competition, hemocytes are recruited independently of cell death and in fact participate directly in cell killing.

Vaccines have saved millions of lives, yet their importance and safety is
                    repeatedly in question. We cannot let disinformation campaigns get in the way of
                    global public health—it is not time to defund, but rather invest in these
                    life-saving tools.

                Meyerolbersleben et al. investigate how the mouse thalamocortical system processes complex visual input through the lens of fast neural oscillations. Local visual features in naturalistic stimuli induce V1 oscillatory bursts with retinotopic, spectral, and laminar specificity, accompanied by translaminar patterns of phase-coupled spiking. This might serve differential and multiplexed visual coding.

                In this study, He et al. find that there is a balance between conventional and unconventional T helper cells and that this influences autoreactive B cell responses. They find that when iNKTfh cells are activated, they limit the expansion of Tfh cells, but the resulting autoreactive B cell response is increased.

">Developmental, neuroanatomical and cellular expression of genes causing dystonia</a></h4>

              
                Objective Dystonia is one of the most common forms of movement disorder with >50 genes identified as causative. However, an understanding of which developmental stages, brain regions and cell types are most relevant is crucial for developing relevant disease models and therapeutics. One approach is to examine the timing and anatomical expression of dystonia-causing genes, on the assumption that deleterious variants have a greater impact where higher levels of expression are observed. Methods We investigated the expression patterns of 44 dystonia-causing genes across two bulk- and two single-nuclei RNA-sequencing datasets, derived from prenatal and postnatal human brain tissue. Results Dystonia genes were most strongly enriched in those with higher expression in the striatum, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, amygdala and substantia nigra, and for higher postnatal expression. Individual genes exhibiting differences in expression across adult brain regions include SQSTM1, SGCE, KMT2B, PRKRA, YY1, DNAJC12, KCNA1, CACNA1A (highest expression in cerebellum), ADCY5, GNAL, ANO3 (highest expression in striatum), RHOBTB2, FOXG1 (highest expression in cerebral cortex). Single-nuclei RNA-sequencing data analyses from human frontal cortex, striatum and cerebellum indicated that dystonia genes are predominantly expressed in neurons (both glutamatergic and GABAergic), rather than glia. Gene Ontology analysis showed prominent enrichment in biological processes such as dopamine biosynthetic and metabolic processes, and in the cellular components axons, presynapse and neuron projection. Interpretation These analyses provide important insights into the anatomical, developmental and cellular expression patterns of dystonia-causing genes, potentially guiding the development of disease-relevant models and improving the timing and targeting of future therapeutic interventions.

Several studies have shown that Lewy bodies contain C-terminally truncated aSyn which is more prone to fibrillation and enhances the aggregation of human full-length aSyn in vitro. Nevertheless, in vivo studies addressing whether and how human C-terminally truncated aSyn may exacerbate the pathological aggregation and toxicity of human full-length aSyn are currently lacking. In the present study we aimed to determine whether the co-expression of human full-length and 1-120 truncated aSyn would enhance human full-length aSyn aggregation and toxicity. To this end we generated and characterized two novel alpha-synuclein mouse models. Specifically, we first produced a mouse line expressing full-length human aSyn under its own promoter (BACo mice) in the absence of endogenous mouse aSyn. Then, the BACo mice were crossed with the previously described MI2 mice, which express human 1-120 truncated aSyn under the control of the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) promoter on a mouse aSyn null backgroundin order to obtain the MI2BACo mice, which express both human 1-120 truncated and full-length aSyn in a mouse aSyn null background. We found that aSyn aggregation was present and increased with age in both mouse lines but was significantly higher in the MI2BACo mice. These mice exhibited progressive nigrostriatal accumulation of aSyn aggregates which were often composed of full-length and 1-120haSyn, the latter being specifically recognized by using a novel antibody raised against the 1-120haSyn. In addition, we observed that the presence of both truncated and full-length aSyn in MI2BACo mice led to a faster and more pronounced aSyn aggregation which associated with more severe dopaminergic striatal fiber degeneration and nigral neuron loss. Collectively, our results indicate that the expression of human C-terminally truncated aSyn exacerbates human full-length aSyn pathology and support that the novel MI2BACo transgenic mouse line represents an innovative experimental model to study the biological basis of PD and test novel therapeutic approaches.

">First vs recurrent episode symptomatology in Major Depressive Disorder and its relation to brain function and structure: a network approach.</a></h4>

              
                Background: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a prevalent psychiatric disorder. At least half of the patients who recover from a first depressive episode, will experience a relapse. Therefore, understanding the underlying mechanisms supporting relapse is a clinical urgency that could be informed by studying complex brain-behavior associations. Here, we investigated how the relationships between depressive symptomatology and regional brain characteristics differed between people with first depressive episode vs recurrent depression. Methods: We used REST-meta-MDD data from the DIRECT consortium. We focused on comparing global and local network properties between first (n=239) and recurrent episode (n=179) on: (i) symptom network, (ii) brain structural (VBM) and functional networks (ALFF, ReHO), and (iii) integrated symptoms network and brain characteristics using the psychopathology and multimodal network approach. Results: Symptom network analysis showed high values of strength centrality for Insomnia: Early Hours of the Morning and General somatic symptoms at recurrence compared to the first episode. Also, differences in global strength in the integrated symptom-brain network (measured with ReHo metric) (S=2.09 p= 0.042). Finally, we found the edge of specific symptom-brain links, including insomnia and somatic symptoms-, to differ between the first episode and recurrence. Conclusions: For symptom networks, local but not global properties differentiated first from recurrent episode MDD, with specially stronger relations of insomnia and somatic symptoms in recurrent episode depression. For integrated symptom-brain networks, global strength of the network reflecting regional functional integrity (ReHO) was related to recurrence. This suggests that symptoms have relevance for understanding the complex brain-symptom relations underpinning recurrence of depression.

">N1 cassette-lacking NMDA receptors mediate the antidepressant activity of ketamine</a></h4>

              
                Ketamine has emerged as a rapid-acting and robust antidepressant1,2. However, the mechanism of its antidepressant action remains enigmatic. The core issue that has yet to be resolved is whether NMDA receptors (NMDARs), which are subject to open channel blockade by ketamine3,4, mediate the antidepressant effect. NMDARs naturally undergo alternative splicing of the obligatory GluN1 subunit5, producing receptor diversity in the brain that has not been considered in the actions of ketamine. Here we discover that alternative splicing of Grin1 exon 5, which leads to exclusion (GluN1a) or inclusion (GluN1b) of the N1 cassette, located in the N-terminal domain of GluN1 distant from the pore, unexpectedly dictates the level and dynamics of NMDAR blockade by ketamine and gates its antidepressant activity. We find that ketamine prevents NMDAR-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 region of the hippocampus in mice engineered to exclude Grin1 exon 5 (GluN1a mice), but ketamine has no effect on LTP in mice engineered to include this exon (GluN1b mice). Ketamine inhibits synaptic NMDARs in CA1 pyramidal neurons in both GluN1a and GluN1b mice, with the level of steady-state blockade marginally greater in GluN1a- than in GluN1b-containing NMDARs. However, the rate of relief of ketamine blockade upon membrane depolarization is markedly slower in GluN1a than in GluN1b neurons such that GluN1a-containing receptors remain blocked during bursting activity, whereas those containing GluN1b escape the ketamine blockade. Furthermore, ketamine treatment, either via systemic administration or local infusion into the hippocampus, induces an antidepressant effect in GluN1a mice but has no effect in GluN1b mice. Collectively, we identify GluN1a-containing NMDARs, which are persistently blocked by ketamine during neuronal firing activity, to be selectively responsible for the antidepressant effect.

">Switches from tonic to burst firing enable memory consolidation through late-phase synaptic plasticity</a></h4>

              
                This study explores how alternating periods of tonic and burst firing phases in neural networks contribute to memory consolidation. We develop a biophysical neural network model that leverages these brain state fluctuations to investigate the interplay between neuronal firing shifts and synaptic plasticity. The model introduces a two-stage plasticity rule, combining conventional early-phase plasticity with a novel burst-driven late-phase plasticity. Using a learning protocol where tonic firing is associated with active learning periods and burst firing is associated with rest periods, we demonstrate that burst firing resets early-phase plasticity, enabling new memory formation during subsequent tonic firing learning periods and memory consolidation through late-phase plasticity. We further confirm through a pattern recognition task that replacing burst firing with additional tonic firing or quiescent periods hinders memory consolidation. These findings suggest a mechanistic role for burst firing in memory consolidation and its importance for both computational models and experimental studies of learning.

">Brainstem pathology in human narcolepsy: Neurodegeneration in the locus coeruleus in narcoleptic humans, but not in genetically narcoleptic mice or dogs</a></h4>

              
                Our earlier study led to the conclusion that human narcolepsy with cataplexy was caused by the loss of forebrain hypocretin (orexin) neurons in the hypothalamus. We now report that humans having narcolepsy with cataplexy also have a 46% decrease in the number and an 18% increase in the size of brainstem neuromelanin-pigmented locus coeruleus (LC) neurons and increased microglial activity in LC. However, no such changes are observed in the LC of hypocretin peptide depleted narcoleptic mice, hypocretin neuron depleted orexin-tTA/TetO-DTA (orexin-DTA) narcoleptic mice or in narcoleptic dogs. Sodium oxybate, an effective treatment for narcolepsy, decreased the size of LC norepinephrine neurons and increased the number and size of LC microglial cells in mice. Our results indicate that the autoimmune process believed to cause human narcolepsy affects both forebrain Hcrt neurons and brainstem LC norepinephrine cells. Addressing both forebrain and brainstem pathologies may improve understanding of, and treatments for, human narcolepsy.

">Task-induced 1/f slope modulation as a paradigm-independent marker of cognitive control in multiple sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neuro-degenerative and inflammatory disease causing motor, sensory, and cognitive deficits, including impairments in working memory and attention. These cognitive deficits may arise from an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neural activity due to synaptic loss. Recent studies suggest that the aperiodic 1/f slope, a neural marker reflecting excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance, could serve as a biomarker for cognitive control. This study examines 1/f slope modulation during cognitive tasks in people with MS and healthy controls to investigate its potential as a paradigm-independent marker of cognitive control. We analyzed the Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data collected from 126 participants: 44 healthy controls (HCs), 61 people with MS not treated with benzodiazepines (pwMS(BZDn)), and 21 pwMS treated with benzodiazepines (pwMS(BZDp)). Participants performed an auditory oddball task and a visual-verbal n-back working memory task. After preprocessing MEG data, we used the FOOOF algorithm to extract the aperiodic 1/f slope from power spectral densities across 42 cortical parcels. Through this analysis, we observed significant increases in the 1/f slope following stimulus onset for all stimulus types, with more pronounced modulation for non-standard stimuli (targets and distractors), especially within the temporal cortex. Group comparisons revealed less slope modulation in pwMS(BZDp) compared to HCs during distractor stimuli, indicating impaired inhibitory control linked to benzodiazepine treatment. Positive correlations of 1/f slope modulation across auditory oddball and n-back tasks were observed in HCs and pwMS(BZDn), highlighting a consistent, paradigm-independent mechanism. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the aperiodic 1/f slope is a sensitive, paradigm-independent marker of cognitive control and E/I balance. Reduced modulation in response to distractors among pwMS(BZDp) highlights benzodiazepine-related disruptions in inhibitory neural processes underlying cognitive deficits. These findings underscore the value of aperiodic spectral measures to deepen understanding and potentially guide therapeutic interventions targeting cognitive impairments in MS.

">Deep learning using structural MRI massively improves prediction accuracy of body mass index</a></h4>

              
                Obesity is a major public health problem globally and there is considerable interest in the neural mechanisms in food overconsumption. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning, has shown promise in characterizing links between brain morphometry and obesity. In 1106 adults, compared to other forms of machine learning, deep learning using 3D convolutional neural networks (3D-CNN) dramatically improves prediction of body mass index (BMI). The 3D-CNN model robustly predicted BMI (R2 =.325), outperforming random forest, elastic net, and tabnet models (R2s<.07) in a 'lockbox' sample. Explainable AI analyses revealed the specific brain regions implicated and these regions were moderately associated with delay discounting, fluid cognition, gait speed, dexterity, and alcohol use. Collectively, these findings reveal the value of deep learning for understanding of the neural basis and motivational processes in the neurobiology of obesity.

">The Ventral Attention Network Mediates Attentional Reorienting to Cross-Modal Expectancy Violations: Evidence from EEG and fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Our daily interactions with the world are shaped by sensory expectations informed by context and prior experiences, which in turn influence how we allocate our attention. Prominent predictive coding models suggest that sensory expectancy and attention interact but disagree on the precise mechanisms. One possibility is that the Ventral Attention Network (VAN), may play a role by facilitating attentional reorienting when expectancy is violated. To test this, we employed an auditory-visual trial-by-trial cueing paradigm in three experiments integrating EEG and fMRI to investigate the role of VAN in violations of cross-modal expectancy. Behavioral results showed faster responses to expected targets, confirming the efficacy of cue-induced expectations in orienting attention to the expected target modality. EEG analyses revealed differences in early (~100 ms latency) event-related potentials (ERPs) to both auditory and visual stimuli when expectations were violated. Unexpected stimuli elicited significantly larger early-latency negative ERPs, across both modalities. Source localization of these ERPs and subsequent fMRI evidence revealed activation in the right VAN. Functional connectivity analyses further showed greater coupling between VAN regions and sensory cortices, with modality-specific pathways involving superior temporal gyrus (STG) for auditory and fusiform gyrus (FG) for visual targets. These findings demonstrate that expectancy violations recruit the VAN to reorient attention and resolve sensory conflict. By coordinating top-down control and bottom-up sensory input, the VAN supports adaptive responses to unexpected stimuli. This work advances our understanding of predictive processing in multisensory perception and highlights the role of VAN in flexible cognitive control.

">Dissociating physiological ripples and epileptiform discharges with vision transformers</a></h4>

              
                Two frequently studied bursts of neural activity in the hippocampus are normal physiological ripples and abnormal interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs). While they are different waveforms, IEDs are notoriously picked up as false positives when using typical automated ripples detectors which are prone to sharp edge artifacts. This has created challenges for studying ripples and IEDs independently. We leveraged recent advances in computer vision on time-frequency feature representations to enable more comprehensive and objective dissociation of these phenomena. We retrospectively evaluated human intracranial recordings from 46 hippocampal depth electrode sites among 17 patients with focal epilepsy, the majority of whom had a seizure-onset zone/network involving the hippocampus. We implemented a common human ripple detection algorithm and broadband spectrograms of all detected ripple candidates were projected into low-dimensional space. We segmented them using k-means to infer pseudo-labels for probable ripples and probable IEDs. Independently, human expert IED labels were manually annotated for comparison. State-of-the-art vision transformer models were implemented on individual spectrograms to approach ripple vs. IED dissociation as an image classification problem. We detected 31,847 ripple/IED candidates, and a median 3.9% per patient (range: 0-47.2%) were IEDs based on expert label overlap. Low-dimensional projection of spectrograms separated canonical IEDs vs. ripples better than raw or ripple-filtered waveforms. Canonical ripple and IED candidates emerged at opposite poles with a continuous landscape of intermediates in between. A binary vision transformer model trained on expert-labeled IED vs. non-IED candidate spectrograms with 5-fold cross-validation showed a mean area under the curve (AUC) of 0.970 and mean precision-recall curve of 0.694, both significantly above chance. To evaluate generalizability, we implemented a leave-one-patient-out cross-validation approach, in which training on pseudo-labels and testing on expert-labeled data demonstrated near-expert performance (mean AUC 0.966 across patients, range 0.892-0.997). Transformer-derived attention maps revealed that models were tuned to triangle-like edge artifact spatial features in the spectrograms. Model-derived probabilities (i.e. of being an IED) for all candidates demonstrated continuous transitions between ripples vs. IEDs, as opposed to binary clustering. The delineation between ripples and IEDs appears best represented as a gradient (i.e. not binary) due to physiological ripple features overlapping with sharpened and/or high frequency pathophysiological IED features. ViTs nevertheless perform virtually at human expert levels in dissociating these phenomena by leveraging time-frequency spatial features enabled by neural data spectrograms. Such tools applied to spectrotemporal representations may augment comprehensive investigations in cognitive neurophysiology and epileptiform signal biomarker optimization for closed-loop applications.

">An enteric neuron-expressed variant ionotropic receptor detects ingested salts to regulate salt stress resistance</a></h4>

              
                The detection of internal chemicals by interoceptive chemosensory pathways is critical for regulating metabolism and physiology. The molecular identities of interoceptors, and the functional consequences of chemosensation by specific interoceptive neurons remain to be fully described. The C. elegans pharyngeal neuronal network is anatomically and functionally homologous to the mammalian enteric nervous system. Here, we show that the I3 pharyngeal enteric neuron responds to cations via an I3-specific variant ionotropic receptor (IR) to regulate salt stress tolerance. The GLR-9 IR, located at the gut lumen-exposed sensory end of I3, is necessary and sufficient for salt sensation, establishing a chemosensory function for IRs beyond insects. Salt detection by I3 protects specifically against high salt stress, as glr-9 mutants show reduced tolerance of hypertonic salt but not sugar solutions, with or without prior acclimation. While cholinergic signaling from I3 promotes tolerance to acute high salt stress, peptidergic signaling from I3 during acclimation is essential for resistance to a subsequent high salt challenge. Transcriptomic analyses show that I3 regulates salt tolerance in part via regulating the expression of osmotic stress response genes in distal tissues. Our results describe the mechanisms by which chemosensation mediated by a defined enteric neuron regulates physiological homeostasis in response to a specific abiotic stress.

">Generating the head direction signal: Two types of head direction cells in the lateral mammillary and dorsal tegmental nuclei.</a></h4>

              
                Head direction (HD) cells discharge as a function of the animals directional heading and are believed to underlie ones sense of direction. They have been identified in several brain areas, although the signal is thought to be generated across the connections between the lateral mammillary (LMN) and dorsal tegmental nuclei (DTN). Computational models have proposed that a ring-attractor network underlies the mechanisms that generate the signal. These models usually contain separate populations of neurons that encode HD and angular head velocity (AHV). Currently, both cell types have been identified in the LMN and DTN. However, HD attractor models also require cells, referred to as rotation cells, which are sensitive to both parameters conjunctively (HD+AHV). Here we sought to identify such cells in the LMN-DTN network. We identified two distinct types of HD cells. The majority of LMN HD cells (~64%) were AHV-independent, responding only to the animals directional heading. However, a second population (~36%) was sensitive to both HD and AHV. Both symmetric and asymmetric AHV cell types were found. Similar results were found in the DTN, but with a higher percentage of conjunctive HD+AHV cells (60%). Notably, many HD+AHV conjunctive cells were also sensitive to the animals linear velocity (LV). In contrast, HD cells in the anterodorsal thalamus were rarely sensitive to AHV or LV. These findings demonstrate that the requisite rotation-type HD cell is present in brain areas responsible for generating the HD signal and supports the view that an attractor style network underlies its generation in mammals.

                <p>One pending question in social neuroscience is whether interpersonal interactions are processed differently by the brain depending on the bodily characteristics of the interactor, i.e., their physical appearance. To address this issue, we engaged participants in a minimally interactive task with an avatar either showing bodily features or not while recording their brain activity using electroencephalography (EEG) in order to investigate indices of action observation and action monitoring processing. Multivariate results showed that bodily compared with nonbodily appearance modulated parieto-occipital neural patterns throughout the entire duration of the observed movement and that, importantly, such patterns differ from the ones related to initial shape processing. Furthermore, among the electrocortical indices of action monitoring, only the early observational positivity (oPe) was responsive to the bodily appearance of the observed agent under the specific task requirement to predict the partner movement. Taken together, these findings broaden the understanding of how bodily appearance shapes the spatiotemporal processing of an interactor's movements. This holds particular relevance in our modern society, where human&ndash;artificial (virtual or robotic) agent interactions are rapidly becoming ubiquitous.</p>

                Introduction Sharenting involves parents sharing photos, videos, or other information about their children on their social media profiles via online platforms. Research indicated the rising prevalence of parental sharenting behaviour among various countries. Objective The main aim of this article was to explore the role of motivations, perceptions, attitudes, and impression management on parental sharenting behaviours. Methods A systematic review examined empirical studies published from 2019 to 2024 regarding parental motivations, attitudes, perceptions, and impression management associated with sharenting. Relevant studies were identified via Scopus and manual reference searches, with data extraction concentrating on study characteristics, demographics, objectives, design, and principal findings. Findings Parental sharenting is motivated by intrinsic desires, social validation, and impression management, as parents curate content to improve their social image. While children value favourable representations, many object to sharing without consent. Notwithstanding privacy concerns, parents frequently prioritise advantages, raising ethical enquiries regarding children’s autonomy, privacy, and digital identity in digital self-representation. Conclusion Parental sharenting, motivated by emotional satisfaction, social validation, and impression management, frequently neglects privacy risks and ethical considerations. Such practices may compromise children’s autonomy, privacy, and digital identity, resulting in conflicts with their rights. Children’s varied responses underscore these dilemmas, highlighting the necessity of reconciling parental intentions with safeguarding children’s digital futures and overall well-being. Recommendation Parents should engage in mindful sharenting, policymakers must safeguard children’s digital rights, professionals should enhance awareness, and researchers should investigate methods to reconcile parental desires with children’s welfare.

                Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) is a serious and life-threatening complication defined by excessive immune activation. While it’s commonly associated with rheumatic diseases, infections can also trigger MAS, with tuberculosis being a rare but significant cause. This case report discusses a rare occurrence of Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) caused by multifocal tuberculosis in an immunocompromised patient with Crohn’s disease receiving immunosuppressive treatment. The patient is a 26-year-old woman with Crohn’s disease who is being treated with azathioprine. She arrived at the hospital battling persistent abdominal pain, overwhelming fatigue, and fever. Upon examination, splenomegaly and ascites were noted. A chest X-ray revealed bilateral pleural effusion consistent with tuberculosis. A CT scan confirmed the presence of pleural, pericardial, and intraperitoneal fluid. Blood tests indicated pancytopenia, hyperferritinemia, and hypofibrinogenemia. The analysis of ascitic fluid suggested an exudate. The PCR test of the bone marrow aspirate was positive for tuberculosis without rifampicin resistance, and the smear showed hemophagocytosis images. The patient was diagnosed with Macrophage Activation Syndrome secondary to multifocal tuberculosis. This report delves into the complex relationship between MAS and tuberculosis, emphasizing the challenges in diagnosing MAS in such cases and the potential link to tuberculosis. The complex diagnostic landscape of multifocal tuberculosis, which can often mimic malignancies, underscores the importance of promptly detecting and starting anti-tuberculosis interventions for improved clinical outcomes and the prevention of associated complications.

                Life support robots that can be fully autonomous clothing wear-support robotic identification control systems are challenging. Robotic-assisted dressing solutions have the potential to provide tremendous support to the elderly, patients with mobility impairments, and their caregivers. In this study, we propose an IoT control system that automatically identifies clothing wearing position boundaries and recognizes actual spatial height information using a stereo camera with computer vision. The location information of the clothes boundary was recognized use the semantic segmentation model and machine learning method. Then, using the depth measurement of the stereo camera, the spatial height position of the actual clothing boundary was calculated using the depth information. Finally, the auxiliary position movement control of the clothes-wearing support robot was carried out using the IoT method. We experimentally verified that the recognition control system can successfully achieve the recognition and control of the auxiliary position movement of the device. We performed practical experiments for the evaluation. The recognition accuracy and control accuracy in multiple situations and environmental conditions were 77.35% and 97.21%.

                Background Bioremediation faces several compounds to recover oil spilled ecosystem. The BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene) are toxic hydrocarbons requiring efficient microbial degradation for bioremediation. Pseudomonas aeruginosa can degrade hydrocarbons through emulsification (rhl genes) and tolerance (mla genes). However, genomic organization of these systems in environmental P. aeruginosa strains remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the rhl and mla systems in six strains isolated from hydrocarbon-contaminated sites in Peru. Methods Six Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were evaluated in this study. Each strain were able to degrade hydrocarbon and tolerate heavy metals. DNA extraction, sequencing, and quality-controlled assembly, functional genome annotation was performed using BAKTA. Comparative analysis included high-quality Pseudomonas genomes from RefSeq, with ANI metrics. A phylogenetic tree was built from core gene alignment, revealed evolutionary connections and was visualized with iTOL. Results The assembled genomes ranged from 5.6 to 6.0 Mbp with ~66% GC content. All the strains were confirmed as P. aeruginosa by ANI; placing them within Clade 1 alongside environmental and clinical strains. Pangenome analysis identified 3,544 core genes and a diverse accessory genome. All strains had rhlABRI genes in a conserved 3′-5′ orientation. Most of them contained duplicated rhlB gene, except C1BHIC5 strain. However, rhlG varied in position and orientation, it was often near rhlC, with C1BHIC5 also displaying an exception in rhlG orientation.100% of strains presented mla system, associated with toluene tolerance, with two copies of mlaA, mlaFEDC, and mlaEFD genes arranged with high synteny but variable orientations. In comparison to Pseudomonas putida, where mla genes are positioned between murA and ppcD with an additional toluene tolerance gene (ttg2D). Conclusions In conclusion, the presence of the rhlABC genes and the BTEX tolerance genes in all of the analyzed strains allowed us to understand the great ability of P. aeruginosa to survive in polluted environments.

                <p>by Laetitia Grabot, Garance Merholz, Jonathan Winawer, David J. Heeger, Laura Dugué</p>

Brain oscillations might be traveling waves propagating in cortex. Studying their propagation within single cortical areas has mostly been restricted to invasive measurements. Their investigation in healthy humans, however, requires non-invasive recordings, such as MEG or EEG. Identifying traveling waves with these techniques is challenging because source summation, volume conduction, and low signal-to-noise ratios make it difficult to localize cortical activity from sensor responses. The difficulty is compounded by the lack of a known ground truth in traveling wave experiments. Rather than source-localizing cortical responses from sensor activity, we developed a two-part model-based neuroimaging approach: (1) The putative neural sources of a propagating oscillation were modeled within primary visual cortex (V1) via retinotopic mapping from functional MRI recordings (encoding model); and (2) the modeled sources were projected onto MEG and EEG sensors to predict the resulting signal using a biophysical head model. We tested our model by comparing its predictions against the MEG-EEG signal obtained when participants viewed visual stimuli designed to elicit either fovea-to-periphery or periphery-to-fovea traveling waves or standing waves in V1, in which ground truth cortical waves could be reasonably assumed. Correlations on within-sensor phase and amplitude relations between predicted and measured data revealed good model performance. Crucially, the model predicted sensor data more accurately when the input to the model was a traveling wave going in the stimulus direction compared to when the input was a standing wave, or a traveling wave in a different direction. Furthermore, model accuracy peaked at the spatial and temporal frequency parameters of the visual stimulation. Together, our model successfully recovers traveling wave properties in cortex when they are induced by traveling waves in stimuli. This provides a sound basis for using MEG-EEG to study endogenous traveling waves in cortex and test hypotheses related with their role in cognition.

                <p>by Wasim Abbas, Sieun Lee, Sangil Kim</p>
Background <p>In Korea, Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) is a recurring illness that presents significant public health challenges, primarily because of its unpredictable epidemic patterns. The accurate prediction of the spread of HFMD plays a vital role in the effective management of the disease.</p> Methods <p>We have devised a dynamic model that accurately represents the transmission dynamics of HFMD. The model includes compartments for susceptible, exposed, inpatients, outpatients, recovered, and deceased individuals. By utilizing monthly inpatient and outpatient data, the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) method was employed to perform a joint estimation of model parameters and state variables. The calibration of model parameters involved using data from the months of January to May, while generating forecasts for the timeframe spanning from June to December.</p> Results <p>The findings reveal a significant alignment between the model and the observed data, as evidenced by root-mean-square error (RMSE) values below 1000 for inpatients and below 10000 for outpatients starting in June. The correlation coefficients surpassed 0.9, except for the year 2015. The implications of our findings suggest a notable shift in transmission and recovery rates, starting in 2015.</p> Discussion <p>The model successfully predicted the peak and magnitude of HFMD outbreaks occurring between June and December, closely matching the observed epidemic patterns. The model’s efficacy in predicting epidemic trends and informing preventive strategies is reinforced by the insights gained from monthly variations in parameter estimates of HFMD transmission dynamics.</p>

                <p>by Jiaxin Hu, Jesse N. Weber, Lauren E. Fuess, Natalie C. Steinel, Daniel I. Bolnick, Miaoyan Wang</p>

Studying the mechanisms underlying the genotype-phenotype association is crucial in genetics. Gene expression studies have deepened our understanding of the genotype  →  expression  →  phenotype mechanisms. However, traditional expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) methods often overlook the critical role of gene co-expression networks in translating genotype into phenotype. This gap highlights the need for more powerful statistical methods to analyze genotype  →  network  →  phenotype mechanism. Here, we develop a network-based method, called spectral network quantitative trait loci analysis (snQTL), to map quantitative trait loci affecting gene co-expression networks. Our approach tests the association between genotypes and joint differential networks of gene co-expression via a tensor-based spectral statistics, thereby overcoming the ubiquitous multiple testing challenges in existing methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of snQTL in the analysis of three-spined stickleback (<i>Gasterosteus aculeatus</i>) data. Compared to conventional methods, our method snQTL uncovers chromosomal regions affecting gene co-expression networks, including one strong candidate gene that would have been missed by traditional eQTL analyses. Our framework suggests the limitation of current approaches and offers a powerful network-based tool for functional loci discoveries.

Drug-resistant tuberculosis is a pressing global health issue that requires the development of new drugs or the identification of new therapeutic targets. The ESX-3 secretion system is essential for the <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> growth and plays a role in iron/zinc homeostasis and virulence. The aim of this study was to evaluate the quaternary interface of EccD3, a component of the ESX-3 secretion system, and to evaluate the association of an <i>eccD3</i> mutant with drug resistance. The molecular structures of EccD3 protein and other ESX-3 secretion system proteins of the <i>M. tuberculosis</i> were predicted based in homology with the <i>Mycolicibacterium smegmatis</i> tertiary protein structures. According to the <i>in silico</i> results, selamectin, avermectin, ivermectin, and moxidectin were selected as prospective drugs. Selamectin and moxidectin had favorable ΔG values for the EccB3 and EccD3 dimer interfaces, whereas the ESX-3 Protomer 1 interface had the best ΔG + with avermectin, ivermectin, and moxidectin. Furthermore, ivermectin susceptibility increased when the <i>eccD3</i> gene was inhibited using CRISPRi in <i>M. smegmatis</i>. Blockage of EccD3 increased the ivermectin action, but the modest changes observed may be explained by the compensatory mechanisms or other ivermectin targets in absence of this Esx3 component. Further <i>in vitro</i> and preclinical studies are required to validate our findings.

During fertilization, mammalian sperm undergo a winnowing selection process that reduces the candidate pool of potential fertilizers from ~10<sup>6</sup>-10<sup>11</sup> cells to 10<sup>1</sup>-10<sup>2</sup> cells (depending on the species). Classical sperm competition theory addresses the positive or ‘stabilizing’ selection acting on sperm phenotypes within populations of organisms but does not strictly address the developmental consequences of sperm traits among individual organisms that are under purifying selection during fertilization. It is the latter that is of utmost concern for improving assisted reproductive technologies (ART) because low-fitness sperm may be inadvertently used for fertilization during interventions that rely heavily on artificial sperm selection, such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Importantly, some form of sperm selection is used in nearly all forms of ART (e.g., differential centrifugation, swim-up, or hyaluronan binding assays, etc.). To date, there is no unifying quantitative framework (i.e., theory of sperm selection) that synthesizes causal mechanisms of selection with observed natural variation in individual sperm traits. In this report, we reframe the physiological function of sperm as a collective diffusive search process and develop multi-scale computational models to explore the causal dynamics that constrain sperm fitness during fertilization. Several experimentally useful concepts are developed, including a probabilistic measure of sperm fitness as well as an information theoretic measure of the magnitude of sperm selection, each of which are assessed under systematic increases in microenvironmental selective pressure acting on sperm motility patterns.

                <p>by Brittany M. Stewart, Linley R. Pierce, Mikayla C. Olson, Chengyuan Ji, Robert C. Orchard</p>

Norovirus, the leading cause of gastroenteritis worldwide, is a non-enveloped virus whose tropism is determined in part by the expression patterns of entry receptors. However, the contribution of cellular lipids to viral entry is not well understood. Here, we determined that the asymmetrical distribution of lipids within membrane bilayers is required for murine norovirus (MNV) replication. Specifically, TMEM30a, an essential subunit of lipid flippases, is required for MNV replication in vitro. Disruption of TMEM30a in mouse intestinal epithelial cells prevents persistent, enteric infection by MNV in vivo. Mechanistically, TMEM30a facilitates MNV binding and entry. Surprisingly, exoplasmic phosphatidylserine (PS), a typical marker of dying cells, does not inhibit MNV infection. Rather, TMEM30a maintains a lipid-ordered state that impacts membrane fluidity that is necessary for the low affinity, high avidity binding of MNV to cells. Our data provides a new role for lipid asymmetry in promoting non-enveloped virus infection in vitro and norovirus persistence in vivo.

Stem cells have lower facultative heterochromatin as defined by trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) compared to differentiated cells. However, the mechanisms underlying these differential H3K27me3 levels remain elusive. Because H3K27me3 levels are diluted 2-fold in every round of replication and then restored through the rest of the cell cycle, we reasoned that the cell cycle length could be a key regulator of total H3K27me3 levels. Here, we propose that a short G1 phase restricts H3K27me3 levels in stem cells. To test this model, we determined changes to H3K27me3 levels in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) globally and at specific loci upon G1 phase lengthening – accomplished by thymidine block or growth in the absence of serum (with the “2i medium”). H3K27me3 levels in mESCs increase with G1 arrest when grown in serum and in 2i medium. Additionally, we observed via CUT&RUN and ChIP-seq that regions that gain H3K27me3 in G1 arrest and 2i media overlap, supporting our model of G1 length as a critical regulator of the stem cell epigenome. Furthermore, we demonstrate the inverse effect – that G1 shortening in differentiated human HEK293 cells results in a loss of H3K27me3 levels. Finally, in human tumor cells with extreme H3K27me3 loss, lengthening of the G1 phase leads to H3K27me3 recovery despite the presence of the dominant negative, sub-stoichiometric H3.K27M mutation. Our results indicate that G1 length is an essential determinant of H3K27me3 landscapes across diverse cell types.

Self-initiated behavior is accompanied by the experience of intending our actions. Here, we leverage the unique opportunity to examine the full intentional chain—from intention to action to environmental effects—in a tetraplegic person outfitted with a primary motor cortex (M1) brain–machine interface (BMI) generating real hand movements via neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES). This combined BMI-NMES approach allowed us to selectively manipulate each element of the intentional chain (intention, action, effect) while probing subjective experience and performing extra-cellular recordings in human M1. Behaviorally, we reveal a novel form of intentional binding: motor intentions are reflected in a perceived temporal attraction between the onset of intentions and that of actions. Neurally, we demonstrate that evoked spiking activity in M1 largely coincides in time with the onset of the experience of intention and that M1 spike counts and the onset of subjective intention may co-vary on a trial-by-trial basis. Further, population-level dynamics, as indexed by a decoder instantiating movement, reflect intention-action temporal binding. The results fill a significant knowledge gap by relating human spiking activity in M1 with the onset of subjective intention and complement prior human intracranial work examining pre-motor and parietal areas.

                <p>by Khang Ho, Rasika M. Harshey</p>

Chromosomal organization in <i>Escherichia coli</i> as examined by Hi-C methodology indicates that long-range interactions are sparse. Yet, spatial co-localization or “clustering” of 6/7 ribosomal RNA (<i>rrn</i>) operons distributed over half the 4.6 Mbp genome has been captured by two other methodologies—fluorescence microscopy and Mu transposition. Our current understanding of the mechanism of clustering is limited to mapping essential <i>cis</i> elements. To identify <i>trans</i> elements, we resorted to perturbing the system by chemical and physical means and observed that heat shock disrupts clustering. Levels of σ<sup>H</sup> are known to rise as a cellular response to the shock. We show that elevated expression of σ<sup>H</sup> alone is sufficient to disrupt clustering, independent of heat stress. The anti-clustering activity of σ<sup>H</sup> does not depend on its transcriptional activity but requires core-RNAP interaction and DNA-binding activities. This activity of σ<sup>H</sup> is suppressed by ectopic expression of σ<sup>D</sup> suggesting a competition for core-RNAP. A query of the other five known σ factors of <i>E. coli</i> found that elevated expression of FecI, the ECF σ factor that controls iron citrate transport, also perturbs clustering and is also suppressed by σ<sup>D</sup>. We discuss a possible scenario for how these membrane-associated σ factors participate in clustering of distant <i>rrn</i> loci.

                <p>by Hao Xiao, Wenyuan Chen, Hao Pang, Jing Zheng, Li Wang, Hao Feng, Jingdong Song, Lingpeng Cheng, Hongrong Liu</p>

In the assembly pathway of tailed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) bacteriophages and herpesviruses, a procapsid with a dodecameric portal for DNA delivery at a unique vertex is initially formed. Appropriate procapsid assembly requires the transient presence of multiple copies of a scaffolding protein (SP), which is absent in the mature virion. However, how the SP contributes to dodecameric portal formation, facilitates portal and coat protein incorporation, and is subsequently released remains unclear because of a lack of structural information. Here, we present the structure of the SP–portal complex within the procapsid of bacteriophage P22 at 3–9 Å resolutions. The AlphaFold2-predicted SP model fits well with the density map of the complex. The SP forms trimers and tetramers that interact to yield a dome-like complex on the portal. Two SP domains mediate multimerization. Each trimer interacts with two neighboring portal subunits. The SP has a loop-hook-like structure that aids in coat protein recruitment during viral assembly. The loops of those SP subunits on the portal are positioned in clefts between adjacent portal subunits. Conformational changes in the portal during phage maturation may trigger the disassembly and release of the SP complex. Our findings provide insights into SP-assisted procapsid assembly in bacteriophage P22 and suggest that this strategy is also implemented by other dsDNA viruses, including herpesviruses.

The discovery of the <i>ProtoRAG</i> transposon in lancelets revealed that V(D)J recombination originates from the <i>Recombination activating gene-like</i> (<i>RAGL</i>) transposon. Analogous to the vertebrate RAG complex, the RAGL transposase nicks host flanking DNA and leads to the formation of hairpin ends. Here, we showed that the Artemis nuclease, which is capable of resolving DNA hairpin ends generated during V(D)J recombination, is also responsible for unraveling <i>ProtoRAG</i>-mediated DNA hairpin ends. Notably, like the <i>RAGL</i> transposon, Artemis originated from the eukaryotic common ancestor. By tracing the evolving function of Artemis from cephalochordates to vertebrates, we revealed the lineage specific allele polymorphism of lancelet <i>Artemis</i> and uncovered an increased activity on hairpin DNA opening in vertebrate Artemis. Additionally, the evolutionarily conserved LYCS motif in Artemis β6, which may be associated with disease, is demonstrated to be crucial for its function. Overall, this study highlights the evolving function of Artemis, identifies novel critical residues, and provides new insights into the evolution of RAG-mediated recombination and the clinical therapy of <i>Artemis</i> deficient disease.

                Background The discoveries of Mulatu’s numbers, better known as Mulatu’s sequence, represent revolutionary contributions to the mathematical world. His best-known work is Mulatu’s sequence, in which each new number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. When various operations and manipulations are performed on the numbers in this sequence, remarkable and intricate patterns begin to emerge. This study aimed to identify novel characterizations of Mulatu’s numbers. Methods This study employed a multi-faceted approach to investigate characterizations of Mulatu’s numbers. Mathematical proof techniques such as principle of mathematical induction, proof by contradiction and direct proof were utilized to substantiate findings. Results In this study, we provided several characterizations of Mulatu’s numbers. We also investigated the properties and patterns of these numbers. Moreover, we have also shown that, similar to Fibonacci’s numbers, Mulatu’s numbers give the so-called golden ratio, which is most applicable in numerical optimization. Furthermore, we formulated a relation among Mulatu’s numbers, Fibonacci numbers, and Lucas numbers. Finally, we provided a generating function for the Mulatu numbers. Conclusions In this study, we uncovered novel characterizations of Mulatu’s numbers and introduced a generating function for them. We investigated relationship between Mulatu’s numbers and the golden ratio. The results discussed offer valuable insights and enhance our understanding of their properties. Furthermore, these findings play a vital role in the boarder context of mathematics and related areas, contributing significantly to the field.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1213/v2?src=rss">Preterm birth: associated risk factors in the tertiary care center [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                The study aimed at identifying the prevalence of preterm labor and the associated risk factors. Methods A quantitative approach using a retrospective case-control study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Udupi district, Karnataka. The sample consisted of women who delivered in the hospital. Among them, cases (250) were records of women who had delivered before 37 weeks of gestation, and controls (500) were records of women who delivered after 37 weeks 1 of gestation without any complications. Results The study revealed that the prevalence of preterm labor was 356 (14.86%) out of 2402 deliveries. Among these, only 250 were assessed. Preterm labor was significantly correlated with age, place of residence, degree of education, occupation, marital status, gravida, number of deliveries, type of deliveries, gap between births, blood type, and religion. Pregnant women exposed or at risk for preterm labor included those diagnosed with pregnancy-induced hypertension, those who took medication during pregnancy, those with a history of abortion, those engaged in intense physical labor, and those who conceived after the age of 30. Conclusion The prevalence of preterm labor can be minimized if modifiable risk factors are controlled, while non-modifiable risk factors require keen supervision. Health professionals must be alert to all modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-445/v1?src=rss">Dynamic vertical green walls & shading systems integration to enhance energy efficiency & thermal comfort: A case of educational building skin retrofit in a Mediterranean city [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Since 1900, the Mediterranean coast has experienced a notable increase in average annual temperatures, rising from 20°C to 24°C.This upward trend in outdoor climate plays a significant role in determining indoor environmental quality (IEQ) particularly in educational buildings. With growing concerns about energy consumption and urban climate change, This paper examines the potential of movable green walls on building facades to improve urban ecosystems. Unlike traditional passive green walls, active green walls offer dynamic aesthetics and provide various benefits, including shading, passive cooling, and opportunities for personal expression in urban environments. The primary aim of this research is to evaluate the shading effectiveness and energy performance of DVGS in hot climates, specifically within educational settings, to enhance their design as an architectural feature. 1 , 2 Methods A comprehensive approach is employed, specifically designed for the local climate of Egypt, utilizing DVGS to achieve comfort in temperatures and natural sunlight while reducing power consumption to enhance energy efficiency & thermal comfort for the occupants. The novelty of this paper lies in its comparative methodology, enhanced by software simulations (DesignBuilder7.0.2.006-Energy Plus plugin),(hyperlink: https://www.openstudio.net) to address design challenges in the existing educational building. Results The paper highlights the benefits of dynamic vertical green systems (DVGS) in educational institutions, revealing a significant reduction in energy efficiency and air quality. Louvers reduced chilling energy usage by 10.95% and heating energy usage by4.8%, while green walls reduced chilling energy and heating energy usage by 19.14% and 12.94% respectively. Louvers also reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 13%, while green walls reduced emissions by 28.43%. The vegetation layer’s thermal properties improved relative humidity by4% and 8%, respectively, in hot arid environments. DVGS installations also reduced electricity costs by 35% and 41.5% during August peak months. Conclusions The implementation of DVGS significantly improves indoor environmental quality by enhancing energy efficiency, thermal comfort and natural daylight.

                Hippocampal place fields emerge during exploration to support navigational learning and memory. The subcellular mechanisms supporting place field formation remain unclear. O’Hare et al. report that distal tuft dendrites are variably recruited during place field formation. The timing and magnitude of their recruitment predict the properties of new hippocampal place fields.

                Fu et al. find that low-dose prexasertib, a CHK1 inhibitor, enhances tumor sensitivity while mitigating on-target toxicity during immunotherapy through mtDNA-mediated STING pathway activation. Mechanistically, prexasertib at therapeutic doses blocks Nek1-mediated phosphorylation of VDAC1 at the threonine 107 residue, showing a phosphorylation-dependent regulatory mechanism of mitochondrial-nuclear crosstalk.

                Chen et al. demonstrate that HAF2 is a histone acetyltransferase that interacts with EIN2-C to regulate H3K14ac and H3K23ac in response to ethylene. HAF2 functions with the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, establishing its role in ethylene-induced chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation.

                Oka et al. show that basal cell carcinoma (BCC) has low immunogenicity due to low HLA-I expression from its inception. Foxc1, a transcription factor associated with BCC cell of origin, inhibits HLA-I expression in BCC cells, which can be reversed by a histone deacetylase inhibitor to enable BCC immunotherapy.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100581">Targeting IRE1α improves insulin sensitivity and thermogenesis and suppresses metabolically active adipose tissue macrophages in male obese mice</a></h4>

              
                Overnutrition engenders the expansion of adipose tissue and the accumulation of immune cells, in particular, macrophages, in the adipose tissue, leading to chronic low-grade inflammation and insulin resistance. In obesity, several proinflammatory subpopulations of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) identified hitherto include the conventional ‘M1-like’ CD11C-expressing ATM and the newly discovered metabolically activated CD9-expressing ATM; however, the relationship among ATM subpopulations is unclear. The ER stress sensor inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) is activated in the adipocytes and immune cells under obesity. It is unknown whether targeting IRE1α is capable of reversing insulin resistance and obesity and modulating the metabolically activated ATMs. We report that pharmacological inhibition of IRE1α RNase significantly ameliorates insulin resistance and glucose intolerance in male mice with diet-induced obesity. IRE1α inhibition also increases thermogenesis and energy expenditure, and hence protects against high fat diet-induced obesity. Our study shows that the ‘M1-like’ CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs are largely overlapping with but yet non-identical to CD9<sup>+</sup> ATMs in obese white adipose tissue. Notably, IRE1α inhibition diminishes the accumulation of obesity-induced metabolically activated ATMs and ‘M1-like’ ATMs, resulting in the curtailment of adipose inflammation and ensuing reactivation of thermogenesis, without augmentation of the alternatively activated M2 macrophage population. Our findings suggest the potential of targeting IRE1α for the therapeutic treatment of insulin resistance and obesity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106256">Cholesterol taste avoidance in Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                The question as to whether animals taste cholesterol taste is not resolved. This study investigates whether the fruit fly, <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, is capable of detecting cholesterol through their gustatory system. We found that flies are indifferent to low levels of cholesterol and avoid higher levels. The avoidance is mediated by gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs), demonstrating that flies can taste cholesterol. The cholesterol-responsive GRNs comprise a subset that also responds to bitter substances. Cholesterol detection depends on five ionotropic receptor (IR) family members, and disrupting any of these genes impairs the flies' ability to avoid cholesterol. Ectopic expressions of these IRs in GRNs reveals two classes of cholesterol receptors, each with three shared IRs and one unique subunit. Additionally, expressing cholesterol receptors in sugar-responsive GRNs confers attraction to cholesterol. This study reveals that flies can taste cholesterol, and that the detection depends on IRs in GRNs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106228">Kinetic regulation of kinesin’s two motor domains coordinates its stepping along microtubules</a></h4>

              
                The two identical motor domains (heads) of dimeric kinesin-1 move in a hand-over-hand process along a microtubule, coordinating their ATPase cycles such that each ATP hydrolysis is tightly coupled to a step and enabling the motor to take many steps without dissociating. The neck linker, a structural element that connects the two heads, has been shown to be essential for head–head coordination; however, which kinetic step(s) in the chemomechanical cycle is ‘gated’ by the neck linker remains unresolved. Here, we employed pre-steady-state kinetics and single-molecule assays to investigate how the neck-linker conformation affects kinesin’s motility cycle. We show that the backward-pointing configuration of the neck linker in the front kinesin head confers higher affinity for microtubule, but does not change ATP binding and dissociation rates. In contrast, the forward-pointing configuration of the neck linker in the rear kinesin head decreases the ATP dissociation rate but has little effect on microtubule dissociation. In combination, these conformation-specific effects of the neck linker favor ATP hydrolysis and dissociation of the rear head prior to microtubule detachment of the front head, thereby providing a kinetic explanation for the coordinated walking mechanism of dimeric kinesin.

                Apical constriction is a basic mechanism for epithelial morphogenesis, making columnar cells into wedge shape and bending a flat cell sheet. It has long been thought that an apically localized myosin generates a contractile force and drives the cell deformation. However, when we tested the increased apical surface contractility in a cellular Potts model simulation, the constriction increased pressure inside the cell and pushed its lateral surface outward, making the cells adopt a drop shape instead of the expected wedge shape. To keep the lateral surface straight, we considered an alternative model in which the cell shape was determined by cell membrane elasticity and endocytosis, and the increased pressure is balanced among the cells. The cellular Potts model simulation succeeded in reproducing the apical constriction, and it also suggested that a too strong apical surface tension might prevent the tissue invagination.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101780">A general framework for characterizing optimal communication in brain networks</a></h4>

              
                Efficient communication in brain networks is foundational for cognitive function and behavior. However, how communication efficiency is defined depends on the assumed model of signaling dynamics, e.g., shortest path signaling, random walker navigation, broadcasting, and diffusive processes. Thus, a general and model-agnostic framework for characterizing optimal neural communication is needed. We address this challenge by assigning communication efficiency through a virtual multi-site lesioning regime combined with game theory, applied to large-scale models of human brain dynamics. Our framework quantifies the exact influence each node exerts over every other, generating optimal influence maps given the underlying model of neural dynamics. These descriptions reveal how communication patterns unfold if regions are set to maximize their influence over one another. Comparing these maps with a variety of brain communication models showed that optimal communication closely resembles a broadcasting regime in which regions leverage multiple parallel channels for information dissemination. Moreover, we found that the brain’s most influential regions are its rich-club, exploiting their topological vantage point by broadcasting across numerous pathways that enhance their reach even if the underlying connections are weak. Altogether, our work provides a rigorous and versatile framework for characterizing optimal brain communication, and uncovers the most influential brain regions, and the topological features underlying their influence.

Using a combination of behavioral methods, computational modeling, fMRI, MR spectroscopy, and pharmacological intervention, we investigated the role of aging and GABA in neural variability during visual processing. We replicated previous findings that participants expressed higher variability when viewing more complex visual stimuli. Additionally, we found that such variability modulation was associated with higher baseline visual GABA levels and was reduced in older adults. When pharmacologically increasing GABA activity, we found that participants with lower baseline GABA levels showed a drug-related increase in variability modulation while participants with higher baseline GABA showed no change or even a reduction, consistent with an inverted-U account. Finally, higher baseline GABA and variability modulation were jointly associated with better visual-discrimination performance. These results suggest that GABA plays an important role in how humans utilize neural variability to adapt to the complexity of the visual world.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94578">Shaping the physical world to our ends through the left PF technical-cognition area</a></h4>

              
                Our propensity to materiality, which consists in using, making, creating, and passing on technologies, has enabled us to shape the physical world according to our ends. To explain this proclivity, scientists have calibrated their lens to either low-level skills such as motor cognition or high-level skills such as language or social cognition. Yet, little has been said about the intermediate-level cognitive processes that are directly involved in mastering this materiality, that is, technical cognition. We aim to focus on this intermediate level for providing new insights into the neurocognitive bases of human materiality. Here, we show that a technical-reasoning process might be specifically at work in physical problem-solving situations. We found via two distinct neuroimaging studies that the area PF (parietal F) within the left parietal lobe is central for this reasoning process in both tool-use and non-tool-use physical problem-solving and can work along with social-cognitive skills to resolve day-to-day interactions that combine social and physical constraints. Our results demonstrate the existence of a specific cognitive module in the human brain dedicated to materiality, which might be the supporting pillar allowing the accumulation of technical knowledge over generations. Intensifying research on technical cognition could nurture a comprehensive framework that has been missing in fields interested in how early and modern humans have been interacting with the physical world through technology, and how this interaction has shaped our history and culture.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93921">Combinatorial CRISPR screen reveals FYN and KDM4 as targets for synergistic drug combination for treating triple negative breast cancer</a></h4>

              
                Tyrosine kinases play a crucial role in cell proliferation and survival and are extensively investigated as targets for cancer treatment. However, the efficacy of most tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in cancer therapy is limited due to resistance. In this study, we identify a synergistic combination therapy involving TKIs for the treatment of triple negative breast cancer. By employing pairwise tyrosine kinase knockout CRISPR screens, we identify <i>FYN</i> and <i>KDM4</i> as critical targets whose inhibition enhances the effectiveness of TKIs, such as NVP-ADW742 (IGF-1R inhibitor), gefitinib (EGFR inhibitor), and imatinib (ABL inhibitor) both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, treatment with TKIs upregulates the transcription of <i>KDM4</i>, which in turn demethylates H3K9me3 at <i>FYN</i> enhancer for <i>FYN</i> transcription. This compensatory activation of <i>FYN</i> and <i>KDM4</i> contributes to the resistance against TKIs. <i>FYN</i> expression is associated with therapy resistance and persistence by demonstrating its upregulation in various experimental models of drug-tolerant persisters and residual disease following targeted therapy, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Collectively, our study provides novel targets and mechanistic insights that can guide the development of effective combinatorial targeted therapies, thus maximizing the therapeutic benefits of TKIs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99258">TRPγ regulates lipid metabolism through Dh44 neuroendocrine cells</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how the brain controls nutrient storage is pivotal. Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are conserved from insects to humans. They serve in detecting environmental shifts and in acting as internal sensors. Previously, we demonstrated the role of TRPγ in nutrient-sensing behavior (Dhakal et al., 2022). Here, we found that a TRPγ mutant exhibited in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> is required for maintaining normal lipid and protein levels. In animals, lipogenesis and lipolysis control lipid levels in response to food availability. Lipids are mostly stored as triacylglycerol in the fat bodies (FBs) of <i>D. melanogaster</i>. Interestingly, <i>trpγ</i> deficient mutants exhibited elevated TAG levels and our genetic data indicated that <i>Dh44</i> neurons are indispensable for normal lipid storage but not protein storage. The <i>trpγ</i> mutants also exhibited reduced starvation resistance, which was attributed to insufficient lipolysis in the FBs. This could be mitigated by administering lipase or metformin orally, indicating a potential treatment pathway. Gene expression analysis indicated that <i>trpγ</i> knockout downregulated <i>brummer</i>, a key lipolytic gene, resulting in chronic lipolytic deficits in the gut and other fat tissues. The study also highlighted the role of specific proteins, including neuropeptide DH44 and its receptor DH44R2 in lipid regulation. Our findings provide insight into the broader question of how the brain and gut regulate nutrient storage.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102166">Social and environmental predictors of gut microbiome age in wild baboons</a></h4>

              
                Mammalian gut microbiomes are highly dynamic communities that shape and are shaped by host aging, including age-related changes to host immunity, metabolism, and behavior. As such, gut microbial composition may provide valuable information on host biological age. Here, we test this idea by creating a microbiome-based age predictor using 13,563 gut microbial profiles from 479 wild baboons collected over 14 years. The resulting ‘microbiome clock’ predicts host chronological age. Deviations from the clock’s predictions are linked to some demographic and socio-environmental factors that predict baboon health and survival: animals who appear old-for-age tend to be male, sampled in the dry season (for females), and have high social status (both sexes). However, an individual’s ‘microbiome age’ does not predict the attainment of developmental milestones or lifespan. Hence, in our host population, gut microbiome age largely reflects current, as opposed to past, social and environmental conditions, and does not predict the pace of host development or host mortality risk. We add to a growing understanding of how age is reflected in different host phenotypes and what forces modify biological age in primates.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102542">Still waters run deep in large-scale genome rearrangements of morphologically conservative Polyplacophora</a></h4>

              
                A major question in animal evolution is how genotypic and phenotypic changes are related, and another is when and whether ancient gene order is conserved in living clades. Chitons, the molluscan class Polyplacophora, retain a body plan and general morphology apparently little changed since the Palaeozoic. We present a comparative analysis of five reference quality genomes, including four de novo assemblies, covering all major chiton clades, and an updated phylogeny for the phylum. We constructed 20 ancient molluscan linkage groups (MLGs) and show that these are relatively conserved in bivalve karyotypes, but in chitons they are subject to re-ordering, rearrangement, fusion, or partial duplication and vary even between congeneric species. The largest number of novel fusions is in the most plesiomorphic clade Lepidopleurida, and the chitonid <i>Liolophura japonica</i> has a partial genome duplication, extending the occurrence of large-scale gene duplication within Mollusca. The extreme and dynamic genome rearrangements in this class stands in contrast to most other animals, demonstrating that chitons have overcome evolutionary constraints acting on other animal groups. The apparently conservative phenome of chitons belies rapid and extensive changes in genome.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104764">Cell type-specific driver lines targeting the Drosophila central complex and their use to investigate neuropeptide expression and sleep regulation</a></h4>

              
                The central complex (CX) plays a key role in many higher-order functions of the insect brain including navigation and activity regulation. Genetic tools for manipulating individual cell types, and knowledge of what neurotransmitters and neuromodulators they express, will be required to gain mechanistic understanding of how these functions are implemented. We generated and characterized split-GAL4 driver lines that express in individual or small subsets of about half of CX cell types. We surveyed neuropeptide and neuropeptide receptor expression in the central brain using fluorescent in situ hybridization. About half of the neuropeptides we examined were expressed in only a few cells, while the rest were expressed in dozens to hundreds of cells. Neuropeptide receptors were expressed more broadly and at lower levels. Using our GAL4 drivers to mark individual cell types, we found that 51 of the 85 CX cell types we examined expressed at least one neuropeptide and 21 expressed multiple neuropeptides. Surprisingly, all co-expressed a small molecule neurotransmitter. Finally, we used our driver lines to identify CX cell types whose activation affects sleep, and identified other central brain cell types that link the circadian clock to the CX. The well-characterized genetic tools and information on neuropeptide and neurotransmitter expression we provide should enhance studies of the CX.

">Loss of MeCP2 leads to sleep deficits that are time-of-day dependent and worsen with sleep deprivation</a></h4>

              
                Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe, progressive neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the X-linked gene encoding methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2). Sleep problems are frequently reported in Rett Syndrome, but the exact nature remains relatively unexplored. Currently there is limited understanding the role of MECP2 in sleep architecture and regulation. In this study, we employed longitudinal electroencephalographic (EEG) and electromyographic (EMG) recordings to investigate sleep architecture during baseline conditions as well as the homeostatic response to sleep deprivation (SD) in Mecp2-/y male mice. At baseline, Mecp2-/y mice have more non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep and less rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep than their wildtype littermates during the light period. However, Mecp2-/y mice display altered sleep timing during the dark period, spending more time in both NREM and REM during the first half and less time during the second half. We also observe differences in REM sleep and wake quality based on spectral properties of the EEG. In response to SD, Mecp2-/y mice can accumulate and discharge sleep pressure normally and show a sleep rebound. However, baseline differences in sleep architecture are heightened after SD. Overall, our findings show that RTT mice exhibit distinct sleep patterns compared to wildtype mice, with time-of-day-dependent variations in NREM and REM sleep, as well as altered EEG spectral properties, that become more pronounced following SD. Future research should explore the molecular mechanisms through which MECP2 regulates circadian sleep architecture to develop targeted therapeutics for sleep disturbances in RTT patients.

">Transcriptional and neuroprotective effects of hexokinase-2 inhibitors administered afterstroke</a></h4>

              
                The inflammatory response induced by stroke can exacerbate injury to peri-infarct tissue. Microglia and other immune cells that mediate this response require increased glycolytic flux during pro-inflammatory activation. These cells, unlike neurons and most other cell types, utilize hexokinase-2 (HK2) rather than hexokinase-1 for glycolysis, such that HK2 inhibitors may selectively target them to suppress post-ischemic inflammation. Here we compared the effects of the non-selective hexokinase inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose to the HK2-selective inhibitors lonidamine and 3-bromopyruvate on secondary injury after stroke. A spatial transcriptomic assessment was performed in parallel to compare effects of the inhibitors on microglial gene expression and microglia - neuron interactions and to screen for off-target effects. Each of the inhibitors suppressed pro-inflammatory gene upregulation in peri-infarct microglia and attenuated the upregulation of cell stress functional pathways in the neighboring neurons, but had minimal effect on neuronal gene expression in uninjured cortex. The HK2-selective inhibitors were more effective than 2-deoxyglucose in suppressing morphological microglial changes, neuronal oxidative stress, and neurite loss. 3-bromopyruvate administered after stroke produced long-term improvements in functional outcome. Selective HK2 inhibitors may thus provide a clinically applicable means to suppress microglial activation and thereby improve outcomes after stroke without endangering neuronal energy metabolism.

">Initial signs of learning: Decoding newly-learned vocabulary from neural patterns in novice sign language learners</a></h4>

              
                Learning a new language requires the brain to map new perceptual cues onto real-world semantic concepts. Studies of semantic processing suggest that these representations are at least partially language-independent: despite differing low-level perceptual features, homologous words can evoke overlapping neural patterns associated with a shared underlying meaning. A few studies have leveraged this relationship to examine the emergence of knowledge in the brains of novice learners, but so far all have focused on learners of spoken languages. Evidence from bimodal (sign and speech) bilinguals suggests that neural representations of signs and spoken words may be language-dependent on the individual item level but share representations of broad semantic features. However this remains to be tested in novice signers, who may rely more on their established spoken language representations. We present two experiments in which hearing English speakers underwent brief training in American Sign Language (ASL). In Study 1, participants were all trained to ceiling on a set of signs, while in Study 2 the task difficulty was increased to produce individual differences in performance. Using representational similarity analysis (RSA) with fMRI, we identify brain regions where neural patterns reflect semantic relationships between nouns in both languages. Moreover, in Study 2 participants, we show that multivariate neural measures of semantic representation of ASL in several frontal, temporal, and occipital regions reflect individual differences in comprehension. These results suggest that in contrast to prior work in bilinguals, novice signers show semantic representation at the item level in partially overlapping regions, and the degree of multivariate correlation can track individual-level shifts in understanding in the earliest stages of sign language learning.

">Protective effects of central leptin on whole-body energy homeostasis upon acute olanzapine exposure</a></h4>

              
                Second-generation antipsychotic use is associated with severe metabolic side effects such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Leptin is a hormone that is secreted by adipose tissue, and it acts on the brain to decrease body weight by reducing food intake and stimulating energy expenditure. Leptin also improves glucose and lipid metabolism. We examined the short-term impact of olanzapine, a commonly used second-generation antipsychotic, on the central leptin-mediated regulation of energy balance, lipid metabolism, and hypothalamic kinase activity. Male Sprague Dawley rats were given an acute intracerebroventricular (ICV, 3rd ventricle) injection of either leptin or vehicle, combined with subcutaneous olanzapine or vehicle. As expected, ICV leptin decreased food intake and, importantly, olanzapine did not block this effect. Administration of leptin, olanzapine, or their combination reduced the average respiratory exchange ratio (RER) during the light cycle, which indicates that fat oxidation was increased. In the dark cycle, leptin decreased the average RER regardless of olanzapine administration, and in the presence of leptin, olanzapine did not affect the average RER. Leptin did not alter the olanzapine-induced increase in serum triglyceride concentrations. Olanzapine and central leptin treatment differentially activated hypothalamic kinases. In conclusion, regulation of food intake and fuel preference by central leptin is intact following acute olanzapine administration.

">Targeted gene transfer into developmentally defined cell populations of the primate brain</a></h4>

              
                The primate brain possesses unique physiological and developmental features whose systematic investigation is hampered by a paucity of transgenic germline models and tools. Here, we present a minimally invasive method to introduce transgenes widely across the primate cerebral cortex using ultrasound-guided fetal intracerebroventricular viral injections (FIVI). This technique enables rapid-onset and long-lasting transgene expression following the delivery of recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs). By adjusting the gestational timing of injections, viral serotypes, and transcriptional regulatory elements, rAAV FIVI allows for systematic targeting of specific cell populations. We demonstrate the versatility of this method through restricted laminar expression in the cortex, Cre-dependent targeting of neurons, CRISPR-based gene editing, and labeling of peripheral somatosensory and retinal pathways. By mimicking key desirable features of germline transgenic models, this efficient and targeted method for gene transfer into the fetal primate brain opens new avenues for experimental and translational neuroscience across the lifespan.

">A test of long-term and dose-dependent effects of fluoxetine exposure on the velocity of the invasive crayfish Procambarus clarkii</a></h4>

              
                Fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), is one of the most detected antidepressants in wastewater, managing to enter watersheds where it is taken up by freshwater fauna. Here we asked if the serotonergic system affects the dispersal capabilities of Procambarus clarkii, a prolific worldwide invasive freshwater crayfish species, thanks in part due to its dispersal rates. For this, we exposed adult crayfish to fluoxetine (serotonin facilitator) and para-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA, serotonin inhibitor) at two concentrations, and measured their velocity after 8 and 16 days, on a two-meter-long metal gutter. Overall, our treatment effects revealed to be non-significant, however the lowest dosage of fluoxetine seem to decrease crayfish mean velocity between the 8th and 16th day of exposure, thus shedding some light on the putative importance of the long-term exposure to environment dosage-dependent fluoxetine in modulating the dispersal capabilities of P. clarkii. Though further research is needed, these results can help us better understand the impact of ambient fluoxetine to this invasive species.

">Validation and pre-analytical considerations for processing cerebrospinal fluid samples on a high-throughput proximity extension assay platform</a></h4>

              
                Background: Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) facilitates the understanding of brain-specific molecular changes that may associate with disease progression. Proximity extension assays (PEA) have been deployed in several CSF studies, however the validation of the assay and impact of freeze-thaw cycles on the protein signal has not been documented. We sought to (1) validate the assay on the PEA platform and (2) evaluate the effect of freeze-thaw cycles on the detectability of analytes on the PEA platform. Results: We have validated the PEA with Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) readout assay and report on the detectability and coefficient of variation observed in CSF samples. We have also evaluated proteomic signals with a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 9 freeze thaw cycles and detected very minimal change in signal with increasing cycle number. Conclusion: Our study is the first to validate PEA using NGS readout platform with CSF samples. We report lower protein detection rates and higher variability in the expansion panels compared to the original 4 panels, with acceptable variation above detectability threshold. In addition, our work demonstrates that the proteomic signal is robust and continues to be stable across multiple freeze thaw cycles. This is highly impactful to the processing and analysis of clinical samples and facilitates the investigation of samples with variable pre-analytical conditions.

">Intrinsic and circuit mechanisms of predictive coding in a grid cell network model</a></h4>

              
                Grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) fire when an animal is located at the vertices of a hexagonal grid that extends across the environment. The population activity of grid cells serves as an allocentric representation of the current location of the animal. Recent studies have identified a class of grid cells that represent locations ahead of the animal. How do these predictive representations emerge from the wetware of the MEC? To address this question, we developed a detailed conductance- based model of the MEC network, constrained by existing data on the biophysical properties of stellate cells and the topology of the MEC network. Our model revealed two mechanisms underlying the emergence of a predictive code in the MEC. The first relied on a time scale associated with the HCN conductance. The other depended on the degree of asymmetry in the topology of the MEC network. The former mechanism was sufficient to explain predictive coding in layer II grid cells that represented locations shifted ahead of the current location. The shift was equivalent to [~]5% of the diameter of a grid field. The latter mechanism was required to model predictive representations in layer III grid cells that were shifted forward by a distance of [~]25% of the diameter of a grid field. A corollary of our model, that the extent of the predictive code changes monotonically along the dorsoventral axis of the MEC following observed changes in the properties of the HCN conductance, is borne out by recent experiments.

">Weakened prefrontal activation dynamics associated with slowed information processing speed in multiple sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                Information processing speed (IPS) is a core cognitive deficit in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). Previous efforts have associated IPS performance to frontal regions, but were constrained by limited temporal resolution. In this work, we employed a data-driven method, the time delay embedded-hidden Markov model (TDE-HMM), to identify task-specific states that are spectrally defined with distinct temporal and spatial profiles. We used magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data recorded while healthy controls and PwMS performed a cognitive task designed to capture IPS, the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT). The TDE-HMM identified five task-relevant states, supporting a tri-factor contribution to IPS: sensory speed (occipital visual detection and processing), cognitive speed (prefrontal executive and frontoparietal attention shift), and motor speed (sensorimotor). We observed reduced prefrontal and increased frontoparietal activation in PwMS, which correlated with offline SDMT performance. This work can drive future research for MS treatments targeting IPS improvements.

">Impairment of the blood brain barrier accelerates a negative ultraslow potential in the locust CNS</a></h4>

              
                Insects provide useful models for investigating evolutionarily conserved mechanisms underlying electrical events associated with brain injury and death. Spreading depolarizations (SD) are transient events that propagate through neuropil whereas the negative ultraslow potential (NUP) is sustained and reflects accumulating damage in the tissue. We used the locust, Locusta migratoria, to investigate ion homeostasis at the blood brain barrier (BBB) during SD and NUP induced by treatment with the Na+/K+-ATPase inhibitor, ouabain. We found that sustained SD caused by the metabolic inhibitor, sodium azide, was associated with a large reduction of K+ efflux through the BBB at ganglia (= grey matter) but not at connectives (= white matter). This was accompanied by a large increase in tissue resistivity but no conductance changes of identified motoneuron dendrites in the neuropil. Males recovered more slowly from ouabain-induced SD, as previously described for anoxic SD. Impairment of barrier functions of the BBB pharmacologically with cyclosporin A or DIDS, or by cutting nerve roots, accelerated the NUP, thus promoting earlier and more frequent SD, but had no effect on the temporal parameters of SD. We conclude that the mechanisms underlying onset and recovery of SD are minimally affected by the damage associated with the NUP. We suggest that future research using tissue-specific genetic approaches in Drosophila to target identified molecular structures of the BBB are likely to be fruitful.

">Alzheimer's disease and its co-pathologies: implications for hippocampal degeneration, cognitive decline, and the role of APOE ϵ4</a></h4>

              
                INTRODUCTION: In neurodegenerative dementias, the co-occurrence and interaction of A{beta}, tau, and other pathological lesions confound their individual contributions to neurodegeneration and their modulation by risk factors. METHODS: We analyzed 480 post-mortem human brains (ages 50-99) using regression and structural equation models to assess the relationships among A{beta}, tau, LATE-NC, -synuclein, other age-related lesions, and APOE {epsilon}4, as well as their effects on CA1 neuronal density, brain weight, and cognitive status. RESULTS: A{beta}, tau, LATE-NC, and amygdala-predominant -synuclein pathology were highly interconnected. Tau was the strongest predictor of global neurodegeneration, while LATE-NC primarily, but not exclusively, affected hippocampal neuron loss. Small vessel disease correlated with both LATE-NC and -synuclein, while APOE {epsilon}4 was mainly associated with extracellular and capillary A{beta}. DISCUSSION: Although Alzheimer's pathology plays a central role in brain degeneration, coexisting pathologies can both exacerbate and independently contribute to it. These factors should be considered in patient stratification.

">Brain precapillary sphincters modulate myogenic tone in adult and aged mice</a></h4>

              
                Brain precapillary sphincters, which are surrounded by contractile pericytes and are located at the junction of penetrating arterioles and first-order capillaries, can increase their diameter by ~30% in a few seconds during sensory stimulation, allowing for rapid control of capillary blood flow over a wide dynamic range. We hypothesized that these properties could help precapillary sphincters maintain the capillary blood flow and shield the downstream capillaries during surges in blood pressure. To test this, we visualized microvessels in adult and old anaesthetized mice using in vivo two-photon microscopy. We showed that a blood pressure surge disrupts both microvascular myogenic response and neurovascular coupling in both adult and old mice, with old mice exhibiting a more diminished myogenic response. Similarly, laser ablation of contractile pericytes encircling precapillary sphincters disrupted neurovascular coupling and myogenic response. The resistance provided by precapillary sphincters may be increasingly important in old mice, where we found changes in the topology of microvessels, potentially affecting microvascular blood flow. Old mice displayed more tortuous penetrating arterioles, reduced pial collateral arteriolar density and altered capillary densities: reduced in the arterial end and increased in the venous end. Our results illustrate how blood pressure surges affect brain microvascular function, underscore the protective role of precapillary sphincters during cerebrovascular autoregulation in response to blood pressure surges and compare vascular topology in adult and old mice in vivo.

">Anti-Aβ immunotherapy-mediated amyloid clearance attenuates microglial activation without inducing exhaustion at residual plaques</a></h4>

              
                Anti-amyloid {beta}-peptide (A{beta}) immunotherapy was developed to reduce amyloid plaque pathology and slow cognitive decline during progression of Alzheimer's disease. Efficient amyloid plaque clearance has been proven in clinical trials testing anti-A{beta} antibodies, with the impact on cognitive endpoints correlating with the extent of plaque removal. However, treatment is associated with adverse side-effects, such as oedema and haemorrhages, which are potentially linked to the induced immune response. To improve the safety profile of these molecules, it is imperative to understand the consequences of anti-A{beta} antibody treatment on immune cell function. Here, we investigated the effects of long-term chronic anti-A{beta} treatment on amyloid plaque pathology and microglial response in the APP-SAA triple knock-in mouse model. Mice were treated weekly with anti-A{beta} antibody from 4-8 months of age. Long-term treatment with anti-A{beta} results in a robust and dose-dependent removal of amyloid plaque pathology, with a higher efficiency for removing diffuse over dense-core plaques. Analysis of the CSF proteome indicates a reduction of markers for neurodegeneration including Tau and -Synuclein, as well as immune cell related proteins. Bulk RNA-seq revealed a dose-dependent decrease in brain-wide disease-associated microglial (DAM) and glycolytic gene expression, which is supported by a parallel decrease of glucose uptake and protein levels of Triggering receptor of myeloid cells 2 (Trem2) protein, a major immune receptor involved in DAM activation of microglia. In contrast, DAM activation around remaining plaques remains high regardless of treatment dose. In addition, microglia surrounding remaining plaques display a dose-dependent increase in microglial clustering and a selective increase in antigen presenting and immune signalling proteins. These findings demonstrate that long-term chronic anti-A{beta}-mediated removal of A{beta} leads to a dose dependent decrease in brain-wide microglial DAM activation and neurodegeneration, while microglia at residual plaques display a combined DAM and antigen presenting phenotype that suggests a continued treatment response.

                State-of-the-art high-density multielectrode arrays enable the recording of simultaneous spiking activity from hundreds of neurons. Although significant efforts have been dedicated to enhancing neural recording devices and developing more efficient sorting algorithms, there has been relatively less focus on the allocation of microelectrodes - a factor that undeniably affects spike sorting effectiveness and ultimately the total number of detected neurons. Here, we systematically examined the relationship between optimal electrode spacing and spike sorting efficiency by creating virtual sparser layouts from high-density recordings through spatial downsampling. We assessed spike sorting performance by comparing the quantity of well-isolated single units per electrode in sparse configurations across various brain regions (neocortex and thalamus) and species (rat, mouse, and human). Enabling the theoretical estimation of optimal electrode arrangements, we complement experimental results with a geometrical modeling framework. Contrary to the general assumption that higher electrode density inherently leads to more efficient sorting, both our theoretical and experimental results reveal a clear optimum for electrode spacing specific to species and regions. We demonstrate that carefully choosing optimal electrode distances could yield a total of 1.7 to 3 times increase in spike sorting efficiency. These findings emphasize the necessity of species- and region-specific microelectrode design optimization.

">Abnormal Tau Protein Influences Intercellular Mitochondrial Transfer Between Astrocytic and Neuronal Cells</a></h4>

              
                Tauopathies are a group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the pathological accumulation of abnormal tau protein. A consequence of tau pathologies is mitochondrial dysfunctions, which affect essential processes such as mitochondrial transport, bioenergetics, and dynamics. Given the high energy demands of neurons, tau-induced mitochondrial impairment significantly contributes to neuronal vulnerability and degeneration. Recent studies have revealed that cells can transfer mitochondria between them to help energy-deficient cells. This process, known as intercellular mitochondrial transfer, occurs through two different pathways: an indirect transfer via extracellular vesicles and a direct transfer via tunneling nanotubes and gap junctions. Given the known impact of abnormal tau protein on mitochondrial transport and actin filament dynamics, we hypothesized that intercellular mitochondrial transfer could be altered in the context of tauopathies. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate mitochondrial transfer between astrocytic and neuronal cells and assess how abnormal tau protein may influence this process. Our results showed that abnormal tau protein enhances mitochondrial transfer from astrocytic to neuronal cells. Notably, this transfer occurs mainly via contact-dependent mechanisms. In both pathological and healthy conditions, the transferred astrocytic mitochondria either fused with the mitochondrial network of recipient cells or were degraded in the lysosomes or remained isolated in the cytosol. Our data highlight a novel pathway by which abnormal tau protein impacts mitochondrial function, namely the transfer of astrocytic mitochondria to neuronal cells.

                <p>Memory retrieval activates regions across the brain, including not only the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe (MTL), but also frontal, parietal, and lateral temporal cortical regions. What remains unclear, however, is how these regions communicate to organize retrieval-specific processing. Here, we elucidate the role of theta (3&ndash;8 Hz) synchronization, broadly implicated in memory function, during the spontaneous retrieval of episodic memories. Analyzing a dataset of 382 neurosurgical patients (213 males, 168 females, and 1 unknown) implanted with intracranial electrodes who completed a free-recall task, we find that synchronous networks of theta phase synchrony span the brain in the moments before spontaneous recall, in comparison to periods of deliberation and incorrect recalls. Hubs of the retrieval network, which systematically synchronize with other regions, appear throughout the prefrontal cortex and lateral and medial temporal lobes, as well as other areas. Theta synchrony increases appear more prominently for slow (3 Hz) theta than for fast (8 Hz) theta in the recall&ndash;deliberation contrast, but not in the encoding or recall&ndash;intrusion contrasts, and theta power and synchrony correlate positively throughout the theta band. These results implicate diffuse brain-wide synchronization of theta rhythms, especially slow theta, in episodic memory retrieval.</p>

                <p>Dopaminergic subpopulations of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) differentially degenerate in Parkinson's disease and are characterized by unique electrophysiological properties. The vulnerable population expresses a T-type calcium channel-mediated afterdepolarization (ADP) and shows rebound activity upon release from inhibition, whereas the resilient population does not have an ADP and is slower to fire after hyperpolarization. This rebound activity can trigger dopamine release in the striatum, an important component of basal ganglia function. Using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology on ex vivo slices from adult mice of both sexes, we find that muscarinic activation with the nonselective muscarinic agonist oxotremorine inhibits rebound activity more strongly in vulnerable versus resilient SNc neurons. Here, we show that this effect depends on the direct activation of muscarinic receptors on the SNc dopaminergic neurons. Through a series of pharmacological and transgenic knock-out experiments, we tested whether the muscarinic inhibition of rebound was mediated through the canonical rebound-related ion channels: T-type calcium channels, hyperpolarization-activated cation channels (HCN), and A-type potassium channels. We find that muscarinic receptor activation inhibits HCN-mediated current (<I>I</I><SUB>h</SUB>) in vulnerable SNc neurons but that <I>I</I><SUB>h</SUB> activity is not necessary for the muscarinic inhibition of rebound activity. Similarly, we find that oxotremorine inhibits rebound activity independently of T-type calcium channels and A-type potassium channels. Together these findings reveal new principles governing acetylcholine and dopamine interactions, showing that muscarinic receptors directly affect SNc rebound activity in the midbrain at the somatodendritic level and differentially modify information processing in distinct SNc subpopulations.</p>

                <p>Genetic disorders such as neurofibromatosis type 1 (Nf1) increase vulnerability to cognitive and behavioral disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Nf1 results from mutations in the neurofibromin gene that can reduce levels of the neurofibromin protein. While the mechanisms have yet to be fully elucidated, loss of Nf1 may alter neuronal circuit activity leading to changes in behavior and susceptibility to cognitive and behavioral comorbidities. Here we show that mutations decreasing Nf1 expression alter motor behaviors, impacting the patterning, prioritization, and behavioral state dependence in a <I>Drosophila</I> model of Nf1. Loss of Nf1 increased spontaneous grooming in male and female flies. This followed a nonlinear spatial pattern, with Nf1 deficiency increasing grooming of certain body parts differentially, including the abdomen, head, and wings. The increase in grooming could be overridden by hunger in foraging animals, demonstrating that the Nf1 effect is plastic and internal state dependent. Stimulus-evoked grooming patterns were altered as well, suggesting that hierarchical recruitment of grooming command circuits was altered. Yet loss of Nf1 in sensory neurons and/or grooming command neurons did not alter grooming frequency, suggesting that Nf1 affects grooming via higher-order circuit alterations. Changes in grooming coincided with alterations in walking. Flies lacking Nf1 walked with increased forward velocity on a spherical treadmill, yet there was no detectable change in leg kinematics or gait. These results demonstrate that loss of Nf1 alters the patterning and prioritization of repetitive behaviors, in a state-dependent manner, without affecting low-level motor functions.</p>

                <p>It is recently shown that objects with long-term reward associations can be efficiently located during visual search. The neural mechanism for valuable object pop-out is unknown. In this work, we recorded neuronal responses in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) with known roles in visual search and reward processing in macaques while monkeys engaged in efficient versus inefficient visual search for high-value fractal objects (targets). Behavioral results and modeling using multialternative attention-modulated drift&ndash;diffusion indicated that efficient search was concurrent with enhanced processing for peripheral objects. Notably, neural results showed response amplification and receptive field widening to peripherally presented targets in vlPFC during visual search. Both neural effects predict higher target detection and were found to be correlated with it. Our results suggest that value-driven efficient search independent of low-level visual features arises from reward-induced spatial processing enhancement of peripheral valuable objects.</p>
