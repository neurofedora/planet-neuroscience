<p>An accurate auditory space map can be learned from auditory experience, for
example during development or in response to altered auditory cues such as a
modified pinna. We studied neural network models that learn to localise a
single sound source in the horizontal plane using binaural cues based on
limited supervisions. These supervisions can be unreliable or sparse in real
life. First, a simple model that has unreliable estimation of the sound source
location is built, in order to simulate the unreliable auditory orienting
response of newborns. It is used as a Teacher that acts as a source of
unreliable supervisions. Then we show that it is possible to learn a continuous
auditory space map based only on noisy left or right feedbacks from the
Teacher. Furthermore, reinforcement rewards from the environment are used as a
source of sparse supervision. By combining the unreliable innate response and
the sparse reinforcement rewards, an accurate auditory space map, which is hard
to be achieved by either one of these two kind of supervisions, can eventually
be learned. Our results show that the auditory space mapping can be calibrated
even without explicit supervision. Moreover, this study implies a possibly more
general neural mechanism where multiple sub-modules can be coordinated to
facilitate each other's learning process under limited supervisions.

<p>Consciousness is an explicit outcome of brain activity; however, it is
reputed to be inapprehensible in physical terms. Here, I extract a macroscopic
non-identity law from physics. Using this tool, I show visual awareness
possesses a recurrent projection pathway from brain to observed object, and
that the postponed out-of-body projection, whether superimposed onto or
separated from its original, is a conscious visual outcome. These findings
suggest that visual creatures possesses a gift of not only subjectively imaging
in response to the messenger of original but also projecting the image back
onto the original. The recurrent projection provides a foundation for
understanding the subjectivity and intentionality of consciousness and the
relationships between original, conscious outcome and expression, and paves the
way for scientific research involving consciousness.

<p>Morris-Lecar model is arguably the simplest dynamical model that retains both
the slow-fast geometry of excitable phase portraits and the physiological
interpretation of a conductance-based model. We augment this model with one
slow inward current to capture the additional property of bistability between a
resting state and a spiking limit cycle. The resulting dynamical system is a
core structure for many dynamical phenomena such as slow spiking and bursting.
We show how the proposed model combines physiological interpretation and
mathematical tractability and we discuss the benefits of the proposed approach
with respect to alternative models in the literature.

<p>Background: An imbalance between total training load and total recovery may cause overtraining (OT). The purpose of the present study was to verify the effects of OT on the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), its receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) and p75 and the dynamic expression patterns of brain-specific miR-34a and miR-124 or inflammation-related miR-21 and miR-132 in the mouse hippocampus.</p><p>Method: Eight weeks old C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to the control (CON), normal training (NT) and OT groups. An 8-week OT training protocol was applied to evaluate the phenotype of mice endurance (incremental load test, ILT) and cognitive capacity (Morris water maze test). We used qRT-PCR and immunoblotting to detect changes in the molecular level of hippocampal samples.</p><p>Result: Compared with the CON, both NT and OT decreased bodyweight after 8-week training. After 8-week of training, NT increased the exhaustion velocity (EV) while the EV of OT was lower than NT. Mice in NT decreased the escape latency than CON. The percentage of time spent in the probe quadrant and the number of crossing platform times in NT were higher than CON and OT. The BDNF, p75 and TrkB mRNA levels were increased in NT than CON, only the p75 mRNA was increased in OT. The NT exhibited increased protein levels of BDNF and TrkB compared to CON. The protein expression of BDNF was decreased in OT than NT and CON. The protein level of p75 in the OT was higher than in NT and CON. In addition, the phosphorylation level of TrkB in OT was higher than CON and NT. Only the miR-34a level was increased in the OT. Moreover, the expression of miR-34a was found to be negatively correlated with the expression of BDNF, and the increase in miR-34a level was accompanied by a decrease in performance.</p><p>Conclusion: In summary, the training-evoked increase in the BDNF level may help to improve performance, whereas this conditioning is lost after OT. Moreover, miR-34a potentially mediated changes in the expression of BDNF and may reflect the decrease in performance after OT.</p>

<p>Background: Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) has a high conversion risk to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The aMCI patients may have only a memory deficit (single-domain-aMCI, sd-aMCI) or deficits in multiple cognitive domains (multiple-domain-aMCI, md-aMCI). However, differences in intrinsic brain activity between these two sub-types remain unclear.</p><p>Method: Neuropsychological and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were acquired from 24 patients with sd-aMCI, 23 patients with md-aMCI, and 32 healthy controls (HCs). We used the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) to characterize the intensity of spontaneous brain activity. The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and post hoc tests was performed to determine the between-group differences in fALFF.</p><p>Results: We found higher fALFF in left-sided superior-to-middle frontal gyri and middle-to-inferior temporal gyri in sd-aMCI compared to both the md-aMCI and HCs. Conversely, a lower fALFF was found in the left inferior parietal lobe in both the md-aMCI and sd-aMCI patients. The fALFF values in the left middle and inferior temporal gyri were correlated with cognitive performances.</p><p>Conclusion: The gradual reduction in the left inferior parietal lobe from single to multiple domain aMCI suggest a functional inefficiency underlying cognitive impairment, while increased activity in the frontal and temporal gyri in sd-aMCI rather than md-aMCI might indicate functional compensation. This study indicates differential functional profiles in the sd-aMCI and md-aMCI, which may be helpful for the prediction of the future conversion of aMCI to AD.</p>

<p>The neural circuits responsible for social communication are among the least understood in the brain. Human studies have made great progress in advancing our understanding of the global computations required for processing speech, and animal models offer the opportunity to discover evolutionarily conserved mechanisms for decoding these signals. In this review article, we describe some of the most well-established speech decoding computations from human studies and describe animal research designed to reveal potential circuit mechanisms underlying these processes. Human and animal brains must perform the challenging tasks of rapidly recognizing, categorizing, and assigning communicative importance to sounds in a noisy environment. The instructions to these functions are found in the precise connections neurons make with one another. Therefore, identifying circuit-motifs in the auditory cortices and linking them to communicative functions is pivotal. We review recent advances in human recordings that have revealed the most basic unit of speech decoded by neurons is a phoneme, and consider circuit-mapping studies in rodents that have shown potential connectivity schemes to achieve this. Finally, we discuss other potentially important processing features in humans like lateralization, sensitivity to fine temporal features, and hierarchical processing. The goal is for animal studies to investigate neurophysiological and anatomical pathways responsible for establishing behavioral phenotypes that are shared between humans and animals. This can be accomplished by establishing cell types, connectivity patterns, genetic pathways and critical periods that are relevant in the development and function of social communication.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00006">Unsuspected Involvement of Spinal Cord in Alzheimer Disease</a></h4>

<p>Objective: Brain atrophy is an established biomarker for dementia, yet spinal cord involvement has not been investigated to date. As the spinal cord is relaying sensorimotor control signals from the cortex to the peripheral nervous system and vice-versa, it is indeed a very interesting question to assess whether it is affected by atrophy due to a disease that is known for its involvement of cognitive domains first and foremost, with motor symptoms being clinically assessed too. We, therefore, hypothesize that in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), severe atrophy can affect the spinal cord too and that spinal cord atrophy is indeed an important in vivo imaging biomarker contributing to understanding neurodegeneration associated with dementia.</p><p>Methods: 3DT1 images of 31 AD and 35 healthy control (HC) subjects were processed to calculate volume of brain structures and cross-sectional area (CSA) and volume (CSV) of the cervical cord [per vertebra as well as the C2-C3 pair (CSA23 and CSV23)]. Correlated features (ρ &gt; 0.7) were removed, and the best subset identified for patients’ classification with the Random Forest algorithm. General linear model regression was used to find significant differences between groups (p ≤ 0.05). Linear regression was implemented to assess the explained variance of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score as a dependent variable with the best features as predictors.</p><p>Results: Spinal cord features were significantly reduced in AD, independently of brain volumes. Patients classification reached 76% accuracy when including CSA23 together with volumes of hippocampi, left amygdala, white and gray matter, with 74% sensitivity and 78% specificity. CSA23 alone explained 13% of MMSE variance.</p><p>Discussion: Our findings reveal that C2-C3 spinal cord atrophy contributes to discriminate AD from HC, together with more established features. The results show that CSA23, calculated from the same 3DT1 scan as all other brain volumes (including right and left hippocampi), has a considerable weight in classification tasks warranting further investigations. Together with recent studies revealing that AD atrophy is spread beyond the temporal lobes, our result adds the spinal cord to a number of unsuspected regions involved in the disease. Interestingly, spinal cord atrophy explains also cognitive scores, which could significantly impact how we model sensorimotor control in degenerative diseases with a primary cognitive domain involvement. Prospective studies should be purposely designed to understand the mechanisms of atrophy and the role of the spinal cord in AD.</p>

<p>Objective: To assess the association between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) and risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD).</p><p>Methods: Embase, Pubmed, and Web of Science were searched until June 2019. Standard mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was estimated using random-effects models.</p><p>Results: Our meta-analysis of 26 studies revealed higher levels of LDL-c in AD than that of non-dementia controls (SMD = 0.35, 95% CI 0.12–0.58, p &lt; 0.01). The meta-regression analysis on confounders showed that age (p &lt; 0.01, Adj R-squared = 92.41%) and cardiovascular disease (p = 0.01, Adj R-squared = 85.21%), but not the body mass index, education, smoking, hypertension and diabetes mellitus, exerted an impact on the relationship between LDL-c and risk of ICH. Further subgroup analysis of age showed LDL-c levels in AD patients aged 60–70 were higher than that of non-dementia (60 ≤ age &lt; 70: SMD = 0.80, 95% CI 0.23–1.37, p &lt; 0.01); but no association between the SMD of AD in LDL-c and age over 70 was noted across the studies (70 ≤ age &lt; 77: SMD = −0.02, 95% CI −0.39~0.34, p = 9.0; 77 ≤ age &lt; 80: SMD = 0.15, 95% CI −0.17~0.47, p = 0.35; ≥80: SMD = 0.53, 95% CI −0.04~1.11, p = 0.07).

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Evidence for a role of microglia in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) is growing. Hence, we investigated association of microglial markers at time of diagnostic lumbar puncture (LP) with different aspects of disease activity (relapses, disability, MRI parameters) up to six years later in a cohort of 143 patients.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), we measured three macrophage and microglia‐related proteins, chitotriosidase (CHIT1), chitinase‐3‐like protein 1 (CHI3L1 or YKL‐40) and soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2), as well as a marker of neuronal damage, neurofilament light chain (NfL), using enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and electrochemiluminescence. We investigated the same microglia‐related markers in publicly available RNA expression data from post‐mortem brain tissue.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>CHIT1 levels at diagnostic LP correlated with two aspects of long‐term disease activity after correction for multiple testing. First, CHIT1 increased with reduced tissue integrity in lesions at a median three years later (p=9.6x10<sup>‐4</sup>). Secondly, CHIT1 reflected disease severity at a median five years later (p=1.2x10<sup>‐4</sup>). Together with known clinical covariates, CHIT1 levels explained 12% and 27% of variance in these two measures, respectively, and were able to distinguish slow and fast disability progression (AUC 85%). CHIT1 was the best discriminator of chronic active versus chronic inactive lesions, and the only marker correlated with NfL (r=0.3, p=0.0019). Associations with disease activity were, however, independent of NfL.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>CHIT1 CSF levels measured during the diagnostic LP reflect microglial activation early on in MS and can be considered a valuable prognostic biomarker for future disease activity.</p>

Abstract<p>Visceral sensory neurons encode distinct sensations from healthy organs and initiate pain states that are resistant to common analgesics. Transcriptome analysis is transforming our understanding of sensory neuron subtypes but has generally focused on somatic sensory neurons or the total population of neurons in which visceral neurons form the minority. Our aim was to define transcripts specifically expressed by sacral visceral sensory neurons, as a step towards understanding the unique biology of these neurons and potentially leading to identification of new analgesic targets for pelvic visceral pain. Our strategy was to identify genes differentially expressed between sacral dorsal root ganglia (DRG) that include somatic neurons and sacral visceral neurons, and adjacent lumbar DRG that comprise exclusively of somatic sensory neurons. This was performed in adult and E18.5 male and female mice. By developing a method to restrict analyses to nociceptive Trpv1 neurons, a larger group of genes were detected as differentially expressed between spinal levels. We identified many novel genes that had not previously been associated with pelvic visceral sensation or nociception. Limited sex differences were detected across the transcriptome of sensory ganglia, but more were revealed in sacral levels and especially in Trpv1 nociceptive neurons. These data will facilitate development of new tools to modify mature and developing sensory neurons and nociceptive pathways.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> In this study of mouse dorsal root ganglia, we have identified numerous features of sensory neurons that vary between lumbar and sacral spinal levels and that are potentially involved in unique physiology and pathophysiology of visceral sensation and pain. We further identify maturational components of this sacral visceral transcriptome by comparing data from embryonic and adult mice. There are limited sex differences across the transcriptome of embryonic or adult sensory ganglia, but in adults these can be revealed in sacral levels and especially in Trpv1 nociceptive neurons. These data sets will encourage identification of new tools to modify mature or developing sensory neurons and adult nociceptive pathways.</p>

Abstract<p>Reward value guides goal-directed behavior and modulates early sensory processing. Rewarding stimuli are often multisensory but it is not known how reward value is combined across sensory modalities. Here we show that the integration of reward value critically depends on whether the distinct sensory inputs are perceived to emanate from the same multisensory object. We systematically manipulated the congruency in monetary reward values and the relative spatial positions of co-occurring auditory and visual stimuli that served as bimodal distractors during an oculomotor task performed by healthy human participants (male and female). The amount of interference induced by the distractors was used as an indicator of their perceptual salience. Our results across two experiments show that when reward value is linked to each modality separately, the value congruence between vision and audition determines the combined salience of the bimodal distractors. However, reward value of vision wins over the value of audition if the two modalities are perceived to convey conflicting information regarding the spatial position of the bimodal distractors. These results show that in a task that highly relies on the processing of visual spatial information, the reward values from multiple sensory modalities are integrated with each other, each with their respective weights. This weighting depends on the strength of prior beliefs regarding a common source for incoming uni-sensory signals based on their congruency in reward value and perceived spatial alignment.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Real-world objects are typically multisensory but it is not known how reward value is combined across sensory modalities. We examined how the eye movements towards a visual target are modulated by the reward value of audiovisual distractors. Our results show that in the face of uncertainty as to whether co-occurring visual and auditory inputs belong to the same object, congruence in their reward values is used to guide audiovisual integration. However, when a strong prior exists to assume that uni-sensory inputs do not emanate from the same object, the associative value of vision dominates over audition. These results demonstrate that our brain uses a reward-sensitive, flexible weighting mechanism to decide whether incoming sensory signals should be combined or not.</p>

<p>Walking and other forms of self-motion create global motion patterns across our eyes. With the resulting stream of visual signals, how do we perceive ourselves as moving through a stable world? Although the neural mechanisms are largely unknown, human studies (Warren and Rushton, 2009) provide strong evidence that the visual system is capable of parsing the global motion into two components: one due to self-motion and the other due to independently moving objects. In the present study, we use computational modeling to investigate potential neural mechanisms for stabilizing visual perception during self-motion that build on neurophysiology of the middle temporal (MT) and medial superior temporal (MST) areas. One such mechanism leverages direction, speed, and disparity tuning of cells in dorsal MST (MSTd) to estimate the combined motion parallax and disparity signals attributed to the observer's self-motion. Feedback from the most active MSTd cell subpopulations suppresses motion signals in MT that locally match the preference of the MSTd cell in both parallax and disparity. This mechanism combined with local surround inhibition in MT allows the model to estimate self-motion while maintaining a sparse motion representation that is compatible with perceptual stability. A key consequence is that after signals compatible with the observer's self-motion are suppressed, the direction of independently moving objects is represented in a world-relative rather than observer-relative reference frame. Our analysis explicates how temporal dynamics and joint motion parallax-disparity tuning resolve the world-relative motion of moving objects and establish perceptual stability. Together, these mechanisms capture findings on the perception of object motion during self-motion.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The image integrated by our eyes as we move through our environment undergoes constant flux as trees, buildings, and other surroundings stream by us. If our view can change so radically from one moment to the next, how do we perceive a stable world? Although progress has been made in understanding how this works, little is known about the underlying brain mechanisms. We propose a computational solution whereby multiple brain areas communicate to suppress the motion attributed to our movement relative to the stationary world, which is often responsible for a large proportion of the flux across the visual field. We simulated the proposed neural mechanisms and tested model estimates using data from human perceptual studies.</p>

<p>Multiple insults to the brain lead to neuronal cell death, thus raising the question to what extent can lost neurons be replenished by adult neurogenesis. Here we focused on the hippocampus and especially the dentate gyrus (DG), a vulnerable brain region and one of the two sites where adult neuronal stem cells (NSCs) reside. While adult hippocampal neurogenesis was extensively studied with regard to its contribution to cognitive enhancement, we focused on their underestimated capability to repair a massively injured, nonfunctional DG. To address this issue, we inflicted substantial DG-specific damage in mice of either sex either by diphtheria toxin-based ablation of &gt;50% of mature DG granule cells (GCs) or by prolonged brain-specific VEGF overexpression culminating in extensive, highly selective loss of DG GCs (thereby also reinforcing the notion of selective DG vulnerability). The neurogenic system promoted effective regeneration by increasing NSCs proliferation/survival rates, restoring a nearly original DG mass, promoting proper rewiring of regenerated neurons to their afferent and efferent partners, and regaining of lost spatial memory. Notably, concomitantly with the natural age-related decline in the levels of neurogenesis, the regenerative capacity of the hippocampus also subsided with age. The study thus revealed an unappreciated regenerative potential of the young DG and suggests hippocampal NSCs as a critical reservoir enabling recovery from catastrophic DG damage.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Adult hippocampal neurogenesis has been extensively studied in the context of its role in cognitive enhancement, but whether, and to what extent can dentate gyrus (DG)-resident neural stem cells drive regeneration of an injured DG has remained unclear. Here we show that DG neurogenesis acts to replace lost neurons and restore lost functions even following massive (&gt;50%) neuronal loss. Age-related decline of neurogenesis is paralleled by a progressive decline of regenerative capacity. Considering also the exceptional vulnerability of the DG to insults, these findings provide a further rationale for maintaining DG neurogenesis in adult life.</p>

<p>Cortical circuit activity is shaped by the parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SST) interneurons that inhibit principal excitatory (EXC) neurons and the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) interneurons that suppress activation of other interneurons. To understand the molecular-genetic basis of functional specialization and identify potential drug targets specific to each neuron subtype, we performed a genome wide assessment of both gene expression and splicing across EXC, PV, SST and VIP neurons from male and female mouse brains. These results reveal numerous examples where neuron subtype-specific gene expression, as well as splice-isoform usage, can explain functional differences between neuron subtypes, including in presynaptic plasticity, postsynaptic receptor function, and synaptic connectivity specification. We provide a searchable web resource for exploring differential mRNA expression and splice form usage between excitatory, PV, SST, and VIP neurons (<a href="http://research-pub.gene.com/NeuronSubtypeTranscriptomes">http://research-pub.gene.com/NeuronSubtypeTranscriptomes</a>). This resource, combining a unique new dataset and novel application of analysis methods to multiple relevant datasets, identifies numerous potential drug targets for manipulating circuit function, reveals neuron subtype-specific roles for disease-linked genes, and is useful for understanding gene expression changes observed in human patient brains.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Understanding the basis of functional specialization of neuron subtypes and identifying drug targets for manipulating circuit function requires comprehensive information on cell-type-specific transcriptional profiles. We sorted excitatory neurons and key inhibitory neuron subtypes from mouse brains and assessed differential mRNA expression. We used a genome-wide analysis which not only examined differential gene expression levels but could also detect differences in splice isoform usage. This analysis reveals numerous examples of neuron subtype-specific isoform usage with functional importance, identifies potential drug targets, and provides insight into the neuron subtypes involved in psychiatric disease. We also apply our analysis to two other relevant datasets for comparison, and provide a searchable website for convenient access to the resource.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/5/944?rss=1">Activity Shapes Neural Circuit Form and Function: A Historical Perspective</a></h4>

<p>The brilliant and often prescient hypotheses of Ramon y Cajal have proven foundational for modern neuroscience, but his statement that "In adult centers the nerve paths are something fixed, ended, immutable ... " is an exception that did not stand the test of empirical study. Mechanisms of cellular and circuit-level plasticity continue to shape and reshape many regions of the adult nervous system long after the neurodevelopmental period. Initially focused on neurons alone, the field has followed a meteoric trajectory in understanding of activity-regulated neurodevelopment and ongoing neuroplasticity with an arc toward appreciating neuron–glial interactions and the role that each neural cell type plays in shaping adaptable neural circuity. In this review, as part of a celebration of the 50th anniversary of Society for Neuroscience, we provide a historical perspective, following this arc of inquiry from neuronal to neuron–glial mechanisms by which activity and experience modulate circuit structure and function. The scope of this consideration is broad, and it will not be possible to cover the wealth of knowledge about all aspects of activity-dependent circuit development and plasticity in depth.</p>

<p>Recovery after stroke is a multicellular process encompassing neurons, resident immune cells, and brain-invading cells. Stroke alters the gut microbiome, which in turn has considerable impact on stroke outcome. However, the mechanisms underlying gut–brain interaction and implications for long-term recovery are largely elusive. Here, we tested the hypothesis that short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), key bioactive microbial metabolites, are the missing link along the gut–brain axis and might be able to modulate recovery after experimental stroke. SCFA supplementation in the drinking water of male mice significantly improved recovery of affected limb motor function. Using <i>in vivo</i> wide-field calcium imaging, we observed that SCFAs induced altered contralesional cortex connectivity. This was associated with SCFA-dependent changes in spine and synapse densities. RNA sequencing of the forebrain cortex indicated a potential involvement of microglial cells in contributing to the structural and functional remodeling. Further analyses confirmed a substantial impact of SCFAs on microglial activation, which depended on the recruitment of T cells to the infarcted brain. Our findings identified that microbiota-derived SCFAs modulate poststroke recovery via effects on systemic and brain resident immune cells.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Previous studies have shown a bidirectional communication along the gut–brain axis after stroke. Stroke alters the gut microbiota composition, and in turn, microbiota dysbiosis has a substantial impact on stroke outcome by modulating the immune response. However, until now, the mediators derived from the gut microbiome affecting the gut-immune-brain axis and the molecular mechanisms involved in this process were unknown. Here, we demonstrate that short-chain fatty acids, fermentation products of the gut microbiome, are potent and proregenerative modulators of poststroke neuronal plasticity at various structural levels. We identified that this effect was mediated via circulating lymphocytes on microglial activation. These results identify short-chain fatty acids as a missing link along the gut–brain axis and as a potential therapeutic to improve recovery after stroke.</p>

<p>Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy has been causally linked to a constellation of neurodevelopmental deformities in the fetus resulting in a disease termed congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). Here we detail how ZIKV infection produces extensive neuropathology in the developing mouse brain and spinal cord of both sexes. Surprisingly, neuropathology differs depending on viral strain with a French Polynesian isolate producing primarily excitotoxicity and a Brazilian isolate being almost exclusively apoptotic but occurring over a prolonged period that is more likely to produce severe hypoplasia. We also show exposure can produce a characteristic pattern of infection that mirrors neuropathology and ultimately results in gross morphological deformities strikingly similar to CZS. This research provides a valuable mouse model mirroring the clinical course of disease that can be used to test potential therapies to improve treatment and gain a better understanding of the disabilities associated with CZS.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy has been causally linked to a constellation of neurodevelopmental deformities in the fetus resulting in a disease termed congenital Zika syndrome. Despite its devastating effects, very little is known about how ZIKV infection produces fetal neuropathology. Here we detail the temporal progression of ZIKV infection in the mouse brain and spinal cord resulting in massive neurodegeneration of infected regions. We also report a ZIKV strain from a region of Brazil with high levels of microcephaly (abnormally small head circumference) produces particularly devastating neuropathology.</p>

<p>Neurofibrillary tangles likely cause neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We demonstrate that the CX3CL1 C-terminal domain can upregulate neurogenesis, which may ameliorate neurodegeneration. Here we generated transgenic (Tg-CX3CL1) mice by overexpressing CX3CL1 in neurons. Tg-CX3CL1 mice exhibit enhanced neurogenesis in both subgranular and subventricular zones. This enhanced neurogenesis correlates well with elevated expression of TGF-β2 and TGF-β3, and activation of their downstream signaling molecule Smad2. Intriguingly, the enhanced adult neurogenesis was mitigated when Smad2 expression was deleted in neurons, supporting a role for the CX3CL1–TGF-β2/3–Smad2 pathway in the control of adult neurogenesis. When Tg-CX3CL1 mice were crossed with Alzheimer's PS19 mice, which overexpress a tau P301S mutation and exhibit age-dependent neurofibrillary tangles and neurodegeneration, overexpressed CX3CL1 in both male and female mice was sufficient to rescue the neurodegeneration, increase survival time, and improve cognitive function. Hence, we provide <i>in vivo</i> evidence that CX3CL1 is a strong activator of adult neurogenesis, and that it reduces neuronal loss and improves cognitive function in AD.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This study will be the first to demonstrate that enhanced neurogenesis by overexpressed CX3CL1 is mitigated by disruption of Smad2 signaling and is independent of its interaction with CX3CR1. Overexpression of CX3CL1 lengthens the life span of PS19 tau mice by enhancing adult neurogenesis while having minimal effect on tau pathology. Enhancing neuronal CX3CL1, mainly the C-terminal fragment, is a therapeutic strategy for blocking or reversing neuronal loss in Alzheimer's disease or related neurodegenerative disease patients.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/5/1120?rss=1">Integration of Motion and Form Cues for the Perception of Self-Motion in the Human Brain</a></h4>

<p>When moving around in the world, the human visual system uses both motion and form information to estimate the direction of self-motion (i.e., heading). However, little is known about cortical areas in charge of this task. This brain-imaging study addressed this question by using visual stimuli consisting of randomly distributed dot pairs oriented toward a locus on a screen (the form-defined focus of expansion [FoE]) but moved away from a different locus (the motion-defined FoE) to simulate observer translation. We first fixed the motion-defined FoE location and shifted the form-defined FoE location. We then made the locations of the motion- and the form-defined FoEs either congruent (at the same location in the display) or incongruent (on the opposite sides of the display). The motion- or the form-defined FoE shift was the same in the two types of stimuli, but the perceived heading direction shifted for the congruent, but not for the incongruent stimuli. Participants (both sexes) made a task-irrelevant (contrast discrimination) judgment during scanning. Searchlight and ROI-based multivoxel pattern analysis revealed that early visual areas V1, V2, and V3 responded to either the motion- or the form-defined FoE shift. After V3, only the dorsal areas V3a and V3B/KO responded to such shifts. Furthermore, area V3B/KO shows a significantly higher decoding accuracy for the congruent than the incongruent stimuli. Our results provide direct evidence showing that area V3B/KO does not simply respond to motion and form cues but integrates these two cues for the perception of heading.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Human survival relies on accurate perception of self-motion. The visual system uses both motion (optic flow) and form cues for the perception of the direction of self-motion (heading). Although human brain areas for processing optic flow and form structure are well identified, the areas responsible for integrating these two cues for the perception of self-motion remain unknown. We conducted fMRI experiments and used multivoxel pattern analysis technique to find human brain areas that can decode the shift in heading specified by each cue alone and the two cues combined. We found that motion and form cues are first processed in the early visual areas and then are likely integrated in the higher dorsal area V3B/KO for the final estimation of heading.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/5/1110?rss=1">Attention Networks in the Parietooccipital Cortex Modulate Activity of the Human Vestibular Cortex during Attentive Visual Processing</a></h4>

<p>Previous studies in human subjects reported that the parieto-insular vestibular cortex (PIVC), a core area of the vestibular cortex, is inhibited when visual processing is prioritized. However, it has remained unclear which networks in the brain modulate this inhibition of PIVC. Based on previous results showing that the inhibition of PIVC is strongly influenced by visual attention, we here examined whether attention networks in the parietooccipital cortex modulate the inhibition of PIVC. Using diffusion-weighted and resting-state fMRI in a group of female and male subjects, we found structural and functional connections between PIVC and the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), a major brain region of the cortical attention network. We then temporarily inhibited PPC by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and hypothesized that the modulatory influence of PPC over PIVC would be reduced; and, as a result, PIVC would be less inhibited. Subjects performed a visual attentional tracking task immediately after rTMS, and the inhibition of PIVC during attentive tracking was measured with fMRI. The results showed that the inhibition of PIVC during attentive tracking was less pronounced compared with sham rTMS. We also examined the effects of inhibitory rTMS over the occipital cortex and found that the visual-vestibular posterior insular cortex area was less activated during attentive tracking compared with sham rTMS or rTMS over PPC. Together, these results suggest that attention networks in the parietooccipital cortex modulate activity in core areas of the vestibular cortex during attentive visual processing.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Although multisensory integration is generally considered beneficial, it can become detrimental when cues from different senses are in conflict. The occurrence of such multisensory conflicts can be minimized by inhibiting core cortical areas of the subordinate sensory system (e.g., vestibular), thus reducing potential conflict with ongoing processing of the prevailing sensory (e.g., visual) cues. However, it has remained unclear which networks in the brain modulate the magnitude of inhibition of the subordinate sensory system. Here, by investigating the inhibition of the vestibular sensory system when visual processing is prioritized, we show that attention networks in the parietooccipital cortex modulate the magnitude of inhibition of the vestibular cortex.</p>

<p>Perception and motor control traditionally are studied separately. However, motor activity can serve as a scaffold to shape the sensory flow. This tight link between motor actions and sensing is particularly evident in active sensory systems. Here, we investigate how the weakly electric mormyrid fish <i>Gnathonemus petersii</i> of undetermined sex structure their sensing and motor behavior while learning a perceptual task. We find systematic adjustments of the motor behavior that correlate with an increased performance. Using a model to compute the electrosensory input, we show that these behavioral adjustments improve the sensory input. As we find low neuronal detection thresholds at the level of medullary electrosensory neurons, it seems that the behavior-driven improvements of the sensory input are highly suitable to overcome the sensory limitations, thereby increasing the sensory range. Our results show that motor control is an active component of sensory learning, demonstrating that a detailed understanding of contribution of motor actions to sensing is needed to understand even seemingly simple behaviors.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Motor-guided sensation and perception are intertwined, with motor behavior serving as a scaffold to shape the sensory input. We characterized how the weakly electric mormyrid fish <i>Gnathonemus petersii</i>, as it learns a perceptual task, restructures its sensorimotor behavior. We find that systematic adjustments of the motor behavior correlate with increased performance and a shift of the sensory attention of the animal. Analyzing the afferent electrosensory input shows that a significant gain in information results from these sensorimotor adjustments. Our results show that motor control can be an active component of sensory learning. Researching the sensory corollaries of motor control thus can be crucial to understand sensory sensation and perception under naturalistic conditions.</p>

<p>To efficiently learn optimal behavior in complex environments, humans rely on an interplay of learning and attention. Healthy aging has been shown to independently affect both of these functions. Here, we investigate how reinforcement learning and selective attention interact during learning from trial and error across age groups. We acquired behavioral and fMRI data from older and younger adults (male and female) performing two probabilistic learning tasks with varying attention demands. Although learning in the unidimensional task did not differ across age groups, older adults performed worse than younger adults in the multidimensional task, which required high levels of selective attention. Computational modeling showed that choices of older adults are better predicted by reinforcement learning than Bayesian inference, and that older adults rely more on reinforcement learning-based predictions than younger adults. Conversely, a higher proportion of younger adults' choices was predicted by a computationally demanding Bayesian approach. In line with the behavioral findings, we observed no group differences in reinforcement-learning related fMRI activation. Specifically, prediction-error activation in the nucleus accumbens was similar across age groups, and numerically higher in older adults. However, activation in the default mode was less suppressed in older adults in for higher attentional task demands, and the level of suppression correlated with behavioral performance. Our results indicate that healthy aging does not significantly impair simple reinforcement learning. However, in complex environments, older adults rely more heavily on suboptimal reinforcement-learning strategies supported by the ventral striatum, whereas younger adults use attention processes supported by cortical networks.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Changes in the way that healthy human aging affects how we learn to optimally behave are not well understood; it has been suggested that age-related declines in dopaminergic function may impair older adult's ability to learn from reinforcement. In the present fMRI experiment, we show that learning and nucleus accumbens activation in a simple unidimensional reinforcement-learning task was not significantly affected by age. However, in a more complex multidimensional task, older adults showed worse performance and relied more on reinforcement-learning strategies than younger adults, while failing to disengage their default-mode network during learning. These results imply that older adults are only impaired in reinforcement learning if they additionally need to learn which dimensions of the environment are currently important.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/5/1066?rss=1">The Effects of Population Tuning and Trial-by-Trial Variability on Information Encoding and Behavior</a></h4>

<p>Identifying the features of population responses that are relevant to the amount of information encoded by neuronal populations is a crucial step toward understanding population coding. Statistical features, such as tuning properties, individual and shared response variability, and global activity modulations, could all affect the amount of information encoded and modulate behavioral performance. We show that two features in particular affect information: the modulation of population responses across conditions (population signal) and the inverse population covariability along the modulation axis (projected precision). We demonstrate that fluctuations of these two quantities are correlated with fluctuations of behavioral performance in various tasks and brain regions consistently across 4 monkeys (1 female and 1 male <i>Macaca mulatta</i>; and 2 male <i>Macaca fascicularis</i>). In contrast, fluctuations in mean correlations among neurons and global activity have negligible or inconsistent effects on the amount of information encoded and behavioral performance. We also show that differential correlations reduce the amount of information encoded in finite populations by reducing projected precision. Our results are consistent with predictions of a model that optimally decodes population responses to produce behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The last two or three decades of research have seen hot debates about what features of population tuning and trial-by-trial variability influence the information carried by a population of neurons, with some camps arguing, for instance, that mean pairwise correlations or global fluctuations are important while other camps report opposite results. In this study, we identify the most important features of neural population responses that determine the amount of encoded information and behavioral performance by combining analytic calculations with a novel nonparametric method that allows us to isolate the effects of different statistical features. We tested our hypothesis on 4 macaques, three decision-making tasks, and two brain areas. The predictions of our theory were in agreement with the experimental data.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/5/1053?rss=1">Lip-Reading Enables the Brain to Synthesize Auditory Features of Unknown Silent Speech</a></h4>

<p>Lip-reading is crucial for understanding speech in challenging conditions. But how the brain extracts meaning from, silent, visual speech is still under debate. Lip-reading in silence activates the auditory cortices, but it is not known whether such activation reflects immediate synthesis of the corresponding auditory stimulus or imagery of unrelated sounds. To disentangle these possibilities, we used magnetoencephalography to evaluate how cortical activity in 28 healthy adult humans (17 females) entrained to the auditory speech envelope and lip movements (mouth opening) when listening to a spoken story without visual input (audio-only), and when seeing a silent video of a speaker articulating another story (video-only). In video-only, auditory cortical activity entrained to the absent auditory signal at frequencies &lt;1 Hz more than to the seen lip movements. This entrainment process was characterized by an auditory-speech-to-brain delay of ~70 ms in the left hemisphere, compared with ~20 ms in audio-only. Entrainment to mouth opening was found in the right angular gyrus at &lt;1 Hz, and in early visual cortices at 1–8 Hz. These findings demonstrate that the brain can use a silent lip-read signal to synthesize a coarse-grained auditory speech representation in early auditory cortices. Our data indicate the following underlying oscillatory mechanism: seeing lip movements first modulates neuronal activity in early visual cortices at frequencies that match articulatory lip movements; the right angular gyrus then extracts slower features of lip movements, mapping them onto the corresponding speech sound features; this information is fed to auditory cortices, most likely facilitating speech parsing.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Lip-reading consists in decoding speech based on visual information derived from observation of a speaker's articulatory facial gestures. Lip-reading is known to improve auditory speech understanding, especially when speech is degraded. Interestingly, lip-reading in silence still activates the auditory cortices, even when participants do not know what the absent auditory signal should be. However, it was uncertain what such activation reflected. Here, using magnetoencephalographic recordings, we demonstrate that it reflects fast synthesis of the auditory stimulus rather than mental imagery of unrelated, speech or non-speech, sounds. Our results also shed light on the oscillatory dynamics underlying lip-reading.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/5/1042?rss=1">Taste Quality Representation in the Human Brain</a></h4>

<p>In the mammalian brain, the insula is the primary cortical substrate involved in the perception of taste. Recent imaging studies in rodents have identified a "gustotopic" organization in the insula, whereby distinct insula regions are selectively responsive to one of the five basic tastes. However, numerous studies in monkeys have reported that gustatory cortical neurons are broadly-tuned to multiple tastes, and tastes are not represented in discrete spatial locations. Neuroimaging studies in humans have thus far been unable to discern between these two models, though this may be because of the relatively low spatial resolution used in taste studies to date. In the present study, we examined the spatial representation of taste within the human brain using ultra-high resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at high magnetic field strength (7-tesla). During scanning, male and female participants tasted sweet, salty, sour, and tasteless liquids, delivered via a custom-built MRI-compatible tastant-delivery system. Our univariate analyses revealed that all tastes (vs tasteless) activated primary taste cortex within the bilateral dorsal mid-insula, but no brain region exhibited a consistent preference for any individual taste. However, our multivariate searchlight analyses were able to reliably decode the identity of distinct tastes within those mid-insula regions, as well as brain regions involved in affect and reward, such as the striatum, orbitofrontal cortex, and amygdala. These results suggest that taste quality is not represented topographically, but by a distributed population code, both within primary taste cortex as well as regions involved in processing the hedonic and aversive properties of taste.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The insula is the primary cortical substrate involved in taste perception, yet some question remains as to whether this region represents distinct tastes topographically or via a population code. Using high field (7-tesla), high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging in humans, we examined the representation of different tastes delivered during scanning. All tastes activated primary taste cortex within the bilateral mid-insula, but no brain region exhibited any consistent taste preference. However, multivariate analyses reliably decoded taste quality within the bilateral mid-insula as well as the striatum, orbitofrontal cortex, and bilateral amygdala. This suggests that taste quality is represented by a spatial population code within regions involved in sensory and appetitive properties of taste.</p>

<p>The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a mesocorticolimbic structure that integrates cognitive, emotional and motor functions. Although its role in psychiatric disorders is widely acknowledged, the understanding of its circuitry is not complete. Here, we combined optogenetic and whole-cell recordings to draw a functional portrait of excitatory disambiguated synapses onto D1 and D2 medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the adult male mouse NAc core. Comparing synaptic properties of ventral hippocampus (vHipp), basolateral amygdala (BLA) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) inputs revealed a hierarchy of synaptic inputs that depends on the identity of the postsynaptic target MSN. Thus, the BLA is the dominant excitatory pathway onto D1 MSNs (BLA &gt; PFC = vHipp) while PFC inputs dominate D2 MSNs (PFC &gt; vHipp &gt; BLA). We also tested the hypothesis that endocannabinoids endow excitatory circuits with pathway- and cell-specific plasticity. Thus, whereas CB1 receptors (CB1R) uniformly depress excitatory pathways regardless of MSNs identity, TRPV1 receptors (TRPV1R) bidirectionally control inputs onto the NAc core in a pathway-specific manner. Finally, we show that the interplay of TRPV1R/CB1R shapes plasticity at BLA-NAc synapses. Together these data shed new light on synapse and circuit specificity in the adult NAc core and illustrate how endocannabinoids contribute to pathway-specific synaptic plasticity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We examined the impact of connections from the ventral hippocampus (vHipp,) basolateral amygdala (BLA) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) onto identified medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the adult accumbens core. We found BLA inputs were strongest at D1 MSNs while PFC inputs dominate D2 MSNs. Pathway- and cell-specific circuit control was also facilitated by endocannabinoids that endow bidirectional synaptic plasticity at identified BLA-NAc synapses. These data provide mechanistic insights on synapse and circuit specificity in the adult NAc core.</p>

<p>Vocal communication relies on the ability of listeners to identify, process, and respond to vocal sounds produced by others in complex environments. To accurately recognize these signals, animals' auditory systems must robustly represent acoustic features that distinguish vocal sounds from other environmental sounds. Vocalizations typically have spectral structure; power regularly fluctuates along the frequency axis, creating spectral contrast. Spectral contrast is closely related to harmonicity, which refers to spectral power peaks occurring at integer multiples of a fundamental frequency. Although both spectral contrast and harmonicity typify natural sounds, they may differ in salience for communication behavior and engage distinct neural mechanisms. Therefore, it is important to understand which of these properties of vocal sounds underlie the neural processing and perception of vocalizations.</p>
<p>Here, we test the importance of vocalization-typical spectral features in behavioral recognition and neural processing of vocal sounds, using male zebra finches. We show that behavioral responses to natural and synthesized vocalizations rely on the presence of discrete frequency components, but not on harmonic ratios between frequencies. We identify a specific population of neurons in primary auditory cortex that are sensitive to the spectral resolution of vocal sounds. We find that behavioral and neural response selectivity is explained by sensitivity to spectral contrast rather than harmonicity. This selectivity emerges within the cortex; it is absent in the thalamorecipient region and present in the deep output region. Further, deep-region neurons that are contrast-sensitive show distinct temporal responses and selectivity for modulation density compared with unselective neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Auditory coding and perception are critical for vocal communication. Auditory neurons must encode acoustic features that distinguish vocalizations from other sounds in the environment and generate percepts that direct behavior. The acoustic features that drive neural and behavioral selectivity for vocal sounds are unknown, however. Here, we show that vocal response behavior scales with stimulus spectral contrast but not with harmonicity, in songbirds. We identify a distinct population of auditory cortex neurons in which response selectivity parallels behavioral selectivity. This neural response selectivity is explained by sensitivity to spectral contrast rather than to harmonicity. Our findings inform the understanding of how the auditory system encodes socially-relevant signals via detection of an acoustic feature that is ubiquitous in vocalizations.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Survivors of prolonged (&gt; 2 weeks) post‐cardiac arrest (CA) coma are expected to remain permanently disabled. We aimed to investigate three outlier patients who ultimately achieved independent functional outcomes after prolonged post‐CA coma to identify electroencephalographic (EEG) markers of their recovery potential. For validation purposes, we also aimed to evaluate these markers in an independent cohort of post‐CA patients.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We identified three patients with late recovery from coma (17‐37 days) following CA who recovered to functionally independent behavioral levels. We performed spectral power analyses of available EEGs during prominent burst suppression patterns (BSP) present in all three patients. Using identical methods, we also assessed the relationship of intra‐burst spectral power and outcomes in a prospectively enrolled cohort of post‐CA patients. We performed chart reviews of common clinical, imaging, EEG prognostic variables and clinical outcomes for all patients.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>All three patients with late recovery from coma lacked evidence of overwhelming cortical injury but demonstrated prominent BSP on EEG. Spectral analyses revealed a prominent theta (~4‐7Hz) feature dominating the bursts during BSP in these patients. In the prospective cohort, similar intra‐burst theta spectral features were evident in patients with favorable outcomes; patients with BSP and unfavorable outcomes showed either no features, transient burst features or decreasing intra‐burst frequencies with time.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>BSP with theta (~4‐7Hz) peak intra‐burst spectral power after CA may index a recovery potential. We discuss our results in the context of optimizing metabolic substrate availability and stimulating the cortico‐thalamic system during recovery from prolonged post‐CA coma.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>GM2‐gangliosidosis are lysosomal diseases due to biallelic mutations in the <i>HEXA</i> (Tay‐Sachs disease: TS) or <i>HEXB</i> (Sandhoff disease: SD) genes, with subsequent low hexosaminidase(s) activity. Most patients have childhood onset, but some experience the first symptoms during adolescence/adulthood. This study aims to clarify the natural history of adult patients with GM2‐gangliosidosis.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We retrospectively described 12 patients from a French cohort and 45 patients from the literature.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We observed four typical presentations: (1) lower motoneuron disorder responsible for proximal lower limb weakness that subsequently expanded to the upper limbs, (2) cerebellar ataxia, (3) psychosis and/or severe mood disorder (only in the TS patients), and (4) a complex phenotype mixing the above three manifestations. The psoas was the first and most affected muscle in the lower limbs, whereas the triceps and interosseous were predominantly involved in the upper limbs. A longitudinal study of compound motor action potentials showed a progressive decrease in all nerves, with different kinetics. Sensory potentials were sometimes abnormally low, mainly in the SD patients. The main brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) feature was cerebellar atrophy, even in patients without cerebellar symptoms or leukodystrophy. The prognosis was mainly related to gait disorder, as we showed that beyond 20 years of disease evolution, half of the patients were wheelchair users.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Improved knowledge of GM2‐gangliosidosis in adults will help clinicians achieve correct diagnoses and better inform patients on the evolution and prognosis. It may also contribute to defining proper outcome measures when testing emerging therapies.</p>

<p>Neurostimulation using weak electric fields has generated excitement in
recent years due to its potential as a medical intervention. However, study of
this stimulation modality has been hampered by inconsistent results and large
variability within and between studies. In order to begin addressing this
variability we need to properly characterise the impact of the current on the
underlying neuron populations. To develop and test a computational model
capable of capturing the impact of electric field stimulation on networks of
neurons. We construct a cortical tissue model with distinct layers and explicit
neuron morphologies. We then apply a model of electrical stimulation and carry
out multiple test case simulations. The cortical slice model is compared to
experimental literature and shown to capture the main features of the
electrophysiological response to stimulation. Namely, the model showed 1) a
similar level of depolarisation in individual pyramidal neurons, 2)
acceleration of intrinsic oscillations, and 3) retention of the spatial profile
of oscillations in different layers. We then apply alternative electric fields
to demonstrate how the model can capture differences in neuronal responses to
the electric field. We demonstrate that the tissue response is dependent on
layer depth, the angle of the apical dendrite relative to the field, and
stimulation strength. We present publicly available computational modelling
software that predicts the neuron network population response to electric field
stimulation.

<p>Neural coding is one of the central questions in systems neuroscience for
understanding how the brain processes stimulus from the environment, moreover,
it is also a cornerstone for designing algorithms of brain-machine interface,
where decoding incoming stimulus is highly demanded for better performance of
physical devices. Traditionally researchers have focused on functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) data as the neural signals of interest for decoding
visual scenes. However, our visual perception operates in a fast time scale of
millisecond in terms of an event termed neural spike. There are few studies of
decoding by using spikes. Here we fulfill this aim by developing a novel
decoding framework based on deep neural networks, named spike-image decoder
(SID), for reconstructing natural visual scenes, including static images and
dynamic videos, from experimentally recorded spikes of a population of retinal
ganglion cells. The SID is an end-to-end decoder with one end as neural spikes
and the other end as images, which can be trained directly such that visual
scenes are reconstructed from spikes in a highly accurate fashion. Our SID also
outperforms on the reconstruction of visual stimulus compared to existing fMRI
decoding models. In addition, with the aid of a spike encoder, we show that SID
can be generalized to arbitrary visual scenes by using the image datasets of
MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100. Furthermore, with a pre-trained SID, one can
decode any dynamic videos to achieve real-time encoding and decoding of visual
scenes by spikes. Altogether, our results shed new light on neuromorphic
computing for artificial visual systems, such as event-based visual cameras and
visual neuroprostheses.

<p>The bifunctional enzyme soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is found in all regions of the brain. It has two different catalytic activities, each assigned to one of its terminal domains: the C-terminal domain presents hydrolase activity, whereas the N-terminal domain exhibits phosphatase activity. The enzyme’s C-terminal domain has been linked to cardiovascular protective and anti-inflammatory effects. Cholesterol-related disorders have been associated with sEH, which plays an important role in the metabolism of cholesterol precursors. The role of sEH’s phosphatase activity has been so far poorly investigated in the context of the central nervous system physiology. Given that brain cholesterol disturbances play a role in the onset of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) as well as of other neurodegenerative diseases, understanding the functions of this enzyme could provide pivotal information on the pathophysiology of these conditions. Moreover, the sEH phosphatase domain could represent an underexplored target for drug design and therapeutic strategies to improve symptoms related to neurodegenerative diseases. This review discusses the function of sEH in mammals and its protein structure and catalytic activities. Particular attention was given to the distribution and expression of sEH in the human brain, deepening into the enzyme’s phosphatase activity and its participation in brain cholesterol synthesis. Finally, this review focused on the metabolism of cholesterol and its association with AD.</p>

<p>The physical continuity of axons over long cellular distances poses challenges for their maintenance. One organelle that faces this challenge is endoplasmic reticulum (ER); unlike other intracellular organelles, this forms a physically continuous network throughout the cell, with a single membrane and a single lumen. In axons, ER is mainly smooth, forming a tubular network with occasional sheets or cisternae and low amounts of rough ER. It has many potential roles: lipid biosynthesis, glucose homeostasis, a Ca<sup>2+</sup> store, protein export, and contacting and regulating other organelles. This tubular network structure is determined by ER-shaping proteins, mutations in some of which are causative for neurodegenerative disorders such as hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). While axonal ER shares many features with the tubular ER network in other contexts, these features must be adapted to the long and narrow dimensions of axons. ER appears to be physically continuous throughout axons, over distances that are enormous on a subcellular scale. It is therefore a potential channel for long-distance or regional communication within neurons, independent of action potentials or physical transport of cargos, but involving its physiological roles such as Ca<sup>2+</sup> or organelle homeostasis. Despite its apparent stability, axonal ER is highly dynamic, showing features like anterograde and retrograde transport, potentially reflecting continuous fusion and breakage of the network. Here we discuss the transport processes that must contribute to this dynamic behavior of ER. We also discuss the model that these processes underpin a homeostatic process that ensures both enough ER to maintain continuity of the network and repair breaks in it, but not too much ER that might disrupt local cellular physiology. Finally, we discuss how failure of ER organization in axons could lead to axon degenerative diseases, and how a requirement for ER continuity could make distal axons most susceptible to degeneration in conditions that disrupt ER continuity.</p>

<p>To investigate the potential applications and the molecular mechanisms of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on cognitive impairment in a vascular dementia (VD) animal model. Sprague-Dawley rats were used in this study. VD rat model was induced by modified permanent bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (2-VO) approach. Anodal tDCS was applied to the animals. Morris water maze was used to analyze spatial memory and navigation ability. The pathological changes in the hippocampal CA1 region and cerebral cortex were examined via Hematoxylin-Eosin staining. The rats were sacrificed for the measurement of the level of superoxide (SOD), glutathione (GSH), reactive oxidative species (ROS), malondialdehyd (MDA), Interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α level in the hippocampus. Western blot was carried out to measure the hippocampal expression of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC-3) and p62. Rats with VD have decreased number of neurons in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, as well as worse cognitive impairment. The proliferation of activated microglia and astroglia, accompanied with attenuation of myelination were observed in the white matter about 1 month after 2-VO operation. These abnormalities were significantly ameliorated by tDCS treatment. Further study revealed that anodal tDCS could suppress the MDA and ROS level, while enhance the SOD and GSH level to reduce the oxidative stress. Anodal tDCS could inhibit hypoperfusion-induced IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α expression to attenuate inflammatory response in hippocampus. Moreover, anodal tDCS treatment could alleviate autophagy level. The study has demonstrated a possible therapeutic role of tDCS in the treatment of cognitive impairment in VD.</p>

<p>Early life stress can exert detrimental or beneficial effects on neural development and postnatal behavior depending on the timing, duration, strength, and ability to control the stressors. In this study, we utilized a maternal and social deprivation (MSD) model to investigate the effects of early life stress on neural stem cells (NSCs) and neurogenesis in the adult brain. We found that MSD during the stress-hyporesponsive period (SHRP) (early-MSD), when corticosterone secretion is suppressed, increased the size of the NSC population, whereas the same stress beyond the SHRP abrogated these effects. Early-MSD enhanced neurogenesis not only in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, one of the classic neurogenic regions, but also in the amygdala. In addition, mice exposed to early-MSD exhibited a reduction in amygdala/hippocampus-dependent fear memory. These results suggest that animals exposed to early life stress during the SHRP have reinforced stress resilience to cope with perceived stressors to maintain a normal homeostatic state.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00018">A Role of Cholesterol in Modulating the Binding of α-Synuclein to Synaptic-Like Vesicles</a></h4>

<p>α-Synuclein (αS) is a presynaptic protein whose aggregation is associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Although the physiological function of αS is still unclear, several lines of evidence indicate that this protein may play a role in the trafficking of synaptic vesicles (SVs) during neurotransmitter release, a task associated with its ability to bind SVs and promote their clustering. It is therefore crucial to identify the cellular factors that modulate this process. To address this question, using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy we have characterized the role of cholesterol, a major component of the membrane of SVs, in the binding of αS with synaptic-like vesicles. Our results indicate that cholesterol can act as a modulator of the overall affinity of αS for SVs by reducing the local affinity of the region spanning residues 65–97 in the non-amyloid-β component (NAC) of the protein. The increased population of bound states that expose the region 65–97 to the solvent was found to induce stronger vesicle-vesicle interactions by αS. These results provide evidence that cholesterol modulates the clustering of synaptic vesicles induced by (α)S, and supports the role of the disorder-to-order equilibrium of the NAC region in the modulation of the biological properties of the membrane-bound state of αS.</p>

<p>Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is associated with high morbidity and mortality, mainly in childhood. Our aim was to evaluate the effects of postnatal ETS exposure in the brain 2-deoxy-2-[<sup>18</sup>F]-fluoro-D-glucose (<sup>18</sup>F-FDG) uptake of mice by positron emission tomography (PET) neuroimaging in a longitudinal study. C57BL/6J mice were exposed to ETS that was generated from 3R4F cigarettes from postnatal day 3 (P3) to P14. PET analyses were performed in male and female mice during infancy (P15), adolescence (P35), and adulthood (P65). We observed that ETS exposure decreased <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake in the whole brain, both left and right hemispheres, and frontal cortex in both male and female infant mice, while female infant mice exposed to ETS showed decreased <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake in the cerebellum. In addition, all mice showed reduced <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake in infancy, compared to adulthood in all analyzed VOIs. In adulthood, ETS exposure during the early postnatal period decreased brain <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake in adult male mice in the cortex, striatum, hippocampus, cingulate cortex, and thalamus when compared to control group. ETS induced an increase in <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake in adult female mice when compared to control group in the brainstem and cingulate cortex. Moreover, male ETS-exposed animals showed decreased <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake when compared to female ETS-exposed in the whole brain, brainstem, cortex, left amygdala, striatum, hippocampus, cingulate cortex, basal forebrain and septum, thalamus, hypothalamus, and midbrain. The present study shows that several brain regions are vulnerable to ETS exposure during the early postnatal period and these effects on <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake are observed even a long time after the last exposure. This study corroborates our previous findings, strengthening the idea that exposure to tobacco smoke in a critical period interferes with brain development of mice from late infancy to early adulthood.</p>

<p>Although the basis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) etiology remains unknown, oxidative stress (OS) has been recognized as a prodromal factor associated to its progression. OS refers to an imbalance between oxidant and antioxidant systems, which usually consist in an overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) which overwhelms the intrinsic antioxidant defenses. Due to this increased production of ROS and RNS, several biological functions such as glucose metabolism or synaptic activity are impaired. In AD, growing evidence links the ROS-mediated damages with molecular targets including mitochondrial dynamics and function, protein quality control system, and autophagic pathways, affecting the proteostasis balance. In this scenario, OS should be considered as not only a major feature in the pathophysiology of AD but also a potential target to combat the progression of the disease. In this review, we will discuss the role of OS in mitochondrial dysfunction, protein quality control systems, and autophagy associated to AD and suggest innovative therapeutic strategies based on a better understanding of the role of OS and proteostasis.</p>

<p>Iron is an essential transition metal for numerous biologic processes in mammals. Iron metabolism is regulated via several coordination mechanisms including absorption, utilization, recycling, and storage. Iron dyshomeostasis can result in intracellular iron retention, thereby damaging cells, tissues, and organs through free oxygen radical generation. Numerous studies have shown that brain iron overload is involved in the pathological mechanism of neurodegenerative disease including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Ferroptosis, a newly defined iron-dependent form of cell death, which is distinct from apoptosis, necrosis, autophagy, and other forms of cell death, may provide us a new viewpoint. Here, we set out to summarize the current knowledge of iron metabolism and ferroptosis, and review the contributions of iron and ferroptosis to AD.</p>

<p>Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is a debilitating condition estimated to impact at least 1 million individuals in the United States, however there persists controversy about its existence. Machine learning algorithms have become a powerful methodology for evaluating multi-regional areas of fMRI activation that can classify disease phenotype from sedentary control. Uncovering objective biomarkers such as an fMRI pattern is important for lending credibility to diagnosis of CFS. fMRI scans were evaluated for 69 patients (38 CFS and 31 Control) taken before (Day 1) and after (Day 2) a submaximal exercise test while undergoing the n-back memory paradigm. A predictive model was created by grouping fMRI voxels into the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas, splitting the data into a training and testing dataset, and feeding these inputs into a logistic regression to evaluate differences between CFS and control. Model results were cross-validated 10 times to ensure accuracy. Model results were able to differentiate CFS from sedentary controls at a 80% accuracy on Day 1 and 76% accuracy on Day 2 (Table 3). Recursive features selection identified 29 ROI's that significantly distinguished CFS from control on Day 1 and 28 ROI's on Day 2 with 10 regions of overlap shared with Day 1 (Figure 3). These 10 shared regions included the putamen, inferior frontal gyrus, orbital (F3O), supramarginal gyrus (SMG), temporal pole; superior temporal gyrus (T1P) and caudate ROIs. This study was able to uncover a pattern of activated neurological regions that differentiated CFS from Control. This pattern provides a first step toward developing fMRI as a diagnostic biomarker and suggests this methodology could be emulated for other disorders. We concluded that a logistic regression model performed on fMRI data significantly differentiated CFS from Control.</p>

<p>Modality-invariant categorical representations, i.e., shared representation, is thought to play a key role in learning to categorize multi-modal information. We have investigated how a bimodal autoencoder can form a shared representation in an unsupervised manner with multi-modal data. We explored whether altering the depth of the network and mixing the multi-modal inputs at the input layer affect the development of the shared representations. Based on the activation of units in the hidden layers, we classified them into four different types: visual cells, auditory cells, inconsistent visual and auditory cells, and consistent visual and auditory cells. Our results show that the number and quality of the last type (i.e., shared representation) significantly differ depending on the depth of the network and are enhanced when the network receives mixed inputs as opposed to separate inputs for each modality, as occurs in typical two-stage frameworks. In the present work, we present a way to utilize information theory to understand the abstract representations formed in the hidden layers of the network. We believe that such an information theoretic approach could potentially provide insights into the development of more efficient and cost-effective ways to train neural networks using qualitative measures of the representations that cannot be captured by analyzing only the final outputs of the networks.</p>

<p>Electrical kindling, repeated brain stimulation eventually resulting in seizures, is widely used as an animal model of epileptogenesis and epilepsy. However, the stimulation electrode used for electric kindling targets unknown neuronal populations and may introduce tissue damage and inflammation. Optogenetics can be used to circumvent these shortcomings by permitting millisecond control of activity in genetically defined neurons without gross injury or inflammation. Here we describe an easy step-by-step protocol for optogenetic kindling – optokindling – by which seizures are eventually elicited in initially healthy mice through repeated light stimulation of neurons expressing Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2). Chronic EEG recordings may be performed over large time scales to monitor activity while video camera monitoring may be used to assess the behavioral severity of seizures. In conclusion, with optokindling, neuroscientists can elucidate the circuit changes that underpin epilepsy while minimizing the contribution of confounding factors such as brain damage and inflammation.</p>

<p>Müller cells are the predominant glial elements in the retina, extending vertically across this structure, and they fulfill a wealth support roles that are critical for neurons. Alterations to the behavior and phenotype of Muüller glia are often seen in animal models of retinal degeneration and in retinal tissue from patients with a variety of retinal disorders. Thus, elucidating the mechanisms underlying the development of retinal diseases would help better understand the cellular processes involved in such pathological changes. Studies into Muüller cell activity in vitro have been hindered by the difficulty in obtaining pure cell populations and the tendency of these cells to rapidly differentiate in culture. Most protocols currently used to isolate Müller glia use neonatal or embryonic tissue but here, we report an optimized protocol that facilitates the reliable and straightforward isolation and culture of Müller cells from adult pigs, rats and mice. The protocol described here provides an efficient method for the rapid isolation of adult mammalian Müller cells, which represents a reliable platform to study therapeutic targets and to test the effects of drugs that might combat retinal diseases.</p>

<p>An inverse association may exist between cancers and neurodegenerative diseases, although convenient biomarkers for verifying this inverse association are lacking. Plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a novel biomarker for neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but it has not been measured in patients with cancers, such as gastric cancer (GC). We aimed to explore whether plasma NfL could be a biomarker for GC and AD and whether an inverse association of NfL exists between GC and AD. In this study, plasma NfL levels of 60 normal controls (NC), 91 GC subjects, and 74 AD subjects were measured by a highly sensitive single-molecule array assay. We found that GC subjects expressed lower plasma NfL levels but AD subjects expressed higher plasma NfL levels than NCs. After controlling for confounding factors, plasma NfL levels in the GC group were associated with serum tumor marker levels, and plasma NfL levels in the AD group were associated with cognitive performance and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pathological marker levels. Across the entire cohort, plasma NfL levels were associated with cognitive performance, CSF pathological marker levels and serum tumor marker levels. These results suggest thatplasma NfL may be a potential biomarker for GC and AD and may be convenient for evaluating the inverse association between cancers and neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<p>The alteration of the functional topological organization in subcortical ischemic vascular cognitive impairment with no dementia (SIVCIND) patients has been illuminated by previous neuroimaging studies. However, in regard to the changes in the structural connectivity of brain networks, little has been reported. In this study, a total of 27 subjects, consisting of 13 SIVCIND patients, and 14 normal controls, were recruited. Each of the structural connectivity networks was constructed by diffusion tensor tractography. Subsequently, graph theory, and network-based statistics (NBS) were employed to analyze the whole-brain mean factional anisotropy matrix. After removing the factor of age, gender, and duration of formal education, the clustering coefficients (C<sub>p</sub>) and global efficiency (E<sub>glob</sub>) were significantly decreased and the mean path length (L<sub>p</sub>) was significantly increased in SIVCIND patients compared with normal controls. Using the combination of four network topological parameters as the classification feature, a classification accuracy of 78% was obtained by leave-one-out cross-validation for all subjects with a sensitivity of 69% and a specificity of 86%. Moreover, we also found decreased structural connections in the SIVCIND patients, which mainly concerned fronto-occipital, fronto-subcortical, and tempo-occipital connections (NBS corrected, p &lt; 0.01). Additionally, significantly altered nodal centralities were found in several brain regions of the SIVCIND patients, mainly located in the prefrontal, subcortical, and temporal cortices. These results suggest that cognitive impairment in SIVCIND patients is associated with disrupted topological organization and provide structural evidence for developing reliable biomarkers related to cognitive decline in SIVCIND.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/52623">The p75 neurotrophin receptor in AgRP neurons is necessary for homeostatic feeding and food anticipation</a></h4>

Networks of neurons control feeding and activity patterns by integrating internal metabolic signals of energy balance with external environmental cues such as time-of-day. Proper circadian alignment of feeding behavior is necessary to prevent metabolic disease, and thus it is imperative that molecular players that maintain neuronal coordination of energy homeostasis are identified. Here, we demonstrate that mice lacking the p75 neurotrophin receptor, p75NTR, decrease their feeding and food anticipatory behavior (FAA) in response to daytime, but not nighttime, restricted feeding. These effects lead to increased weight loss, but do not require p75NTR during development. Instead, p75NTR is required for fasting-induced activation of neurons within the arcuate hypothalamus. Indeed, p75NTR specifically in AgRP neurons is required for FAA in response to daytime restricted feeding. These findings establish p75NTR as a novel regulator gating behavioral response to food scarcity and time-of-day dependence of circadian food anticipation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/51636">SIRT6 is a DNA double-strand break sensor</a></h4>

DNA double strand breaks are the most deleterious type of DNA damage. In this work, we show that SIRT6 directly recognizes DNA damage through a tunnel-like structure, with high affinity for double strand breaks. SIRT6 relocates to sites of damage independently of signalling and known sensors. It activates downstream signalling for double strand break repair by triggering ATM recruitment, H2AX phosphorylation and the recruitment of proteins of Homologous Recombination and Non-Homologous End Joining pathways. Our findings indicate that SIRT6 plays a previously uncharacterized role as a DNA damage sensor, a critical factor in initiating the DNA damage response (DDR). Moreover, other Sirtuins share some DSB binding capacity and DDR activation. SIRT6 activates the DDR before the repair pathway is chosen, and prevents genomic instability. Our findings place SIRT6 as a sensor of DSB, and pave the road to dissecting the contributions of distinct double strand break sensors in downstream signalling.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/51493">Bacterial interspecies interactions modulate pH-mediated antibiotic tolerance</a></h4>

Predicting antibiotic efficacy within microbial communities remains highly challenging. Interspecies interactions can impact antibiotic activity through many mechanisms, including alterations to bacterial physiology. Here, we studied synthetic communities constructed from the core members of the fruit fly gut microbiota. Co-culturing of <i>Lactobacillus plantarum </i>with <i>Acetobacter </i>species altered its tolerance to the transcriptional inhibitor rifampin. By measuring key metabolites and environmental pH, we determined that <i>Acetobacter </i>species counter the acidification driven by <i>L. plantarum</i> production of lactate. Shifts in pH were sufficient to modulate <i>L. plantarum </i>tolerance to rifampin and the translational inhibitor erythromycin. A reduction in lag time exiting stationary phase was linked to <i>L. plantarum </i>tolerance to rifampicin, opposite to a previously identified mode of tolerance to ampicillin in <i>E. coli</i>. This mechanistic understanding of the coupling among interspecies interactions, environmental pH, and antibiotic tolerance enables future predictions of growth and the effects of antibiotics in more complex communities.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/51221">Notochord vacuoles absorb compressive bone growth during zebrafish spine formation</a></h4>

The vertebral column or spine assembles around the notochord rod which contains a core made of large vacuolated cells. Each vacuolated cell possesses a single ﬂuid-ﬁlled vacuole, and loss or fragmentation of these vacuoles in zebrafish leads to spine kinking. Here, we identified a mutation in the kinase gene <i>dstyk</i> that causes fragmentation of notochord vacuoles and a severe congenital scoliosis-like phenotype in zebrafish. Live imaging revealed that Dstyk regulates fusion of membranes with the vacuole. We find that localized disruption of notochord vacuoles causes vertebral malformation and curving of the spine axis at those sites. Accordingly, in <i>dstyk</i> mutants the spine curves increasingly over time as vertebral bone formation compresses the notochord asymmetrically, causing vertebral malformations and kinking of the axis. Together, our data show that notochord vacuoles function as a hydrostatic scaffold that guides symmetrical growth of vertebrae and spine formation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50597">Distinct roles for innexin gap junctions and hemichannels in mechanosensation</a></h4>

Mechanosensation is central to a wide range of functions, including tactile and pain perception, hearing, proprioception, and control of blood pressure, but identifying the molecules underlying mechanotransduction has proved challenging. In <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, the avoidance response to gentle body touch is mediated by 6 touch receptor neurons (TRNs), and is dependent on MEC-4, a DEG/ENaC channel. We show that hemichannels containing the innexin protein UNC-7 are also essential for gentle touch in the TRNs, as well as harsh touch in both the TRNs and the PVD nociceptors. UNC-7 and MEC-4 do not colocalize, suggesting that their roles in mechanosensory transduction are independent. Heterologous expression of <i>unc-7</i> in touch-insensitive chemosensory neurons confers ectopic touch sensitivity, indicating a specific role for UNC-7 hemichannels in mechanosensation. The <i>unc-7</i> touch defect can be rescued by the homologous mouse gene <i>Panx1</i> gene, thus, innexin/pannexin proteins may play broadly conserved roles in neuronal mechanotransduction.

The skin protects animals from infection and physical damage. In C. elegans, wounding the epidermis triggers an immune reaction and a repair response, but it is not clear how these are coordinated. Previous work implicated the microtubule cytoskeleton in the maintenance of epidermal integrity (Chuang et al, 2016). Here, by establishing a simple wounding system, we show that wounding provokes a reorganisation of plasma membrane subdomains. This is followed by recruitment of the microtubule plus end-binding protein EB1/EBP-2 around the wound and actin ring formation, dependant on ARP2/3 branched actin polymerisation. We show that microtubule dynamics are required for the recruitment and closure of the actin ring, and for the trafficking of the key signalling protein SLC6/SNF-12 towards the injury site. Without SNF-12 recruitment, there is an abrogation of the immune response. Our results suggest that microtubule dynamics coordinate the cytoskeletal changes required for wound repair and the concomitant activation of innate immunity.

The present study examines how artificial tactile stimulation from a novel non-invasive sensory device is learned and integrated with information from another sensory system.  Participants were trained to identify the direction of visual dot motion stimuli with a low, medium, and high signal-to-noise ratio. In bimodal trials, this visual direction information was paired with reliable symbolic tactile information. Over several blocks of training, discrimination performance in unimodal tactile test trials improved, indicating that participants were able to associate the visual and tactile information and thus learned the meaning of the symbolic tactile cues. Formal analysis of the results in bimodal trials showed that the information from both modalities was integrated according to two different integration policies. Initially, participants seemed to rely on a linear decision integration policy based on the metacognitive experience of confidence. In later learning phases, however, our results are consistent with a Bayesian integration policy, that is, optimal integration of sensory information. Thus, the present study demonstrates that humans are capable of learning and integrating an artificial sensory device delivering symbolic tactile information. This finding connects the field of multisensory integration research to the development of sensory substitution systems.

Neural stem cell (NSC) transplantation induces recovery in animal models of central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Although the replacement of lost endogenous cells was originally proposed as the primary healing mechanism of NSC grafts, it is now clear that transplanted NSCs operate via multiple mechanisms, including the horizontal exchange of therapeutic cargoes to host cells via extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs are membrane particles trafficking nucleic acids, proteins, metabolites and metabolic enzymes, lipids and entire organelles. However, the function and the contribution of these cargoes to the broad therapeutic effects of NSCs is yet to be fully understood. Mitochondrial dysfunction is an established feature of several inflammatory and degenerative CNS disorders, most of which are potentially treatable with exogenous stem cell therapeutics. Herein we investigated the hypothesis that NSCs release and traffic functional mitochondria via EVs to restore mitochondrial function in target cells. Untargeted proteomics revealed a significant enrichment of mitochondrial proteins spontaneously released by NSCs in EVs. Morphological and functional analyses confirmed the presence of ultrastructurally intact mitochondria within EVs (Mito-EVs) with conserved membrane potential and respiration. We found that the transfer of Mito-EVs to mtDNA-deficient L929 Rho0 cells rescued mitochondrial function and increased Rho0 cell survival. Furthermore, the incorporation of Mito-EVs into inflammatory professional phagocytes restored normal mitochondrial dynamics and cellular metabolism and reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory markers in target cells. When transplanted in an animal model of multiple sclerosis, exogenous NSCs actively transferred mitochondria to mononuclear phagocytes and induced a significant amelioration of clinical deficits. Our data provide the first evidence that NSCs deliver functional mitochondria to target cells via Mito-EVs, paving the way for the development of novel (a)cellular approaches aimed at restoring mitochondrial dysfunction not only in multiple sclerosis, but also in degenerative neurological diseases.

Effort-related choice (ERC) tasks allow animals to choose between high-value reinforcers that require high effort to obtain or low-value/low-effort reinforcers. Dopaminergic neuromodulation regulates effort-related choice behavior. The enzyme catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) metabolizes synaptically-released dopamine. COMT is the predominate regulator of dopamine turnover in regions of the brain with low levels of dopamine transporters, including the prefrontal cortex. Here, we evaluated the effects of the COMT inhibitor tolcapone on ERC performance in a touchscreen-based fixed-ratio/concurrent chow assay in male mice. In this task, mice were given the choice between engaging in a fixed number of instrumental responses to acquire a strawberry milk reward and consuming standard lab chow concurrently available on the chamber floor. We found no significant effects of tolcapone treatment on either strawberry milk earned or chow consumed compared to vehicle treatment. In contrast, we found that haloperidol decreased instrumental responding for strawberry milk and increased chow consumption as seen in previously published studies. These data suggest that COMT inhibition does not significantly affect effort-related decision making in a fixed-ratio/concurrent chow task in male mice.

As stroke mortality rates decrease, there has been a surge of effort to study post- stroke dementia (PSD) to improve long-term quality of life for stroke survivors. Hippocampal volume may be an important neuroimaging biomarker in post-stroke dementia, as it has been associated with many other forms of dementia. However, studying hippocampal volume using MRI requires hippocampal segmentation. Advances in automated segmentation methods have allowed for studying the hippocampus on a large scale, which is important for robust results in the heterogeneous stroke population. However, most of these automated methods use a single atlas-based approach and may fail in the presence of severe structural abnormalities common in stroke. Hippodeep, a new convolutional neural network-based hippocampal segmentation method, does not rely solely on a single atlas-based approach and thus may be better suited for stroke populations. Here, we compared the accuracy and segmentation output success among Hippodeep and two well-accepted hippocampal segmentation methods on stroke MRIs (FreeSurfer 6.0 whole hippocampus and FreeSurfer 6.0 sum of hippocampal subfields). Hippodeep performed best in terms of output failure rates and accuracy, although the FreeSurfer 'sum of subfields' method performed best on volumetric intraclass correlations. Overall, this study suggests that both Hippodeep and FreeSurfer may be useful for hippocampal segmentation in stroke rehabilitation research, but Hippodeep may be more robust to stroke lesion anatomy.

Expertise enables humans to achieve outstanding performance on domain-specific tasks, and programming is no exception. Many have shown that expert programmers exhibit remarkable differences from novices in behavioral performance, knowledge structure, and selective attention.However, the underlying differences in the brain are still unclear. We here address this issue by associating the cortical representation of source code with individual programming expertise using a data-driven decoding approach. This approach enabled us to identify seven brain regions, widely distributed in the frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices, that have a tight relationship with programming expertise. In these brain regions, functional categories of source code could be decoded from brain activity and the decoding accuracies were significantly correlated with individual behavioral performances on source-code categorization. Our results suggest that programming expertise is built up on fine-tuned cortical representations specialized for the domain of programming.

Ramon y Cajal proclaimed the neuron doctrine based on circuit features he exemplified using cerebellar basket cell projections. Basket cells form dense inhibitory plexuses that wrap Purkinje cell somata and terminate as pinceaux at the initial segment of axons. Here, we demonstrate that HCN1, Kv1.1, PSD95 and GAD67 unexpectedly mark patterns of basket cell pinceaux that map onto Purkinje cell functional zones. Using cell-specific genetic tracing with an Ascl1CreERT2 mouse conditional allele, we reveal that basket cell zones comprise different sizes of pinceaux. We tested whether Purkinje cells instruct the assembly of inhibitory projections into zones, as they do for excitatory afferents. Genetically silencing Purkinje cell neurotransmission blocks the formation of sharp Purkinje cell zones and disrupts excitatory axon patterning. The distribution of pinceaux into size-specific zones is eliminated without Purkinje cell output. Our data uncover the cellular and molecular diversity of a foundational synapse that revolutionized neuroscience.

Despite recent discovery in GWAS of genomic variants associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), its underlying biological mechanisms are still elusive. Discovery of novel AD-associated genetic variants, particularly in coding regions and from APOE e4 non-carriers, may provide more insights into the understanding of the pathology of AD. In this study, we carried out exome-wide association analysis of age-of-onset of AD with ~20,000 subjects, and placed more emphasis on APOE e4 non-carriers. Using Cox mixed-effects models, we find that age-of-onset shows a stronger genetic signal than AD case-control status, capturing many known variants with stronger significance, and also revealing three new variants. We identified two novel rare variants, rs56201815, a synonymous variant in ERN1, from the analysis of APOE e4 non-carriers, and a missense variant rs144292455 in TACR3. In addition, we detected rs12373123, a common missense variant in SPPL2C in the MAPT region, associated with age-of-onset of AD in APOE e4 non-carriers. In an attempt to unravel their regulatory and biological functions, we found that the minor allele of rs56201815 was associated with lower average FDG uptake across five brain regions in ADNI. Our eQTL analyses based on 6198 gene expression samples from ROSMAP and GTEx revealed that the minor allele of rs56201815 was associated with elevated expression of ERN1, a key gene triggering unfolded protein response (UPR), in multiple brain regions, including posterior cingulate cortex and nucleus accumbens. Our cell type-specific eQTL analysis of based on ~80,000 single nuclei in prefrontal cortex revealed that the protective minor allele of rs12373123 significantly increased expression of GRN in microglia, and was associated with MAPT expression in astrocytes. These findings provide novel evidence supporting the hypothesis of the potential involvement of the UPR to ER stress in the pathological pathway of AD, and also provide more insights into underlying regulatory mechanisms behind the pleiotropic effects of rs12373123 in multiple degenerative diseases including AD and Parkinson's disease.

Odors carrying intrinsic values often trigger instinctive aversive or attractive responses. Innate valence is thought to be conveyed through hardwired circuits along the olfactory pathway, insulated from influences of other odors. Here we show that in mice, mixing of innately aversive or attractive odors with a neutral odor abolishes the behavioral responses. Surprisingly, mixing of two odors with the same valence also abolishes the expected responses. Recordings from the olfactory bulb indicate that odors are not masked at the level of peripheral activation and glomeruli independently encode components in the mixture. However, crosstalk among the mitral/tufted cells changes their patterns of activity such that those elicited by the congruent mixtures can no longer be decoded as separate components. The changes in behavioral and mitral/tufted cell responses are associated with reduced activation of brain areas linked to odor preferences. Thus, interactions of odor channels at the earliest processing stage in the olfactory pathway lead to re-coding of odor identity. These results are inconsistent with insulated labeled lines and support a model of a common mechanism of odor recognition for both innate and learned valence associations.

Animals possess inborn ability to recognize certain odors, which enables them to seek food, avoid predators and find mates even in the absence of prior experiences. Here we report that the acquisition of innate odor recognition requires spontaneous neural activity and is influenced by sensory experience during early postnatal development. Genetic silencing of mouse olfactory sensory neurons during the critical period has little impact on odor sensitivity, odor discrimination and recognition later in life. However, it abolishes innate odor preference and alters the patterns of activation in brain centers associated with odor preference. Moreover, exposure to an innately aversive odor during the critical period abolishes aversion in adulthood in an odor specific manner. The loss of innate aversion is associated with broadened projection of OSNs expressing the cognate receptor such that they innervate ectopic glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. These results indicate that a delicate balance of neural activity is required during critical period in establishing innate odor preference and that ectopic projection is a convergent mechanism to alter innate odor valence.

Oligodendrocyte loss in neurological disease leaves axons vulnerable to damage and degeneration, and activity- dependent myelination may represent an endogenous mechanism to improve remyelination following injury. Here, we report that while learning a forelimb reach task transiently suppresses oligodendrogenesis, it subsequently increases OPC differentiation, oligodendrocyte generation, and retraction of pre-existing myelin sheaths in the forelimb region of motor cortex. Immediately following demyelination, motor cortex neurons exhibit hyperexcitability, motor learning is impaired, and behavioral intervention provides no long-term benefit to remyelination. However, partial remyelination restores neuronal and behavioral function. Motor learning following partial remyelination increases oligodendrogenesis and enhances the ability of mature oligodendrocytes to generate new myelin sheaths, resulting in almost double the remyelination of denuded axons relative to untrained controls. Together, our findings demonstrate that the correct timing of behaviorally-induced neuronal circuit activation improves recovery from demyelinating injury via enhanced remyelination from new and surviving oligodendrocytes.

We investigated two-attribute, two-alternative decision-making in a hierarchical neural network with three layers: an input layer encoding choice alternative attribute values; an intermediate layer of modules processing separate attributes; and a choice layer producing the decision. Depending on intermediate layer excitatory-inhibitory (E/I) tone, the network displays three distinct regimes characterized by linear (I), convex (II) or concave (III) choice indifference curves. In regimes I and II, each option's attribute information is additively integrated. To maximize reward at low environmental uncertainty, the system should operate in regime I. At high environmental uncertainty, reward maximization is achieved in regime III, with each attribute module selecting a favored alternative, and the ultimate decision based upon comparison between outputs of attribute processing modules. We then use these principles to examine multi-attribute decisions with autism-related deficits in E/I balance, leading to predictions of different choice patterns and overall performance between autism and neurotypicals.

Hyper-activated LRRK2 is linked to Parkinsons disease susceptibility and progression. Quantitative measures of LRRK2 inhibition, especially in the brain, may be critical in the clinical development of successful LRRK2-targeting therapeutics. In this study, three structurally distinct, brain-penetrant, and selective LRRK2 small-molecule kinase inhibitors (PFE-360, MLi2, and RA283) were orally administered to groups of cynomolgus macaques at different doses. Biofluid markers with proposed predictive value for assessing LRRK2 inhibition were measured from samples of blood, urine, and cerebral-spinal fluid (CSF). LRRK2 kinase inhibition led to consistent reduced pS935-LRRK2 and pRab10 proteins in blood mononuclear cells, reduced exosome LRRK2 protein and di-docosahexaenoyl (22:6) bis (monoacylglycerol) phosphate in urine, and reduced exosome LRRK2 and autophosphorylated pS1292-LRRK2 protein in CSF. Incomplete LRRK2 kinase inhibition reduced LRRK2 protein secretion in exosomes whereas high drug exposures may reduce both exosome and tissue levels of LRRK2 protein. These orthogonal pairs of markers for LRRK2 inhibition in urine and CSF can be used in combination with blood markers to non-invasively monitor the potency of LRRK2-targeting therapeutics in the brain and periphery.

Trauma can cause dysfunctional fear regulation leading some to develop disorders like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The amygdala regulates fear, and, PACAP and PAC1 receptors are linked to PTSD symptom severity at genetic/epigenetic levels, with a strong link in females with PTSD. We discovered a PACAPergic projection from the basomedial amygdala (BMA) to the medial intercalated cells (mICCs). In vivo optogenetic stimulation of this pathway increased cfos expression in mICCs, decreased fear retention and increased fear extinction. Selective deletion of PAC1 receptors from the mICCs in females reduced fear acquisition, but enhanced fear generalization and reduced fear extinction in males. Optogenetic stimulation of the BMA-mICCs PACAPergic pathway produced excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in mICCs neurons, which was enhanced by PAC1 receptor antagonist, PACAP 6-38. Our findings show that mICCs modulate contextual fear in a dynamic and sex-dependent manner via the microcircuit containing the BMA and mICCs, dependent on behavioral state.

Fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) encodes the RNA binding protein FMRP. Loss of FMRP drives Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the leading inherited cause of intellectual disability and a leading monogenic cause of autism. Cortical hyperexcitability is a hallmark of FXS, however, the underlying mechanisms reported, including alterations in synaptic transmission and ion channel expression and properties, are heterogeneous and at times contradictory. Here, we generated isogenic FMR1y/+ and FMR1y/- human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) lines using CRISPR-Cas9, differentiated these stem cell tools into excitatory cortical neurons and systematically assessed the impact of FMRP loss on intrinsic membrane and synaptic properties over the course of in vitro differentiation. Using whole-cell patch clamp analyses at five separate time-points, we observed significant changes in multiple metrics following FMRP loss, including decreased membrane resistance, increased capacitance, decreased action potential half-width and higher maximum frequency, consistent with FMR1y/- neurons overall showing an increased intrinsic membrane excitability compared with age-matched FMR1y/+ controls. Surprisingly, a majority of these changes emerged early during in vitro differentiation and some were not stable over time. Although we detected significant differences in intrinsic properties, no discernable alterations were observed in synaptic transmission. Collectively, this study provides a new isogenic hPSC model to study the mechanisms of FMR1 gene function, identifies electrophysiological impacts of FMRP loss on human excitatory cortical neurons over time in vitro, and underscores that early developmental changes to intrinsic membrane properties may be a critical cellular pathology contributing to cortical hyperexcitability in FXS.

The dorsal raphe nucleus (DR) contains the largest brain population of Pet1-lineage neurons, a predominantly serotonergic group distributed throughout multiple DR subdomains. These neurons collectively regulate diverse physiology and behavior and are often therapeutically targeted to treat affective disorders. Characterizing Pet1 neuron molecular heterogeneity and relating it to anatomy is vital for understanding DR functional organization, with potential to inform therapeutic separability. Here we use high-throughput and DR subdomain-targeted single-cell transcriptomics and intersectional genetic tools to map molecular and anatomical diversity of DR-Pet1 neurons. We describe up to fourteen neuron subtypes, many showing biased cell body distributions across the DR. We further show that P2ry1-Pet1 DR neurons - the most molecularly distinct of the subtypes - possess unique efferent projections and electrophysiological properties. The present data complement and extend previous DR characterizations, combining intersectional genetics with multiple transcriptomic modalities to achieve fine-scale molecular and anatomic identification of Pet1 neuron subtypes.

Mutations in RP2 lead to a severe form of X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP). RP2 functions as a GTPase activating protein (GAP) for the small GTPase ARL3, which is essential for cilia function and for photoreceptor development and maintenance. The mechanisms of RP2 associated retinal degeneration in humans are poorly understood, and genetically engineered animal models of RP2 XLRP present with differing retinal phenotypes and slow degeneration suggesting potential species differences. Here, we developed CRISPR gene edited isogenic RP2 knock-out (RP2 KO) induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and RP2 patient derived iPSC to produce 3D retinal organoids as a human retinal disease model. The isogenic RP2 KO retinal organoids and two unrelated RP2 patient iPSC lines produced retinal organoids with a defined photoreceptor cell layer (ONL) containing rod and cone photoreceptors. Strikingly the RP2 KO and RP2 patient derived organoids showed a thinning of the ONL by 180 days (D180) of culture, which was associated with a spike in cell death in the ONL at D150 of differentiation. RNA sequencing confirmed induction of cell death pathways in the RP2 null organoids at this stage. Photoreceptor cell death and ONL thinning was attributed to cells undergoing terminal rod cell differentiation characterized by reduced RHO expression and fewer rhodopsin immunoreactive photoreceptors. Gene augmentation with a human RP2 transgene in an AAV2/5 vector efficiently transduced RP2 KO organoids and led to high levels of RP2 expression in both rods and cones. Importantly, the viral transduction significantly increased ONL thickness and restored rhodopsin expression, suggesting rescue of the RP2 degeneration phenotype. These data show that 3D retinal organoids can be used to model molecular defects associated with inherited retinal disease, photoreceptor cell death and also to test potential therapies targeted to prevent photoreceptor degeneration.

Brain age is becoming a widely applied imaging-based biomarker of neural aging and potential proxy for brain integrity and health. We estimated multimodal and modality-specific brain age in the Whitehall II MRI cohort using machine learning and imaging-derived measures of gray matter morphology, diffusion-based white matter microstructure, and resting state functional connectivity. Ten-fold cross validation yielded multimodal and modality-specific brain age estimates for each participant, and additional predictions based on a separate training sample was included for comparison. The results showed equivalent age prediction accuracy between the multimodal model and the gray and white matter models (R2 of 0.34, 0.31, and 0.31, respectively), while the functional connectivity model showed a lower prediction accuracy (R2 of 0.01). Cardiovascular risk factors, including high blood pressure, alcohol intake, and stroke risk score, were each associated with more apparent brain aging, with consistent associations across modalities.

Previous studies demonstrated that alterations in functional MRI derived receptive field (pRF) properties in cortical projection zones of retinal lesions can erroneously be mistaken for cortical large-scale reorganization in response to visual system pathologies. We tested, whether such confounds are also evident in the normal cortical projection zone of the fovea for simulated peripheral visual field defects. We applied fMRI-based visual field mapping of the central visual field at 3 Tesla in eight controls to compare the pRF properties of the central visual field of a reference condition (stimulus radius: 14{degrees}) and two conditions with simulated peripheral visual field defect, i.e., with a peripheral gray mask, stimulating only the central 7{degrees} or 4{degrees} radius. We quantified, for the cortical representation of the actually stimulated visual field, the changes in the position and size of the pRFs associated with reduced peripheral stimulation using conventional and advanced pRF modeling. We found foveal pRF-positions ([≤]3{degrees}) to be significantly shifted towards the periphery (p&lt;0.05, corrected). These pRF-shifts were largest for the 4{degrees} condition [visual area (mean eccentricity shift): V1 (0.9{degrees}), V2 (0.9{degrees}), V3 (1.0{degrees})], but also evident for the 7{degrees} condition [V1 (0.5{degrees}), V2 (0.5{degrees}), V3 (0.9{degrees})]. Further, an overall enlargement of pRF-sizes was observed. These findings indicate the dependence of foveal pRF parameters on the spatial extent of the stimulated visual field. Consequently, our results imply that, previously reported similar findings in patients with actual peripheral scotomas need to be interpreted with caution and indicate the need for adequate control conditions in investigations of visual cortex reorganization.

In this study, we test the hypothesis that noninvasive markers of brain development reflect the spatiotemporal patterning of genes underlying corticogenesis during gestation and the developmental staging of the neonatal brain. Additionally, we test the selective vulnerability of molecular processes underlying cortical development to disruption following preterm birth. We find that gene expression in the fetal cortex is mirrored by a principal mode of variation in the neonatal cortex. Specifically, regional variation in cortical morphology and microstructure reflect differences in developmental maturity across cortical areas, indexed by the differential timing of gene expression across multiple cell types in the fetal cortex. Further, the effects of preterm birth are temporally and spatially coincident to developmental processes involving the differentiation and specialisation of cortical oligodendrocyte populations. This work provides an experimental framework to link molecular developmental mechanisms to macroscopic measures of cortical anatomy in early life, demonstrating the relationship between fetal gene expression and neonatal brain development and highlighting the specific impact of early exposure to the extrauterine environment due to preterm birth.

Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) enables the non-invasive, focal stimulation of brain areas in desired frequencies, intensities and spatial configurations. These attributes have raised tACS to a widely used tool in cognitive neuroscience and a promising treatment in the field of motor rehabilitation. Nevertheless, considerable heterogeneity of its behavioral effects has been reported across individuals. We present a machine learning pipeline for predicting the behavioral response to 70 Hz contralateral motor cortex-tACS from Electroencephalographic resting-state activity preceding the stimulation. Specifically, we show in a cross-over study design that high-gamma (90--160 Hz) resting-state activity predicts arm-speed response to the stimulation in a concurrent reaching task. Moreover, we show in a prospective study that the behavioral effect size of stimulation significantly increases after the stratification of subjects with our prediction method. Finally, we discuss a plausible neurophysiological mechanism that links high resting-state gamma power in motor areas to stimulation response. As such, we provide a method that can reliably distinguish responders from non-responders to tACS, prior to the stimulation treatment. This contribution could eventually bring us a step closer towards translating non-invasive brain stimulation from a research tool into a safe and effective clinical treatment.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine the clinical and molecular features in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 4 (ALS4) due to mutations in the senataxin (<i>SETX</i>) gene and to develop tools for evaluating <i>SETX</i> variants.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Our study involved 32 patients, including 31 with mutation in <i>SETX</i> at c.1166 T&gt;C (p.Leu389Ser) and 1 with mutation at c.1153 G&gt;A (p.Glu385Lys). Clinical characterization of the patients included neurological examination, blood tests, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and dual‐energy x‐ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Fibroblasts and motor neurons were obtained to model the disease and characterize the molecular alteration in senataxin function.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We report key clinical features of ALS4. Laboratory analysis showed alteration of serum creatine kinase and creatinine in the Leu389Ser ALS4 cohort. MRI showed increased muscle fat fraction in the lower extremities, which correlates with disease duration (thigh fat fraction <i>R</i>
<sup>2</sup> = 0.35, <i>p</i> = 0.01; lower leg fat fraction <i>R</i>
<sup>2</sup> = 0.49, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). DEXA measurements showed lower extremities are more affected than upper extremities (average fat <i>z</i> scores of 2.1 and 0.6, respectively). A cellular assay for SETX function confirmed that like the Leu389Ser mutation, the Glu385Lys variant leads to a decrease in R loops, likely from a gain of function.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We identified clinical laboratory and radiological features of ALS4, and hence they should be monitored for disease progression. The molecular characterization of R‐loop levels in patient‐derived cells provides insight into the disease pathology and assays to evaluate the pathogenicity of candidate mutations in the <i>SETX</i> gene.

<p>Resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is a widespread and powerful tool for
investigating functional connectivity (FC) and brain disorders. However, FC
analysis can be seriously affected by random and structured noise from
non-neural sources such as physiology. Thus, it is essential to first reduce
thermal noise and then correctly identify and remove non-neural artefacts from
rs-fMRI signals through proper data processing methods. However, existing tools
that correct for these effects are tailored for human brain and are not readily
transposable to rat data. Here, we established a data processing pipeline that
can robustly remove random and structured noise from rat rs-fMRI data. It
includes a novel denoising approach based on Marchenko-Pastur Principle
Component Analysis (MP-PCA) method, FMRIB's ICA-based Xnoiseifier (FIX) for
automatic artefact classification and cleaning, and global signal regression
(GSR). Our results show that: I) MP-PCA denoising substantially improves the
temporal signal-to-noise ratio; II) the pre-trained FIX classifier achieves a
high accuracy in artefact classification; III) both artefact cleaning and GSR
are essential steps in minimizing the within-group variability in control
animals and identifying FC changes in a rat model of sporadic Alzheimer's
disease, as compared to controls.

<p>The mathematical classification of complex bursting oscillations in
multiscale excitable systems, seen for example in physics and neuroscience, has
been the subject of active enquiry since the early 1980s. This classification
problem is fundamental as it also establishes analytical and numerical
foundations for studying complex temporal behaviours in multiple timescale
models. This manuscript begins by reviewing the seminal works of Rinzel and
Izhikevich in classifying bursting patterns of excitable cell models. Moreover,
we recall an alternative, yet complementary, mathematical classification
approach by Golubitsky, which together with the Rinzel-Izhikevich proposals
provide the state-of-the-art foundations to the classification problem.
Unexpectedly, while keeping within the Rinzel-Izhikevich framework, we find
novel cases of bursting mechanisms not considered before. Moving beyond the
state-of-the-art, we identify novel bursting mechanisms that fall outside the
current classifications. This leads us towards a new classification, which
requires the analysis of both the fast and the slow subsystems of an underlying
slow-fast model. This new classification allows the dynamical dissection of a
larger class of bursters. To substantiate this, we add a new class of bursters
with at least two slow variables, which we denote folded-node bursters, to
convey the idea that the bursts are initiated or annihilated via a folded-node
singularity. In fact, there are two main families of folded-node bursters,
depending upon the phase of the bursting cycle during which folded-node
dynamics occurs. If it occurs during the silent phase, we obtain the classical
folded-node bursting (or simply folded-node bursting). If it occurs during the
active phase, we have cyclic folded-node bursting. We classify both families
and give examples of minimal systems displaying these novel types of bursting
behaviour.

<p>Natural animal behavior displays rich lexical and temporal dynamics, even in
a stable environment. This implies that behavioral variability arises from
sources within the brain, but the origin and mechanics of these processes
remain largely unknown. Here, we focus on the observation that the timing of
self-initiated actions shows large variability even when they are executed in
stable, well-learned sequences. Could this mix of reliability and stochasticity
arise within the same circuit? We trained rats to perform a stereotyped
sequence of self-initiated actions and recorded neural ensemble activity in
secondary motor cortex (M2), which is known to reflect trial-by-trial action
timing fluctuations. Using hidden Markov models we established a robust and
accurate dictionary between ensemble activity patterns and actions. We then
showed that metastable attractors, representing activity patterns with the
requisite combination of reliable sequential structure and high transition
timing variability, could be produced by reciprocally coupling a high
dimensional recurrent network and a low dimensional feedforward one.
Transitions between attractors were generated by correlated variability arising
from the feedback loop between the two networks. This mechanism predicted a
specific structure of low-dimensional noise correlations that were empirically
verified in M2 ensemble dynamics. This work suggests a robust network motif as
a novel mechanism to support critical aspects of animal behavior and
establishes a framework for investigating its circuit origins via correlated
variability.

<p>Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are condensed extracellular matrix (ECM) structures regulating developmental plasticity and protecting neurons against oxidative stress. PNN abnormalities have been observed in various psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, but the relationship between PNN density and depression still remains unclear. In the present study, we examined the density and components of PNNs including aggrecan, neurocan and Tenascin-R in the prelimbic cortex (PrL) after chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). We found that depressive-like behaviors were induced after 30 days of CUMS accompanied by decreases in PNN<sup>+</sup> cell density and aggrecan expression in the PrL. In addition, rats subjected to 20 days of CUMS were separated into vulnerable and resilient subpopulations that differ along several behavioral domains. Consistently, the density of PNNs and the expression level of neurocan in the vulnerable group were decreased compared to control and resilient groups. Finally, we examined individual differences based on locomotion in a novel context and classified rats as high responding (HR) and low responding (LR) phenotypes. The density of PNNs and the expression level of neurocan in the LR group were lower than the HR group. Moreover, the LR rats were more susceptible to depressive-like behaviors compared with HR rats. Altogether, these results suggest that the density of PNNs in the PrL is associated with depressive-like behaviors in young-aged rats, and it may serve as a potential endophenotype or therapeutic target for depression.</p>

<p>Introduction: Ocular manifestations in several neurological pathologies accentuate the strong relationship between the eye and the brain. Retinal alterations in particular can serve as surrogates for cerebral changes. Offering a “window to the brain,” the transparent eye enables non-invasive imaging of these changes in retinal structure and vasculature. Fractal dimension (FD) reflects the overall complexity of the retinal vasculature. Changes in FD could reflect subtle changes in the cerebral vasculature that correspond to preclinical stages of neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, the potential of this retinal vessel metric to serve as a biomarker in neurodegeneration and stroke will be explored.</p><p>Methods: A literature search was conducted, following the PRISMA Statement 2009 criteria, in four large bibliographic databases (Pubmed, Embase, Web Of Science and Cochrane Library) up to 12 October 2019. Articles have been included based upon their relevance. Wherever possible, level of evidence (LOE) has been assessed by means of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine Level of Evidence classification.</p><p>Results: Twenty-one studies were included for qualitative synthesis. We performed a narrative synthesis and produced summary tables of findings of included papers because methodological heterogeneity precluded a meta-analysis. A significant association was found between decreased FD and neurodegenerative disease, mainly addressing cognitive impairment (CI) and dementia. In acute, subacute as well as chronic settings, decreased FD seems to be associated with stroke. Differences in FD between subtypes of ischemic stroke remain unclear.</p><p>Conclusions: This review provides a summary of the scientific literature regarding the association between retinal FD and neurodegenerative disease and stroke. Central pathology is associated with a decreased FD, as a measure of microvascular network complexity. As retinal FD reflects the global integrity of the cerebral microvasculature, it is an attractive parameter to explore. Despite obvious concerns, mainly due to a lack of methodological standardization, retinal FD remains a promising non-invasive and low-cost diagnostic biomarker for neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular disease. Before FD can be implemented in clinic as a diagnostic biomarker, the research community should strive for uniformization and standardization.</p>

<p>Aging coincides with a decline in navigation and wayfinding abilities, but it is unclear to what extent factors relating to a given individual may contribute to mitigating this decline. The present study aims to analyze how older adults’ objective cognitive functioning and self-reported subjective wayfinding inclinations predict their navigation performance. Sixty-four older adults were assessed on their general cognitive functioning (all scoring from 22 to 30 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA), visuospatial working memory (VSWM), and perspective-taking abilities. Their self-assessed wayfinding inclinations (such as their sense of direction, pleasure in exploring places, and spatial anxiety) were also examined. Then participants learned a path in an environment from video navigation and performed a route repetition task (which maintained the same egocentric perspective as the learning phase), and a sketch map task (which involved switching from an egocentric perspective used in the learning phase to an allocentric perspective). The results showed that positive wayfinding inclinations (in terms of pleasure in exploring) related to participants’ route repetition accuracy, while their general cognitive performance (MoCA scores) related to their sketch map drawing accuracy. Individual factors such as cognitive functioning and wayfinding inclinations relate differently to older people’s navigation performance, depending on the demands of the tasks used to test their environment learning.</p>

<p>Functional neuroimaging studies have emphasized distinct networks for social cognition and affective aspects of empathy. However, studies have not considered whether substrates of social cognition, such as the right temporoparietal junction (TPJ), play a role in affective responses to complex empathy-related stimuli. Here, we used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to test whether the right TPJ contributes to psychophysiological responses to another person’s emotional suffering. We used a theory of mind functional localizer and image-guided TMS to target the sub-region of the right TPJ implicated in social cognition, and measured autonomic and subjective responses to an empathy induction video. We found evidence that TMS applied at 1 Hz over the right TPJ increased withdrawal of parasympathetic nervous system activity during the empathy induction (n = 32), but did not affect sympathetic nervous system activity (n = 27). Participants who received TMS over the right TPJ also reported feeling more irritation and annoyance, and were less likely to report feeling compassion over and above empathic sadness, than participants who received TMS over the vertex (N = 34). This study provides preliminary evidence for the role of right TPJ functioning in empathy-related psychophysiological and affective responding, potentially blurring the distinction between neural regions specific to social cognition vs. affective aspects of empathy.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00082">Neural Correlates of Learning Pure Tones or Natural Sounds in the Auditory Cortex</a></h4>

<p>Associative learning of pure tones is known to cause tonotopic map expansion in the auditory cortex (ACx), but the function this plasticity sub-serves is unclear. We developed an automated training platform called the “Educage,” which was used to train mice on a go/no-go auditory discrimination task to their perceptual limits, for difficult discriminations among pure tones or natural sounds. Spiking responses of excitatory and inhibitory parvalbumin (PV<sup>+</sup>) L2/3 neurons in mouse ACx revealed learning-induced overrepresentation of the learned frequencies, as expected from previous literature. The coordinated plasticity of excitatory and inhibitory neurons supports a role for PV<sup>+</sup> neurons in homeostatic maintenance of excitation–inhibition balance within the circuit. Using a novel computational model to study auditory tuning curves, we show that overrepresentation of the learned tones does not necessarily improve discrimination performance of the network to these tones. In a separate set of experiments, we trained mice to discriminate among natural sounds. Perceptual learning of natural sounds induced “sparsening” and decorrelation of the neural response, consequently improving discrimination of these complex sounds. This signature of plasticity in A1 highlights its role in coding natural sounds.</p>

<p>The concept that neuroinflammation induced by excessive alcohol intake in adolescence triggers brain mechanisms that perpetuate consumption has strengthened in recent years. The melanocortin system, composed of the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) and its ligand α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH), has been implicated both in modulation of alcohol consumption and in ethanol-induced neuroinflammation decrease. Chronic alcohol consumption in adolescent rats causes a decrease in an α-MSH release by the hypothalamus, while the administration of synthetic agonists of MC4R causes a decrease in neuroinflammation and a decrease in voluntary alcohol consumption. However, the mechanism that connects the activation of MC4R with the decrease of both neuroinflammation and voluntary alcohol consumption has not been elucidated. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been implicated in alcohol drinking motivation, dependence and withdrawal, and its levels are reduced in alcoholics. Deficiencies in BDNF levels increased ethanol self-administration in rats. Further, BDNF triggers important anti-inflammatory effects in the brain, and this could be one of the mechanisms by which BDNF reduces chronic alcohol intake. Interestingly, MC4R signaling induces BDNF expression through the activation of the cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB). We hypothesize that ethanol exposure during adolescence decreases the expression of α-MSH and hence MC4R signaling in the hippocampus, leading to a lower BDNF activity that causes dramatic changes in the brain (e.g., neuroinflammation and decreased neurogenesis) that predispose to maintain alcohol abuse until adulthood. The activation of MC4R either by α-MSH or by synthetic agonist peptides can induce the expression of BDNF, which would trigger several processes that lead to lower alcohol consumption.</p>

<p>Preclinical animal studies have continuously reported the possibility of long-lasting neurotoxic effects after general anesthesia in young animals. Such studies also show that the neurological changes induced by anesthesia in young animals differ by their neurodevelopmental stage. Exposure to anesthetic agents increase dendritic spines and induce sex-dependent changes of excitatory/inhibitory synaptic transmission in late postnatal mice, a critical synaptogenic period. However, the mechanisms underlying these changes remain unclear. Abnormal activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, an important regulator of neurodevelopment, has also been shown to induce similar changes during neurodevelopment. Interestingly, previous studies show that exposure to general anesthetics during neurodevelopment can activate the mTOR signaling pathway. This study, therefore, evaluated the role of mTOR signaling after exposing postnatal day (PND) 16/17 mice to sevoflurane, a widely used inhalation agent in pediatric patients. We first confirmed that a 2-h exposure of 2.5% sevoflurane could induce widespread mTOR phosphorylation in both male and female mice. Pretreatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin not only prevented anesthesia-induced mTOR phosphorylation, but also the increase in mitochondrial respiration and male-dependent enhancement of excitatory synaptic transmission. However, the changes in inhibitory synaptic transmission that appear after anesthesia in female mice were not affected by rapamycin pretreatment. Our results suggest that mTOR inhibitors may act as potential therapeutic agents for anesthesia-induced changes in the developing brain.</p>

<p>Taurisolo<sup>®</sup> is a pomace extract from Aglianico Grapes, a wine cultivar native to Campania (Southern Italy). It exhibits a very high polyphenolic content and, consumed as a nutraceutical, is effective in reducing the level of Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a cardiovascular disease risk factor marker. We here show the effects of Taurisolo<sup>®</sup> on rat brain microvascular alterations induced by a diminution in cerebral blood flow (CBFD) for 30 min, due to bilateral common carotid artery occlusion, and subsequent blood flow restoration (CBFR) for 60 min. The rat pial microcirculation was investigated by intravital fluorescence microscopy through a parietal closed window implanted into the skull bone. The rat pial arterioles were classified according to Strahler’s ordering scheme, from smaller penetrating arterioles up to the larger ones. Western blotting analysis and mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomics were used to investigate the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) or the presence of peroxidized cardiolipin and several inflammatory mediators, respectively. Radical Oxygen Species (ROS) formation and neuronal loss were assessed. In rats CBFD and CBFR caused a decrease in arteriolar diameter, increase in fluorescent leakage and in adhesion of leukocytes to venular walls, reduction in the length of perfused capillaries and increment of ROS formation with large infarct size. Taurisolo<sup>®</sup>, intravenously or orally administered, induced pial arteriolar dilation (up to &gt;30% of baseline), prevented fluorescent leakage, adhesion of leukocytes, ROS formation, while facilitated capillary perfusion and significantly reduced infarct size. These effects were accompanied by an increase in eNOS expression. Mass-spectrometry metabolomics analysis detected a marked decrease in the amount of peroxidized cardiolipin and pronounced reduction in pro-inflammatory prostaglandins and thromboxane Txb2. Altogether, these results extend the nutraceutical potential of Taurisolo<sup>®</sup> and suggest their eligibility for preventing brain damage due to ischemia-reperfusion injury.</p>

<p>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive technique that uses electromagnetic fields to stimulate the brain. rTMS can restore an impaired central nervous system and promote proliferation of neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs), but optimal stimulus parameters and mechanisms underlying these effects remain elusive. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of different rTMS stimulus parameters on proliferation and apoptosis of spinal cord-derived NSPCs, the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) after rTMS, and the potentially underlying pathways. NSPCs were isolated from mice spinal cord and stimulated by different frequencies (1/10/20 Hz), intensities (0.87/1.24/1.58 T), and number of pulses (400/800/1,500/3,000) once a day for five consecutive days. NSPC proliferation was analyzed by measuring the neurosphere diameter and Brdu staining, apoptosis was detected by cell death enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and flow cytometry, and NSPC viability was assessed by cell counting kit-8 assay. We found that specific parameters of frequency (1/10/20 Hz), intensity (1.24/1.58 T), and number of pulses (800/1,500/3,000) promote proliferation and apoptosis (p &lt; 0.05 for all), but 20 Hz, 1.58 T, and 1,500 pulses achieved the optimal response for the NSPC viability. In addition, rTMS significantly promoted the expression of BDNF at the mRNA and protein level, while also increasing Akt phosphorylation (Thr308 and Ser473; p &lt; 0.05). Overall, we identified the most appropriate rTMS parameters for further studies on NSPCs in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the effect of magnetic stimulation on NSPC proliferation might be correlated to BDNF/Akt signaling pathway.</p>

<p>Human tauopathies, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), have been widely studied in transgenic mice overexpressing human tau in the brain. The longest brain isoforms of Tau in mice and humans show 89% amino acid identity; however, the expression of the isoforms of this protein in the adult brain of the two species differs. Tau 3R isoforms are not present in adult mice. In contrast, the adult human brain contains Tau 3R and also Tau 4R isoforms. In addition, the N-terminal sequence of Tau protein in mice and humans differs, a Tau peptide (residues 17–28) being present in the latter but absent in the former. Here we review the main published data on this N-terminal sequence that suggests that human and mouse Tau proteins interact with different endogenous proteins and also show distinct secretion patterns.</p>

<p>Background and Objective: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is considered a preclinical state of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and may represent a more advanced preclinical status than amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Our aim was to explore changes in the white matter (WM) microstructure and their correlation with cognitive function in these AD-spectrum patients.</p><p>Methods: Diffusion tensor images from 43 individuals with normal cognition (NC), 38 SCD patients, and 36 aMCI patients were compared using an atlas-based segmentation strategy. The correlation between diffusion parameters and cognitive function was further analyzed.</p><p>Results: The anatomical pattern of WM impairment was generally similar between SCD and aMCI patients. However, aMCI patients showed significantly lower fractional anisotropy (i.e., corpus callosum forceps major and forceps minor) and increased mean diffusivity [i.e., bilateral anterior thalamic radiation (ATR), left corticospinal tract (CST), forceps minor, left cingulum (cingulate gyrus), left cingulum hippocampus, and left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFO)] in some tracts than did SCD subjects, indicating a disruption in WM microstructural integrity in the aMCI. Individuals with microstructural disruption in forceps minor, left cingulum (cingulate gyrus), and left cingulum hippocampus tracts performed worse in general cognition and memory function tests, as indicated by line regression analysis.</p><p>Conclusion: SCD individuals had extensive WM microstructural damage in a pattern similar to that seen in aMCI, although presenting a cognitive performance comparable with that of cognitively healthy individuals.

<p>Variants in the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene play an important role in the development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Specifically, the APOE-ε4 allele is an established genetic risk factor for AD, while the APOE-ε2 allele is a protective factor against AD. However, the mechanism underlying this impact of APOE genotype on the pathogenesis of AD remain unclear. This study sought to investigate the influence of APOE genotype on cognition and neuroimaging features in cognitively normal (CN) elderly individuals and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). A total of 177 participants were selected from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database, including 101 MCI patients and 76 CN individuals. A 2 × 3 (consisting of 2 groups and 3 APOE genotypes) analysis of covariance was carried out to measure the influences of diagnosis and APOE genotype on cognition and brain features, assessed based on global functional connectivity density (gFCD) and hippocampal volume. In addition, a mediation analysis was carried out to investigate the indirect influence of neuroimaging features on the relationship between APOE genotype and cognitive performance in the MCI group. This analysis revealed that APOE genotype had an influence on brain function in the bilateral precentral gyrus, right thalamus, and posterior cingulate cortex. In addition, an interactive influence between diagnosis and APOE genotype was found on general cognition, immediate memory, executive function, hippocampal volume, and gFCD in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and medial prefrontal cortex. Finally, this mediation analysis revealed that hippocampal volume and gFCD in the thalamus may mediate the relationship between APOE genotype and cognitive performance in the MCI group. Taken together, our findings provide novel insights into the neural mechanisms underlying the genetically guided pathogenic mechanisms of AD.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/54355">Guanidine hydrochloride reactivates an ancient septin hetero-oligomer assembly pathway in budding yeast</a></h4>

Septin proteins evolved from ancestral GTPases and co-assemble into hetero-oligomers and cytoskeletal filaments. In <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, five septins comprise two species of hetero-octamers, Cdc11/Shs1–Cdc12–Cdc3–Cdc10–Cdc10–Cdc3–Cdc12–Cdc11/Shs1. Slow GTPase activity by Cdc12 directs the choice of incorporation of Cdc11 vs Shs1, but many septins, including Cdc3, lack GTPase activity. We serendipitously discovered that guanidine hydrochloride rescues septin function in <i>cdc10</i> mutants by promoting assembly of non-native Cdc11/Shs1–Cdc12–Cdc3–Cdc3–Cdc12–Cdc11/Shs1 hexamers. We provide evidence that in <i>S. cerevisiae</i> Cdc3 guanidinium occupies the site of a 'missing' Arg side chain found in other fungal species where (i) the Cdc3 subunit is an active GTPase and (ii) Cdc10-less hexamers natively co-exist with octamers. We propose that guanidinium reactivates a latent septin assembly pathway that was suppressed during fungal evolution in order to restrict assembly to octamers. Since homodimerization by a GTPase-active human septin also creates hexamers that exclude Cdc10-like central subunits, our new mechanistic insights likely apply throughout phylogeny.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/52583">Learning improves decoding of odor identity with phase-referenced oscillations in the olfactory bulb</a></h4>

Local field potential oscillations reflect temporally coordinated neuronal ensembles—coupling distant brain regions, gating processing windows, and providing a reference for spike timing-based codes. In phase amplitude coupling (PAC), the amplitude of the envelope of a faster oscillation is larger within a phase window of a slower carrier wave. Here, we characterized PAC, and the related theta phase-referenced high gamma and beta power (PRP), in the olfactory bulb of mice learning to discriminate odorants. PAC changes throughout learning, and odorant-elicited changes in PRP increase for rewarded and decrease for unrewarded odorants. Contextual odorant identity (is the odorant rewarded?) can be decoded from peak PRP in animals proficient in odorant discrimination, but not in naïve mice. As the animal learns to discriminate the odorants the dimensionality of PRP decreases. Therefore, modulation of phase-referenced chunking of information in the course of learning plays a role in early sensory processing in olfaction.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/52228">Integration of locomotion and auditory signals in the mouse inferior colliculus</a></h4>

The inferior colliculus (IC) is the major midbrain auditory integration center, where virtually all ascending auditory inputs converge. Although the IC has been extensively studied for sound processing, little is known about the neural activity of the IC in moving subjects, as frequently happens in natural hearing conditions. Here, by recording neural activity in walking mice, we show that the activity of IC neurons is strongly modulated by locomotion, even in the absence of sound stimuli. Similar modulation was also found in hearing-impaired mice, demonstrating that IC neurons receive non-auditory, locomotion-related neural signals. Sound-evoked activity was attenuated during locomotion, and this attenuation increased frequency selectivity across the neuronal population, while maintaining preferred frequencies. Our results suggest that during behavior, integrating movement-related and auditory information is an essential aspect of sound processing in the IC.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/51739">A phenotypic screening platform utilising human spermatozoa identifies compounds with contraceptive activity</a></h4>

There is an urgent need to develop new methods for male contraception, however a major barrier to drug discovery has been the lack of validated targets and the absence of an effective high-throughput phenotypic screening system. To address this deficit, we developed a fully-automated robotic screening platform that provided quantitative evaluation of compound activity against two key attributes of human sperm function: motility and acrosome reaction. In order to accelerate contraceptive development, we screened the comprehensive collection of 12,000 molecules that make up the ReFRAME repurposing library, comprising nearly all the small molecules that have been approved or have undergone clinical development, or have significant preclinical profiling. We identified several compounds that potently inhibit motility representing either novel drug candidates or routes to target identification. This platform will now allow for major drug discovery programmes that address the critical gap in the contraceptive portfolio as well as uncover novel human sperm biology.

Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) or Cys-loop receptors are involved in fast synaptic signaling in the nervous system. Allosteric modulators bind to sites that are remote from the neurotransmitter binding site, but modify coupling of ligand binding to channel opening. In this study, we developed nanobodies (single domain antibodies), which are functionally active as allosteric modulators, and solved co-crystal structures of the prokaryote (<i>Erwinia</i>) channel ELIC bound either to a positive or a negative allosteric modulator. The allosteric nanobody binding sites partially overlap with those of small molecule modulators, including a vestibule binding site that is not accessible in some pLGICs. Using mutagenesis, we extrapolate the functional importance of the vestibule binding site to the human 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor, suggesting a common mechanism of modulation in this protein and ELIC. Thus we identify key elements of allosteric binding sites, and extend drug design possibilities in pLGICs with an accessible vestibule site.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50740">Preclinical murine tumor models: a structural and functional perspective</a></h4>

The goal of this review is to pinpoint the specific features, including the weaknesses, of various tumor models, and to discuss the reasons why treatments that are efficient in murine tumor models often do not work in clinics. In a detailed comparison of transplanted and spontaneous tumor models, we focus on structure–function relationships in the tumor microenvironment. For instance, the architecture of the vascular tree, which depends on whether tumor cells have gone through epithelial-mesenchymal transition, is determinant for the extension of the spontaneous necrosis, and for the intratumoral localization of the immune infiltrate. Another key point is the model-dependent abundance of TGFβ in the tumor, which controls the variable susceptibility of different tumor models to treatments. Grounded in a historical perspective, this review provides a rationale for checking factors that will be key for the transition between preclinical murine models and clinical applications.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50670">GLI transcriptional repression regulates tissue-specific enhancer activity in response to Hedgehog signaling</a></h4>

Transcriptional repression needs to be rapidly reversible during embryonic development. This extends to the Hedgehog pathway, which primarily serves to counter GLI repression by processing GLI proteins into transcriptional activators. In investigating the mechanisms underlying GLI repression, we find that a subset of GLI binding regions, termed HH-responsive enhancers, specifically loses acetylation in the absence of HH signaling. These regions are highly enriched around HH target genes and primarily drive HH-specific transcriptional activity in the mouse limb bud. They also retain H3K27ac enrichment in limb buds devoid of GLI activator and repressor, indicating that their activity is primarily regulated by GLI repression. Furthermore, the Polycomb repression complex is not active at most of these regions, suggesting it is not a major mechanism of GLI repression. We propose a model for tissue-specific enhancer activity in which an HDAC-associated GLI repression complex regulates target genes by altering the acetylation status at enhancers.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/50458">TLR5 participates in the TLR4 receptor complex and promotes MyD88-dependent signaling in environmental lung injury</a></h4>

Lung disease causes significant morbidity and mortality, and is exacerbated by environmental injury, e.g. through lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or ozone (O<sub>3</sub>). Toll-like receptors (TLRs) orchestrate immune responses to injury by recognizing pathogen- or danger-associated molecular patterns. TLR4, the prototypic receptor for LPS, also mediates inflammation after O<sub>3</sub>, triggered by endogenous hyaluronan. Regulation of TLR4 signaling is incompletely understood. TLR5, the flagellin receptor, is expressed in alveolar macrophages, and regulates immune responses to environmental injury. Using <i>in vivo</i> animal models of TLR4-mediated inflammations (LPS, O<sub>3</sub>, hyaluronan), we show that TLR5 impacts the <i>in vivo</i> response to LPS, hyaluronan and O<sub>3</sub>. We demonstrate that immune cells of human carriers of a dominant negative TLR5 allele have decreased inflammatory response to O<sub>3</sub> exposure <i>ex vivo</i> and LPS exposure <i>in vitro</i>. Using primary murine macrophages, we find that TLR5 physically associates with TLR4 and biases TLR4 signaling towards the MyD88 pathway. Our results suggest an updated paradigm for TLR4/TLR5 signaling.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/49816">Genomic adaptations in information processing underpin trophic strategy in a whole-ecosystem nutrient enrichment experiment</a></h4>

Several universal genomic traits affect trade-offs in the capacity, cost, and efficiency of biochemical information processing underpinning metabolism and reproduction. We analyzed their role in mediating planktonic microbial community responses to nutrient enrichment in an oligotrophic, phosphorus-deficient pond in Cuatro Ciénegas, Mexico—one of the first whole-ecosystem experiments involving replicated metagenomic assessment. Mean bacterial genome size, GC content, total number of tRNA genes, total number of rRNA genes, and codon usage bias in ribosomal protein sequences were higher in the fertilized treatment, as predicted assuming oligotrophy favors lower information-processing costs while copiotrophy favors higher processing rates. Contrasting changes in trait variances also suggested differences between traits in mediating assembly under copiotrophic versus oligotrophic conditions. Trade-offs in information-processing traits are apparently sufficiently pronounced to play a role in community assembly as the major components of metabolism—information, energy, and nutrient requirements—are fine-tuned to an organism's growth and trophic strategy.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/49774">Actin assembly ruptures the nuclear envelope by prying the lamina away from nuclear pores and nuclear membranes in starfish oocytes</a></h4>

The nucleus of oocytes (germinal vesicle) is unusually large and its nuclear envelope (NE) is densely packed with nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) stockpiled for embryonic development. We showed that breakdown of this specialized NE is mediated by an Arp2/3-nucleated F-actin 'shell' in starfish oocytes, in contrast to microtubule-driven tearing in mammalian fibroblasts. Here, we address the mechanism of F-actin-driven NE rupture by correlated live-cell, super-resolution and electron microscopy. We show that actin is nucleated within the lamina sprouting filopodia-like spikes towards the nuclear membranes. These F-actin spikes protrude pore-free nuclear membranes, whereas the adjoining membrane stretches accumulate NPCs associated with the still-intact lamina. Packed NPCs sort into a distinct membrane network, while breaks appear in ER-like, pore-free regions. Thereby, we reveal a new function for actin-mediated membrane shaping in nuclear rupture that is likely to have implications in other contexts such as nuclear rupture observed in cancer cells.

Axolotls and other salamanders can regenerate entire limbs after amputation as adults, and much recent effort has sought to identify the molecular programs controlling this process. While targeted mutagenesis approaches like CRISPR/Cas9 now permit gene-level investigation of these mechanisms, genetic screening in the axolotl requires an extensive commitment of time and space. Previously, we quantified CRISPR/Cas9-generated mutations in the limbs of mosaic mutant axolotls before and after regeneration and found that the regenerated limb is a highfidelity replicate of the original limb (Flowers et al. 2017). Here, we circumvent aforementioned genetic screening limitations and present methods for a multiplex CRISPR/Cas9 haploid screen in chimeric axolotls (MuCHaChA), which is a novel platform for haploid genetic screening in animals to identify genes essential for limb regeneration.

It has been commonly assumed that Zika virus (ZIKV) infection confers long-term protection against reinfection, preventing ZIKV from re-emerging in previously affected areas for several years. However, the long-term immune response to ZIKV following an outbreak remains poorly documented. We compared results from eight serological surveys before and after known ZIKV outbreaks in French Polynesia and Fiji, including cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. We found evidence of a decline in seroprevalence in both countries over a two-year period following first reported ZIKV transmission. This decline was concentrated in adults, while high seroprevalence persisted in children. In the Fiji cohort, there was also a significant decline in neutralizing antibody titres against ZIKV, but not against dengue viruses that circulated during the same period.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/47551">High-speed motility originates from cooperatively pushing and pulling flagella bundles in bilophotrichous bacteria</a></h4>

Bacteria propel and change direction by rotating long, helical filaments, called flagella. The number of flagella, their arrangement on the cell body and their sense of rotation hypothetically determine the locomotion characteristics of a species. The movement of the most rapid microorganisms has in particular remained unexplored because of additional experimental limitations. We show that magnetotactic cocci with two flagella bundles on one pole swim faster than 500 µm·s<sup>-1</sup> along a double helical path, making them one of the fastest natural microswimmers. We additionally reveal that the cells reorient in less than 5 ms, an order of magnitude faster than reported so far for any other bacteria. Using hydrodynamic modeling, we demonstrate that a mode where a pushing and a pulling bundle cooperate is the only possibility to enable both helical tracks and fast reorientations. The advantage of sheathed flagella bundles is the high rigidity, making high swimming speeds possible.

<p>by Tomasz Konopka, Damian Smedley</p>

Functional annotation of genes remains a challenge in fundamental biology and is a limiting factor for translational medicine. Computational approaches have been developed to process heterogeneous data into meaningful metrics, but often do not address how findings might be updated when new evidence comes to light. To address this challenge, we describe requirements for a framework for incremental data integration and propose an implementation based on phenotype ontologies and Bayesian probability updates. We apply the framework to quantify similarities between gene annotations and disease profiles. Within this scope, we categorize human diseases according to how well they can be recapitulated by animal models and quantify similarities between human diseases and mouse models produced by the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium. The flexibility of the approach allows us to incorporate negative phenotypic data to better prioritize candidate genes, and to stratify disease mapping using sex-dependent phenotypes. All our association scores can be updated and we exploit this feature to showcase integration with curated annotations from high-precision assays. Incremental integration is thus a suitable framework for tracking functional annotations and linking to complex human pathology.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/T6mS4qnAmJU" width="1" />

<p>by Daan H. de Groot, Josephus Hulshof, Bas Teusink, Frank J. Bruggeman, Robert Planqué</p>

In this paper we try to describe all possible molecular states (phenotypes) for a cell that fabricates itself at a constant rate, given its enzyme kinetics and the stoichiometry of all reactions. For this, we must understand the process of cellular growth: steady-state self-fabrication requires a cell to synthesize all of its components, including metabolites, enzymes and ribosomes, in proportions that match its own composition. Simultaneously, the concentrations of these components affect the rates of metabolism and biosynthesis, and hence the growth rate. We here derive a theory that describes all phenotypes that solve this circular problem. All phenotypes can be described as a combination of minimal building blocks, which we call Elementary Growth Modes (EGMs). EGMs can be used as the theoretical basis for all models that explicitly model self-fabrication, such as the currently popular Metabolism and Expression models. We then use our theory to make concrete biological predictions. We find that natural selection for maximal growth rate drives microorganisms to states of minimal phenotypic complexity: only one EGM will be active when growth rate is maximised. The phenotype of a cell is only extended with one more EGM whenever growth becomes limited by an additional biophysical constraint, such as a limited solvent capacity of a cellular compartment. The theory presented here extends recent results on Elementary Flux Modes: the minimal building blocks of cellular growth models that lack the self-fabrication aspect. Our theory starts from basic biochemical and evolutionary considerations, and describes unicellular life, both in growth-promoting and in stress-inducing environments, in terms of EGMs.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/quMD_5d5iEc" width="1" />

<p>by Sean M. Cascarina, Mikaela R. Elder, Eric D. Ross</p>

A variety of studies have suggested that low-complexity domains (LCDs) tend to be intrinsically disordered and are relatively rare within structured proteins in the protein data bank (PDB). Although LCDs are often treated as a single class, we previously found that LCDs enriched in different amino acids can exhibit substantial differences in protein metabolism and function. Therefore, we wondered whether the structural conformations of LCDs are likewise dependent on which specific amino acids are enriched within each LCD. Here, we directly examined relationships between enrichment of individual amino acids and secondary structure tendencies across the entire PDB proteome. Secondary structure tendencies varied as a function of the identity of the amino acid enriched and its degree of enrichment. Furthermore, divergence in secondary structure profiles often occurred for LCDs enriched in physicochemically similar amino acids (e.g. valine vs. leucine), indicating that LCDs composed of related amino acids can have distinct secondary structure tendencies. Comparison of LCD secondary structure tendencies with numerous pre-existing secondary structure propensity scales resulted in relatively poor correlations for certain types of LCDs, indicating that these scales may not capture secondary structure tendencies as sequence complexity decreases. Collectively, these observations provide a highly resolved view of structural tendencies among LCDs parsed by the nature and magnitude of single amino acid enrichment.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AzngjXlIAGY" width="1" />

<p>by Erinija Pranckeviciene, Sergey Hosid, Nathan Liang, Ilya Ioshikhes</p>

Nucleosome positioning DNA sequence patterns (NPS)—usually distributions of particular dinucleotides or other sequence elements in nucleosomal DNA—at least partially determine chromatin structure and arrangements of nucleosomes that in turn affect gene expression. Statistically, NPS are defined as oscillations of the dinucleotide periodicity with about 10 base pairs (bp) which reflects the double helix period. We compared the nucleosomal DNA patterns in mouse, human and yeast organisms and observed few distinctive patterns that can be termed as packing and regulatory referring to distinctive modes of chromatin function. For the first time the NPS patterns in nucleus accumbens cells (NAC) in mouse brain were characterized and compared to the patterns in human CD4+ and apoptotic lymphocyte cells and well studied patterns in yeast. The NPS patterns in human CD4+ cells and mouse brain cells had very high positive correlation. However, there was no correlation between them and patterns in human apoptotic lymphocyte cells and yeast, but the latter two were highly correlated with each other. By their dinucleotide arrangements the analyzed NPS patterns classified into stable canonical WW/SS (W = A or T and S = C or G dinucleotide) and less stable RR/YY (R = A or G and Y = C or T dinucleotide) patterns and anti-patterns. In the anti-patterns positioning of the dinucleotides is flipped compared to those in the regular patterns. Stable canonical WW/SS patterns and anti-patterns are ubiquitously observed in many organisms and they had high resemblance between yeast and human apoptotic cells. Less stable RR/YY patterns had higher positive correlation between mouse and normal human cells. Our analysis and evidence from scientific literature lead to idea that various distinct patterns in nucleosomal DNA can be related to the two roles of the chromatin: packing (WW/SS) and regulatory (RR/YY and “anti”).<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YMSzdZ8k0CA" width="1" />

<p>by Roger J. W. Hill, Pasquale F. Innominato, Francis Lévi, Annabelle Ballesta</p>

Precision medicine requires accurate technologies for drug administration and proper systems pharmacology approaches for patient data analysis. Here, plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) data of the OPTILIV trial in which cancer patients received oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil and irinotecan via chronomodulated schedules delivered by an infusion pump into the hepatic artery were mathematically investigated. A pump-to-patient model was designed in order to accurately represent the drug solution dynamics from the pump to the patient blood. It was connected to semi-mechanistic PK models to analyse inter-patient variability in PK parameters. Large time delays of up to 1h41 between the actual pump start and the time of drug detection in patient blood was predicted by the model and confirmed by PK data. Sudden delivery spike in the patient artery due to glucose rinse after drug administration accounted for up to 10.7% of the total drug dose. New model-guided delivery profiles were designed to precisely lead to the drug exposure intended by clinicians. Next, the complete mathematical framework achieved a very good fit to individual time-concentration PK profiles and concluded that inter-subject differences in PK parameters was the lowest for irinotecan, intermediate for oxaliplatin and the largest for 5-fluorouracil. Clustering patients according to their PK parameter values revealed two patient subgroups for each drug in which inter-patient variability was largely decreased compared to that in the total population. This study provides a complete mathematical framework to optimize drug infusion pumps and inform on inter-patient PK variability, a step towards precise and personalized cancer chronotherapy.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0oUR8OKovIs" width="1" />

<p>by Rocío Vega, Manuel Carretero, Rui D. M. Travasso, Luis L. Bonilla</p>

During angiogenesis, new blood vessels sprout and grow from existing ones. This process plays a crucial role in organ development and repair, in wound healing and in numerous pathological processes such as cancer progression or diabetes. Here, we present a mathematical model of early stage angiogenesis that permits exploration of the relative importance of mechanical, chemical and cellular cues. Endothelial cells proliferate and move over an extracellular matrix by following external gradients of Vessel Endothelial Growth Factor, adhesion and stiffness, which are incorporated to a Cellular Potts model with a finite element description of elasticity. The dynamics of Notch signaling involving Delta-4 and Jagged-1 ligands determines tip cell selection and vessel branching. Through their production rates, competing Jagged-Notch and Delta-Notch dynamics determine the influence of lateral inhibition and lateral induction on the selection of cellular phenotypes, branching of blood vessels, anastomosis (fusion of blood vessels) and angiogenesis velocity. Anastomosis may be favored or impeded depending on the mechanical configuration of strain vectors in the ECM near tip cells. Numerical simulations demonstrate that increasing Jagged production results in pathological vasculatures with thinner and more abundant vessels, which can be compensated by augmenting the production of Delta ligands.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QIX_0vY3F0E" width="1" />

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Leucine‐rich glioma‐inactivated 1 (LGI1) encephalitis is the second most common antibody‐mediated encephalopathy, but insight into the intrathecal B‐cell autoimmune response, including clonal relationships, isotype distribution, frequency, and pathogenic effects of single LGI1 antibodies, has remained limited.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We cloned, expressed, and tested antibodies from 90 antibody‐secreting cells (ASCs) and B cells from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of several patients with LGI1 encephalitis.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Eighty‐four percent of the ASCs and 21% of the memory B cells encoded LGI1‐reactive antibodies, whereas reactivities to other brain epitopes were rare. All LGI1 antibodies were of IgG1, IgG2, or IgG4 isotype and had undergone affinity maturation. Seven of the overall 26 LGI1 antibodies efficiently blocked the interaction of LGI1 with its receptor ADAM22 in vitro, and their mean LGI1 signal on mouse brain sections was weak compared to the remaining, non–ADAM22‐competing antibodies. Nevertheless, both types of LGI1 antibodies increased the intrinsic cellular excitability and glutamatergic synaptic transmission of hippocampal CA3 neurons in slice cultures.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our data show that the patients’ intrathecal B‐cell autoimmune response is dominated by LGI1 antibodies and that LGI1 antibodies alone are sufficient to promote neuronal excitability, a basis of seizure generation. Fundamental differences in target specificity and antibody hypermutations compared to the CSF autoantibody repertoire in N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptor encephalitis underline the clinical concept that autoimmune encephalitides are very distinct entities.

Abstract<p>The <i>Skn-1a</i> transcription factor (<i>Pou2f3</i>) is required for Type II taste cell differentiation in taste buds. Taste buds in <i>Skn-1a</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice lack Type II taste cells but have a concomitant expansion of Type III cells, providing an ideal model to determine the relative role of taste cell types in response specificity. We confirmed that chorda tympani responses to sweet, bitter, and umami stimuli were greatly reduced in the knock-outs (KOs) compared with wild-type (WT) littermates. <i>Skn-1a</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice also had reductions to NaCl that were partially amiloride-insensitive, suggesting that both Type II and Type III cells contribute to amiloride-insensitive salt detection in anterior tongue. We also confirmed that responses to sour stimuli are equivalent in the KOs, despite the large increase in the number of Type III taste cells. To examine their innervation, we crossed the <i>Htr3a</i>-GFP (5-HT<sub>3A</sub>-GFP) reporter mouse with the <i>Skn-1a</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice and examined geniculate ganglion neurons for GFP expression and responses to 5-HT. We found no change in the number of 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>-expressing neurons with KO of <i>Skn-1a</i>. Calcium imaging showed that only 5-HT<sub>3A</sub>-expressing neurons respond to exogenous 5-HT, while most neurons respond to ATP, similar to WT mice. Interestingly, despite loss of all Type II cells, the P2X3 antagonist AF353 blocked all chorda tympani responses. These data collectively raise questions pertaining the source of ATP signaling in the absence of Type II taste cells and whether the additional Type III cells are innervated by fibers that would have normally innervated Type II cells.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Despite numerous studies, the role of specific taste cell types in taste responsivity and their connectivity to gustatory nerves is incompletely understood. Here we show that in <i>Skn-1a</i> knock-out (KO) mice where only Type I and III cells exist within taste buds, the number of gustatory ganglion cells innervating Type III cells remains unchanged and these neurons exhibit normal responses to gustatory neurotransmitters. Further, we show that although ATP release from taste buds is undetectable in <i>Skn-1a</i> KO mice, ATP is still required to drive gustatory neural output via the chorda tympani nerve. The source of the required ATP is unclear and begs further study.</p>

Abstract<p>The organization of region-to-region functional connectivity has major implications for understanding information transfer and transformation between brain regions. We extended connective field mapping methodology to 3-dimensional anatomical space to derive estimates of cortico-cortical functional organization. Using multiple publicly available human (both male and female) resting-state fMRI data samples for model testing and replication analysis, we have three main findings. First, we found that the functional connectivity between early visual regions maintained a topographic relationship along the anterior-posterior dimension, which corroborates previous research. Higher order visual regions showed a pattern of connectivity that supports convergence and biased sampling, which has implications for their receptive field properties. Second, we demonstrated that topographic organization is a fundamental aspect of functional connectivity across the entire cortex, with higher topographic connectivity between regions within a functional network than across networks. The principle gradient of topographic connectivity across the cortex resembled whole brain gradients found in previous work. Last but not least, we showed that the organization of higher order regions such as the lateral prefrontal cortex demonstrate functional gradients of topographic connectivity and convergence. These organizational features of the lateral prefrontal cortex predict task based activation patterns, particularly visual specialization and higher order rules. In sum, these findings suggest that topographic input is a fundamental motif of functional connectivity between cortical regions for information processing and transfer, with maintenance of topography potentially important for preserving the integrity of information from one region to another.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Quantifying spatial patterns of region-to-region functional connectivity provides an avenue for testing theories of corticocortical information transformation and organization. This work demonstrates that this quantification is feasible not only in early visual cortex, but even in highly multimodal regions where spatial topography is less clear. Overall, we show that topographic relationships as a common motif functional connectivity across the cortex between regions within the same functional network and that analyzing the lateral prefrontal cortex in terms of topographic connectivity reveals organizational features that voxelwise connectivity analysis misses.</p>

<p>Electrical stimulation of residual nerves can be used to provide amputees
with intuitive sensory feedback. An important aspect of this artificial sensory
feedback is the ability to convey the magnitude of tactile stimuli. Using
classical psychophysical methods, we quantified the just-noticeable differences
for electrocutaneous stimulation pulse frequency in both intact participants
and one transradial amputee. For the transradial amputee, we also quantified
the just-noticeable difference of intraneural microstimulation pulse frequency
via chronically implanted Utah Slanted Electrode Arrays. We demonstrate that
intensity discrimination is similar across conditions: intraneural
microstimulation of the residual nerves, electrocutaneous stimulation of the
reinnervated skin on the residual limb, and electrocutaneous stimulation of
intact hands. We also show that intensity discrimination performance is
significantly better at lower pulse frequencies than at higher ones - a finding
that's unique to electrocutaneous and intraneural stimulation and suggests that
supplemental sensory cues may be present at lower pulse frequencies. These
results can help guide the implementation of artificial sensory feedback for
sensorized bionic arms.

<p>Intuitive control of prostheses relies on training algorithms to correlate
biological recordings to motor intent. The quality of the training dataset is
critical to run-time performance, but it is difficult to label hand kinematics
accurately after the hand has been amputated. We quantified the accuracy and
precision of labeling hand kinematics for two different approaches: 1) assuming
a participant is perfectly mimicking predetermined motions of a prosthesis
(mimicked training), and 2) assuming a participant is perfectly mirroring their
contralateral hand during identical bilateral movements (mirrored training). We
compared these approaches in non-amputee individuals, using an infrared camera
to track eight different joint angles of the hands in real-time. Aggregate data
revealed that mimicked training does not account for biomechanical coupling or
temporal changes in hand posture. Mirrored training was significantly more
accurate and precise at labeling hand kinematics. However, when training a
modified Kalman filter to estimate motor intent, the mimicked and mirrored
training approaches were not significantly different. The results suggest that
the mirrored training approach creates a more faithful but more complex
dataset. Advanced algorithms, more capable of learning the complex mirrored
training dataset, may yield better run-time prosthetic control.

<p>Multiarticulate bionic arms are now capable of mimicking the endogenous
movements of the human hand. 3D-printing has reduced the cost of prosthetic
hands themselves, but there is currently no low-cost alternative to dexterous
electromyographic (EMG) control systems. To address this need, we developed an
inexpensive (~$675) and portable EMG control system by integrating low-cost
microcontrollers with an EMG acquisition device. We validated signal
acquisition by comparing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of our system with
that of a high-end research-grade system. We also demonstrate the ability to
use the low-cost control system for proportional and independent control of
various prosthetic hands in real-time. We found that the SNR of the low-cost
control system was statistically no worse than 44% of the SNR of a
research-grade control system. The RMSEs of predicted hand movements (from a
modified Kalman filter) were typically a few percent better than, and not more
than 6% worse than, RMSEs of a research-grade system for up to six degrees of
freedom when only relatively few (six) EMG electrodes were used. However, RMSEs
were generally higher than RMSEs of research-grade systems that utilize
considerably more (32) EMG electrodes, guiding future work towards increasing
electrode count. Successful instantiation of this low-cost control system
constitutes an important step towards the commercialization and wide-spread
availability of dexterous bionic hands.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/53406">LAR receptor phospho-tyrosine phosphatases regulate NMDA-receptor responses</a></h4>

LAR-type receptor phosphotyrosine-phosphatases (LAR-RPTPs) are presynaptic adhesion molecules that interact trans-synaptically with multitudinous postsynaptic adhesion molecules, including SliTrks, SALMs, and TrkC. Via these interactions, LAR-RPTPs are thought to function as synaptogenic wiring molecules that promote neural circuit formation by mediating the establishment of synapses. To test the synaptogenic functions of LAR-RPTPs, we conditionally deleted the genes encoding all three LAR-RPTPs, singly or in combination, in mice before synapse formation. Strikingly, deletion of LAR-RPTPs had no effect on synaptic connectivity in cultured neurons or in vivo, but impaired NMDA-receptor-mediated responses. Deletion of LAR-RPTPs decreased NMDA-receptor-mediated responses by a trans-synaptic mechanism. In cultured neurons, deletion of all LAR-RPTPs led to a reduction in synaptic NMDA-receptor EPSCs, without changing the subunit composition or the protein levels of NMDA-receptors. In vivo, deletion of all LAR-RPTPs in the hippocampus at birth also did not alter synaptic connectivity as measured via AMPA-receptor-mediated synaptic responses at Schaffer-collateral synapses monitored in juvenile mice, but again decreased NMDA-receptor mediated synaptic transmission. Thus, LAR-RPTPs are not essential for synapse formation, but control synapse properties by regulating postsynaptic NMDA-receptors via a trans-synaptic mechanism that likely involves binding to one or multiple postsynaptic ligands.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Spontaneous recovery is an important determinant of upper extremity recovery after stroke and has been described by the 70% proportional recovery rule for the Fugl–Meyer motor upper extremity (FM‐UE) scale. However, this rule is criticized for overestimating the predictability of FM‐UE recovery. Our objectives were to develop a longitudinal mixture model of FM‐UE recovery, identify FM‐UE recovery subgroups, and internally validate the model predictions.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We developed an exponential recovery function with the following parameters: subgroup assignment probability, proportional recovery coefficient <span>
   <i>r</i>
   <sub>
      <i>k</i>
   </sub>
</span>, time constant in weeks <span>
   <i>τ</i>
   <sub>
      <i>k</i>
   </sub>
</span>, and distribution of the initial FM‐UE scores. We fitted the model to FM‐UE measurements of 412 first‐ever ischemic stroke patients and cross‐validated endpoint predictions and FM‐UE recovery cluster assignment.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The model distinguished 5 subgroups with different recovery parameters (<span>
   <i>r</i>
   <sub>1</sub> = 0.09</span>, <span>
   <i>τ</i>
   <sub>1</sub> = 5.3</span>, <span>
   <i>r</i>
   <sub>2</sub> = 0.46</span>, <span>
   <i>τ</i>
   <sub>2</sub> = 10.1</span>, <span>
   <i>r</i>
   <sub>3</sub> = 0.86</span>, <span>
   <i>τ</i>
   <sub>3</sub> = 9.8</span>, <span>
   <i>r</i>
   <sub>4</sub> = 0.89</span>, <span>
   <i>τ</i>
   <sub>4</sub> = 2.7</span>, <span>
   <i>r</i>
   <sub>5</sub> = 0.93</span>, <span>
   <i>τ</i>
   <sub>5</sub> = 1.2</span>). Endpoint FM‐UE was predicted with a median absolute error of 4.8 (interquartile range [IQR] = 1.3–12.8) at 1 week poststroke and 4.2 (IQR = 1.3–9.8) at 2 weeks. Overall accuracy of assignment to the poor (subgroup 1), moderate (subgroups 2 and 3), and good (subgroups 4 and 5) FM‐UE recovery clusters was 0.79 (95% equal‐tailed interval [ETI] = 0.78–0.80) at 1 week poststroke and 0.81 (95% ETI = 0.80–0.82) at 2 weeks.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>FM‐UE recovery reflects different subgroups, each with its own recovery profile. Cross‐validation indicates that FM‐UE endpoints and FM‐UE recovery clusters can be well predicted. Results will contribute to the understanding of upper limb recovery patterns in the first 6 months after stroke. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Long‐term cognitive decline is an adverse outcome after major surgery associated with increased risk for mortality and morbidity. We studied the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum biochemical inflammatory response to a standardized orthopedic surgical procedure and the possible association with long‐term changes in cognitive function. We hypothesized that the CSF inflammatory response pattern after surgery would differ in patients having long‐term cognitive decline defined as a composite cognitive <i>z</i> score of ≥1.0 compared to patients without long‐term cognitive decline at 3 months postsurgery.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Serum and CSF biomarkers of inflammation and blood–brain barrier (BBB) integrity were measured preoperatively and up to 48 hours postoperatively, and cognitive function was assessed preoperatively and at 2 to 5 days and 3 months postoperatively.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Surgery was associated with a pronounced increase in inflammatory biomarkers in both CSF and blood throughout the 48‐hour study period. A principal component (PC) analysis was performed on 52 inflammatory biomarkers. The 2 first PC (PC1 and PC2) construct outcome variables on CSF biomarkers were significantly associated with long‐term cognitive decline at 3 months, but none of the PC construct serum variables showed a significant association with long‐term cognitive decline at 3 months. Patients both with and patients without long‐term cognitive decline showed early transient increases of the astroglial biomarkers S‐100B and glial fibrillary acidic protein in CSF, and in BBB permeability (CSF/serum albumin ratio).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Surgery rapidly triggers a temporal neuroinflammatory response closely associated with long‐term cognitive outcome postsurgery. The findings of this explorative study require validation in a larger surgical patient cohort. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

High-throughput sequencing has become ubiquitous in biomedical sciences. As new technologies emerge and sequencing costs decline, the diversity and volume of available data increases exponentially, and successfully navigating the data becomes more challenging. Though datasets are often hosted by public repositories, scientists must rely on inconsistent annotation to identify and interpret meaningful data. Moreover, the experimental heterogeneity and wide-ranging quality of high-throughput biological data means that even data with desired cell lines, tissue types, or molecular targets may not be readily interpretable or integrated. We have developed ORSO (Online Resource for Social Omics) as an easy-to-use web application to connect life scientists with genomics data. In ORSO, users interact within a data-driven social network, where they can favorite datasets and follow other users. In addition to more than 30,000 datasets hosted from major biomedical consortia, users may contribute their own data to ORSO, facilitating its discovery by other users. Leveraging user interactions, ORSO provides a novel recommendation system to automatically connect users with hosted data. In addition to social interactions, the recommendation system considers primary read coverage information and annotated metadata. Similarities used by the recommendation system are presented by ORSO in a graph display, allowing exploration of dataset associations. The topology of the network graph reflects established biology, with samples from related systems grouped together. We tested the recommendation system using an RNA-seq time course dataset from differentiation of embryonic stem cells to cardiomyocytes. The ORSO recommendation system correctly predicted early data point sources as embryonic stem cells and late data point sources as heart and muscle samples, resulting in recommendation of related datasets. By connecting scientists with relevant data, ORSO provides a critical new service that facilitates wide-ranging research interests.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/i1I_hz584xs" width="1" />

<p>by Rasmus S. Petersen, Andrea Colins Rodriguez, Mathew H. Evans, Dario Campagner, Michaela S. E. Loft</p>

Quantification of behaviour is essential for biology. Since the whisker system is a popular model system, it is important to have methods for measuring whisker movements from behaving animals. Here, we developed a high-speed imaging system that measures whisker movements simultaneously from two vantage points. We developed a whisker tracker algorithm that automatically reconstructs 3D whisker information directly from the ‘stereo’ video data. The tracker is controlled via a Graphical User Interface that also allows user-friendly curation. The algorithm tracks whiskers, by fitting a 3D Bezier curve to the basal section of each target whisker. By using prior knowledge of natural whisker motion and natural whisker shape to constrain the fits and by minimising the number of fitted parameters, the algorithm is able to track multiple whiskers in parallel with low error rate. We used the output of the tracker to produce a 3D description of each tracked whisker, including its 3D orientation and 3D shape, as well as bending-related mechanical force. In conclusion, we present a non-invasive, automatic system to track whiskers in 3D from high-speed video, creating the opportunity for comprehensive 3D analysis of sensorimotor behaviour and its neural basis.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0cGdliKtXMc" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To systematically investigate causal relationships between obesity and cerebrovascular disease, and the extent to which hypertension and hyperglycemia mediate the effect of obesity on cerebrovascular disease.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used summary statistics from genome‐wide association studies for body mass index (BMI), waist‐to‐hip ratio (WHR) and multiple cerebrovascular disease phenotypes. We explored causal associations with two‐sample Mendelian randomization (MR) accounting for genetic covariation between BMI and WHR; and assessed what proportion of the association between obesity and cerebrovascular disease was mediated by systolic blood pressure (SBP) and blood glucose levels respectively.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Genetic predisposition to higher BMI did not increase the risk of cerebrovascular disease. In contrast, for each 10% increase in WHR there was a 75% increase (95% confidence interval (CI)=44%‐113%) in risk for large artery ischemic stroke, a 57% (CI=29%‐91%) increase in risk for small vessel ischemic stroke, a 197% increase (CI=59%‐457%) in risk of intracerebral hemorrhage, as well as an increase in white matter hyperintensity volume (β=0.11; CI=0.01‐0.21). These WHR associations persisted after adjusting for genetic determinants of BMI. Approximately one tenth of the observed effect of WHR was mediated by SBP for ischemic stroke (12%; CI=4%‐20%), but no evidence of mediation was found for average blood glucose.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Abdominal adiposity may trigger causal pathological processes, partially independent from blood pressure and totally independent from glucose levels, that lead to cerebrovascular disease. Potential targets of these pathological processes could represent novel therapeutic opportunities for stroke.</p>

Abstract
<p>Estrogen and progesterone (P4) act in neural circuits to elicit lordosis, the stereotypical female sexual receptivity behavior. Estradiol acts through membrane receptors to rapidly activate a limbic-hypothalamic circuit consisting of the arcuate (ARH), medial preoptic (MPN), and ventromedial (VMH) nuclei of the hypothalamus. This initial activation results in a transient but necessary inhibition of lordosis, which appears to be a result of the release of β-endorphin (β-End) from proopiomelanocortin (POMC) terminals onto cells containing the µ-opioid receptor (MOR) in the MPN. To functionally examine the role of the MOR in the hypothalamic lordosis circuit, we transfected a channelrhodopsin (ChR2) adeno-associated virus into POMC cell bodies in the ARH and photostimulated POMC/β-End axon terminals in the MPN in sexually receptive female Pomc-cre mice. Following estrogen and P4 priming, sexual receptivity was assessed by measuring the lordosis quotient (LQ). Following an initial trial for sexual receptivity, mice were photostimulated during behavioral testing, and brains were processed for MOR immunohistochemistry (IHC). Photostimulation decreased the LQ only in ChR2-expressing Pomc-cre mice. Furthermore, photostimulation of ChR2 in POMC/β-End axon terminals in the MPN resulted in the internalization of MOR, indicating activation of the receptor. Our results suggest that the activation of the MOR in the MPN is sufficient to attenuate lordosis behavior in a hormone-primed, sexually receptive female mouse. These data support a central role of MOR in female sexual behavior, and provide further insight into the hypothalamus control of sexual receptivity.</p>

Abstract
<p>Multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) are being more widely used by researchers as an instrument platform for monitoring prolonged, non-destructive recordings of spontaneously firing neurons <i>in vitro</i> for applications in modeling Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, schizophrenia, and many other diseases of the human CNS. With the more widespread use of these instruments, there is a need to examine the prior art of studies utilizing MEAs and delineate best practices for data acquisition and analysis to avoid errors in interpretation of the resultant data. Using a dataset of recordings from primary rat (<i>Rattus norvegicus</i>) cortical cultures, methods and statistical power for discerning changes in neuronal activity on the array level are examined. Further, a method for unsupervised spike sorting is implemented, allowing for the resolution of action potential incidents down to the single neuron level. Following implementation of spike sorting, the dynamics of firing frequency across populations of individual neurons and networks are examined longitudinally. Finally, the ability to detect a frequency independent phenotype, the change in action potential amplitude, is demonstrated through the use of pore-forming neurotoxin treatments. Taken together, this study provides guidance and tools for users wishing to incorporate multi-well MEA usage into their studies.</p>

Abstract<p>Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a debilitating chronic pain disorder typically in the upper or lower limbs. Whilst CRPS usually develops from a peripheral event, it is likely maintained by central nervous system changes. Indeed CRPS is reported to be associated with sensorimotor cortex changes, or functional ‘reorganisation’, as well as deficits such as poor tactile acuity. Whilst the mechanisms underpinning cortical reorganisation in CRPS are unknown, some have hypothesised that it involves disinhibition, i.e. a reduction in gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) activity. In this study we addressed this hypothesis by using edited magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to determine sensorimotor GABA and glutamate concentrations in 16 humans with CRPS and 30 matched controls and the relationship of these concentrations with tactile acuity. We found that individuals with upper limb CRPS displayed reduced tactile acuity in the painful hand compared with the non-painful hand and pain-free controls. Despite this acuity deficit, CRPS was not associated with altered GABA or glutamate concentrations within the sensorimotor cortex on either the side that represents the affected or unaffected hand. Furthermore, there was no significant relationship between sensorimotor GABA or glutamate concentrations and tactile acuity in CRPS or control subjects. Although our sample was small, these data suggest that CRPS is not associated with altered total sensorimotor GABA or glutamate concentrations. Whilst these results are at odds with the sensorimotor cortex disinhibition hypothesis, it is possible that GABAergic mechanisms other than total GABA concentration may contribute to such disinhibition.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Complex regional pain syndrome is a debilitating chronic pain disorder that usually affects the limbs. It is associated with altered sensorimotor cortex function including reorganisation and reduced tactile acuity, which are thought to result from reduced on-going inhibition. However, we found that this pain condition is not associated with reduced on-going sensorimotor inhibition in the form of gamma-Aminobutyric acid concentration, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. These findings strongly suggest that changes in sensorimotor function in individuals with complex regional pain syndrome are explained by factors other than neurotransmitter concentration.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>REM‐sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a prodromal synucleinopathy, as &gt;80% will eventually convert to overt synucleinopathy. We performed an in‐depth analysis of the <i>SNCA</i> locus to identify RBD‐specific risk variants.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Full sequencing and genotyping of <i>SNCA</i> was performed in isolated/idiopathic RBD (iRBD, n=1,076), Parkinson's disease (PD, n=1,013), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB, n=415), and in control subjects (n=6,155). iRBD cases were diagnosed with RBD prior to neurodegeneration, although some have since converted. A replication cohort from 23andMe of PD patients with probable RBD (pRBD) was also analyzed (cases n=1,782, controls n=131,250). Adjusted logistic regression models and meta‐analyses were performed. Effects on conversion rate were analyzed in 432 RBD patients with available data using Kaplan‐Meier survival analysis.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A 5'‐region <i>SNCA</i> variant (rs10005233) was associated with iRBD (OR=1.43, <i>p</i>=1.1E‐08), which was replicated in pRBD. This variant is in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with other 5' risk variants across the different synucleinopathies. An independent iRBD‐specific suggestive association (rs11732740) was detected at the 3' of <i>SNCA</i> (OR=1.32, <i>p</i>=4.7E‐04, not statistically significant after Bonferroni correction). Homozygous carriers of both iRBD‐specific SNPs were at highly increased risk for iRBD (OR=5.74, <i>p</i>=2E‐06). The known top PD‐associated variant (3' variant rs356182) had an opposite direction of effect in iRBD compared to PD.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>There is a distinct pattern of association at the <i>SNCA</i> locus in RBD as compared to PD, with an opposite direction of effect at the 3' of <i>SNCA</i>. Several 5' <i>SNCA</i> variants are associated with iRBD and with pRBD in overt synucleinopathies.</p>

<p>Recent studies have proposed that one can summarize brain activity into
dynamics among a relatively small number of hidden states and that such an
approach is a promising tool for revealing brain function. Hidden Markov models
(HMMs) are a prevalent approach to inferring dynamics among discrete states in
neural data. However, the validity of modeling neural time series data with
HMMs has not been established. Here, to address this situation and examine the
performance of the HMM, we compare it with the Gaussian mixture model (GMM),
which is a statistically simpler model than the HMM with no assumption of
Markovianity. We do so by applying both models to synthetic and empirical
resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. We find that
the GMM allows us to interpret the sequence of the estimated hidden states as a
time series obeying some patterns. We show that GMMs are often better than HMMs
in terms of the accuracy and consistency of estimating the time course of the
hidden state. These results suggest that GMMs can be a model of first choice
for investigating hidden-state dynamics in data even if the time series is
apparently not memoryless.

<p>Recent advances in brain recording technology and artificial intelligence are
propelling a new paradigm in neuroscience beyond the traditional controlled
experiment. Naturalistic neuroscience studies neural computations associated
with spontaneous behaviors performed in unconstrained settings. Analyzing such
unstructured data lacking a priori experimental design remains a significant
challenge, especially when the data is multi-modal and long-term. Here we
describe an automated approach for analyzing large ($\approx$250 GB/subject)
datasets of simultaneously recorded human electrocorticography (ECoG) and
naturalistic behavior video data for 12 subjects. Our pipeline discovers and
annotates thousands of instances of human upper-limb movement events in
long-term (7--9 day) naturalistic behavior data using a combination of computer
vision, discrete latent-variable modeling, and string pattern-matching.
Analysis of the simultaneously recorded brain data uncovers neural signatures
of movement that corroborate prior findings from traditional controlled
experiments. We also prototype a decoder for a movement initiation detection
task to demonstrate the efficacy of our pipeline as a source of training data
for brain-computer interfacing applications. We plan to publish our curated
dataset, which captures naturalistic neural and behavioral variability at a
scale not previously available. We believe this data will enable further
research on models of neural function and decoding that incorporate such

<p>Recent whole brain imaging experiments on $\textit{C. elegans}$ has revealed
that the neural population dynamics encode motor commands and stereotyped
transitions between behaviors on low dimensional manifolds. Efforts to
characterize the dynamics on this manifold have used piecewise linear models to
describe the entire state space, but it is unknown how a single, global
dynamical model can generate the observed dynamics. Here, we propose a control
framework to achieve such a global model of the dynamics, whereby underlying
linear dynamics is actuated by sparse control signals. This method learns the
control signals in an unsupervised way from data, then uses $\textit{ Dynamic
Mode Decomposition with control}$ (DMDc) to create the first global, linear
dynamical system that can reconstruct whole-brain imaging data. These control
signals are shown to be implicated in transitions between behaviors. In
addition, we analyze the time-delay encoding of these control signals, showing
that these transitions can be predicted from neurons previously implicated in
behavioral transitions, but also additional neurons previously unidentified.
Moreover, our decomposition method allows one to understand the observed
nonlinear global dynamics instead as linear dynamics with control. The proposed
mathematical framework is generic and can be generalized to other neurosensory
systems, potentially revealing transitions and their encodings in a completely
unsupervised way.

<p>Recent whole-brain calcium imaging recordings of the nematode C. elegans have
demonstrated that neural activity is dominated by dynamics on a low-dimensional
manifold that can be clustered according to behavioral states. Despite progress
in modeling the dynamics with linear or locally linear models, it remains
unclear how a single network of neurons can produce the observed features. In
particular, there are multiple clusters, or fixed points, observed in the data
which cannot be characterized by a single linear model. We propose a nonlinear
control model which is global and parameterized by only four free parameters
that match the features displayed by the low-dimensional C. elegans neural
activity. In addition to reproducing the average probability distribution of
the data, long and short time-scale changes in transition statistics can be
characterized via changes in a single parameter. Some of these macro-scale
transitions have experimental correlates to single neuro-modulators that seem
to act as biological controls, allowing this model to generate testable
hypotheses about the effect of these neuro-modulators on the global dynamics.
The theory provides an elegant characterization of the neuron population
dynamics in C. elegans. Moreover, the mathematical structure of the nonlinear
control framework provides a paradigm that can be generalized to more complex
systems with an arbitrary number of behavioral states.

<p>The ability to record from increasingly large numbers of neurons, and the
increasing attention being paid to large scale neural network simulations,
demands computationally fast algorithms to compute relevant statistical
measures. We present an O(n) algorithm for calculating the Kendall correlation
of spike trains, a correlation measure that is becoming especially recognized
as an important tool in neuroscience. We show that our method is around 50
times faster than the O (n ln n) method which is a current standard for quickly
computing the Kendall correlation. In addition to providing a faster algorithm,
we emphasize the role that taking the specific nature of spike trains had on
reducing the run time. We imagine that there are many other useful algorithms
that can be even more significantly sped up when taking this into
consideration. A MATLAB function executing the method described here has been
made freely available on-line.

<p>Tinnitus is one of the most prevalent auditory disorders worldwide, manifesting in both chronic and acute forms. The pathology of tinnitus has been mechanistically linked to induction of harmful neural plasticity stemming from traumatic noise exposure, exposure to ototoxic medications, input deprivation from age-related hearing loss, and in response to injuries or disorders damaging the conductive apparatus of the ears, the cochlear hair cells, the ganglionic cells of the VIIIth cranial nerve, or neurons of the classical auditory pathway which link the cochlear nuclei through the inferior colliculi and medial geniculate nuclei to auditory cortices. Research attempting to more specifically characterize the neural plasticity occurring in tinnitus have used a wide range of techniques, experimental paradigms, and sampled at different windows of time to reach different conclusions about why and which specific brain regions are crucial in the induction or ongoing maintenance of tinnitus-related plasticity. Despite differences in experimental methodologies, evidence reveals similar findings that strongly suggest that immediate and prolonged activation of non-classical auditory structures (i.e., amygdala, hippocampus, and cingulate cortex) may contribute to the initiation and development of tinnitus in addition to the ongoing maintenance of this devastating condition. The overarching focus of this review, therefore, is to highlight findings from the field supporting the hypothesis that abnormal early activation of non-classical sensory limbic regions are involved in tinnitus induction, with activation of these regions continuing to occur at different temporal stages. Since initial/early stages of tinnitus are difficult to control and to quantify in human clinical populations, a number of different animal paradigms have been developed and assessed in experimental investigations. Reviews of traumatic noise exposure and ototoxic doses of sodium salicylate, the most prevalently used animal models to induce experimental tinnitus, indicate early limbic system plasticity (within hours, minutes, or days after initial insult), supports subsequent plasticity in other auditory regions, and contributes to the pathophysiology of tinnitus. Understanding this early plasticity presents additional opportunities for intervention to reduce or eliminate tinnitus from the human condition.</p>

<p>Opioid drugs are the gold standard for the management of pain, but their use is severely limited by dangerous and unpleasant side effects. All clinically available opioid analgesics bind to and activate the mu-opioid receptor (MOR), a heterotrimeric G-protein-coupled receptor, to produce analgesia. The activity of these receptors is modulated by a family of intracellular RGS proteins or regulators of G-protein signaling proteins, characterized by the presence of a conserved RGS Homology (RH) domain. These proteins act as negative regulators of G-protein signaling by serving as GTPase accelerating proteins or GAPS to switch off signaling by both the Gα and βγ subunits of heterotrimeric G-proteins. Consequently, knockdown or knockout of RGS protein activity enhances signaling downstream of MOR. In this review we discuss current knowledge of how this activity, across the different families of RGS proteins, modulates MOR activity, as well as activity of other members of the opioid receptor family, and so pain and analgesia in animal models, with particular emphasis on RGS4 and RGS9 families. We discuss inhibition of RGS proteins with small molecule inhibitors that bind to sensitive cysteine moieties in the RH domain and the potential for targeting this family of intracellular proteins as adjuncts to provide an opioid sparing effect or as standalone analgesics by promoting the activity of endogenous opioid peptides. Overall, we conclude that RGS proteins may be a novel drug target to provide analgesia with reduced opioid-like side effects, but that much basic work is needed to define the roles for specific RGS proteins, particularly in chronic pain, as well as a need to develop newer inhibitors.</p>

<p>Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) caused by herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection can lead to a high mortality rate and severe neurological sequelae. The destruction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is an important pathological mechanism for the development of HSE. However, the specific mechanism underlying the BBB destruction remains unclear. Our previous study found that the Golgi apparatus (GA) plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the BBB. Therefore, this present study aimed to investigate the role of the GA in the destruction of the BBB and its underlying mechanisms. Mouse brain endothelial cells (Bend.3) were cultured to establish a BBB model in vitro, and then infected with HSV-1. The results showed that HSV-1 infection caused downregulation of the Golgi-associated protein GM130, accompanied by Golgi fragmentation, cell apoptosis, and downregulation of tight junction proteins occludin and claudin 5. Knockdown of GM130 with small interfering RNA in uninfected Bend.3 cells triggered Golgi fragmentation, apoptosis, and downregulation of occludin and claudin 5. However, overexpression of GM130 in HSV-1 infected Bend.3 cells by transient transfection partially attenuated the aforementioned damage caused by HSV-1 infection. When the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk was used after HSV-1 infection to inhibit apoptosis, the protein levels of GM130, occludin and claudin 5 were partially restored. Taken together, these observations indicate that HSV-1 infection of Bend.3 cells triggers a GM130-mediated Golgi stress response that is involved in apoptosis, which in turn results in downregulation of occludin and claudin 5 protein levels. Meanwhile, GM130 downregulation is partially due to apoptosis triggered by HSV-1 infection. Our findings reveal an association between the GA and the BBB during HSV-1 infection and identify potentially novel targets for protecting the BBB and therapeutic approaches for patients with HSE.</p>

<p>Astrocytes are the most abundant type of glial cells in the brain, and they play a key role in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Fibroblast Growth Factor-2 (FGF-2) has been implicated as a potential therapeutic agent for treating AD. In the present study, we investigated the protective effects of low molecular weight (LMW; 17 KDa) and high molecular weight (HMW; 23 KDa) forms of FGF-2 on Aβ<sub>1–42</sub>-induced toxicity, and proliferation in astrocytes. We show that both isoforms of FGF-2 have similar protective effects against Aβ<sub>1–42</sub>-induced cytotoxicity in primary cultured cortical astrocytes as measured by Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay. Additionally, 17 KDa FGF-2 significantly promoted astrocyte proliferation as measured by Trypan Blue, DRAQ5 and 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU) staining, but not 23 kDa FGF-2. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that AKT signaling pathway was required for the protective and proliferative effects of FGF-2. Downstream effector studies indicated that 17 kDa FGF-2 promoted astrocyte proliferation by enhanced expression of c-Myc, Cyclin D1, Cyclin E. Furthermore, our data suggested that Cyclin D1 was required for the proliferative effect of LMW FGF2 in astrocytes. Taken together, our findings provide important information for the similarities and differences between 23 kDa and17 kDa isoforms of FGF-2 on astrocyte survival and proliferation.</p>

<p>Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) are two major forms of synaptic plasticity that are widely accepted as cellular mechanisms involved in learning and memory. Metaplasticity is a process whereby modifications in synaptic processes shift the threshold for subsequent plasticity. While metaplasticity has been functionally observed, its molecular basis is not well understood. Here, we report that neurogranin (Ng) regulates metaplasticity by shifting the threshold toward potentiation, i.e., increasing Ng in hippocampal neurons lowers the threshold for LTP and augments the threshold for LTD. We also show that Ng does not change the ultrastructural localization of calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein Kinase II (CaMKII) or calcineurin, critical enzymes for the induction of LTP and LTD, respectively. Interestingly, while CaMKII concentrates close to the plasma membrane, calcineurin concentrates away from the plasma membrane. These data, along with the previous observation showing Ng targets CaM closer to the plasma membrane, suggesting that shifting the localization of CaM within the dendritic spines and closer to the plasma membrane, where there is more CaMKII, may be favoring the activation of CaMKII vs. that of calcineurin. Thus, the regulation of CaM localization/targeting within dendritic spines by Ng may provide a mechanistic basis for the regulation of metaplasticity.</p>

<p>Spaced training is robustly superior to massed training, which is a well-documented phenomenon in humans and animals. However, the mechanisms underlying the spacing effect still remain unclear. We have reported previously that spacing training exerts memory-enhancing effects by inhibiting forgetting via decreasing hippocampal Rac1 activity. Here, using contextual fear conditioning in rat, we found that spaced but not massed training increased hippocampal 5-HT2A receptors’ expression. Furthermore, hippocampal administration of 5-HT2A receptor antagonist MDL11939 before spaced training blocked the enhanced memory, while hippocampal administration of 5-HT2A receptor agonist TCB-2 before massed training promoted the memory. Moreover, MDL11939 activated hippocampal Rac1, while TCB-2 decreased hippocampal Rac1 activity in naïve rats. These results indicated the possibility of interaction between 5-HT2A receptors and Rac1, which was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Our study first demonstrates that activation of hippocampal 5-HT2A is a mechanism underlying the spacing effect, and forgetting related molecular Rac1 is engaged in this process through interacting with 5-HT2A receptors, which suggest a promising strategy to modulate abnormal learning in cognitive disorders.</p>

<p>Spinal motoneurons exhibit sustained afterdischarges and plateau potentials following a brief high-frequency stimulation of Ia afferents. Also, there is evidence that spinal cord interneurons exhibit plateau potentials. However, to our knowledge, there are no reports about the possible afterdischarge behavior of lumbar spinal interneurons activated by Ia afferents. Given that there are spinal interneurons receiving monosynaptic inputs from Ia afferents, these cells could then be activated in parallel to motoneurons after repetitive muscle stretch. We explored this possibility in cats with a precollicular-postmammillary decerebration. We found that a brief high-frequency stimulation of Ia afferents produces afterdischarges that are highly correlated to a DC slow potential recorded at the cord dorsum. We conclude that in the cat spinal cord, not only the motoneurons but also the interneurons from the superficial and deep dorsal horn produce sustained afterdischarges, thus highlighting the importance of interneurons in the spinal neuronal circuitry. The significance of our finding is that it opens the possibility that the spinal cord interneurons activated by Ia afferents could also exhibit bistability, a relevant phenomenon well-characterized in the motoneurons.</p>

<p>Performing an accurate segmentation of the hippocampus from brain magnetic resonance images is a crucial task in neuroimaging research, since its structural integrity is strongly related to several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Some automatic segmentation tools are already being used, but, in recent years, new deep learning (DL) based methods have been proven to be much more accurate in various medical image segmentation tasks. In this work, we propose a DL-based hippocampus segmentation framework that embeds statistical shape of the hippocampus as context information into the deep neural network (DNN). The inclusion of shape information is achieved with three main steps: (1) a U-Net based segmentation, (2) a shape model estimation and (3) a second U-Net based segmentation which uses both the original input data and the fitted shape model. The trained DL architectures were tested on image data of three diagnostic groups (AD patients, subjects with mild cognitive impairment and controls) from two cohorts (ADNI and AddNeuroMed). Both intra-cohort validation and cross-cohort validation were performed and compared with the conventional U-net architecture and some variations with other types of context information (i.e. autocontext and tissue-class context). Our results suggest that adding shape information can improve the segmentation accuracy in cross-cohort validation, i.e. when DNNs are trained on one cohort and applied to another. However, no significant benefit is observed in intra-cohort validation, i.e. training and testing DNNs on images from the same cohort. Moreover, compared to other types of context information, the use of shape context was shown to be the most successful in increasing the accuracy, while keeping the computational time in the order of a few minutes.</p>

<p>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms are prevalent in both civilian and military service members. As the number of smartphone-based applications (apps) grows rapidly in health care, apps are also increasingly used to help individuals with subthreshold PTSD or full PTSD. Yet, if the apps are self-managed, the feasibility and efficacy of such interventions are still rather unclear in these two populations with PTSD symptoms. Hence, the present meta-analysis set out to evaluate the effect of self-management smartphone-based apps on PTSD and depressive symptoms in populations with subthreshold PTSD or full PTSD. Studies were included if they conducted randomized controlled trials or pre-post comparisons. Six studies (n = 2 randomized controlled trials) were identified for meta-analysis. In pre-post comparisons, N = 209 participants were included in the analyses. In randomized controlled trials, N = 87 participants received smartphone-based self-management interventions and N = 82 participants were in waitlist control conditions. Meta-analysis for pre-post comparisons concluded an effect of g = 0.55 (p &lt; 0.001) regarding the overall reduction in PTSD symptoms (n = 6) and g = 0.45 (p &lt; 0.001) for reduction in depressive symptoms (n = 5). Yet, in randomized controlled trials, no significant difference was found between app-based treatment and waitlist control groups (g = 0.09, p = 0.574). The duration of the interventions did not significantly influence the results. Overall, despite positive pre-post effects, current results indicate that smartphone-apps for PTSD patients are not significantly more effective than waitlist control conditions. Nevertheless, a combined smartphone and standard therapy approach may be a fruitful field for future research.</p>

<p>The manual brain tumor annotation process is time consuming and resource consuming, therefore, an automated and accurate brain tumor segmentation tool is greatly in demand. In this paper, we introduce a novel method to integrate location information with the state-of-the-art patch-based neural networks for brain tumor segmentation. This is motivated by the observation that lesions are not uniformly distributed across different brain parcellation regions and that a locality-sensitive segmentation is likely to obtain better segmentation accuracy. Toward this, we use an existing brain parcellation atlas in the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space and map this atlas to the individual subject data. This mapped atlas in the subject data space is integrated with structural Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging data, and patch-based neural networks, including 3D U-Net and DeepMedic, are trained to classify the different brain lesions. Multiple state-of-the-art neural networks are trained and integrated with XGBoost fusion in the proposed two-level ensemble method. The first level reduces the uncertainty of the same type of models with different seed initializations, and the second level leverages the advantages of different types of neural network models. The proposed location information fusion method improves the segmentation performance of state-of-the-art networks including 3D U-Net and DeepMedic. Our proposed ensemble also achieves better segmentation performance compared to the state-of-the-art networks in BraTS 2017 and rivals state-of-the-art networks in BraTS 2018. Detailed results are provided on the public multimodal brain tumor segmentation (BraTS) benchmarks.</p>

<p>The coordination of brain activity between disparate neural populations is highly dynamic. Investigations into intrinsic brain organization by evaluating dynamic resting-state functional connectivity (dRSFC) have attracted great attention in recent years. However, there are few dRSFC studies based on functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) even though it has some advantages for studying the temporal evolution of brain function. In this research, we recruited 20 young adults and measured their resting-state brain fluctuations in several areas of the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes using fNIRS-electroencephalography (EEG) simultaneous recording. Based on a sliding-window approach, we found that the variability of the dRSFC within any region of interest was significantly lower than the connections between region of interests but noticeably greater than the correlation between the channels with a short interoptode distance, which mainly consist of physiological fluctuations occurring in the superficial layers. Furthermore, based on a time-resolved k-means clustering analysis, the temporal evolution was extracted for three dominant functional networks. These networks were roughly consistent between different subject subgroups and in varying sliding time window lengths of 20, 30, and 60 s. Between these three functional networks, there were obvious time-varied and system-specific synchronous relationships. In addition, the oscillation of the frontal-parietal-temporal network showed significant correlation with the switching of one EEG microstate, a finding which is consistent with a previous functional MRI-EEG study. All this evidence implies the functional significance of fNIRS-dRSFC and demonstrates the feasibility of fNIRS for extracting the dominant functional networks based on RSFC dynamics.</p>

<p>The ability to form a mental representation of the surroundings is a critical skill for spatial navigation and orientation in humans. Such a mental representation is known as a “cognitive map” and is formed as individuals familiarize themselves with the surrounding, providing detailed information about salient environmental landmarks and their spatial relationships. Despite evidence of the malleability and potential for training spatial orientation skills in humans, it remains unknown if the specific ability to form cognitive maps can be improved by an appositely developed training program. Here, we present a newly developed computerized 12-days training program in a virtual environment designed specifically to stimulate the acquisition of this important skill. We asked 15 healthy volunteers to complete the training program and perform a comprehensive spatial behavioral assessment before and after the training. We asked participants to become familiar with the environment by navigating a small area before slowly building them up to navigate within the larger and more complex environment; we asked them to travel back and forth between environmental landmarks until they had built an understanding of where those landmarks resided with respect to one another. This process repeated until participants had visited every landmark in the virtual town and had learned where each landmark resided with respect to the others. The results of this study confirmed the feasibility of the training program and suggested an improvement in the ability of participants to form mental representations of the spatial surrounding. This study provides preliminary findings on the feasibility of a 12-days program in training spatial orientation skills. We discuss the utility and potential impact of this training program in the lives of the many individuals affected by topographical disorientation as a result of an acquired or developmental condition.</p>

<p>Previous research has suggested that the lateral occipital cortex (LOC) is involved with visual decision making, and specifically with the accumulation of information leading to a decision. In humans, this research has been primarily based on imaging and electroencephalography (EEG), and as such only correlational. One line of such research has led to a model of three spatially distributed brain networks that activate in temporal sequence to enable visual decision-making. The model predicted that disturbing neural processing in the LOC at a specific latency would slow object decision-making, increasing reaction time (RT) in a difficult discrimination task. We utilized transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to test this prediction, perturbing LOC beginning at 400 ms post-stimulus onset, a time in the model corresponding to LOC activation at a particular difficulty level, with the expectation of increased RT. Thirteen healthy adults participated in two TMS sessions in which left and right LOC were stimulated separately utilizing neuronavigation and robotic coil guidance. Participants performed a two-alternative forced-choice task selecting whether a car or face was present on each trial amidst visual noise pre-tested to approximate a 75% accuracy level. In an effort to disrupt processing, pairs of TMS pulses separated by 50 ms were presented at one of five stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs): −200, 200, 400, 450, or 500 ms. Behavioral performance differed systematically across SOAs for RT and accuracy measures. As predicted, TMS at 400 ms resulted in a significant slowing of RT. TMS delivered at −200 ms resulted in faster RT, indicating early stimulation may result in priming and performance enhancement. Use of TMS thus causally demonstrated the involvement of LOC in this task, and more broadly with perceptual decision-making; additionally, it demonstrated the role of TMS in testing well-developed neural models of perceptual processing.</p>

<p>Since Tulving proposed a distinction in memory between semantic and episodic memory, considerable effort has been directed towards understanding their similar and unique features. Of particular interest has been the extent to which semantic and episodic memory have a shared dependence on the hippocampus. In contrast to the definitive evidence for the link between hippocampus and episodic memory, the role of the hippocampus in semantic memory has been a topic of considerable debate. This debate stems, in part, from highly variable reports of new semantic memory learning in amnesia ranging from profound impairment to full preservation, and various degrees of deficit and ability in between. More recently, a number of significant advances in experimental methods have occurred, alongside new provocative data on the role of the hippocampus in semantic memory, making this an ideal moment to revisit this debate, to re-evaluate data, methods, and theories, and to synthesize new findings. In line with these advances, this review has two primary goals. First, we provide a historical lens with which to reevaluate and contextualize the literature on semantic memory and the hippocampus. The second goal of this review is to provide a synthesis of new findings on the role of the hippocampus and semantic memory. With the perspective of time and this critical review, we arrive at the interpretation that the hippocampus does indeed make necessary contributions to semantic memory. We argue that semantic memory, like episodic memory, is a highly flexible, (re)constructive, relational and multimodal system, and that there is value in developing methods and materials that fully capture this depth and richness to facilitate comparisons to episodic memory. Such efforts will be critical in addressing questions regarding the cognitive and neural (inter)dependencies among forms of memory, and the role that these forms of memory play in support of cognition more broadly. Such efforts also promise to advance our understanding of how words, concepts, and meaning, as well as episodes and events, are instantiated and maintained in memory and will yield new insights into our two most quintessentially human abilities: memory and language.</p>

<p>Individuals on the autism spectrum are reported to show impairments in the processing of social information, including aspects of eye-movements towards faces. Abnormalities in basic-level visual processing are also reported. In the current study, we sought to determine if the latency of saccades made towards social targets (faces) in a natural scene as opposed to inanimate targets (cars) would be related to sub-clinical autism traits (ATs) in individuals drawn from a neurotypical population. The effect of stimulus inversion was also examined given that difficulties with processing inverted faces are thought to be a function of face expertise. No group differences in saccadic latency were established for face or car targets, regardless of image orientation. However, as expected, we found that individuals with higher autism-like traits did not demonstrate a saccadic face inversion effect, but those with lower autism-like traits did. Neither group showed a car inversion effect. Thus, these results suggest that neurotypical individuals with high autism-like traits also show anomalies in detecting and orienting to faces. In particular, the reduced saccadic face inversion effect established in these participants with high ATs suggests that speed of visual processing and orienting towards faces may be associated with the social difficulties found across the broader autism spectrum.</p>

<p>Dynamic cognitive control adjustments are important for integrating thoughts and actions that take place during dynamic changes of environmental demands and support goal-directed behavior. We investigated, in a working memory (WM) paradigm, whether dynamic adjustments in cognitive control based on previous trial load influence the neural response to neutral or unpleasant distracters. We also investigated whether individual self-reported abilities in controlling thoughts influence this effect. Participants performed a WM change detection task with low or high WM-related cognitive demands. An unpleasant or a neutral distractive image was presented at the beginning of each trial, prior to the WM task. We tested for control adjustments that were associated with the load level of the preceding trial task (N-1) on the neural response to the subsequent distractive image. We found an effect of the prior WM task load on a parieto-occipital waveform event-related potential (ERP) that appeared between 200 and 300 ms after the neutral distracter onset. This effect was not observed for the unpleasant distracter. Individual ability for controlling thoughts may influence the effect of cognitive control adjustments on distracter processing during the unpleasant condition. These findings provide evidence that: (1) dynamic cognitive control adjustments are impaired by unpleasant distracters; and (2) the ability to control unpleasant thoughts is linked to individual differences in flexible cognitive control adjustments and shielding of WM representations from unpleasant distracters.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00003">Novel Volumetric Sub-region Segmentation in Brain Tumors</a></h4>

<p>A novel deep learning based model called Multi-Planar Spatial Convolutional Neural Network (MPS-CNN) is proposed for effective, automated segmentation of different sub-regions viz. peritumoral edema (ED), necrotic core (NCR), enhancing and non-enhancing tumor core (ET/NET), from multi-modal MR images of the brain. An encoder-decoder type CNN model is designed for pixel-wise segmentation of the tumor along three anatomical planes (axial, sagittal, and coronal) at the slice level. These are then combined, by incorporating a consensus fusion strategy with a fully connected Conditional Random Field (CRF) based post-refinement, to produce the final volumetric segmentation of the tumor and its constituent sub-regions. Concepts, such as spatial-pooling and unpooling are used to preserve the spatial locations of the edge pixels, for reducing segmentation error around the boundaries. A new aggregated loss function is also developed for effectively handling data imbalance. The MPS-CNN is trained and validated on the recent Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge (BraTS) 2018 dataset. The Dice scores obtained for the validation set for whole tumor (WT :NCR/NE +ET +ED), tumor core (TC:NCR/NET +ET), and enhancing tumor (ET) are 0.90216, 0.87247, and 0.82445. The proposed MPS-CNN is found to perform the best (based on leaderboard scores) for ET and TC segmentation tasks, in terms of both the quantitative measures (viz. Dice and Hausdorff). In case of the WT segmentation it also achieved the second highest accuracy, with a score which was only 1% less than that of the best performing method.</p>

<p>The epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures (EIMFS; previously called Malignant migrating partial seizures of infancy) are early-onset epileptic encephalopathies (EOEE) that associate multifocal ictal discharges and profound psychomotor retardation. EIMFS have a genetic origin and are mostly caused by de novo mutations in the KCNT1 gene, and much more rarely in the KCNT2 gene. KCNT1 and KCNT2 respectively encode the K<sub>Na</sub>1.1 (Slack) and K<sub>Na</sub>1.2 (Slick) subunits of the sodium-dependent voltage-gated potassium channel K<sub>Na</sub>. Functional analyses of the corresponding mutant homomeric channels in vitro suggested gain-of-function effects. Here, we report two novel, de novo truncating mutations of KCNT2: one mutation is frameshift (p.L48Qfs43), is situated in the N-terminal domain, and was found in a patient with EOEE (possibly EIMFS); the other mutation is nonsense (p.K564*), is located in the C-terminal region, and was found in a typical EIMFS patient. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, we have analyzed the functional consequences of those two novel KCNT2 mutations on reconstituted K<sub>Na</sub>1.2 homomeric and K<sub>Na</sub>1.1/K<sub>Na</sub>1.2 heteromeric channels in transfected chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. We report that both mutations significantly impacted on K<sub>Na</sub> function; notably, they decreased the global current density of heteromeric channels by ~25% (p.K564*) and ~55% (p.L48Qfs43). Overall our data emphasize the involvement of KCNT2 in EOEE and provide novel insights into the role of heteromeric K<sub>Na</sub> channel in the severe KCNT2-related epileptic phenotypes. This may have important implications regarding the elaboration of future treatment.</p>

<p>C-bouton-type cholinergic afferents exert an important function in controlling motoneuron (MN) excitability. During the immunocytochemical analysis of the role of c-Jun in MNs with a monoclonal (clone Y172) antibody against phospho (p)-c-Jun (serine [Ser]63), unexpected labeling was identified in the cell body cytoplasm. As predicted for c-Jun in adult spinal cord, very few, if any MNs exhibited nuclear immunoreactivity with the Y172 antibody; conversely, virtually all MNs displayed strong Y172 immunostaining in cytoplasmic structures scattered throughout the soma and proximal dendrites. The majority of these cytoplasmic Y172-positive profiles was closely associated with VAChT-positive C-boutons, but not with other types of nerve afferents contacting MNs. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that cytoplasmic Y172 immunostaining was selectively located at the subsurface cistern (SSC) of C-boutons and also in the inner areas of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We also described changes in cytoplasmic Y172 immunoreactivity in injured and degenerating MNs. Moreover, we noticed that MNs from NRG1 type III-overexpressing transgenic mice, which show abnormally expanded SSCs, exhibited an increase in the density and size of peripherally located Y172-positive profiles. A similar immunocytochemical pattern to that of the Y172 antibody in MNs was found with a polyclonal antibody against p-c-Jun (Ser63) but not with another polyclonal antibody that recognizes c-Jun phosphorylated at a different site. No differential band patterns were found by western blotting with any of the antibodies against c-Jun or p-c-Jun used in our study. In cultured MNs, Y172-positive oval profiles were distributed in the cell body and proximal dendrites. The in vitro lentiviral-based knockdown of c-Jun resulted in a dramatic decrease in nuclear Y172 immunostaining in MNs without any reduction in the density of cytoplasmic Y172-positive profiles, suggesting that the synaptic antigen recognized by the antibody corresponds to a C-bouton-specific protein other than p-c-Jun. Our results lay the foundation for further studies aimed at identifying this protein and determining its role in this particular type of synapse.</p>

<p>Creating a functional cerebral cortex requires a series of complex and well-coordinated developmental steps. These steps have evolved across species with the emergence of cortical gyrification and coincided with more complex behaviors. The presence of diverse progenitor cells, a protracted timeline for neuronal migration and maturation, and diverse neuronal types are developmental features that have emerged in the gyrated cortex. These factors could explain how the human brain has expanded in size and complexity. However, their complex nature also renders new avenues of vulnerability by providing additional cell types that could contribute to disease and longer time windows that could impact the composition and organization of the cortical circuit. We aim to discuss the unique developmental steps observed in human corticogenesis and propose how disruption of these species-unique processes could lead to malformations of cortical development.</p>

The last decade has witnessed a remarkable increase in our ability to measure genetic information. Advancements of sequencing technologies are challenging the existing methods of data storage and analysis. While methods to cope with the data deluge are progressing, many biologists have lagged behind due to the fast pace of computational advancements and tools available to address their scientific questions. Future generations of biologists must be more computationally aware and capable. This means they should be trained to give them the computational skills to keep pace with technological developments. Here, we propose a model that bridges experimental and bioinformatics concepts using the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing platform. We provide both a guide to begin to empower the new generation of educators, scientists, and students in performing long-read assembly of bacterial and bacteriophage genomes and a standalone virtual machine containing all the required software and learning materials for the course.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_KTMj8f9HUs" width="1" />

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been suggested as a reliable, noninvasive, and inexpensive tool for the diagnosis of neurodegenerative dementias. In this study, we assessed the classification performance of TMS parameters in the differential diagnosis of common neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD).</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a multicenter study enrolling patients referred to 4 dementia centers in Italy, in accordance with the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy. All patients underwent TMS assessment at recruitment (index test), with application of reference clinical criteria, to predict different neurodegenerative disorders. The investigators who performed the index test were masked to the results of the reference test and all other investigations. We trained and tested a random forest classifier using 5‐fold cross‐validation. The primary outcome measures were the classification accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of TMS in differentiating each neurodegenerative disorder.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 694 participants were included, namely 273 patients diagnosed as AD, 67 as DLB, and 207 as FTD, and 147 healthy controls (HC). A series of 3 binary classifiers was employed, and the prediction model exhibited high classification accuracy (ranging from 0.89 to 0.92), high precision (0.86–0.92), high recall (0.93–0.98), and high F1 scores (0.89–0.95) in differentiating each neurodegenerative disorder.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>TMS is a noninvasive procedure that reliably and selectively distinguishes AD, DLB, FTD, and HC, representing a useful additional screening tool to be used in clinical practice. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Epidemiological research in MS has mainly been performed in socioeconomically and ethnically limited populations; influences on MS risk have not been studied in prospectively collected non‐White populations. We set out to study the influence of previously described MS risk factors in an ethnically diverse population.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A nested case‐control study was created using primary care records of over 1 million individuals, &gt;50% of whom identify as Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME). MS cases were compared to an age and sex‐matched control cohort (1:4), and to a large unmatched cohort. Odds ratios of disease were determined according to exposure of interest and a multivariable model including all exposures was created. Potential pairwise interactions were considered where both indicated a significant effect.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>1344 confirmed MS cases were included. MS odds in Blacks aged &lt;40 were 1.15 (0.81‐1.62) compared to Whites. MS odds in BAME current (OR 1.71, 95%CI 1.24‐2.31) and ex‐smokers (OR 2.83, 95%CI 2.14‐3.72) were considerably higher than Whites (OR 1.09 95%CI 0.88‐1.34; OR 1.44, 95%CI 1.19‐1.74 respectively). Prior infectious mononucleosis (IM) was associated with increased odds of MS in Blacks (OR 4.94 95%CI 1.23‐17.89). An increase in MS odds was seen in the least‐deprived quintile (OR 2.46 95%CI 1.40‐4.24), but no effect across deprived quintiles was seen.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This cohort provides novel data on factors potentially driving MS susceptibility in a diverse population, a third of whom live in poverty. Environmental exposures have differential risk across ethnicity.</p>

Abstract<p>Olfactory sensory neurons expressing same-type odorant receptors typically project to a pair of glomeruli in the medial and lateral sides of the olfactory bulbs (OBs) in rodents. This multiple glomerular representation of homologous inputs is considered to have more important functional roles for odor information processing than the redundant backup system. However, a consensus idea is lacking and this hinders interpretation of the phenomenon. In addition, the shared and unique odorant response properties of the homologous glomeruli remain unclear because the majority of medial glomeruli are hidden in the septal OB, and thus it is difficult to directly compare them. Olfactory sensory neurons, which express trace amine-associated odorant receptors (TAARs), were recently identified that project to a pair of glomeruli uniquely located in the dorsal OB. In this study, we measured the odorant-induced calcium responses of homologous pairs of TAAR glomeruli simultaneously in anesthetized mice and directly compared their response patterns. We found that they exhibited similar temporal response patterns and could not find differences in onset latency, rise time, decay time, or response amplitude. However, the medial glomeruli had significantly larger respiration-locked calcium fluctuations than the lateral glomeruli. This trend was observed with/without odorant stimulation in postsynaptic neurons of GABAergic, dopaminergic, and mitral/tufted cells, but not in presynaptic olfactory sensory axon terminals. This indicates that, at least in these TAAR glomeruli, the medial rather than the lateral OB map enhances the respiration-locked rhythm and transfers this information to higher brain centers.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> This study directly compared the odor-evoked responses in paired homologous glomeruli in medial and lateral maps in the mouse dorsal olfactory bulb using the <i>in vivo</i> calcium imaging technique, which revealed that the response amplitude, onset latency, rising time, and decay time were not significantly different between medial and lateral homologous glomeruli. However, postsynaptic but not presynaptic neuronal activity in medial glomeruli had stronger respiratory-locked calcium fluctuations than lateral glomeruli. These differences were also observed in the resting condition without odor stimulation. The results suggest that the medial map neurons enhance respiratory-linked odor representation and transmit it to higher brain centers.</p>

<p>Active inference provides a biologically plausible process theory of brain
function. It specifies neuronal dynamics for state-estimation in terms of a
gradient descent on (variational) free energy -- a measure of the fit between
an internal (generative) model and sensory observations. When formulated for
discrete state-space generative models, the free energy gradient turns out to
be a prediction error -- plausibly encoded in the average membrane potentials
of neuronal populations. Conversely, the expected probability of a state can
then be expressed in terms of firing rates. We establish a construct validity
to this scheme -- by showing that it is consistent with current models of
neuronal dynamics -- and face validity, as it is able to synthesize a wide
range of biologically plausible electrophysiological responses. We then show
that these neuronal dynamics approximate natural gradient descent, a well-known
optimisation algorithm from information geometry that prescribes locally
optimal belief updates. Lastly, numerical simulations suggest that both schemes
perform equally well on average. The performance of belief updating is scored
in terms of information length, a measure of the distance traveled in
information space, which has a direct interpretation in terms of metabolic
efficiency. These results show that active inference is consistent with
state-of-the-art models of neuronal dynamics and coincides with the natural
gradient. This suggests that natural selection, by selecting the phenotypes
that optimise metabolic and computational efficiency, has implicitly
approximated the steepest direction in information space; namely, natural
gradient descent.

<p>Neurons in the primate visual cortices show a wide range of stimulus
selectivity. Some neurons respond to only a small fraction of stimulus images,
whereas others respond to many stimulus images in a non-selective manner. It is
unclear how stimulus selective and non-selective neurons contribute to visual
object recognition. Herein, we examined the relationship between stimulus
selectivity and the effect of deletion of units on task performance using fully
a connected layer of two types of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs).
Deleting a stimulus selective unit caused slight improvements of task
performance, whereas deleting stimulus non-selective units caused a significant
decrease in task performance. However, these findings do not imply that
stimulus selective units have no use for the task. Indeed, better performance
was obtained when the networks consisted of both stimulus selective and
non-selective units.

<p>GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors mediate a large fraction of inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. Two major classes of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are γ2-containing receptors and δ-containing receptors, which are largely located synaptically and extrasynaptically, respectively. Neuroactive steroids such as allopregnanolone (3α5αP) and allotetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC) are hypothesized to selectively affect δ-containing receptors over γ2-containing receptors. However, the selectivity of neurosteroids on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor classes is controversial. In this study, we re-examined this issue using mice with picrotoxin resistance associated with either the δ or γ2 subunit. Our results show that 3α5αP potentiated phasic inhibition of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, and this is mainly through γ2-containing receptors. 3α5αP, with or without exogenous GABA, potentiated tonic inhibition through GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. Surprisingly, potentiation arose from both γ2- and δ-containing receptors, even when a δ selective agonist THIP was used to activate current. Although ethanol has been proposed to act through neurosteroids and to act selectively at δ receptors, we found no evidence for ethanol potentiation of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor function at 50 mM under our experimental conditions. Finally, we found that the actions of pentobarbital exhibited very similar effects on tonic current as 3α5αP, emphasizing the broad spectrum nature of neurosteroid potentiation. Overall, using chemogenetic analysis, our evidence suggests that in a cell population enriched for δ-containing receptors, neurosteroids act through both δ-containing and non-δ-containing receptors.</p>

<p>Huntington’s disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative movement disorder that presents with prominent cognitive and psychiatric dysfunction. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of HD, as well as other neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, and epigenetic alterations in the complex BDNF promoter have been associated with its deregulation in pathological conditions. BDNF has gained increased attention as a potential biomarker of disease; but currently, the conflicting results from measurements of BDNF in different biofluids difficult the assessment of its utility as a biomarker for HD. Here, we measured BDNF protein levels in plasma (n = 85) and saliva (n = 81) samples from premanifest and manifest HD patients and normal controls using ELISA assays. We further examined DNA methylation levels of BDNF promoter IV using DNA derived from whole blood of HD patients and healthy controls (n = 40) using pyrosequencing. BDNF protein levels were not significantly different in plasma samples across diagnostic groups. Plasma BDNF was significantly correlated with age in control subjects but not in HD patients, nor were significant gender effects observed. Similar to plasma, salivary BDNF was correlated with age only in control subjects, with no gender effects observed. Importantly, we detected significantly lower levels of salivary BDNF in premanifest and manifest HD patients compared to control subjects, with lower BDNF levels being observed in premanifest patients within a predicted 10 years to disease onset. Salivary and plasma BDNF levels were not significantly correlated with one another, suggesting different origins. DNA methylation at four out of the 12 CpG sites studied in promoter IV were significantly altered in HD patients in comparison to controls. Interestingly, methylation at three of these CpG sites was inversely correlated to the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) scores. BDNF promoter methylation was not correlated with motor or cognitive scores in HD patients, and was not associated with sex or age in neither disease nor control groups. Conclusion: Our studies show that BDNF protein levels are decreased in saliva; and BDNF promoter methylation increased in blood in HD subjects when compared to controls. These findings suggest that salivary BDNF measures may represent an early marker of disease onset and DNA methylation at the BDNF promoter IV, could represent a biomarker of psychiatric symptoms in HD patients.</p>

<p>The lateral parabrachial nucleus, medial parabrachial nucleus, vestibular nuclei complex, and medullary viscero-sensory-motor (VSM) nuclei complex (the latter including among others the solitary nucleus, vagus nerve nucleus, and hypoglossal nucleus) are anatomically and functionally connected brainstem gray matter structures that convey signals across multiple modalities between the brain and the spinal cord to regulate vital bodily functions. It is remarkably difficult to precisely extrapolate the location of these nuclei from ex vivo atlases to conventional 3 Tesla in vivo images; thus, a probabilistic brainstem template in stereotaxic neuroimaging space in living humans is needed. We delineated these nuclei using single-subject high contrast 1.1 mm isotropic resolution 7 Tesla MRI images. After precise coregistration of nuclei labels to stereotaxic space, we generated a probabilistic template of their anatomical locations. Finally, we validated the nuclei labels in the template by assessing their inter-rater agreement, consistency across subjects and volumes. We also performed a preliminary comparison of their location and microstructural properties to histologic sections of a postmortem human brainstem specimen. In future, the resulting probabilistic template of these brainstem nuclei in stereotaxic space may assist researchers and clinicians in evaluating autonomic, vestibular and VSM nuclei structure, function and connectivity in living humans using conventional 3 Tesla MRI scanners.</p>

<p>Alpha-synuclein (α-syn) is localized in cellular organelles of most neurons, but many of its physiological functions are only partially understood. α-syn accumulation is associated with Parkinson’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy as well as other synucleinopathies; however, the exact pathomechanisms that underlie these neurodegenerative diseases remain elusive. In this review, we describe what is known about α-syn function and pathophysiological changes in different cellular structures and organelles, including what is known about its behavior as a prion-like protein. We summarize current knowledge of α-syn and its pathological forms, covering its effect on each organelle, including aggregation and toxicity in different model systems, with special interest on the mitochondria due to its relevance during the apoptotic process of dopaminergic neurons. Moreover, we explore the effect that α-syn exerts by interacting with chromatin remodeling proteins that add or remove histone marks, up-regulate its own expression, and resume the impairment that α-syn induces in vesicular traffic by interacting with the endoplasmic reticulum. We then recapitulate the events that lead to Golgi apparatus fragmentation, caused by the presence of α-syn. Finally, we report the recent findings about the accumulation of α-syn, indirectly produced by the endolysosomal system. In conclusion, many important steps into the understanding of α-syn have been made using in vivo and in vitro models; however, the time is right to start integrating observational studies with mechanistic models of α-syn interactions, in order to look at a more complete picture of the pathophysiological processes underlying α-synucleinopathies.</p>

<p>In light of growing concerns about opioid analgesics, developing new non-pharmacologic pain control techniques has become a high priority. Adjunctive virtual reality can help reduce acute pain during painful medical procedures. However, for some especially painful medical procedures such as burn wound cleaning, clinical researchers recommend that more distracting versions of virtual reality are needed, to further amplify the potency of virtual reality analgesia. The current study with healthy volunteers explores for the first time whether interacting with virtual objects in Virtual Reality (VR) via “hands free” eye-tracking technology integrated into the VR helmet makes VR more effective/powerful than non-interactive/passive VR (no eye-tracking) for reducing pain during brief thermal pain stimuli.</p>Method<p>Forty eight healthy volunteers participated in the main study. Using a within-subject design, each participant received one brief thermal pain stimulus during interactive eye tracked virtual reality, and each participant received another thermal pain stimulus during non-interactive VR (treatment order randomized). After each pain stimulus, participants provided subjective 0–10 ratings of cognitive, sensory and affective components of pain, and rated the amount of fun they had during the pain stimulus.</p>Results<p>As predicted, interactive eye tracking increased the analgesic effectiveness of immersive virtual reality. Compared to the passive non-interactive VR condition, during the interactive eye tracked VR condition, participants reported significant reductions in worst pain (p &lt; 0.001) and pain unpleasantness (p &lt; 0.001). Participants reported a significantly stronger illusion of presence (p &lt; 0.001), and significantly more fun in VR (p &lt; 0.001) during the interactive condition compared to during passive VR. In summary, as predicted by our primary hypothesis, in the current laboratory acute pain analog study with healthy volunteers, increasing the immersiveness of the VR system via interactive eye tracking significantly increased how effectively VR reduced worst pain during a brief thermal pain stimulus. Although attention was not directly measured, the pattern of pain ratings, presence ratings, and fun ratings are consistent with an attentional mechanism for how VR reduces pain. Whether the current results generalize to clinical patient populations is another important topic for future research. Additional research and development is recommended.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00100">Effects of Cholinergic Neuromodulation on Thalamocortical Rhythms During NREM Sleep: A Model Study</a></h4>

<p>It has been suggested that cholinergic neurons shape the oscillatory activity of the thalamocortical (TC) network in behavioral and electrophysiological experiments. However, theoretical modeling demonstrating how cholinergic neuromodulation of thalamocortical rhythms during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep might occur has been lacking. In this paper, we first develop a novel computational model (TC-ACH) by incorporating a cholinergic neuron population (CH) into the classical thalamo-cortical circuitry, where connections between populations are modeled in accordance with existing knowledge. The neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACH) released by neurons in CH, which is able to change the discharge activity of thalamocortical neurons, is the primary focus of our work. Simulation results with our TC-ACH model reveal that the cholinergic projection activity is a key factor in modulating oscillation patterns in three ways: (1) transitions between different patterns of thalamocortical oscillations are dramatically modulated through diverse projection pathways; (2) the model expresses a stable spindle oscillation state with certain parameter settings for the cholinergic projection from CH to thalamus, and more spindles appear when the strength of cholinergic input from CH to thalamocortical neurons increases; (3) the duration of oscillation patterns during NREM sleep including K-complexes, spindles, and slow oscillations is longer when cholinergic input from CH to thalamocortical neurons becomes stronger. Our modeling results provide insights into the mechanisms by which the sleep state is controlled, and provide a theoretical basis for future experimental and clinical studies.</p>

<p>Head-direction cells have been found in several areas in the mammalian brains. The firing rate of an ideal head-direction cell reaches its peak value only when the animal's head points in a specific direction, and this preferred direction stays the same regardless of spatial location. In this paper we combine mathematical analytical techniques and numerical simulations to fully analyze the equilibrium states of a generic ring attractor network, which is a widely used modeling framework for the head-direction system. Under specific conditions, all solutions of the ring network are bounded, and there exists a Lyapunov function that guarantees the stability of the network for any given inputs, which may come from multiple sources in the biological system, including self-motion information for inertially based updating and landmark information for calibration. We focus on the first few terms of the Fourier series of the ring network to explicitly solve for all possible equilibrium states, followed by a stability analysis based on small perturbations. In particular, these equilibrium states include the standard single-peaked activity pattern as well as double-peaked activity pattern, whose existence is unknown but has testable experimental implications. To our surprise, we have also found an asymmetric equilibrium activity profile even when the network connectivity is strictly symmetric. Finally we examine how these different equilibrium solutions depend on the network parameters and obtain the phase diagrams in the parameter space of the ring network.</p>

<p>The unique combination of small size, translucency, and powerful genetic tools makes larval zebrafish a uniquely useful vertebrate system to investigate normal and pathological brain structure and function. While functional connectivity can now be assessed by optical imaging (via fluorescent calcium or voltage reporters) at the whole-brain scale, it remains challenging to systematically determine structural connections and identify connectivity changes during development or disease. To address this, we developed Tracer with Restricted Anterograde Spread (TRAS), a novel vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based neural circuit labeling approach. TRAS makes use of replication-incompetent VSV (VSVΔG) and a helper virus (lentivirus) to enable anterograde transneuronal spread between efferent axons and their direct postsynaptic targets but restricts further spread to downstream areas. We integrated TRAS with the Z-Brain zebrafish 3D atlas for quantitative connectivity analysis and identified targets of the retinal and habenular efferent projections, in patterns consistent with previous reports. We compared retinofugal connectivity patterns between wild-type and down syndrome cell adhesion molecule-like 1 (dscaml1) mutant zebrafish and revealed differences in topographical distribution. These results demonstrate the utility of TRAS for quantitative structural connectivity analysis that would be valuable for detecting novel efferent targets and mapping connectivity changes underlying neurological or behavioral deficits.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00080">Facilitation of Crossmodal Integration During Emotional Prediction in Methamphetamine Dependents</a></h4>

<p>Methamphetamine (meth) can greatly damage the prefrontal cortex of the brain and trigger dysfunction of the cognitive control loop, which triggers not only drug dependence but also emotional disorders. The imbalance between the cognitive and emotional systems will lead to crossmodal emotional deficits. Until now, the negative impact of meth dependence on crossmodal emotional processing has not received attention. Therefore, the present study firstly examined the differences in crossmodal emotional processing between healthy controls and meth dependents (MADs) and then investigated the role of visual- or auditory-leading cues in the promotion of crossmodal emotional processing. Experiment 1 found that MADs made a visual–auditory integration disorder for fearful emotion, which may be related to the defects in information transmission between the auditory and auditory cortex. Experiment 2 found that MADs had a crossmodal disorder pertaining to fear under visual-leading cues, but the fearful sound improved the detection of facial emotions for MADs. Experiment 3 reconfirmed that, for MADs, A-leading cues could induce crossmodal integration immediately more easily than V-leading ones. These findings provided sufficient quantitative indicators and evidences that meth dependence was associated with crossmodal integration disorders, which in turn was associated with auditory-leading cues that enhanced the recognition ability of MADs for complex emotions (all results are available at: https://osf.io/x6rv5/). These results provided a better understanding for individuals using drugs in order to enhance the cognition for the complex crossmodal emotional integration.</p>

<p>Objective: Mean Diffusivity (MD) as measured by diffusion tensor imaging can be used to detect microstructural alterations of the brain’s gray matter (GM). A previous study found that higher education, which is a proxy for cognitive reserve (CR), was related to decreased hippocampal MD in middle-aged healthy adults, indicating decreased microstructural damage in more educated participants. Based on this study, we aimed at determining the role of hippocampal GM MD in the interaction of AD pathology and CR in older people without dementia.
Method: We used a sample of 52 cognitively normal people and 38 participants with late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI) from the ADNI database. MCI and cognitively normal participants were analyzed separately. Using linear models, we regressed hippocampal GM MD on CR (quantified by a composite score), amyloid status and the interaction of both, adjusting for age, gender and memory score. 
Results: CR was not associated with hippocampal GM MD and hippocampal GM volume. Also, no interaction of amyloid status and CR was found.
Conclusions: Our results do not confirm an association of CR and hippocampal GM MD in older adults. In contrast to previous studies, we did not find an association between CR and microstructural, nor macrostructural alterations of the hippocampus in older adults. More research is needed to determine the influence of CR on hippocampal microstructural integrity in relation to age and AD pathology.</p>

Background<p>Identifying persons at risk for cognitive decline may aid in early detection of persons at risk of dementia and to select those that would benefit most from therapeutic or preventive measures for dementia.</p>Objective<p>In this study we aimed to validate whether cognitive decline in the general population can be predicted with multivariate data using a previously proposed supervised classification method: Disease State Index (DSI).</p>Methods<p>We included 2,542 participants, non-demented and without mild cognitive impairment at baseline, from the population-based Rotterdam Study (mean age 60.9 ± 9.1 years). Participants with significant global cognitive decline were defined as the 5% of participants with the largest cognitive decline per year. We trained DSI to predict occurrence of significant global cognitive decline using a large variety of baseline features, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features, cardiovascular risk factors, APOE-ε4 allele carriership, gait features, education, and baseline cognitive function as predictors. The prediction performance was assessed as area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), using 500 repetitions of 2-fold cross-validation experiments, in which (a randomly selected) half of the data was used for training and the other half for testing.</p>Results<p>A mean AUC (95% confidence interval) for DSI prediction was 0.78 (0.77–0.79) using only age as input feature. When using all available features, a mean AUC of 0.77 (0.75–0.78) was obtained. Without age, and with age-corrected features and feature selection on MRI features, a mean AUC of 0.70 (0.63–0.76) was obtained, showing the potential of other features besides age.</p>Conclusion<p>The best performance in the prediction of global cognitive decline in the general population by DSI was obtained using only age as input feature. Other features showed potential, but did not improve prediction. Future studies should evaluate whether the performance could be improved by new features, e.g., longitudinal features, and other prediction methods.</p>

<p>by Edward W. Huang, Ameya Bhope, Jing Lim, Saurabh Sinha, Amin Emad</p>

Prediction of clinical drug response (CDR) of cancer patients, based on their clinical and molecular profiles obtained prior to administration of the drug, can play a significant role in individualized medicine. Machine learning models have the potential to address this issue but training them requires data from a large number of patients treated with each drug, limiting their feasibility. While large databases of drug response and molecular profiles of preclinical <i>in-vitro</i> cancer cell lines (CCLs) exist for many drugs, it is unclear whether preclinical samples can be used to predict CDR of real patients. We designed a systematic approach to evaluate how well different algorithms, trained on gene expression and drug response of CCLs, can predict CDR of patients. Using data from two large databases, we evaluated various linear and non-linear algorithms, some of which utilized information on gene interactions. Then, we developed a new algorithm called TG-LASSO that explicitly integrates information on samples’ tissue of origin with gene expression profiles to improve prediction performance. Our results showed that regularized regression methods provide better prediction performance. However, including the network information or common methods of including information on the tissue of origin did not improve the results. On the other hand, TG-LASSO improved the predictions and distinguished resistant and sensitive patients for 7 out of 13 drugs. Additionally, TG-LASSO identified genes associated with the drug response, including known targets and pathways involved in the drugs’ mechanism of action. Moreover, genes identified by TG-LASSO for multiple drugs in a tissue were associated with patient survival. In summary, our analysis suggests that preclinical samples can be used to predict CDR of patients and identify biomarkers of drug sensitivity and survival.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rAZBxYSJIMs" width="1" />

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>There are currently no definitive disease‐modifying therapies for traumatic brain injury (TBI). In this study, we present a strong therapeutic candidate for TBI, immunomodulatory nanoparticles (IMPs), which ablate a specific subset of hematogenous monocytes (hMos). We hypothesized that prevention of infiltration of these cells into brain acutely after TBI would attenuate secondary damage and preserve anatomic and neurologic function.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>IMPs, composed of US Food and Drug Administration–approved 500nm carboxylated‐poly(lactic‐co‐glycolic) acid, were infused intravenously into wild‐type C57BL/6 mice following 2 different models of experimental TBI, controlled cortical impact (CCI), and closed head injury (CHI).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>IMP administration resulted in remarkable preservation of both tissue and neurological function in both CCI and CHI TBI models in mice. After acute treatment, there was a reduction in the number of immune cells infiltrating into the brain, mitigation of the inflammatory status of the infiltrating cells, improved electrophysiologic visual function, improved long‐term motor behavior, reduced edema formation as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging, and reduced lesion volumes on anatomic examination.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings suggest that IMPs are a clinically translatable acute intervention for TBI with a well‐defined mechanism of action and beneficial anatomic and physiologic preservation and recovery. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate β‐amyloid and tau depositions using Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET and AV1451 tau PET imaging in aging multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients with MS (n=16) and controls (n=80) matched for age, sex and <i>APOE</i> ε4 status from the population‐based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging who underwent PiB PET imaging were studied. Of these individuals, 12 patients with MS and 60 matching controls also underwent AV1451 tau PET. Cortical PiB and AV1451 standard uptake value ratios (SUVr) from the entire cortex and previously determined Alzheimer's disease (AD) signature regions in the same population were calculated for group comparisons and testing for associations with age.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>AD‐signature PiB SUVr (OR(95%CI)=0.52(0.27,0.98),p=0.044), total cortical PiB SUVr (OR(95%CI)=0.52(0.28,0.99),p=0.048) and the frequency of abnormal PiB SUVrs (OR(95%CI)=0.10(0.01,0.90),p=0.040) were lower in MS than controls. While AD‐signature and total cortical AV1451 SUVrs were not different between the groups, the frequency of abnormal AV1451 SUVrs was higher (OR(95%CI)=10.65(1.10,103.35),p=0.041) in MS than controls. The association of AD‐signature PiB SUVr with age was steeper in the controls compared to patients with MS (estimate(95%CI))=‐0.14(‐0.023,‐0.006),p=0.002). Similarly, the association of total cortical PiB SUVr with age was steeper in the controls compared to patients with MS (estimate(95%CI))=‐0.13(‐0.021,‐0.005),p=0.002). There was no difference in the association of AV1451 SUVr findings with age between the MS patients and controls.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>While both β‐amyloid and tau are biomarkers of cognitive aging and AD, cortical β‐amyloid deposition was lower in MS than age‐matched controls, suggesting that some aspect of MS pathobiology retards the accumulation of β‐amyloid, but not the accumulation of tau.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Recessive null variants of the slow skeletal muscle troponin T1 (<i>TNNT1</i>) gene are a rare cause of nemaline myopathy that is fatal in infancy due to respiratory insufficiency. Muscle biopsy shows rods and fiber type disproportion. We report on four French Canadians with a novel form of recessive congenital <i>TNNT1</i> core‐rod myopathy.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients underwent full clinical characterization, lower limb MRI, muscle biopsy and genetic testing. A zebrafish loss‐of‐function model using morpholinos was created to assess the pathogenicity of the identified variant. Wild type or mutated human <i>TNNT1</i> mRNAs were co‐injected with morpholinos to assess their abilities to rescue the morphant phenotype.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Three adults and one child shared a novel missense homozygous variant in the <i>TNNT1</i> gene (c.287T&gt;C; p.Leu96Pro). They developed from childhood very slowly progressive limb‐girdle weakness with rigid spine and disabling contractures. They suffered from restrictive lung disease requiring non‐invasive mechanical ventilation in three patients, as well as recurrent episodes of rhabdomyolysis triggered by infections, which were relieved by dantrolene in one patient. Older patients remained ambulatory into their sixties. MRI of the leg muscles showed fibro‐fatty infiltration predominating in the posterior thigh and the deep posterior leg compartments. Muscle biopsies showed multi‐minicores and lobulated fibers, rods in half the patients and no fiber type disproportion. Wild type <i>TNNT1</i> mRNA rescued the zebrafish morphants but mutant transcripts failed to do so.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study expands the phenotypic spectrum of <i>TNNT1</i> myopathy and provides functional evidence for the pathogenicity of the newly identified missense mutation.</p>

<p>Multiple schizophrenia (SCZ) risk loci may be involved in gene co-regulation mechanisms, and analysis of coexpressed gene networks may help to clarify SCZ molecular basis. We have previously identified a dopamine D2 receptor (<i>DRD2</i>) coexpression module enriched for SCZ risk genes and associated with cognitive and neuroimaging phenotypes of SCZ, as well as with response to treatment with antipsychotics. Here we aimed to identify regulatory factors modulating this coexpression module and their relevance to SCZ. We performed motif enrichment analysis to identify transcription factor (TF) binding sites in human promoters of genes coexpressed with <i>DRD2.</i> Then, we measured transcript levels of a group of these genes in primary mouse cortical neurons in basal conditions and upon overexpression and knockdown of predicted TFs. Finally, we analyzed expression levels of these TFs in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of SCZ patients. Our <i>in silico</i> analysis revealed enrichment for NURR1 and ERR1 binding sites. In neuronal cultures, the expression of genes either relevant to SCZ risk (<i>Drd2, Gatad2a</i>, <i>Slc28a1</i>, <i>Cnr1</i>) or indexing coexpression in our module (<i>Btg4</i>, <i>Chit1</i>, <i>Osr1</i>, <i>Gpld1</i>) was significantly modified by gain and loss of Nurr1 and Err1. Postmortem DLPFC expression data analysis showed decreased expression levels of NURR1 and ERR1 in patients with SCZ. For NURR1 such decreased expression is associated with treatment with antipsychotics. Our results show that NURR1 and ERR1 modulate the transcription of <i>DRD2</i> coexpression partners and support the hypothesis that NURR1 is involved in the response to SCZ treatment.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In the present study, we provide <i>in silico</i> and experimental evidence for a role of the TFs NURR1 and ERR1 in modulating the expression pattern of genes coexpressed with <i>DRD2</i> in human DLPFC. Notably, genetic variations in these genes is associated with SCZ risk and behavioral and neuroimaging phenotypes of the disease, as well as with response to treatment. Furthermore, this study presents novel findings on a possible interplay between D2 receptor-mediated dopamine signaling involved in treatment with antipsychotics and the transcriptional regulation mechanisms exerted by NURR1. Our results suggest that coexpression and co-regulation mechanisms may help to explain some of the complex biology of genetic associations with SCZ.</p>

<p>Categorization allows organisms to generalize existing knowledge to novel stimuli and to discriminate between physically similar yet conceptually different stimuli. Humans, nonhuman primates, and rodents can readily learn arbitrary categories defined by low-level visual features, and learning distorts perceptual sensitivity for category-defining features such that differences between physically similar yet categorically distinct exemplars are enhanced, whereas differences between equally similar but categorically identical stimuli are reduced. We report a possible basis for these distortions in human occipitoparietal cortex. In three experiments, we used an inverted encoding model to recover population-level representations of stimuli from multivoxel and multielectrode patterns of human brain activity while human participants (both sexes) classified continuous stimulus sets into discrete groups. In each experiment, reconstructed representations of to-be-categorized stimuli were systematically biased toward the center of the appropriate category. These biases were largest for exemplars near a category boundary, predicted participants' overt category judgments, emerged shortly after stimulus onset, and could not be explained by mechanisms of response selection or motor preparation. Collectively, our findings suggest that category learning can influence processing at the earliest stages of cortical visual processing.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Category learning enhances perceptual sensitivity for physically similar yet categorically different stimuli. We report a possible mechanism for these changes in human occipitoparietal cortex. In three experiments, we used an inverted encoding model to recover population-level representations of stimuli from multivariate patterns in occipitoparietal cortex while participants categorized sets of continuous stimuli into discrete groups. The recovered representations were systematically biased by category membership, with larger biases for exemplars adjacent to a category boundary. These results suggest that mechanisms of categorization shape information processing at the earliest stages of the visual system.</p>

Abstract
<p>Myelination of the CNS relies on the production and differentiation of oligodendrocyte (OL) precursor cells (OPCs) into mature OLs. During the first month of postnatal life, OPCs that populate the corpus callosum (CC) arise from neural stem cells (NSCs) in the subcallosal subventricular zone (SVZ), and then differentiate to generate myelinating OLs. However, the signals that regulate these processes are not fully understood. In this study, we show that endogenous expression of the retinoic acid (RA)-synthesizing enzyme retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (RALDH2) is required for OPC generation and differentiation in the postnatal subcortical white matter. In male and female pups, conditional deletion of <i>Raldh2</i> reduced OPC numbers and differentiation. Moreover, decreased OPC numbers coincided with reductions in NSC survival and expression of the sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling effector protein <i>Gli1</i> in the SVZ. Additionally, GFAP expression in the CC was decreased, and cortical neuron numbers were altered. Our work suggests a role for endogenous RALDH2-dependent RA synthesis in OPC production and differentiation in the CC, as well as in the development of other cell types derived from NSCs in the embryonic ventricular zone (VZ) and SVZ, as well as the postnatal subcallosal SVZ.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0222-19.2019v1?rss=1">Preservation of partially mixed selectivity in human posterior parietal cortex across changes in task context</a></h4>

Abstract<p>Recent studies in posterior parietal cortex (PPC) have found multiple effectors and cognitive strategies represented within a shared neural substrate in a structure termed "partially mixed selectivity" (Zhang et al., 2017). In this study, we examine whether the structure of these representations are preserved across changes in task context and is thus a robust and generalizable property of the neural population. Specifically, we test whether the structure is conserved from an open-loop motor imagery task (training) to a closed-loop cortical control task (online), a change that has led to substantial changes in neural behavior in prior studies in motor cortex. Recording from a 4x4 mm electrode array implanted in PPC of a human tetraplegic patient participating in a brain-machine interface (BMI) clinical trial, we studied the representations of imagined/attempted movements of the left/right hand and compare their individual BMI control performance using a one dimensional cursor control task. We found that the structure of the representations is largely maintained between training and online control. Our results demonstrate for the first time that the structure observed in the context of an open-loop motor imagery task is maintained and accessible in the context of closed-loop BMI control. These results indicate that it is possible to decode the mixed variables found from a small patch of cortex in PPC and use them individually for BMI control. Furthermore, they show that the structure of the mixed representations is maintained and robust across changes in task context.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Multiple effectors and cognitive strategies are represented within a small patch of human posterior parietal cortex (Zhang et al., 2017). However, it is unknown to what degree the structure of the representations is maintained across different task contexts. Here, we focus on the task contexts of brain-machine interface (BMI) training and online control, different contexts that have led to substantial changes in neural behavior in prior studies in motor cortex. We find that the structure of the representation of different movement conditions is largely maintained between the two contexts and that the different representations can all be separately decoded and used for online BMI control.</p>

We now demonstrate that inhibiting NAA synthesis by intracisternal administration of a locked nucleic acid antisense oligonucleotide to young‐adult aspartoacylase‐deficient mice reverses their pre‐existing ataxia and diminishes cerebellar and thalamic vacuolation and Purkinje cell dendritic atrophy.

<p>A number of observations in recent years demonstrates that across all levels of organization, memory is inherently fluid. On the cognitive-behavioral level, the innocent act of remembering can irrevocably alter the contents of established long-term memories, while the content of dormant long-term memories that is deemed irrelevant, superfluous, or limiting may be pragmatically erased or suppressed. On the cellular level, the proteins implementing the molecular alterations underpinning memories are in a constant state of flux, with proteins being turned over, translocated, reconfigured, substituted, and replaced. Yet, the general perception of memory, and the words used to describe it, suggest a static system characterized by the goal of preserving records of past experiences with high fidelity, in contrast to the reality of an inherently adaptive system purposed to enable survival in a changing world with a pragmatic disregard for the fate of acquired memories. Here, we examine present memory terminology and how it corresponds to our actual understanding of the molecules, cells, and systems underlying memory. We will identify where terms lead us astray and line out possible ways to reform memory nomenclature to better fit the true nature of memory as we begin to know it.</p>

<p>Quality assessment of diffusion MRI (dMRI) data is essential prior to any analysis, so that appropriate pre-processing can be used to improve data quality and ensure that the presence of MRI artifacts do not affect the results of subsequent image analysis. Manual quality assessment of the data is subjective, possibly error-prone, and infeasible, especially considering the growing number of consortium-like studies, underlining the need for automation of the process. In this paper, we have developed a deep-learning-based automated quality control (QC) tool, QC-Automator, for dMRI data, that can handle a variety of artifacts such as motion, multiband interleaving, ghosting, susceptibility, herringbone, and chemical shifts. QC-Automator uses convolutional neural networks along with transfer learning to train the automated artifact detection on a labeled dataset of ∼332,000 slices of dMRI data, from 155 unique subjects and 5 scanners with different dMRI acquisitions, achieving a 98% accuracy in detecting artifacts. The method is fast and paves the way for efficient and effective artifact detection in large datasets. It is also demonstrated to be replicable on other datasets with different acquisition parameters.</p>

<p>The neurovascular unit (NVU) is a relatively recent concept in neuroscience that broadly describes the relationship between brain cells and their blood vessels. The NVU incorporates cellular and extracellular components involved in regulating cerebral blood flow and blood–brain barrier function. The NVU within the adult brain has attracted strong research interest and its structure and function is well described, however, the NVU in the developing brain over the fetal and neonatal period remains much less well known. One area of particular interest in perinatal brain development is the impact of known neuropathological insults on the NVU. The aim of this review is to synthesize existing literature to describe structure and function of the NVU in the developing brain, with a particular emphasis on exploring the effects of perinatal insults. Accordingly, a brief overview of NVU components and function is provided, before discussion of NVU development and how this may be affected by perinatal pathologies. We have focused this discussion around three common perinatal insults: prematurity, acute hypoxia, and chronic hypoxia. A greater understanding of processes affecting the NVU in the perinatal period may enable application of targeted therapies, as well as providing a useful basis for research as it expands further into this area.</p>

<p>Diffusible ions (Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Cl<sup>–</sup>) are vital for healthy function of all cells, especially brain cells. Unfortunately, the diffusible nature of these ions renders them difficult to study with traditional microscopy in situ within ex vivo brain tissue sections. This mini-review examines the recent progress in the field, using direct elemental mapping techniques to study ion homeostasis during normal brain physiology and pathophysiology, through measurement of ion distribution and concentration in ex vivo brain tissue sections. The mini-review examines the advantages and limitations of specific techniques: proton induced X-ray emission (PIXE), X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM), secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), laser-ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), and the sample preparation requirements to study diffusible ions with these methods.</p>

<p>Animal whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides a non-invasive window into brain activity. A collection of associated methods aims to replicate observations made in humans and to identify the mechanisms underlying the distributed neuronal activity in the healthy and disordered brain. Animal fMRI studies have developed rapidly over the past years, fueled by the development of resting-state fMRI connectivity and genetically encoded neuromodulatory tools. Yet, comparisons between sites remain hampered by lack of standardization. Recently, we highlighted that mouse resting-state functional connectivity converges across centers, although large discrepancies in sensitivity and specificity remained. Here, we explore past and present trends within the animal fMRI community and highlight critical aspects in study design, data acquisition, and post-processing operations, that may affect the results and influence the comparability between studies. We also suggest practices aimed to promote the adoption of standards within the community and improve between-lab reproducibility. The implementation of standardized animal neuroimaging protocols will facilitate animal population imaging efforts as well as meta-analysis and replication studies, the gold standards in evidence-based science.</p>

Background<p>Inhibitory control is a sub-ability of executive function and plays an important role in the entire cognitive process. However, declines in inhibitory control during aging significantly impair the quality of life of elderly people. Investigating methods to delay the decline of inhibitory control has become a focal point in current research. Tai Chi Chuan (TCC) is one effective method used to delay cognitive declines in older adults. However, the specific effects of TCC on inhibitory control and the mechanisms through which TCC may improve cognition in older adults have not been comprehensively investigated.</p>Objective<p>The study explores possible neurological mechanisms related to the effects of TCC interventions on inhibitory control in older people using a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) technique and reaction times (RTs).</p>Methods<p>A total of 26 healthy, elderly people who had not received TCC training completed all study procedures. The subjects were randomized to either the TCC group or the control group. Subjects in the TCC group were taught TCC by a certified instructor and trained for 8 weeks. The control group continued to perform general daily activities. The Flanker task was administered to every participant to evaluate inhibitory control pre- and post-intervention. While participants were performing the Flanker task, fNIRS data were collected.</p>Results<p>Post-intervention, significant differences for incongruent flankers were found only for the TCC intervention group. Faster RTs were observed for the incongruent flankers in the TCC group than in the control group (p &lt; 0.05). Analysis of the fNIRS data revealed an increase in oxy-Hb in the prefrontal cortex during the incongruent flankers after the TCC exercise intervention.</p>Conclusion<p>The TCC intervention significantly improved inhibitory control in older adults, suggesting that TCC is an effective, suitable exercise for improving executive function and neurological health in elderly people.</p>Clinical Trial Registration<p>Chinese Clinical Trial Register, ChiCTR1900028457.</p>

<p>This study examines the effects of focused-attention meditation on functional brain states in novice meditators. There are a number of feature metrics for functional brain states, such as functional connectivity, graph theoretical metrics, and amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF). It is necessary to choose appropriate metrics and also to specify the region of interests (ROIs) from a number of brain regions. Here, we use a Tucker3 clustering method, which simultaneously selects the feature vectors (graph theoretical metrics and fractional ALFF) and the ROIs that can discriminate between resting and meditative states based on the characteristics of the given data. In this study, breath-counting meditation, one of the most popular forms of focused-attention meditation, was used and brain activities during resting and meditation states were measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging. The results indicated that the clustering coefficients of the eight brain regions, Frontal Inf Oper L, Occipital Inf R, ParaHippocampal R, Cerebellum 10 R, Cingulum Mid R, Cerebellum Crus1 L, Occipital Inf L, and Paracentral Lobule R increased through the meditation. Our study also provided the framework of data-driven brain functional analysis and confirmed its effectiveness on analyzing neural basis of focused-attention meditation.</p>

<p>Neural processing of sounds in the dorsal and ventral streams of the (human) auditory cortex is optimized for analyzing fine-grained temporal and spectral information, respectively. Here we use a Wilson and Cowan firing-rate modeling framework to simulate spectro-temporal processing of sounds in these auditory streams and to investigate the link between neural population activity and behavioral results of psychoacoustic experiments. The proposed model consisted of two core (A1 and R, representing primary areas) and two belt (Slow and Fast, representing rostral and caudal processing respectively) areas, differing in terms of their spectral and temporal response properties. First, we simulated the responses to amplitude modulated (AM) noise and tones. In agreement with electrophysiological results, we observed an area-dependent transition from a temporal (synchronization) to a rate code when moving from low to high modulation rates. Simulated neural responses in a task of amplitude modulation detection suggested that thresholds derived from population responses in core areas closely resembled those of psychoacoustic experiments in human listeners. For tones, simulated modulation threshold functions were found to be dependent on the carrier frequency. Second, we simulated the responses to complex tones with missing fundamental stimuli and found that synchronization of responses in the Fast area accurately encoded pitch, with the strength of synchronization depending on number and order of harmonic components. Finally, using speech stimuli, we showed that the spectral and temporal structure of the speech was reflected in parallel by the modeled areas. The analyses highlighted that the Slow stream coded with high spectral precision the aspects of the speech signal characterized by slow temporal changes (e.g., prosody), while the Fast stream encoded primarily the faster changes (e.g., phonemes, consonants, temporal pitch). Interestingly, the pitch of a speaker was encoded both spatially (i.e., tonotopically) in Slow area and temporally in Fast area. Overall, performed simulations showed that the model is valuable for generating hypotheses on how the different cortical areas/streams may contribute toward behaviorally relevant aspects of auditory processing. The model can be used in combination with physiological models of neurovascular coupling to generate predictions for human functional MRI experiments.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00092">A Computational Model of Interactions Between Neuronal and Astrocytic Networks: The Role of Astrocytes in the Stability of the Neuronal Firing Rate</a></h4>

<p>Recent research in neuroscience indicates the importance of tripartite synapses and gliotransmission mediated by astrocytes in neuronal system modulation. Although the astrocyte and neuronal network functions are interrelated, they are fundamentally different in their signaling patterns and, possibly, the time scales at which they operate. However, the exact nature of gliotransmission and the effect of the tripartite synapse function at the network level are currently elusive. In this paper, we propose a computational model of interactions between an astrocyte network and a neuron network, starting from tripartite synapses and spanning to a joint network level. Our model focuses on a two-dimensional setup emulating a mixed in vitro neuron-astrocyte cell culture. The model depicts astrocyte-released gliotransmitters exerting opposing effects on the neurons: increasing the release probability of the presynaptic neuron while hyperpolarizing the post-synaptic one at a longer time scale. We simulated the joint networks with various levels of astrocyte contributions and neuronal activity levels. Our results indicate that astrocytes prolong the burst duration of neurons, while restricting hyperactivity. Thus, in our model, the effect of astrocytes is homeostatic; the firing rate of the network stabilizes to an intermediate level independently of neuronal base activity. Our computational model highlights the plausible roles of astrocytes in interconnected astrocytic and neuronal networks. Our simulations support recent findings in neurons and astrocytes in vivo and in vitro suggesting that astrocytic networks provide a modulatory role in the bursting of the neuronal network.</p>

<p>Complex environments provide structured yet variable sensory inputs. To best exploit information from these environments, organisms must evolve the ability to anticipate consequences of new stimuli, and act on these predictions. We propose an evolutionary path for neural networks, leading an organism from reactive behavior to simple proactive behavior and from simple proactive behavior to induction-based behavior. Based on earlier in-vitro and in-silico experiments, we define the conditions necessary in a network with spike-timing dependent plasticity for the organism to go from reactive to proactive behavior. Our results support the existence of specific evolutionary steps and four conditions necessary for embodied neural networks to evolve predictive and inductive abilities from an initial reactive strategy.</p>

<p>Demyelination of axons in the central nervous system (CNS) is a hallmark of multiple sclerosis (MS) and other demyelinating diseases. Cycles of demyelination, followed by remyelination, appear in the majority of MS patients and are associated with the onset and quiescence of disease-related symptoms, respectively. Previous studies in human patients and animal models have shown that vast demyelination is accompanied by wide-scale changes to brain activity, but details of this process are poorly understood. We used electrophysiological recordings and non-linear fluorescence imaging from genetically encoded calcium indicators to monitor the activity of hippocampal neurons during demyelination and remyelination over a period of 100 days. We found that synaptic transmission in CA1 neurons was diminished in vitro, and that neuronal firing rates in CA1 and the dentate gyrus (DG) were substantially reduced during demyelination in vivo, which partially recovered after a short remyelination period. This new approach allows monitoring how changes in synaptic transmission induced by cuprizone diet affect neuronal activity, and it can potentially be used to study the effects of therapeutic interventions in protecting the functionality of CNS neurons.</p>

<p>Our general understanding of neuronal function is that dendrites receive information that is transmitted to the axon, where action potentials (APs) are initiated and propagated to eventually trigger neurotransmitter release at synaptic terminals. Even though this canonical division of labor is true for a number of neuronal types in the mammalian brain (including neocortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons or cerebellar Purkinje neurons), many neuronal types do not comply with this classical polarity scheme. In fact, dendrites can be the site of AP initiation and propagation, and even neurotransmitter release. In several interneuron types, all functions are carried out by dendrites as these neurons are devoid of a canonical axon. In this article, we present a few examples of “misbehaving” neurons (with a non-canonical polarity scheme) to highlight the diversity of solutions that are used by mammalian neurons to transmit information. Moreover, we discuss how the contribution of dendrites and axons to neuronal excitability may impose constraints on the morphology of these compartments in specific functional contexts.</p>

<p>Microglia (MG) are the first cells to react to the abnormal incoming signals that follow an injury of sensory nerves and play a critical role in the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain, a common sequel of nerve injuries. Here we present population data on cell number, soma size, and length of processes of MG in the caudal division of the spinal trigeminal nucleus (Sp5C) in control mice and at the peak of microgliosis (7 days) following unilateral transection of the infraorbital nerve (IoN). The study is performed combining several bias- and assumption-free imaging and stereological approaches with different immunolabeling procedures, with the objective of tackling some hard problems that often hinder proper execution of MG morphometric studies. Our approach may easily be applied to low-density MG populations, but also works, with limited biases, in territories where MG cell bodies and processes form dense meshworks. In controls, and contralaterally to the deafferented side, MG cell body size and shape and branching pattern matched well the descriptions of “resting” or “surveillant” MG described elsewhere, with only moderate intersubject variability. On the superficial laminae of the deafferented side, however, MG displayed on average larger somata and remarkable diversity in shape. The number of cells and the length of MG processes per mm<sup>3</sup> increased 5 and 2.5 times, respectively, indicating a net 50% decrease in the mean length of processes per cell. By using specific immunolabeling and cell sorting of vascular macrophages, we found only a negligible fraction of these cells in Sp5C, with no differences between controls and deafferented animals, suggesting that blood-borne monocytes play at most a very limited role in the microgliosis occurring following sensory nerve deafferentation. In sum, here we present reliable morphometric data on MG in control and deafferented trigeminal nuclei using efficient methods that we propose may equally be applied to any morphometric population analysis of these cells under different physiological or pathological conditions.</p>

<p>Cognitive function represents a key determinative factor for independent functioning among the elderly, especially among those with age-related cognitive disorders. However; existing pharmacotherapeutic tactics for treating these disorders provide only modest benefits on cognition. The hypothalamic orexin (hypocretin) system is uniquely positioned, anatomically and functionally, to integrate physiological functions that support proper cognition. The ongoing paucity of orexin receptor agonists has mired the ability to study their potential as cognitive enhancers. Fortunately, intranasal administration of native orexin peptides circumvents this issue and others concerning peptide transport into the central nervous system (CNS). To investigate the ability of intranasal orexin-A (OxA) administration to improve the anatomical, neurochemical, and behavioral substrates of age-related cognitive dysfunction, these studies utilized a rodent model of aging combined with acute intranasal administration of saline or OxA. Here, intranasal OxA increases c-Fos expression in several telencephalic brain regions that mediate important cognitive functions, increases prefrontal cortical acetylcholine efflux, and alters set-shifting-mediated attentional function in rats. Ultimately, these studies provide a framework for the possible mechanisms and therapeutic potential of intranasal OxA in treating age-related cognitive dysfunction.</p>

In this issue of Neuron, Yang et al. (2020) identify glycerolipid metabolism as a neuron-intrinsic mechanism that regulates axonal growth and regeneration. Shifting glycerolipid metabolism toward increased triglyceride synthesis blocks PNS neuron regeneration, whereas shifting it toward membrane phospholipid synthesis overcomes regeneration failure in CNS neurons.

<p>by Amadeus Maes, Mauricio Barahona, Claudia Clopath</p>

Learning to produce spatiotemporal sequences is a common task that the brain has to solve. The same neural substrate may be used by the brain to produce different sequential behaviours. The way the brain learns and encodes such tasks remains unknown as current computational models do not typically use realistic biologically-plausible learning. Here, we propose a model where a spiking recurrent network of excitatory and inhibitory biophysical neurons drives a read-out layer: the dynamics of the driver recurrent network is trained to encode time which is then mapped through the read-out neurons to encode another dimension, such as space or a phase. Different spatiotemporal patterns can be learned and encoded through the synaptic weights to the read-out neurons that follow common Hebbian learning rules. We demonstrate that the model is able to learn spatiotemporal dynamics on time scales that are behaviourally relevant and we show that the learned sequences are robustly replayed during a regime of spontaneous activity.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hPSUoC3dZgU" width="1" />

<p>by Simon D. Angus, Jonathan Newton</p>

For almost four decades, cooperation has been studied through the lens of the prisoner’s dilemma game, with cooperation modelled as the play of a specific strategy. However, an alternative approach to cooperative behavior has recently been proposed. Known as collaboration, the new approach considers mutualistic strategic choice and can be applied to any game. Here, we bring these approaches together and study the effect of collaboration on cooperative dynamics in the standard prisoner’s dilemma setting. It turns out that, from a baseline of zero cooperation in the absence of collaboration, even relatively rare opportunities to collaborate can support material, and robust, levels of cooperation. This effect is mediated by the interaction structure, such that collaboration leads to greater levels of cooperation when each individual strategically interacts with relatively few other individuals, matching well-known characteristics of human interaction networks. Conversely, collaboratively induced cooperation vanishes from dense networks, thus placing environmental limits on collaboration’s successful role in cooperation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hY3eRymbwKc" width="1" />

<p>by Jennifer Hannig, Hendrik Schäfer, Jörg Ackermann, Marie Hebel, Tim Schäfer, Claudia Döring, Sylvia Hartmann, Martin-Leo Hansmann, Ina Koch</p>

In pathology, tissue images are evaluated using a light microscope, relying on the expertise and experience of pathologists. There is a great need for computational methods to quantify and standardize histological observations. Computational quantification methods become more and more essential to evaluate tissue images. In particular, the distribution of tumor cells and their microenvironment are of special interest. Here, we systematically investigated tumor cell properties and their spatial neighborhood relations by a new application of statistical analysis to whole slide images of Hodgkin lymphoma, a tumor arising in lymph nodes, and inflammation of lymph nodes called lymphadenitis. We considered properties of more than 400, 000 immunohistochemically stained, CD30-positive cells in 35 whole slide images of tissue sections from subtypes of the classical Hodgkin lymphoma, nodular sclerosis and mixed cellularity, as well as from lymphadenitis. We found that cells of specific morphology exhibited significant favored and unfavored spatial neighborhood relations of cells in dependence of their morphology. This information is important to evaluate differences between Hodgkin lymph nodes infiltrated by tumor cells (Hodgkin lymphoma) and inflamed lymph nodes, concerning the neighborhood relations of cells and the sizes of cells. The quantification of neighborhood relations revealed new insights of relations of CD30-positive cells in different diagnosis cases. The approach is general and can easily be applied to whole slide image analysis of other tumor types.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uCnNctQlb8g" width="1" />

For women with access to healthcare and early detection, breast cancer deaths are caused primarily by metastasis rather than growth of the primary tumor. Metastasis has been difficult to study because it happens deep in the body, occurs over years, and involves a small fraction of cells from the primary tumor. Furthermore, within-tumor heterogeneity relevant to metastasis can also lead to therapy failures and is obscured by studies of bulk tissue. Here we exploit heterogeneity to identify molecular mechanisms of metastasis. We use “organoids”, groups of hundreds of tumor cells taken from a patient and grown in the lab, to probe tumor heterogeneity, with potentially thousands of organoids generated from a single tumor. We show that organoids have the character of biological replicates: within-tumor and between-tumor variation are of similar magnitude. We develop new methods based on population genetics and variance components models to build between-tumor and within-tumor statistical tests, using organoids analogously to large sibships and vastly amplifying the test power. We show great efficiency for tests based on the organoids with the most extreme phenotypes and potential cost savings from pooled tests of the extreme tails, with organoids generated from hundreds of tumors having power predicted to be similar to bulk tests of hundreds of thousands of tumors. We apply these methods to an association test for molecular correlates of invasion, using a novel quantitative invasion phenotype calculated as the spectral power of the organoid boundary. These new approaches combine to show a strong association between invasion and protein expression of Keratin 14, a known biomarker for poor prognosis, with <i>p</i> = 2 × 10<sup>−45</sup> for within-tumor tests of individual organoids and <i>p</i> &lt; 10<sup>−6</sup> for pooled tests of extreme tails. Future studies using these methods could lead to discoveries of new classes of cancer targets and development of corresponding therapeutics.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The primary imaging modalities used to select patients for endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) are noncontrast computed tomography (CT) and CT perfusion (CTP). However, their relative utility is uncertain. We prospectively assessed CT and CTP concordance/discordance and correlated the imaging profiles on both with EVT treatment decisions and clinical outcomes.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A phase 2, multicenter, prospective cohort study of large‐vessel occlusions presented up to 24 hours from last known well was conducted. Patients received a unified prespecified imaging evaluation (CT, CT angiography, and CTP with Rapid Processing of Perfusion and Diffusion software mismatch determination). The treatment decision, EVT versus medical management, was nonrandomized and at the treating physicians’ discretion. An independent, blinded, neuroimaging core laboratory adjudicated favorable profiles based on predefined criteria (CT:Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score ≥ 6, CTP:regional cerebral blood flow (&lt;30%) &lt; 70ml with mismatch ratio ≥ 1.2 and mismatch volume ≥ 10ml).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 4,722 patients screened from January 2016 to February 2018, 361 patients were included. Two hundred eighty‐five (79%) received EVT, of whom 87.0% had favorable CTs, 91% favorable CTPs, 81% both favorable profiles, 16% discordant, and 3% both unfavorable. Favorable profiles on the 2 modalities correlated similarly with 90‐day functional independence rates (favorable CT = 56% vs favorable CTP = 57%, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.40–9.01, <i>p</i> = 0.41). Having a favorable profile on both modalities significantly increased the odds of receiving thrombectomy as compared to discordant profiles (aOR = 3.97, 95% CI = 1.97–8.01, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Fifty‐eight percent of the patients with favorable profiles on both modalities achieved functional independence as compared to 38% in discordant profiles and 0% when both were unfavorable (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001 for trend). In favorable CT/unfavorable CTP profiles, EVT was associated with high symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) (24%) and mortality (53%) rates.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Patients with favorable imaging profiles on both modalities had higher odds of receiving EVT and high functional independence rates. Patients with discordant profiles achieved reasonable functional independence rates, but those with an unfavorable CTP had higher adverse outcomes. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<p>Gaze holding in the horizontal and vertical directions is separately controlled via the oculomotor neural integrators, the prepositus hypoglossi nucleus (PHN) and the interstitial nucleus of Cajal (INC), respectively. Our previous <i>in vitro</i> studies demonstrated that transient, high-frequency local stimulation of the PHN and the INC increased the frequency of spontaneous EPSCs that lasted for several seconds. The sustained EPSC response of PHN neurons was attributed to the activation of local excitatory networks primarily mediated via Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPA (CP-AMPA) receptors and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated nonselective cation (CAN) channels. However, the contribution of CP-AMPA receptors to the activation of INC excitatory networks appeared to be small. In this study, we clarified the mechanisms of excitatory network activation in the PHN and INC using whole-cell recordings in rat brainstem slices. Although physiological and histological analyses showed that neurons that expressed CP-AMPA receptors existed not only in the PHN but also in the INC, the effect of a CP-AMPA receptor antagonist on the sustained EPSC response was significantly weaker in INC neurons than in PHN neurons. Meanwhile, the effect of an NMDA receptor antagonist on the sustained EPSC response was significantly stronger in INC neurons than in PHN neurons. Furthermore, the current and the charge transfer mediated via NMDA receptors were significantly larger in INC neurons than in PHN neurons. These results strongly suggest that these excitatory networks are activated via different synaptic mechanisms: a CP-AMPA receptor and CAN channel-dependent mechanism and an NMDA receptor-dependent mechanism in horizontal and vertical integrators, respectively.</p>

Abstract<p>Circadian rhythms are 24-hour cycles in physiology regulated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the brain, where daily cues act on SCN neurons to alter clock timing. Cannabinoid signaling modulates SCN neuronal activity, though the mechanism remains unclear. We propose that neuronal activity generates endocannabinoid release, activating astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, which releases adenosine and activates adenosine-1 receptors (A1Rs) on the presynaptic axon terminals, decreasing GABA release. We demonstrated, in mice, that activation of cannabinoid-1 receptors (CB1R) with the agonist WIN 55,212-2 (WIN) reduced the miniature GABA receptor-mediated postsynaptic current (mGPSC) frequency by a mechanism that requires astrocytes and A1R. WIN activated an intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathway in astrocytes. Activating this intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> pathway with DREADDs also decreased the mGPSC frequency and required A1R activation. The frequency of spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> events, including those induced by depolarization of a postsynaptic SCN neuron, was reduced by blocking CB1R activation with AM251, demonstrating neuronal endocannabinoid signaling modulates astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in the SCN. Finally, daytime application of WIN or adenosine phase advanced the molecular circadian clock, indicating that this cannabinoid signaling pathway is vital for the timing of circadian rhythms.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Astrocytes are a critical component of the neural network in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) required for the generation of precise circadian rhythms. We hypothesized that postsynaptic SCN neurons recruit astrocytes via endocannabinoid signaling to modulate presynaptic GABA release. We demonstrate, using a combination of approaches including whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology, GCaMP6 calcium imaging in astrocytes, pharmacology, and manipulation of intracellular signaling cascades using DREADD technology, that SCN neurons release cannabinoids that activate astrocyte intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathways to modulate GABA neurotransmission via adenosine. In addition to unraveling this novel signaling cascade in the SCN, we demonstrate that both CB1 receptor activation and adenosine phase advance the molecular circadian clock, suggesting an important role for astrocytes in modulating clock timing.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Observational studies have indicated that life course adiposity is associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, whether such an association reflects causality remains unclear. We aimed to determine whether life course adiposity such as birth weight (BW), childhood body mass index (BMI), adult BMI, body fat percentage (BF%), and waist‐to‐hip ratio (WHR) have causal effects on ALS.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly associated with life course adiposity were used as instrumental variables to estimate the causal effects on ALS. We used summary‐level data from a cohort of 20,806 cases and 59,804 controls in a Mendelian randomization (MR) framework.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Genetically predicted one standard deviation (1‐SD) increase in BF% was associated with lower risk of ALS (odds ratio [OR] = 0.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.54–0.83, <i>p</i> = 3.25E–04) after Bonferroni correction (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05/5). Genetically predicted 1‐SD higher childhood BMI was suggestively associated with lower risk of ALS (OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.78–0.99, <i>p</i> = 0.031). The weighted median method indicated a suggestive association between BMI and ALS (OR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.69–0.96, <i>p</i> = 0.016). Neither a genetically predicted 1‐SD increase in BW (inverse variance weighted [IVW]: OR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.87–1.17, <i>p</i> = 0.939) nor WHR adjusted for BMI (IVW: OR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.76–1.05, <i>p</i> = 0.178) was associated with ALS.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings provide novel evidence supporting a causal role of higher adiposity, taken as a whole, on lower risk of ALS. A deeper understanding of the energy metabolism of ALS is more likely to identify feasible nutritional interventions and even novel therapeutic targets that might improve the survival of ALS patients.

<p>Dopamine and noradrenaline are crucial neuromodulators controlling brain states, vigilance, action, reward, learning, and memory processes. Ventral tegmental area (VTA) and Locus Coeruleus (LC) are canonically described as the main sources of dopamine (DA) and noradrenaline (NA) with dissociate functions. A comparison of diverse studies shows that these neuromodulators largely overlap in multiple domains such as shared biosynthetic pathway and co-release from the LC terminals, convergent innervations, non-specificity of receptors and transporters, and shared intracellular signaling pathways. DA–NA interactions are mainly studied in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, yet it can be extended to the whole brain given the diversity of catecholamine innervations. LC can simultaneously broadcast both dopamine and noradrenaline across the brain. Here, we briefly review the molecular, cellular, and physiological overlaps between DA and NA systems and point to their functional implications. We suggest that DA and NA may function in parallel to facilitate learning and maintain the states required for normal cognitive processes. Various signaling modules of NA and DA have been targeted for developing of therapeutics. Understanding overlaps of the two systems is crucial for more effective interventions in a range of neuropsychiatric conditions.</p>

<p>The corticospinal tract (CST) plays an important role in controlling voluntary movement. Because the CST has a long trajectory throughout the brain toward the spinal cord, many axon guidance molecules are required to navigate the axons correctly during development. Previously, we found that double-knockout (DKO) mouse embryos lacking the heparan sulfate endosulfatases, Sulf1 and Sulf2, showed axon guidance defects of the CST owing to the abnormal accumulation of Slit2 protein on the brain surface. However, postnatal development of the CST, especially the pyramidal decussation and spinal cord projection, could not be assessed because DKO mice on a C57BL/6 background died soon after birth. We recently found that Sulf1/2 DKO mice on a mixed C57BL/6 and CD-1/ICR background can survive into adulthood and therefore investigated the anatomy and function of the CST in the adult DKO mice. In Sulf1/2 DKO mice, abnormal dorsal deviation of the CST fibers on the midbrain surface persisted after maturation of the CST. At the pyramidal decussation, some CST fibers located near the midline crossed the midline, whereas others located more laterally extended ipsilaterally. In the spinal cord, the crossed CST fibers descended in the dorsal funiculus on the contralateral side and entered the contralateral gray matter normally, whereas the uncrossed fibers descended in the lateral funiculus on the ipsilateral side and entered the ipsilateral gray matter. As a result, the CST fibers that originated from 1 side of the brain projected bilaterally in the DKO spinal cord. Consistently, microstimulation of 1 side of the motor cortex evoked electromyogram responses only in the contralateral forelimb muscles of the wild-type mice, whereas the same stimulation evoked bilateral responses in the DKO mice. The functional consequences of the CST defects in the Sulf1/2 DKO mice were examined using the grid-walking, staircase, and single pellet-reaching tests, which have been used to evaluate motor function in mice. Compared with the wild-type mice, the Sulf1/2 DKO mice showed impaired performance in these tests, indicating deficits in motor function. These findings suggest that disruption of Sulf1/2 genes leads to both anatomical and functional defects of the CST.</p>

<p>Tonotopic differences in the structure and physiological function, e.g., synapse number, membrane properties, Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence of exocytosis and vesicle pool replenishment of inner hair cells (IHCs) along the longitudinal cochlear axis have recently been discovered, suggesting different gene expression patterns of IHCs. To determine whether IHCs present different gene expression patterns along the longitudinal cochlear axis, apical and basal IHCs were collected separately using the suction pipette technique from adult mouse cochleae for RNA-seq and genome-wide transcriptome analysis. We found 689 annotated genes showed more than 2-fold increase in expression. Interestingly, 93.4% of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was upregulated in apical IHCs. Although a subset of genes that related to IHC machinery and deafness were found to be differentially expressed, a gradient of gene expression was indeed detected in Ocm, Pvalb, Prkd1, Fbxo32, Nme2, and Sncg, which may play putative roles in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering and survival regulation. The expression of these genes was validated by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) or immunostaining. We conclude that IHCs from different mouse cochlear longitudinal position have different gene expression profiles. Our data might serve as a valuable resource for exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying different biological properties as well as the survival regulation of IHCs.</p>

<p>Up to 50% of traumatic brain injury (TBI) survivors demonstrate persisting and late-onset anxiety disorders indicative of limbic system dysregulation, yet the pathophysiology underlying the symptoms is unclear. We hypothesize that the development of TBI-induced anxiety-like behavior in an experimental model of TBI is mediated by changes in glutamate neurotransmission within the amygdala. Adult, male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent midline fluid percussion injury or sham surgery. Anxiety-like behavior was assessed at 7 and 28 days post-injury (DPI) followed by assessment of real-time glutamate neurotransmission in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) using glutamate-selective microelectrode arrays. The expression of anxiety-like behavior at 28 DPI coincided with decreased evoked glutamate release and slower glutamate clearance in the CeA, not BLA. Numerous factors contribute to the changes in glutamate neurotransmission over time. In two additional animal cohorts, protein levels of glutamatergic transporters (Glt-1 and GLAST) and presynaptic modulators of glutamate release (mGluR2, TrkB, BDNF, and glucocorticoid receptors) were quantified using automated capillary western techniques at 28 DPI. Astrocytosis and microglial activation have been shown to drive maladaptive glutamate signaling and were histologically assessed over 28 DPI. Alterations in glutamate neurotransmission could not be explained by changes in protein levels for glutamate transporters, mGluR2 receptors, astrocytosis, and microglial activation. Presynaptic modulators, BDNF and TrkB, were significantly decreased at 28 DPI in the amygdala. Dysfunction in presynaptic regulation of glutamate neurotransmission may contribute to anxiety-related behavior and serve as a therapeutic target to improve circuit function.</p>

<p>The spillover effect of brand scandals commonly exists, and this effect will damage the image of the company, industry or even country in which the scandal occurred. Most previous studies on the brand scandal spillover effect have mainly focused on the corporate and industry levels. However, with the development of brand internalization and media technology, the spillover effect at the country level is becoming increasingly common. In the current study, we conducted an event-related potentials study to explore the spillover effect of brand scandals on the country level as well as its underlying neural basis. Specifically, we compared consumers’ attitudes toward countries of origin with different stereotypes during different types of brand scandals. When a competence scandal took place in a competence stereotype country, a larger P2 mean amplitude was elicited compared to a warmth stereotype country. When a morality scandal took place in a warmth stereotype country, a larger LPP mean amplitude was induced compared to a competence stereotype country. We explain the current results based on expectancy violations theory. When competence scandals take place in competence stereotype countries, there will be a greater degree of violation of expectations compared with that in warmth stereotype countries, which leads to a negative evaluation of the country of origin. When morality scandals take place in warmth stereotype countries, people had a stronger negative emotional arousal when morality scandals happened in the warmth stereotype country.</p>

<p>Repetitive traumatic brain injury (rTBI) is a major health care concern that causes substantial neurological impairment. To better understand rTBI, we introduced a new model of rTBI in mice induced by sudden rotation in the coronal plane combined with lateral translation delivered twice at an interval of 24 h. By routine histology, histological examination of Prussian blue-stained sections revealed the presence of microbleed in the corpus callosum and brain stem. Amyloid precursor protein (β-APP) and neurofilament heavy-chain (NF-200) immunohistochemistry demonstrated axonal injury following rTBI. Swelling, waving, and enlargement axons were observed in the corpus callosum and brain stem 24 h after injury by Bielschowsky staining. Ultrastructural studies by electron microscopy provided further insights into the existence and progression of axonal injury. rTBI led to widespread astrogliosis and microgliosis in white matter, as well as significantly increased levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-1β. rTBI mice showed a significantly increased loss of righting reflex (LRR) duration within each time point compared with that of sham animals, which was under 15 min. rTBI mice exhibited depression-like behavior at 1 month. rTBI mice also demonstrated deficits in MWM testing. These results suggested that this model might be suitable for investigating rTBI pathophysiology and evaluating preclinical candidate therapeutics.</p>

Background<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and diabetes mellitus (DM) often coexist in patients because having one of these conditions increases risk for the other. These two diseases share several pathophysiological mechanisms, such as specific inflammatory signaling pathways, oxidative stress, and cell apoptosis. It is still unclear exactly which mechanisms associated with DM are responsible for increased AD risk. Studies have found that even transient elevation of brain Aβ levels can allow T2DM to slightly disrupt the neural milieu in a way that encourages pathologies associated with the onset of memory deficits and AD. A recent study argues that a potential common pathogenetic mechanism underlying both DM and AD is evidenced by the cooccurrence of amyloid brain legions and deposits containing both tau and Aβ in pancreatic β cells. Given these links, an investigation detailing disease mechanisms as well as treatment options for patients with cooccurring DM and AD is urgently needed. The biological effects of resveratrol relevant to DM and AD treatment include its abilities to modulate oxidative stress and reduce inflammation. A rat model of DM and concomitant AD was created for this study using intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin and hippocampal injection of Aβ1–40 to characterize resveratrol’s potential protective action.</p>Results<p>Resveratrol significantly increased the Sirt1 expression, inhibited the memory impairment, the increased acetylcholinesterase, malondialdehyde, interleukin-1β and interleukin 6 levels, and the decreased levels of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione in this rat model of diabetes and concomitant AD. The Sirt 1 inhibitor EX527 partially reversed the effects of resveratrol.</p>Conclusion<p>This study suggests that resveratrol may have a neuroprotective action through activation of Sirt1 signaling in diabetes and AD with concurrent onset.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00463">Variability in Executive Control Performance Is Predicted by Physical Activity</a></h4>

<p>Physical activity (PA) promotes neurogenesis and has neuroprotective effects on the brain, bolstering the structural and functional resources necessary for improved cognitive functioning. Intraindividual variability (IIV) in cognitive performance is linked to neuropsychological structure and functional ability. Despite evidence of the neurogenerative and neuroprotective effects of PA, limited investigation into the link between PA and IIV has been conducted. Across three studies we investigate the effect of PA on IIV in reaction time (RT) on three modified Flanker Tasks. The International PA Questionnaire was used to evaluate PA while the Attention Network Test (ANT) and two additional modified Flanker Tasks were used to assess executive control and attentional performance. RT coefficients of variation (RTCV) were calculated for each participant by dividing the standard deviation by the mean RT for each stimuli condition. Analysis revealed that basic RT was not associated with PA nor was PA predictive of IIV on the modified Flanker Tasks. However, three consistent findings emerged from analysis of the ANT. First, RTCV and moderate PA were positively related, such that more self-reported moderate PA was associated with greater IIV. Conversely, RTCV and vigorous PA were negatively related. Finally, when controlling for the effects of PA on IIV in young adults, variability decreases as age increases. In sum, PA is predictive of IIV on attentional and executive control tasks in young adults, though only at particular intensities and on certain tasks, indicating that task type and cognitive load are important determinants of the relationship between PA and cognitive performance. These findings are consistent with prior literature that suggests that the role of PA in young adults is reliant on specific interventions and measures in order to detect effects more readily found in adolescent and aging populations.</p>

<p>Space generally overshadows time in the construction of theories in cognitive neuroscience. In this paper, we pivot from the spatial axes to the temporal, analyzing fMRI image series to reveal structures in time rather than space. To determine affinities among global brain patterns at different times, core concepts in network analysis (derived from graph theory) were applied temporally, as relations among brain images at every time point during an fMRI scanning epoch. To explore the temporal structures observed through this adaptation of network analysis, data from 180 subjects in the Human Connectome Project were examined, during two experimental conditions: passive movie viewing and rest. The temporal brain, like the spatial brain, exhibits a modular structure, where “modules” are intermittent (distributed in time). These temporal entities are here referred to as themes. Short sequences of themes – motifs – were studied in sequences from 4 to 11 s in length. Many motifs repeated at constant intervals, and are therefore rhythmic; rhythms, converted to frequencies, were often harmonic. We speculate that the structure and interaction of these global oscillations underwrites the capacity to experience and navigate a world which is both recognizably stable and noticeably changing at every moment – a temporal world. In its temporal structure, this brain-constituted world resembles music.</p>

<p>Brain computer interfaces (BCI) for the rehabilitation of motor impairments exploit sensorimotor rhythms (SMR) in the electroencephalogram (EEG). However, the neurophysiological processes underpinning the SMR often vary over time and across subjects. Inherent intra- and inter-subject variability causes covariate shift in data distributions that impede the transferability of model parameters amongst sessions/subjects. Transfer learning includes machine learning-based methods to compensate for inter-subject and inter-session (intra-subject) variability manifested in EEG-derived feature distributions as a covariate shift for BCI. Besides transfer learning approaches, recent studies have explored psychological and neurophysiological predictors as well as inter-subject associativity assessment, which may augment transfer learning in EEG-based BCI. Here, we highlight the importance of measuring inter-session/subject performance predictors for generalized BCI frameworks for both normal and motor-impaired people, reducing the necessity for tedious and annoying calibration sessions and BCI training.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00583">Simultaneous Knockdown of Sprouty2 and PTEN Promotes Axon Elongation of Adult Sensory Neurons</a></h4>

<p>Sprouty2 (Spry2) and phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) are both well-established regulators of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling, and knockdown of Spry2 or PTEN enhances axon regeneration of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons. The major role of Spry2 is the inhibition of the rat sarcoma RAS/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, whereas PTEN acts mainly as an inhibitor of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. In non-neuronal cells, Spry2 increases the expression and activity of PTEN, and PTEN enhances the amount of Spry2 by the inhibition of the microRNA-21 (miR-21) that downregulates Spry2. Applying dissociated DRG neuron cultures from wild-type (WT) or Spry2 deficient mice, we demonstrate that PTEN protein was reduced after 72 h during rapid axonal outgrowth on the laminin substrate. Furthermore, PTEN protein was decreased in DRG cultures obtained from homozygous Spry2−/− knockout mice. Vice versa, Spry2 protein was reduced by PTEN siRNA in WT and heterozygous Spry2+/− neurons. Knockdown of PTEN in DRG cultures obtained from homozygous Spry2−/− knockout mice promoted axon elongation without increasing axonal branching. Activation of Akt, but not ERK, was stronger in response to PTEN knockdown in homozygous Spry2−/− DRG neurons than in WT neurons. Together, our study confirms the important role of the signaling modulators Spry2 and PTEN in axon growth of adult DRG neurons. Both function as endogenous inhibitors of neuronal growth factor signaling and their simultaneous knockdown promotes axon elongation more efficiently than the single knockdown of each inhibitor. Furthermore, Spry2 and PTEN are reciprocally downregulated in adult DRG neuron cultures. Axon growth is influenced by multiple factors and our results demonstrate that the endogenous inhibitors of axon growth, Spry2 and PTEN, are co-regulated in adult DRG neuron cultures. Together, our data demonstrate that combined approaches may be more useful to improve nerve regeneration than targeting one single inhibitor of axon growth.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00579">Fast and Efficient Differentiation of Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells Into ATP-Responsive Astrocytes</a></h4>

<p>Astrocytes are multifunctional cells in the CNS, involved in the regulation of neurovascular coupling, the modulation of electrolytes, and the cycling of neurotransmitters at synapses. Induction of astrocytes from stem cells remains a largely underdeveloped area, as current protocols are time consuming, lack granularity in astrocytic subtype generation, and often are not as efficient as neural induction methods. In this paper we present an efficient method to differentiate astrocytes from mouse embryonic stem cells. Our technique uses a cell suspension protocol to produce embryoid bodies (EBs) that are neurally inducted and seeded onto laminin coated surfaces. Plated EBs attach to the surface and release migrating cells to their surrounding environment, which are further inducted into the astrocytic lineage, through an optimized, heparin-based media. Characterization and functional assessment of the cells consists of immunofluorescent labeling for specific astrocytic proteins and sensitivity to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) stimulation. Our experimental results show that even at the earliest stages of the protocol, cells are positive for astrocytic markers (GFAP, ALDH1L1, S100β, and GLAST) with variant expression patterns and purinergic receptors (P2Y). Generated astrocytes also exhibit differential Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients upon stimulation with ATP, which evolve over the differentiation period. Metabotropic purinoceptors P2Y<sub>1</sub>R are expressed and we offer preliminary evidence that metabotropic purinoceptors contribute to Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. Our protocol is simple, efficient and fast, facilitating its use in multiple investigations, particularly in vitro studies of engineered neural networks.</p>

<p>Polymorphism of the cholesterol-24S-hydroxylase (CYP46A1) gene is thought to be a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). A single nucleotide polymorphism (T/C) in intron 2, rs754203, has been confirmed to be implicated in AD. Rs754203 is located in the long intronic non-coding RNA (LincRNA) sequence, which has previously been shown to be involved in the pathology of many diseases. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the role of LincRNA in the CYP46A1 gene expression and related AD pathology. SH-SY5Y cells with overexpressed TT or CC genotype CYP46A1 were used. Through RT-PCR, Western blot and ELISA assays, we found that LincRNA can affect the CYP46A1 gene expression and the production of 24-OHC and Aβ. Overexpression of LincRNA can significantly inhibit CYP46A1 expression and 24-OHC production, as well as increasing the Aβ expression level. Silencing of LincRNA confirmed the role that it plays in the regulation of CYP46A1, as well as the production of 24-OHC and Aβ. In addition, this effect was stronger in the A type LincRNA than in the G type LincRNA. Results from dual luciferase assays show that LincRNA inhibited the activity of the CYP46A1 gene promoter. This study indicates a possible novel role of LincRNA and provides a new way to look into the relationship between CYP46A1 polymorphism and AD pathology. This may identify a novel pathway through which to explore AD therapy.</p>

<p>The integrity of the frontal areas of the brain, specifically the prefrontal cortex, are critical to preserve cognition and mobility in late life. Prefrontal cortex regions are involved in executive functions and gait control and have been related to the performance of dual-tasks. Dual-task performance assessment may help identify older adults at risk of negative health outcomes. As an alternative to neuroimaging techniques that do not allow assessment during actual motion, functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a non-invasive technique that can assess neural activation through the measurement of cortical oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin levels, while the person is performing a motor task in a natural environment as well as during cognitive tasks. The aim of this review was to describe the use of fNIRS to study frontal lobe hemodynamics during cognitive, motor and dual-tasks in older adults. From the 46 included publications, 20 studies used only cognitive tasks, three studies used motor tasks and 23 used dual-tasks. Our findings suggest that fNIRS detects changes in frontal activation in older adults (cognitively healthy and mild cognitive impairment), especially while performing cognitive and dual-tasks. In both the comparison between older and younger adults, and in people with different neurological conditions, compared to healthier controls, the prefrontal cortex seems to experience a higher activation, which could be interpreted in the context of proposed neural inefficiency and limited capacity models. Further research is needed to establish standardized fNIRS protocols, study the cerebral hemodynamic in different neurological and systemic conditions that might influence cortical activation and explore its role in predicting incident health outcomes such as dementia.</p>

<p>Individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have worse gait performance compared to cognitive healthy individuals (CHI). The discrepancy between imagined and performed timed up and go test (TUG), known as the TUG delta time, is a marker of brain gait control impairment in individuals with MCI. The study aims to examine the association between the TUG delta time and brain gray matter (GM) volumes in CHI and individuals with MCI. A total of 326 participants, 156 CHI and 170 MCI, with TUG delta time and a brain T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were selected in this cross-sectional study. Individuals with MCI were older and had greater (i.e., worst performance) performed TUG and TUG delta time compared to CHI. The GM volume association with TUG delta time was examined in CHI and MCI assuming that increased TUG delta time would be associated with locally decreased GM volumes. No significant association was found in CHI, whereas TUG delta time was negatively associated with the GM volume of the right medial temporal lobe in individuals with MCI.</p>

ABSTRACT<p>The first retinal synapse, photoreceptor-&gt;bipolar cell (BC), is both anatomically and functionally complex. Within the same synaptic region, a change in presynaptic glutamate release is sensed by both ON BCs (DBCs) via the metabotropic glutamate receptor 6 (mGluR6), and OFF BCs (HBCs) via ionotropic glutamate receptors to establish parallel signaling pathways that preferentially encode light increments (ON) or decrements (OFF), respectively. The synaptic structural organization of ON and OFF-type BCs at the photoreceptor terminal differs. DBCs make an invaginating synapse that contains a diverse but incompletely understood complex of interacting proteins (signalplex). HBCs make primarily flat contacts that contain an apparent different set of proteins that is equally uncharacterized. LRIT3 is a synaptic protein known to be essential for ON pathway visual function. In both male and female mice, we demonstrate that LRIT3 interacts with and is required for expression of Nyctalopin, and thus TRPM1 at all DBC dendritic tips, but DBC signalplex components are not required for LRIT3 expression. Using whole-cell and multi-electrode array electrophysiology and glutamate imaging, we demonstrate that the loss of LRIT3 impacts both ON and OFF signaling pathway function. Without LRIT3, excitatory input to type 1 BCs is reduced, as are the visually evoked responses of many OFF retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). We conclude that the absence of LRIT3 expression disrupts excitatory input to OFF BCs and, thus disrupts the normal function of OFF RGCs.</p><p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> At the first visual synapse, photoreceptor cells signal to two distinct BC populations, one characterized by a depolarizing response to light onset (ON or DBCs), the other by a hyperpolarizing response (OFF or HBCs). The DBC light response depends on a G protein-coupled metabotropic glutamate receptor and associated protein complex, known as the DBC signalplex. Loss of function mutations in signalplex proteins lead to loss of scotopic visual function, and causes congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) in humans. Here we show how the loss of LRIT3, a previously identified signalplex protein, not only prevents functional assembly of the DBC signalplex, but also alters visual function through both ON and OFF signaling pathways.</p>

<p>Neurofeedback-guided motor-imagery training (NF-MIT) has been proposed as a promising intervention following upper limb motor impairment. In this intervention, paretic stroke patients receive online feedback about their brain activity while conducting a motor-imagery (MI) task with the paretic limb. Typically, the feedback provided in NF-MIT protocols is an abstract visual signal based on a fixed trial. Here we developed a self-paced NF-MIT paradigm with an embodiable feedback signal (EFS), which was designed to resemble the content of the mental act as closely as possible. To this end, the feedback was delivered via an embodiable, anthropomorphic robotic hand (RH), which was integrated into a closed-looped EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI). Whenever the BCI identified a new instance of a hand-flexion or hand-extension imagination by the participant, the RH carried out the corresponding movement with minimum delay. Nine stroke patients and nine healthy participants were instructed to control RH movements as accurately as possible, using mental activity alone. We evaluated the general feasibility of our paradigm on electrophysiological, subjective and performance levels. Regarding electrophysiological measures, individuals showed the predicted event-related desynchronization (ERD) patterns over sensorimotor brain areas. On the subjective level, we found that most individuals integrated the RH into their body scheme. With respect to RH control, none of our participants achieved a high level of control, but most managed to control the RH actions to some degree. Importantly, patients and controls achieved similar performance levels. The results support the view that self-paced embodiable NF-MIT is feasible for stroke patients and can complement classical NF-MIT.</p>

<p>Touching is a fundamental human behavior used to evaluate objects in the external world. Many previous studies have used tactile stimulation to conduct psychological and psychophysiological experiments. However, most of these studies used solid material, not water stream, as an experimental stimulus. To investigate water perception, or to easily control the temperature of an experimental stimulus, it is important to be able to control the water stimulus. In this study, we investigated the usability of water as an experimental stimulus for electroencephalography (EEG) experiments and report the basic EEG response to water stimulus. We developed a tactile stimulation device using a water stream to study EEG responses, with the ability to control the stimulus onset timing. As stimuli, we selected two types of water stream, normal and soft, based on a psychological experiment to confirm a difference of subjective feeling induced by these water streams. We conducted a typical oddball task using the two different water streams and recorded EEG waveforms from 64 electrodes while participants touched the water streams. We calculated P300 at the Pz electrode, alpha asymmetry at the frontal electrodes, and alpha suppression at the parietal area. As a result, we observed typical P300 differentiation based on the stimulus proportion (target 20% and standard 80%). We observed a weaker alpha suppression when participants touched the soft water stream compared to the normal shower. These results demonstrate the usability of water stream in psychophysiological studies and suggested that alpha suppression could be a candidate to evaluate comfort of water stream.</p>

<p>The resting state fMRI time series appears to have cyclic patterns, which indicates presence of cyclic interactions between different brain regions. Such interactions are not easily captured by pre-established resting state functional connectivity methods including zero-lag correlation, lagged correlation, and dynamic time warping distance. These methods formulate the functional interaction between different brain regions as similar temporal patterns within the time series. To use information related to temporal ordering, cyclicity analysis has been introduced to capture pairwise interactions between multiple time series. In this study, we compared the efficacy of cyclicity analysis with aforementioned similarity-based techniques in representing individual-level and group-level information. Additionally, we investigated how filtering and global signal regression interacted with these techniques. We obtained and analyzed fMRI data from patients with tinnitus and neurotypical controls at two different days, a week apart. For both patient and control groups, we found that the features generated by cyclicity and correlation (zero-lag and lagged) analyses were more reliable than the features generated by dynamic time warping distance in identifying individuals across visits. The reliability of all features, except those generated by dynamic time warping, improved as the global signal was regressed. Nevertheless, removing fluctuations &gt;0.1 Hz deteriorated the reliability of all features. These observations underscore the importance of choosing appropriate preprocessing steps while evaluating different analytical methods in describing resting state functional interactivity. Further, using different machine learning techniques including support vector machines, discriminant analyses, and convolutional neural networks, our results revealed that the manifestation of the group-level information within all features was not sufficient enough to dissociate tinnitus patients from controls with high sensitivity and specificity. This necessitates further investigation regarding the representation of group-level information within different features to better identify tinnitus-related alternation in the functional organization of the brain. Our study adds to the growing body of research on developing diagnostic tools to identify neurological disorders, such as tinnitus, using resting state fMRI data.</p>

The spatial structure of an evolving population affects the balance of natural selection versus genetic drift. Some structures amplify selection, increasing the role that fitness differences play in determining which mutations become fixed. Other structures suppress selection, reducing the effect of fitness differences and increasing the role of random chance. This phenomenon can be modeled by representing spatial structure as a graph, with individuals occupying vertices. Births and deaths occur stochastically, according to a specified update rule. We study <i>death-Birth</i> updating: An individual is chosen to die and then its neighbors compete to reproduce into the vacant spot. Previous numerical experiments suggested that amplifiers of selection for this process are either rare or nonexistent. We introduce a perturbative method for this problem for weak selection regime, meaning that mutations have small fitness effects. We show that fixation probability under weak selection can be calculated in terms of the coalescence times of random walks. This result leads naturally to a new definition of effective population size. Using this and other methods, we uncover the first known examples of transient amplifiers of selection (graphs that amplify selection for a particular range of fitness values) for the death-Birth process. We also exhibit new families of “reducers of fixation”, which decrease the fixation probability of all mutations, whether beneficial or deleterious.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VIgN6AScWdM" width="1" />

<p>by Josef Tkadlec, Andreas Pavlogiannis, Krishnendu Chatterjee, Martin A. Nowak</p>

The fixation probability of a single mutant invading a population of residents is among the most widely-studied quantities in evolutionary dynamics. Amplifiers of natural selection are population structures that increase the fixation probability of advantageous mutants, compared to well-mixed populations. Extensive studies have shown that many amplifiers exist for the Birth-death Moran process, some of them substantially increasing the fixation probability or even guaranteeing fixation in the limit of large population size. On the other hand, no amplifiers are known for the death-Birth Moran process, and computer-assisted exhaustive searches have failed to discover amplification. In this work we resolve this disparity, by showing that any amplification under death-Birth updating is necessarily <i>bounded</i> and <i>transient</i>. Our boundedness result states that even if a population structure does amplify selection, the resulting fixation probability is close to that of the well-mixed population. Our transience result states that for any population structure there exists a threshold <i>r</i><sup>⋆</sup> such that the population structure ceases to amplify selection if the mutant fitness advantage <i>r</i> is larger than <i>r</i><sup>⋆</sup>. Finally, we also extend the above results to <i>δ</i>-death-Birth updating, which is a combination of Birth-death and death-Birth updating. On the positive side, we identify population structures that maintain amplification for a wide range of values <i>r</i> and <i>δ</i>. These results demonstrate that amplification of natural selection depends on the specific mechanisms of the evolutionary process.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/c0_gkrtm8d4" width="1" />

<p>by Melanie Gerken, Sergej Kakorin, Kamel Chibani, Karl-Josef Dietz</p>

Cells contain a thiol redox regulatory network to coordinate metabolic and developmental activities with exogenous and endogenous cues. This network controls the redox state and activity of many target proteins. Electrons are fed into the network from metabolism and reach the target proteins via redox transmitters such as thioredoxin (TRX) and NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductases (NTR). Electrons are drained from the network by reactive oxygen species (ROS) through thiol peroxidases, e.g., peroxiredoxins (PRX). Mathematical modeling promises access to quantitative understanding of the network function and was implemented by using published kinetic parameters combined with fitting to known biochemical data. Two networks were assembled, namely the ferredoxin (FD), FD-dependent TRX reductase (FTR), TRX, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) pathway with 2-cysteine PRX/ROS as oxidant, and separately the FD, FD-dependent NADP reductase (FNR), NADPH, NTRC-pathway for 2-CysPRX reduction. Combining both modules allowed drawing several important conclusions of network performance. The resting H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration was estimated to be about 30 nM in the chloroplast stroma. The electron flow to metabolism exceeds that into thiol regulation of FBPase more than 7000-fold under physiological conditions. The electron flow from NTRC to 2-CysPRX is about 5.32-times more efficient than that from TRX-f1 to 2-CysPRX. Under severe stress (30 μM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) the ratio of electron flow to the thiol network relative to metabolism sinks to 1:251 whereas the ratio of e<sup>-</sup> flow from NTRC to 2-CysPRX and TRX-f1 to 2-CysPRX rises up to 1:67. Thus, the simulation provides clues on experimentally inaccessible parameters and describes the functional state of the chloroplast thiol regulatory network.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/je4rA2iFbGs" width="1" />

Pathogen timetrees are phylogenies scaled to time. They reveal the temporal history of a pathogen spread through the populations as captured in the evolutionary history of strains. These timetrees are inferred by using molecular sequences of pathogenic strains sampled at different times. That is, temporally sampled sequences enable the inference of sequence divergence times. Here, we present a new approach (RelTime with Dated Tips [RTDT]) to estimating pathogen timetrees based on a relative rate framework underlying the RelTime approach that is algebraic in nature and distinct from all other current methods. RTDT does not require many of the priors demanded by Bayesian approaches, and it has light computing requirements. In analyses of an extensive collection of computer-simulated datasets, we found the accuracy of RTDT time estimates and the coverage probabilities of their confidence intervals (CIs) to be excellent. In analyses of empirical datasets, RTDT produced dates that were similar to those reported in the literature. In comparative benchmarking with Bayesian and non-Bayesian methods (LSD, TreeTime, and treedater), we found that no method performed the best in every scenario. So, we provide a brief guideline for users to select the most appropriate method in empirical data analysis. RTDT is implemented for use via a graphical user interface and in high-throughput settings in the newest release of cross-platform MEGA X software, freely available from http://www.megasoftware.net.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pQiuHUzZKK0" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>The neurohypophysis (NH), located at the posterior lobe of the pituitary, is a major neuroendocrine tissue, which mediates osmotic balance, blood pressure, reproduction, and lactation by means of releasing the neurohormones oxytocin (OXT) and arginine-vasopressin (AVP) from the brain into the peripheral blood circulation. The major cellular components of the NH are hypothalamic axonal termini, fenestrated endothelia and pituicytes, the resident astroglia. However, despite the physiological importance of the NH, the exact molecular signature defining neurohypophyseal cell types and in particular the pituicytes, remains unclear. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq), we captured seven distinct cell types in the NH and intermediate lobe (IL) of adult male mouse. We revealed novel pituicyte markers showing higher specificity than previously reported. Bioinformatics analysis demonstrated that pituicyte is an astrocytic cell type whose transcriptome resembles that of tanycyte. Single molecule <i>in situ</i> hybridization revealed spatial organization of the major cell types implying intercellular communications. We present a comprehensive molecular and cellular characterization of neurohypophyseal cell types serving as a valuable resource for further functional research.</p>

Abstract
<p>Two-photon fluorescence microscopy has been used extensively to probe the structure and functions of cells in living biological tissue. Two-photon excitation generates fluorescence from the focal plane, but also from outside the focal plane, with out-of-focus fluorescence increasing as the focus is pushed deeper into tissue. It has been postulated that the two-photon depth limit, beyond which results become inaccurate, is where in-focus and out-of-focus fluorescence are equal, which we term the balance depth. Calculations suggest that the balance depth should be at ~600 µm in mouse cortex. Neither the two-photon depth limit nor the balance depth have been measured in brain tissue. We found the depth limit and balance depth of two-photon excitation in mice with GCaMP6 indicator expression in all layers of visual cortex, by comparing near-simultaneous two-photon and three-photon excitation. Two-photon and three-photon results from superficial locations were almost identical. two-photon results were inaccurate beyond the balance depth, consistent with the depth limit matching the balance depth for two-photon excitation. However, the two-photon depth limit and balance depth were at 450 µm, shallower than predicted by calculations. Our results were from tissue with a largely homogenous distribution of fluorophores. The expected balance depth is deeper in tissue with fewer fluorophores outside the focal plane and our results therefore establish a superficial bound on the two-photon depth limit in mouse visual cortex.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0300-19.2019v1?rss=1">Characterization of auditory and binaural spatial hearing in a Fragile X Syndrome mouse model</a></h4>

Abstract<p>The auditory brainstem compares sound-evoked excitation and inhibition from both ears to compute sound source location and determine spatial acuity. Although alterations to the anatomy and physiology of the auditory brainstem have been demonstrated in Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) it is not known whether these changes cause spatial acuity deficits in FXS. To test the hypothesis that FXS-related alterations to brainstem circuits impair spatial hearing abilities, a reflexive prepulse inhibition (PPI) task, with variations in sound (gap, location, masking) as the prepulse stimulus, was used on <i>Fmr1</i> knockout mice and B6 controls. Specifically, <i>Fmr1</i> mice show decreased PPI compared to wildtype during gap detection, changes in sound source location, and spatial release from masking with no alteration to their overall startle thresholds compared to wildtype. Lastly, <i>Fmr1</i> mice have increased latency to respond in these tasks suggesting additional impairments in the pathway responsible for reacting to a startling sound. This study further supports data in humans with FXS that show similar deficits in PPI.</p><p><b>Significance Statement:</b> This is the first study to characterize auditory spatial acuity in a mouse model of FXS. We saw minor differences in <i>Fmr1</i> mice compared to B6 mice in several measures of auditory acuity as measured by inhibition of the startle response. <i>Fmr1</i> mice had increased latency to startle for almost all conditions compared to B6 mice suggesting altered timing to acoustic cues. These experiments further show that, consistent with patient report and anatomical/physiological data, the auditory system is altered in a mouse model of FXS, though with some potential compensation leading to a subtle behavioral impact.</p>

<p>Respiratory motor failure is the leading cause of death in spinal cord injury (SCI). Cervical injuries disrupt connections between brainstem neurons that are the primary source of excitatory drive to respiratory motor neurons in the spinal cord and their targets. In addition to direct connections from bulbospinal neurons, respiratory motor neurons also receive excitatory and inhibitory inputs from propriospinal neurons, yet their role in the control of breathing is often overlooked. In this review, we will present evidence that propriospinal neurons play important roles in patterning muscle activity for breathing. These roles likely include shaping the pattern of respiratory motor output, processing and transmitting sensory afferent information, coordinating ventilation with motor activity, and regulating accessory and respiratory muscle activity. In addition, we discuss recent studies that have highlighted the importance of propriospinal neurons for recovery of respiratory muscle function following SCI. We propose that molecular genetic approaches to target specific developmental neuron classes in the spinal cord would help investigators resolve the many roles of propriospinal neurons in the control of breathing. A better understanding of how spinal circuits pattern breathing could lead to new treatments to improve breathing following injury or disease.</p>

<p>In an ever-changing environment, crossmodal recalibration is crucial to maintain precise and coherent spatial estimates across different sensory modalities. Accordingly, it has been found that perceived auditory space is recalibrated toward vision after consistent exposure to spatially misaligned audio-visual stimuli (VS). While this so-called ventriloquism aftereffect (VAE) yields internal consistency between vision and audition, it does not necessarily lead to consistency between the perceptual representation of space and the actual environment. For this purpose, feedback about the true state of the external world might be necessary. Here, we tested whether the size of the VAE is modulated by external feedback and reward. During adaptation audio-VS with a fixed spatial discrepancy were presented. Participants had to localize the sound and received feedback about the magnitude of their localization error. In half of the sessions the feedback was based on the position of the VS and in the other half it was based on the position of the auditory stimulus. An additional monetary reward was given if the localization error fell below a certain threshold that was based on participants’ performance in the pretest. As expected, when error feedback was based on the position of the VS, auditory localization during adaptation trials shifted toward the position of the VS. Conversely, feedback based on the position of the auditory stimuli reduced the visual influence on auditory localization (i.e., the ventriloquism effect) and improved sound localization accuracy. After adaptation with error feedback based on the VS position, a typical auditory VAE (but no visual aftereffect) was observed in subsequent unimodal localization tests. By contrast, when feedback was based on the position of the auditory stimuli during adaptation, no auditory VAE was observed in subsequent unimodal auditory trials. Importantly, in this situation no visual aftereffect was found either. As feedback did not change the physical attributes of the audio-visual stimulation during adaptation, the present findings suggest that crossmodal recalibration is subject to top–down influences. Such top–down influences might help prevent miscalibration of audition toward conflicting visual stimulation in situations in which external feedback indicates that visual information is inaccurate.</p>

<p>Transcranial direct and alternating current stimulation (tDCS and tACS, respectively) entail capability to modulate human brain dynamics and cognition. However, the comparability of these approaches at the level of large-scale functional networks has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, 44 subjects were randomly assigned to receive sham (N = 15), tDCS (N = 15), or tACS (N = 14). The first electrode (anode in tDCS) was positioned over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the target area, and the second electrode (cathode in tDCS) was placed over the right supraorbital region. tDCS was delivered with a constant current of 2 mA. tACS was fixed to 2 mA peak-to-peak with 6 Hz frequency. Stimulation was applied concurrently with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) acquisitions, both at rest and during the performance of a verbal working memory (WM) task. After stimulation, subjects repeated the fMRI WM task. Our results indicated that at rest, tDCS increased functional connectivity particularly within the default-mode network (DMN), while tACS decreased it. When comparing both fMRI WM tasks, it was observed that tDCS displayed decreased brain activity post-stimulation as compared to online. Conversely, tACS effects were driven by neural increases online as compared to post-stimulation. Interestingly, both effects primarily occurred within DMN-related areas. Regarding the differences in each fMRI WM task, during the online fMRI WM task, tACS engaged distributed neural resources which did not overlap with the WM-dependent activity pattern, but with some posterior DMN regions. In contrast, during the post-stimulation fMRI WM task, tDCS strengthened prefrontal DMN deactivations, being these activity reductions associated with faster responses. Furthermore, it was observed that tDCS neural responses presented certain consistency across distinct fMRI modalities, while tACS did not. In sum, tDCS and tACS modulate fMRI-derived network dynamics differently. However, both effects seem to focus on DMN regions and the WM network-DMN shift, which are highly affected in aging and disease. Thus, albeit exploratory and needing further replication with larger samples, our results might provide a refined understanding of how the DMN functioning can be externally modulated through commonly used non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, which may be of eventual clinical relevance.</p>

<p>A resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC)-constructed functional network (FN) derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data can effectively mine alterations in brain function during aging due to the non-invasive and effective advantages of fMRI. With global health research focusing on aging, several open fMRI datasets have been made available that combine deep learning with big data and are a new, promising trend and open issue for brain information detection in fMRI studies of brain aging. In this study, we proposed a new method based on deep learning from the perspective of big data, named Deep neural network (DNN) with Autoencoder (AE) pretrained Functional connectivity Analysis (DAFA), to deeply mine the important functional connectivity changes in fMRI during brain aging. First, using resting-state fMRI data from 421 subjects from the CamCAN dataset, functional connectivities were calculated using sliding window method, and the complex functional patterns were mined by an AE. Then, to increase the statistical power and reliability of the results, we used an AE-pretrained DNN to relabel the functional connectivities of each subject to classify them as belonging to the attributes of young or old individuals. A method called search-back analysis was performed to find alterations in brain function during aging according to the relabeled functional connectivities. Finally, behavioral data regarding fluid intelligence and response time were used to verify the revealed functional changes. Compared to traditional methods, DAFA revealed additional, important aged-related changes in FC patterns [e.g., FC connections within the default mode (DMN) and the sensorimotor and cingulo-opercular networks, as well as connections between the frontoparietal and cingulo-opercular networks, between the DMN and the frontoparietal/cingulo-opercular/sensorimotor/occipital/cerebellum networks, and between the sensorimotor and frontoparietal/cingulo-opercular networks], which were correlated to behavioral data. These findings demonstrated that the proposed DAFA method was superior to traditional FC-determining methods in discovering changes in brain functional connectivity during aging. In addition, it may be a promising method for exploring important information in other fMRI studies.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the leading type of dementia worldwide. Despite an increasing burden of disease due to a rapidly aging population, there is still a lack of complete understanding of the precise pathological mechanisms which drive its progression. Glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain and plays an essential role in the normal function and excitability of neuronal networks. While previous studies have shown alterations in the function of the glutamatergic system in AD, the underlying etiology of beta amyloid (Aβ<sub>1–42</sub>) induced changes has not been explored. Here we have investigated the acute effects of stereotaxic hippocampal Aβ<sub>1–42</sub> injection on specific glutamatergic receptors and transporters in the mouse hippocampus, using immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy 3 days after Aβ<sub>1–42</sub> injection in aged male C57BL/6 mice, before the onset of neuronal cell death. We show that acute injection of Aβ<sub>1–42</sub> is sufficient to induce cognitive deficits 3 days post-injection. We also report no significant changes in glutamate receptor subunits GluA1, GluA2, VGluT1, and VGluT2 in response to acute injection of Aβ<sub>1–42</sub> when compared with the ACSF-vehicle injected mice. However, we observed increased expression in the DG hilus and ventral stratum (str.) granulosum, CA3 str. radiatum and str. oriens, and CA1 str. radiatum of the GluN1 subunit, and increased expression within the CA3 str. radiatum and decreased expression within the DG str. granulosum of the GluN2A subunit in Aβ<sub>1–42</sub> injected mice compared to NC, and a similar trend observed when compared to ACSF-injected mice. We also observed alterations in expression patterns of glutamatergic receptor subunits and transporters within specific layers of hippocampal subregions in response to a microinjection stimulus. These findings indicate that the pathological alterations in the glutamatergic system observed in AD are likely to be partially a result of both acute and chronic exposure to Aβ<sub>1–42</sub> and implies a much more complex circuit mechanism associated with glutamatergic dysfunction than simply glutamate-mediated excitotoxic neuronal death.</p>

<p>The emotion generated by the touch of materials is studied via a protocol based on blind assessment of various stimuli. The human emotional reaction felt toward a material is estimated through (i) explicit measurements, using a questionnaire collecting valence and intensity, and (ii) implicit measurements of the activity of the autonomic nervous system, via a pupillometry equipment. A panel of 25 university students (13 women, 12 men), aged from 18 to 27, tested blind twelve materials such as polymers, sandpapers, wood, velvet and fur, randomly ordered. After measuring the initial pupil diameter, taken as a reference, its variation during the tactile exploration was recorded. After each touch, the participants were asked to quantify the emotional value of the material. The results show that the pupil size variation follows the emotional intensity. It is significantly larger during the touch of materials considered as pleasant or unpleasant, than with the touch of neutral materials. Moreover, after a time period of about 0.5 s following the stimulus, the results reveal significant differences between pleasant and unpleasant stimuli, as well as differences according to gender, i.e., higher pupil dilatation of women than men. These results suggest (i) that the autonomic nervous system is initially sensitive to high arousing stimulation, and (ii) that, after a certain period, the pupil size changes according to the cognitive interest induced and the emotional regulation adopted. This research shows the interest of the emotional characterization of materials for product design.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00097">Unsupervised Learning of Persistent and Sequential Activity</a></h4>

<p>Two strikingly distinct types of activity have been observed in various brain structures during delay periods of delayed response tasks: Persistent activity (PA), in which a sub-population of neurons maintains an elevated firing rate throughout an entire delay period; and Sequential activity (SA), in which sub-populations of neurons are activated sequentially in time. It has been hypothesized that both types of dynamics can be “learned” by the relevant networks from the statistics of their inputs, thanks to mechanisms of synaptic plasticity. However, the necessary conditions for a synaptic plasticity rule and input statistics to learn these two types of dynamics in a stable fashion are still unclear. In particular, it is unclear whether a single learning rule is able to learn both types of activity patterns, depending on the statistics of the inputs driving the network. Here, we first characterize the complete bifurcation diagram of a firing rate model of multiple excitatory populations with an inhibitory mechanism, as a function of the parameters characterizing its connectivity. We then investigate how an unsupervised temporally asymmetric Hebbian plasticity rule shapes the dynamics of the network. Consistent with previous studies, we find that for stable learning of PA and SA, an additional stabilization mechanism is necessary. We show that a generalized version of the standard multiplicative homeostatic plasticity (Renart et al., 2003; Toyoizumi et al., 2014) stabilizes learning by effectively masking excitatory connections during stimulation and unmasking those connections during retrieval. Using the bifurcation diagram derived for fixed connectivity, we study analytically the temporal evolution and the steady state of the learned recurrent architecture as a function of parameters characterizing the external inputs. Slow changing stimuli lead to PA, while fast changing stimuli lead to SA. Our network model shows how a network with plastic synapses can stably and flexibly learn PA and SA in an unsupervised manner.</p>

<p>Resting-state brain activities have been extensively investigated to understand the macro-scale network architecture of the human brain using non-invasive imaging methods such as fMRI, EEG, and MEG. Previous studies revealed a mechanistic origin of resting-state networks (RSNs) using the connectome dynamics modeling approach, where the neural mass dynamics model constrained by the structural connectivity is simulated to replicate the resting-state networks measured with fMRI and/or fast synchronization transitions with EEG/MEG. However, there is still little understanding of the relationship between the slow fluctuations measured with fMRI and the fast synchronization transitions with EEG/MEG. In this study, as a first step toward evaluating experimental evidence of resting state activity at two different time scales but in a unified way, we investigate connectome dynamics models that simultaneously explain resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) and EEG microstates. Here, we introduce empirical rsFC and microstates as evaluation criteria of simulated neuronal dynamics obtained by the Larter-Breakspear model in one cortical region connected with those in other cortical regions based on structural connectivity. We optimized the global coupling strength and the local gain parameter (variance of the excitatory and inhibitory threshold) of the simulated neuronal dynamics by fitting both rsFC and microstate spatial patterns to those of experimental ones. As a result, we found that simulated neuronal dynamics in a narrow optimal parameter range simultaneously reproduced empirical rsFC and microstates. Two parameter groups had different inter-regional interdependence. One type of dynamics was synchronized across the whole brain region, and the other type was synchronized between brain regions with strong structural connectivity. In other words, both fast synchronization transitions and slow BOLD fluctuation changed based on structural connectivity in the two parameter groups. Empirical microstates were similar to simulated microstates in the two parameter groups. Thus, fast synchronization transitions correlated with slow BOLD fluctuation based on structural connectivity yielded characteristics of microstates. Our results demonstrate that a bottom-up approach, which extends the single neuronal dynamics model based on empirical observations into a neural mass dynamics model and integrates structural connectivity, effectively reveals both macroscopic fast, and slow resting-state network dynamics.</p>

<p>Behavioral studies have shown spatial working memory impairment with aging in several animal species, including humans. Persistent activity of layer 3 pyramidal dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) neurons during delay periods of working memory tasks is important for encoding memory of the stimulus. In vitro studies have shown that these neurons undergo significant age-related structural and functional changes, but the extent to which these changes affect neural mechanisms underlying spatial working memory is not understood fully. Here, we confirm previous studies showing impairment on the Delayed Recognition Span Task in the spatial condition (DRSTsp), and increased in vitro action potential firing rates (hyperexcitability), across the adult life span of the rhesus monkey. We use a bump attractor model to predict how empirically observed changes in the aging dlPFC affect performance on the Delayed Response Task (DRT), and introduce a model of memory retention in the DRSTsp. Persistent activity—and, in turn, cognitive performance—in both models was affected much more by hyperexcitability of pyramidal neurons than by a loss of synapses. Our DRT simulations predict that additional changes to the network, such as increased firing of inhibitory interneurons, are needed to account for lower firing rates during the DRT with aging reported in vivo. Synaptic facilitation was an essential feature of the DRSTsp model, but it did not compensate fully for the effects of the other age-related changes on DRT performance. Modeling pyramidal neuron hyperexcitability and synapse loss simultaneously led to a partial recovery of function in both tasks, with the simulated level of DRSTsp impairment similar to that observed in aging monkeys. This modeling work integrates empirical data across multiple scales, from synapse counts to cognitive testing, to further our understanding of aging in non-human primates.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00574">Altered Levels and Isoforms of Tau and Nuclear Membrane Invaginations in Huntington’s Disease</a></h4>

<p>Since the early reports of neurofibrillary Tau pathology in brains of some Huntington’s disease (HD) patients, mounting evidence of multiple alterations of Tau in HD brain tissue has emerged in recent years. Such Tau alterations range from increased total levels, imbalance of isoforms generated by alternative splicing (increased 4R-/3R-Tau ratio) or by post-translational modifications such as hyperphosphorylation or truncation. Besides, the detection in HD brains of a new Tau histopathological hallmark known as Tau nuclear rods (TNRs) or Tau-positive nuclear indentations (TNIs) led to propose HD as a secondary Tauopathy. After their discovery in HD brains, TNIs have also been reported in hippocampal neurons of early Braak stage AD cases and in frontal and temporal cortical neurons of FTD-MAPT cases due to the intronic IVS10+16 mutation in the Tau gene (MAPT) which results in an increased 4R-/3R-Tau ratio similar to that observed in HD. TNIs are likely pathogenic for contributing to the disturbed nucleocytoplasmic transport observed in HD. A key question is whether correction of any of the mentioned Tau alterations might have positive therapeutic implications for HD. The beneficial effect of decreasing Tau expression in HD mouse models clearly implicates Tau in HD pathogenesis. Such beneficial effect might be exerted by diminishing the excess total levels of Tau or specifically by diminishing the excess 4R-Tau, as well as any of their downstream effects. In any case, since gene silencing drugs are under development to attenuate both Huntingtin (HTT) expression for HD and MAPT expression for FTD-MAPT, it is conceivable that the combined therapy in HD patients might be more effective than HTT silencing alone.</p>

<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the most frequently occurring movement disorder, with an increasing incidence due to an aging population. For many years, the post-mortem brain was regarded as the gold standard for the analysis of the human pathology of this disease. However, modern stem cell technologies, including the analysis of patient-specific neurons and glial cells, have opened up new avenues for dissecting the pathologic mechanisms of PD. Most data on morphological changes, such as cell death or changes in neurite complexity, or functional deficits were acquired in 2D and few in 3D models. This review will examine the prerequisites for human disease modeling in PD, covering the generation of midbrain neurons, 3D organoid midbrain models, the selection of controls including genetically engineered lines, and the study of cell-cell interactions. We will present major disease phenotypes in human in vitro models of PD, focusing on those phenotypes that have been detected in genetic and sporadic PD models. An additional point covered in this review will be the use of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived technologies to model cell-cell interactions in PD.</p>

<p>Mechanisms underlying the selective vulnerability of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) over those in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to degeneration in Parkinson’s disease (PD) remain poorly understood. DA neurons of SNpc and VTA are autonomous pacemakers but pacemaking in SNpc but not in VTA is accompanied by calcium influx through L-type calcium channel, Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 contributing to increased intracellular calcium and hence to cell death. Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>42A</sub>, an alternatively spliced short variant of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 has increased calcium influx. We, therefore studied the role of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>42</sub> (full-length channel) and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>42A</sub> in mouse SNpc in PD pathogenesis by quantifying mRNA levels of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>42</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>42A</sub> in SNpc and followed the change in their levels in MPTP induced parkinsonism mouse model. Using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry we observed the localization of mRNA of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>42</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>42A</sub> in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive DA neurons. Further, mRNA levels of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>42A</sub> were higher in SNpc as compared to the cortex. Upon MPTP treatment, mRNA levels of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>42</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>42A</sub> maintained their levels in SNpc in spite of the loss of ~50% of the DA neurons. This indicates that the expression of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>42</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3<sub>42A</sub> is maintained at a robust level during the degenerative process in the parkinsonism model.</p>

<p>miR-146a is a microRNA (miRNA) involved in neuroinflammation and aging; alterations in its expression were described in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, most of the studies conducted so far on this miRNA included a limited number of participants and produced contradictory results. We compared miR-146a levels in plasma from 33 AD patients vs. 28 age-matched non-affected controls (CTRL) through quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). No difference between the case and the control group was evidenced, but a correlation was detected between miR-146a levels and subjects’ age (p &lt; 0.001) as well as between miR-146a levels and patients’ Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores (p = 0.011), in an enlarged group of 51 AD patients and 45 CTRL supporting a role for this miRNA in aging processes and disease progression.</p>

During prenatal brain development, ion channels are ubiquitous across several cell types, including progenitor cells and migrating neurons but their function has not been clear. In the past, ion channel dysfunction has been primarily studied in the context of postnatal, differentiated neurons that fire action potentials – notably ion channels mutated in the epilepsies – yet data now support a surprising role in prenatal human brain disorders as well. Modern gene discovery approaches have identified defective ion channels in individuals with cerebral cortex malformations, which reflect abnormalities in early-to-middle stages of embryonic development (prior to ubiquitous action potentials).

<p>by Maria Bargués-Ribera, Chaitanya S. Gokhale</p>

Since its origins, thousands of years ago, agriculture has been challenged by the presence of evolving plant pathogens. Temporal rotations of host and non-host crops have helped farmers to control epidemics among other utilities, but further efforts for strategy assessment are needed. Here, we present a methodology for developing crop rotation strategies optimal for control of pathogens informed by numerical simulations of eco-evolutionary dynamics in one field. This approach can integrate agronomic criteria used in crop rotations—soil quality and cash yield—and the analysis of pathogen evolution in systems where hosts are artificially selected. Our analysis shows which rotation patterns perform better in maximising crop yield when an unspecified infection occurs, with yield being dependent on both soil quality and the strength of the epidemic. Importantly, the use of non-host crops, which both improve soil quality and control the epidemic results in similar rational rotation strategies for diverse agronomic and infection conditions. We test the repeatability of the best rotation patterns over multiple decades, an essential end-user goal. Our results provide sustainable strategies for optimal resource investment for increased food production and lead to further insights into the minimisation of pesticide use in a society demanding ever more efficient agriculture.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6Rt757zAX7c" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Humans and other animals adapt motor commands to predictable disturbances within tens of trials in laboratory conditions. A central question is how does the nervous system adapt to disturbances in natural conditions when exactly the same movements cannot be practiced several times. Because motor commands and sensory feedback together carry continuous information about limb dynamics, we hypothesized that the nervous system could adapt to unexpected disturbances online. We tested this hypothesis in two reaching experiments during which velocity-dependent force fields were randomly applied. We found that within-movement feedback corrections gradually improved, despite the fact that the perturbations were unexpected. Moreover, when participants were instructed to stop at a via-point, the application of a force field prior to the via-point induced mirror-image after-effects after the via-point, consistent with within-trial adaptation to the unexpected dynamics. These findings suggest a fast time-scale of motor learning, which complements feedback control and supports adaptation of an ongoing movement.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> An important function of the nervous system is to adapt motor commands in anticipation of predictable disturbances, which supports motor learning when we move in novel environments such as force fields. Here we show that movement control when exposed to unpredictable disturbances exhibit similar traits: motor corrections become tuned to the force field, and they evoke after effects within an ongoing sequence of movements. We propose and discuss the framework of adaptive control to explain these results: a real-time learning algorithm, which complements feedback control in the presence of model errors. This candidate model potentially links movement control and trial-by-trial adaptation of motor commands.</p>

Vocal production is hierarchical in the time domain. These hierarchies build upon biomechanical and neural dynamics across various timescales. We review studies in marmoset monkeys, songbirds, and other vertebrates. To organize these data in an accessible and across-species framework, we interpret the different timescales of vocal production as belonging to different levels of an autonomous systems hierarchy. The first level accounts for vocal acoustics produced on short timescales; subsequent levels account for longer timescales of vocal output.

<p>by Sungrim Seirin-Lee, Yuhki Yanase, Shunsuke Takahagi, Michihiro Hide</p>

Urticaria is a common skin disorder characterized by the rapid appearance and disappearance of local skin edema and flares with itching. It is characterized by various macroscopic skin eruptions unique to patients and/or subtypes of urticaria with respect to shape, size, color, and/or duration of eruptions. Nevertheless, the mechanism underlying multifarious eruptions in urticaria is largely unknown. The eruptions are believed to be evoked by histamine release from mast cells in the skin. However, the majority of visible characteristics of urticaria cannot be explained by a simple injection of histamine to the skin. To explain the multifarious eruptions of urticaria, we developed a single reaction-diffusion model suggesting the self-activation and self-inhibition regulation of histamine release from mast cells. Using the model, we found that various geometrical shapes of eruptions typically observed in patients can be explained by the model parameters and randomness or strength of the initial stimuli to mast cells. Furthermore, we verified that the wheal-expanding speed of urticaria, which is shown to be much smaller than that of the intradermal injection experimental system may be explained by our model and a simple diffusion equation. Our study suggests that the simple reaction-diffusion dynamics, including the independent self-activating and -inhibitory regulation of histamine release, may account for the essential mechanism underlying the formation of multifarious eruptions in urticaria.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/agkwHgohOw4" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>The preBötzinger complex (preBötC) generates the rhythm and rudimentary motor pattern for inspiratory breathing movements. Here, we test "burstlet" theory (Kam et al., 2013a), which posits that low amplitude burstlets, subthreshold from the standpoint of inspiratory bursts, reflect the fundamental oscillator of the preBötC. In turn, a discrete suprathreshold process transforms burstlets into full amplitude inspiratory bursts that drive motor output, measurable via hypoglossal nerve (XII) discharge <i>in vitro</i>. We recap observations by Kam and Feldman in neonatal mouse slice preparations: field recordings from preBötC demonstrate bursts and concurrent XII motor output intermingled with lower amplitude burstlets that do not produce XII motor output. Manipulations of excitability affect the relative prevalence of bursts and burstlets and modulate their frequency. Whole-cell and photonic recordings of preBötC neurons suggest that burstlets involve inconstant subsets of rhythmogenic interneurons. We conclude that discrete rhythm- and pattern-generating mechanisms coexist in the preBötC and that burstlets reflect its fundamental rhythmogenic nature.</p>

Abstract
<p>For humans, visual tracking of moving stimuli often triggers catch-up saccades during smooth pursuit. The switch between these continuous and discrete eye movements is a trade-off between tolerating sustained position error (PE) when no saccade is triggered or a transient loss of vision during the saccade due to saccadic suppression. de Brouwer et al. (2002b) demonstrated that catch-up saccades were less likely to occur when the target re-crosses the fovea within 40–180 ms. To date, there is no mechanistic explanation for how the trigger decision is made by the brain. Recently, we proposed a stochastic decision model for saccade triggering during visual tracking (Coutinho et al., 2018) that relies on a probabilistic estimate of predicted PE (PE<sub>pred</sub>). Informed by model predictions, we hypothesized that saccade trigger time length and variability will increase when pre-saccadic predicted errors are small or visual uncertainty is high (e.g., for blurred targets). Data collected from human participants performing a double step-ramp task showed that large pre-saccadic PE<sub>pred</sub> (&gt;10°) produced short saccade trigger times regardless of the level of uncertainty while saccade trigger times preceded by small PE<sub>pred</sub> (&lt;10°) significantly increased in length and variability, and more so for blurred targets. Our model also predicted increased signal-dependent noise (SDN) as retinal slip (RS) increases; in our data, this resulted in longer saccade trigger times and more smooth trials without saccades. In summary, our data supports our hypothesized predicted error-based decision process for coordinating saccades during smooth pursuit.</p>

ABSTRACT<p>α-Synuclein overexpression and aggregation are linked to Parkinson’s disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and several other neurodegenerative disorders. In addition to effects in the cell body, α-synuclein accumulation occurs at presynapses where the protein is normally localized. While it is generally agreed that excess α-synuclein impairs synaptic vesicle trafficking, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. We show here that acute introduction of excess human α-synuclein at a classic vertebrate synapse, the lamprey reticulospinal synapse, selectively impaired the uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) during synaptic vesicle recycling, leading to an increase in endocytic intermediates and a severe depletion of synaptic vesicles. Furthermore, human α-synuclein and lamprey -synuclein both interact <i>in vitro</i> with Hsc70, the chaperone protein that uncoats CCVs at synapses. After introducing excess α-synuclein to the giant axons of lampreys (males and females), Hsc70 availability was reduced at stimulated synapses, suggesting Hsc70 sequestration as a possible mechanism underlying the synaptic vesicle trafficking defects. In support of this hypothesis, increasing the levels of exogenous Hsc70 along with α-synuclein ameliorated the CCV uncoating and vesicle recycling defects. These experiments identify a reduction in Hsc70 availability at synapses, and consequently its function, as the mechanism by which α-synuclein induces synaptic vesicle recycling defects. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a viable chaperone-based strategy for reversing the synaptic vesicle trafficking defects associated with excess α-synuclein, which may be of value for improving synaptic function in PD and other synuclein-linked diseases.</p><p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Synaptic defects caused by α-synuclein overexpression are linked to cognitive deficits in PD and other diseases. However, the mechanisms by which excess α-synuclein impairs synaptic vesicle trafficking are unknown. Data presented here demonstrate that acute introduction of excess α-synuclein at a classical vertebrate synapse inhibits CCV uncoating, leading to impaired vesicle recycling. Furthermore, increasing α-synuclein also reduced synaptic levels of Hsc70, the clathrin uncoating chaperone protein, indicating sequestration of Hsc70 as a possible underlying mechanism. Subsequently increasing exogenous Hsc70 restored CCV uncoating and vesicle recycling. This study identifies a novel molecular mechanism underlying the α-synuclein-induced synaptic defects and presents one viable strategy for reversing them.</p>

<p>A mid-thoracic spinal cord injury (SCI) severely impairs activation of the lower limb sensorimotor spinal networks, leading to paralysis. Various neuromodulatory techniques including electrical and pharmacological activation of the spinal networks have been successful in restoring locomotor function after SCI. We hypothesized that the combination of self-training in a natural environment with epidural stimulation (ES), quipazine (Quip), and strychnine (Strych) would result in greater activity in a cage environment after paralysis compared to either intervention alone. To assess this, we developed a method measuring and characterizing the chronic EMG recordings from tibialis anterior (TA) and soleus (Sol) muscles while rats were freely moving in their home cages. We then assessed the relationship between the change in recorded activity over time and motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in animals receiving treatments. We found that the combination of ES, Quip, and Strych (sqES) generated the greatest level of recovery followed by ES + Quip (qES) while ES + Strych (sES) and ES alone showed least improvement in recorded activity. Further, we observed an exponential relationship between late response (LR) component of the MEPs and spontaneously generated step-like activity. Our data demonstrate the feasibility and potential importance of quantitatively monitoring mechanistic factors linked to activity-dependence in response to combinatorial interventions compared to individual therapies after SCI.</p>

<p>The efficacy of neocortical synapses to transmit during bursts of action potentials (APs) increases during development but the underlying mechanisms are largely unclear. We investigated synaptic efficacy at synapses between layer 5 pyramidal neurons (L5PNs) during development, using paired recordings, presynaptic two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, and numerical simulations. Our data confirm a developmental increase in paired-pulse ratios (PPRs). Independent of age, Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging revealed no AP invasion failures and linear summation of presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, making differences in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling an unlikely reason for developmental changes in PPR. Cumulative excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) amplitudes indicate that neither the size of the readily-releasable pool (RRP) nor replenishment rates were different between age groups, while the time-courses of depression differed significantly. At young synapses, EPSCs depressed rapidly to near steady-state during the first four APs, and synaptic failures (F<sub>syn</sub>) increased from 0 to 30%. At mature synapses this drop was significantly slower and strongly biphasic, such that near steady-state depression was reached not before 18 APs with F<sub>syn</sub> remaining between 0 and 5%. While young synapses reliably transmitted during pairs of APs, albeit with strong depression, mature synapses maintained near 100% transfer efficacy with significantly less depression during high-frequency bursts of APs. Our analysis indicates that at mature synapses a replenishment pool (RepP) is responsible for their high efficacy during bursting activity, while this RepP is functionally immature at young synapses. Hence, our data provide evidence that the functional maturation of a RepP underlies increasing synaptic efficacy during the development of an excitatory cortical synapse.</p>

<p>To clarify the different regional brain electroencephalogram (EEG) activities and biochemical responses in seizure and epilepsy models, we assessed the EEG and c-Fos immunolabeling characteristics in a lithium-pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) model and pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizure model. The regional brain activities were evaluated by EEG and c-Fos immunolabeling. ZnT3 immunostaining was performed to observe hippocampal mossy fiber sprouting (MFS) within 7 days after the induction of SE in the lithium-pilocarpine model. The EEG recordings showed distinctive features of activation in different brain areas. With the aggravation of the behavioral manifestations of the seizures, the frequency and amplitude of the discharges on EEG gradually increased. SE was eventually induced and sustained. The labeling of c-Fos was enhanced in the cortex and hippocampal CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG); however, compared to the PTZ-induced seizure model, c-Fos staining could only be observed in the striatum and thalamus in the lithium-pilocarpine-induced epilepsy model. In each brain region, prominent c-Fos labeling was observed 2 h and 4 h after the induction of SE or seizures and diminished at 24 h. During the lithium-pilocarpine-induced chronic epilepsy phase after SE induction, MFS was observed 7 days after SE and was accompanied by the dynamic evolution of epileptic EEG activities. These findings validated the lithium-pilocarpine-induced SE model as an epilepsy model with a specific spatial-temporal profile of neural activation. The EEG characteristics and c-Fos expression patterns differ from those presented in a previous study using a PTZ-induced seizure model. Hippocampal mossy fiber spouting might be associated with spontaneous seizures during the chronic phase and can be detected at least within 1 week by ZnT3 staining after stimulation.</p>

<p>Hair cells sense and transmit auditory, vestibular, and hydrodynamic information by converting mechanical stimuli into electrical signals. This process of mechano-electrical transduction (MET) requires a mechanically gated channel localized in the apical stereocilia of hair cells. In mice, lipoma HMGIC fusion partner-like 5 (LHFPL5) acts as an auxiliary subunit of the MET channel whose primary role is to correctly localize PCDH15 and TMC1 to the mechanotransduction complex. Zebrafish have two lhfpl5 genes (lhfpl5a and lhfpl5b), but their individual contributions to MET channel assembly and function have not been analyzed. Here we show that the zebrafish lhfpl5 genes are expressed in discrete populations of hair cells: lhfpl5a expression is restricted to auditory and vestibular hair cells in the inner ear, while lhfpl5b expression is specific to hair cells of the lateral line organ. Consequently, lhfpl5a mutants exhibit defects in auditory and vestibular function, while disruption of lhfpl5b affects hair cells only in the lateral line neuromasts. In contrast to previous reports in mice, localization of Tmc1 does not depend upon Lhfpl5 function in either the inner ear or lateral line organ. In both lhfpl5a and lhfpl5b mutants, GFP-tagged Tmc1 and Tmc2b proteins still localize to the stereocilia of hair cells. Using a stably integrated GFP-Lhfpl5a transgene, we show that the tip link cadherins Pcdh15a and Cdh23, along with the Myo7aa motor protein, are required for correct Lhfpl5a localization at the tips of stereocilia. Our work corroborates the evolutionarily conserved co-dependence between Lhfpl5 and Pcdh15, but also reveals novel requirements for Cdh23 and Myo7aa to correctly localize Lhfpl5a. In addition, our data suggest that targeting of Tmc1 and Tmc2b proteins to stereocilia in zebrafish hair cells occurs independently of Lhfpl5 proteins.</p>

<p>This study investigates the assessment of motor imagery (MI) ability in humans. Commonly, MI ability is measured through two methodologies: a self-administered questionnaire (MIQ-3) and the mental chronometry (MC), which measures the temporal discrepancy between the actual and the imagined motor tasks. However, both measures rely on subjects' self-assessment and do not use physiological measures. In this study, we propose a novel set of features extracted from the nonlinear dynamics of the eye gaze signal to discriminate between good and bad imagers. To this aim, we designed an experiment where twenty volunteers, categorized as good or bad imagers according to MC, performed three tasks: a motor task (MT), a visual Imagery task (VI), and a kinaesthetic Imagery task (KI). Throughout the experiment, the subjects' eye gaze was continuously monitored using an eye-tracking system. Eye gaze time series were analyzed through recurrence quantification analysis of the reconstructed phase space and compared between the two groups. Statistical results have shown how nonlinear eye behavior can express an inner dynamics of imagery mental process and may be used as a more objective and physiological-based measure of MI ability.</p>

<p>Untreated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) depletes its host CD4 cells, ultimately leading to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). In brain, the HIV confines itself to astrocytes and microglia, the resident brain macrophages, but does not infect oligodendrocytes and neurons. Nonetheless, cognitive symptoms associated with HIV and AIDS are attributed to loss of axons and white matter damage. We used design-based stereology to estimate the numbers of neocortical neurons and glial cells (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia), in a series of 12 patients dying with AIDS before the era of retroviral treatments, and in 13 age-matched control brains. Relative to the control material, there was a 19% loss of neocortical neuron (p = 0.04) and a 29% reduction of oligodendrocytes (p = 0.003) in the patients with AIDS, whereas astrocyte and microglia numbers did not differ between patients and controls. Furthermore, we saw a 17% reduction in mean hemispheric volume in the AIDS group (p = 0.0015), which was driven by neocortical and white matter loss (p &lt; 0.05), while the archicortex, subcortical gray matter, and ventricular volumes were within normal limits. Our results confirm previous reports of neuronal loss in AIDS. The new finding of oligodendrocyte loss supports the proposal that HIV in the brain provokes demyelination and axonal dysfunction and suggests that remyelination treatment strategies may be beneficial to patients suffering from HIV-associated neurocognitive deficits.</p>

<p>Objective: Previous studies have shown that the performance of the famous face P300-speller was better than that of the classical row/column flashing P300-speller. Furthermore, in some studies, the brain was more active when responding to one's own face than to a famous face, and a self-face stimulus elicited larger amplitude event-related potentials (ERPs) than did a famous face. Thus, we aimed to study the role of the self-face paradigm on further improving the performance of the P300-speller system with the famous face P300-speller paradigm as the control paradigm.</p><p>Methods: We designed two facial P300-speller paradigms based on the self-face and a famous face (Ming Yao, a sports star; the famous face spelling paradigm) with a neutral expression.</p><p>Results: ERP amplitudes were significantly greater in the self-face than in the famous face spelling paradigm at the parietal area from 340 to 480 ms (P300), from 480 to 600 ms (P600f), and at the fronto-central area from 700 to 800 ms. Offline and online classification results showed that the self-face spelling paradigm accuracies were significantly higher than those of the famous face spelling paradigm at superposing first two times (P &lt; 0.05). Similar results were found for information transfer rates (P &lt; 0.05).</p><p>Conclusions: The self-face spelling paradigm significantly improved the performance of the P300-speller system. This has significant practical applications for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and could avoid infringement issues caused by using images of other people's faces.</p>

<p>Dynamic Functional Connectivity (DFC) analysis is a promising approach for the characterization of brain electrophysiological activity. In this study, we investigated abnormal alterations due to mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) using DFC of the source reconstructed magnetoencephalographic (MEG) resting-state recordings. Brain activity in several well-known frequency bands was first reconstructed using beamforming of the MEG data to determine ninety anatomical brain regions of interest. A DFC graph was formulated using the imaginary part of phase-locking values, which were obtained from 30 mTBI patients and 50 healthy controls (HC). Subsequently, we estimated normalized Laplacian transformations of individual, statistically and topologically filtered quasi-static graphs. The corresponding eigenvalues of each node synchronization were then computed and through the neural-gas algorithm, we quantized the evolution of the eigenvalues resulting in distinct network microstates (NMstates). The discrimination level between the two groups was assessed using an iterative cross-validation classification scheme with features either the NMstates in each frequency band, or the combination of the so-called chronnectomics (flexibility index, occupancy time of NMstate, and Dwell time) with the complexity index over the evolution of the NMstates across all frequency bands. Classification performance based on chronnectomics showed 80% accuracy, 99% sensitivity, and 49% specificity. However, performance was much higher (accuracy: 91–97%, sensitivity: 100%, and specificity: 77–93%) when focusing on the microstates. Exploring the mean node degree within and between brain anatomical networks (default mode network, frontoparietal, occipital, cingulo-opercular, and sensorimotor), a reduced pattern occurred from lower to higher frequency bands, with statistically significant stronger degrees for the HC than the mTBI group. A higher entropic profile on the temporal evolution of the modularity index was observed for both NMstates for the mTBI group across frequencies. A significant difference in the flexibility index was observed between the two groups for the β frequency band. The latter finding may support a central role of the thalamus impairment in mTBI. The current study considers a complete set of frequency-dependent connectomic markers of mTBI-caused alterations in brain connectivity that potentially could serve as markers to assess the return of an injured subject back to normality.</p>

<p>The function of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (TREM2) has been described within microglia with a beneficial activated phenotype. However, the role of TREM2 underlying microglial phenotypic alterations in the cross-tolerance protection of heat acclimation (HA) against the inflammatory stimuli electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure is less well known. Here, we investigated the TREM2-related signaling mechanism induced by HA in EMF-stimulated N9 microglial cells (N9 cells). We found that EMF exposure significantly increased the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6), and the expression of M1 markers (CD11b and CD86); meanwhile, decreased the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) and the expression of M2 markers (CD206 and Arg1) in N9 cells. Clearly, HA treatment decreased the secretion of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 and the expression of CD11b and CD86, and enhanced the production of IL-4 and IL-10 and the expression of CD206 and Arg1. Moreover, TREM2 esiRNA and selective inhibitor of PI3K clearly decreased anti-inflammatory cytokines production, M2 markers expression, and phosphorylation of PI3K and Akt following HA plus EMF stimulation. These results indicate that TREM2 and PI3K-Akt pathway are involved in the cross-tolerance protective effect of HA in microglial polarization towards the EMF exposure. This finding inspires future studies that aim to explore the non-drug approaches underlying EMF stimulation and other central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory diseases.</p>

<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and dyslexia are both neurodevelopmental disorders with high prevalence in children. Both disorders have strong genetic basis, and share similar social communication deficits co-occurring with impairments of reading or language. However, whether these two disorders share common genetic risks remain elusive. DOCK4 (dedicator for cytokinesis 4), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the small GTPase Rac1, is one of few genes that are associated with both ASD and dyslexia. Dock4 is important for neuronal development and social behaviors. Two DOCK4 variations, Exon27-52 deletion (protein product: Dock4-945VS) and a missense mutation at rs2074130 (protein product: Dock4-R853H), are associated with dyslexia and/or ASD with reading difficulties. The present study explores the molecular and cellular functions of these two DOCK4 variants on neuronal development, by comparing them with the wild-type Dock4 protein. Notably, it is revealed that both mutants of Dock4 showed decreased ability to activate not only Rac1, but also another small GTPase Rap1. Consistently, both mutants were dysfunctional for regulation of cell morphology and cytoskeleton. Using Neuro-2a cells and hippocampus neurons as models, we found that both mutants had compromised function in promoting neurite outgrowth and dendritic spine formation. Electrophysiological recordings further showed that R853H partially lost the ability to promote excitatory synaptic transmission, whereas 945VS totally lost the ability. Together, we identified R853 as a previously uncharacterized site for the regulation of the integrity of Dock4 function, and provides insights in understanding the common molecular pathophysiology of ASD and dyslexia.</p>

<p>Pharmacological treatment facilitating locomotor expression will also have some effects on reflex expression through the modulation of spinal circuitry. Buspirone, a partial serotonin receptor agonist (5-HT<sub>1</sub><sub>A</sub>), was recently shown to facilitate and even trigger locomotor movements in mice after complete spinal lesion (Tx). Here, we studied its effect on the H-reflex after acute Tx in adult mice. To avoid possible impacts of anesthetics on H-reflex depression, experiments were performed after decerebration in un-anesthetized mice (N = 20). The H-reflex in plantar muscles of the hind paw was recorded after tibial nerve stimulation 2 h after Tx at the 8th thoracic vertebrae and was compared before and every 10 min after buspirone (8 mg/kg, i.p.) for 60 min (N = 8). Frequency-dependent depression (FDD) of the H-reflex was assessed before and 60 min after buspirone. Before buspirone, a stable H-reflex could be elicited in acute spinal mice and FDD of the H-reflex was observed at 5 and 10 Hz relative to 0.2 Hz, FDD was still present 60 min after buspirone. Early after buspirone, the H-reflex was significantly decreased to 69% of pre-treatment, it then increased significantly 30–60 min after treatment, reaching 170% 60 min after injection. This effect was not observed in a control group (saline, N = 5) and was blocked when a 5-HT<sub>1</sub><sub>A</sub> antagonist (NAD-299) was administered with buspirone (N = 7). Altogether results suggest that the reported pro-locomotor effect of buspirone occurs at a time where there is a 5-HT<sub>1</sub><sub>A</sub> receptors mediated reflex depression followed by a second phase marked by enhancement of reflex excitability.</p>

<p>Podoplanin (Pdpn), a brain-tumor-related glycoprotein identified in humans and animals, is endogenously expressed in several organs critical for life support such as kidney, lung, heart and brain. In the brain, Pdpn has been identified in proliferative nestin-positive adult neural progenitor cells and in neurons of the neurogenic hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), a structure associated to anxiety, critical for learning and memory functions and severely damaged in people with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). The in vivo role of Pdpn in adult neurogenesis and anxiety-like behavior remained however unexplored. Using mice with disrupted Pdpn gene as a model organism and applying combined behavioral, molecular biological and electrophysiological assays, we here show that the absence of Pdpn selectively impairs long-term synaptic depression in the neurogenic DG without affecting the CA3-Schaffer’s collateral-CA1 synapses. Pdpn deletion also enhanced the proliferative capacity of DG neural progenitor cells and diminished survival of differentiated neuronal cells in vitro. In addition, mice with podoplanin gene disruption showed increased anxiety-like behaviors in experimentally validated behavioral tests as compared to wild type littermate controls. Together, these findings broaden our knowledge on the molecular mechanisms influencing hippocampal synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis in vivo and reveal Pdpn as a novel molecular target for future studies addressing general anxiety disorder and synaptic depression-related memory dysfunctions.</p>

<p>Aging is associated with cognitive decline and dysregulation of the circadian system, which modulates hippocampal-dependent memory as well as biological processes underlying hippocampal function. While circadian dysfunction and memory impairment are common features of aging and several neurodegenerative brain disorders, how aging impacts the circadian expression patterns of proteins involved in processes that underlie hippocampal-dependent memory is not well understood. In this study, we profiled the hippocampal proteomes of young and middle-aged mice across two circadian cycles using quantitative mass spectrometry in order to explore aging-associated changes in the temporal orchestration of biological pathways. Of the ∼1,420 proteins that were accurately quantified, 15% (214 proteins) displayed circadian rhythms in abundance in the hippocampus of young mice, while only 1.6% (23 proteins) were rhythmic in middle-aged mice. Remarkably, aging disrupted the circadian regulation of proteins involved in cellular functions critical for hippocampal function and memory, including dozens of proteins participating in pathways of energy metabolism, neurotransmission, and synaptic plasticity. These included processes such as glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, synaptic vesicle cycling, long-term potentiation, and cytoskeletal organization. Moreover, aging altered the daily expression rhythms of proteins implicated in hallmarks of aging and the pathogenesis of several age-related neurodegenerative brain disorders affecting the hippocampus. Notably, we identified age-related alterations in the rhythmicity of proteins involved in mitochondrial dysfunction and loss of proteostasis, as well as proteins involved in the pathogenesis of disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. These insights into aging-induced changes in the hippocampal proteome provide a framework for understanding how the age-dependent circadian decline may contribute to cognitive impairment and the development of neurodegenerative diseases during aging.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a growing global threat to healthcare in the aging population. In the USA alone, it is estimated that one in nine persons over the age of 65 years is living with AD. The pathology is marked by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition in the brain, which is further enhanced by the neuroinflammatory process. Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine rich repeat and pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) are the major neuroinflammatory pathways that intensify AD pathogenesis. Histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2)-mediated epigenetic mechanisms play a major role in the genesis and neuropathology of AD. Therefore, therapeutic drugs, which can target Aβ production, NLRP3 activation, and HDAC2 levels, may play a major role in reducing Aβ levels and the prevention of associated neuropathology of AD. In this study, we demonstrate that withaferin A (WA), an extract from Withania somnifera plant, significantly inhibits the Aβ production and NF-κB associated neuroinflammatory molecules’ gene expression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cytokine release inhibitory drug 3 (CRID3), an inhibitor of NLRP3, significantly prevents inflammasome-mediated gene expression in our in vitro AD model system. We have also observed that mithramycin A (MTM), an HDAC2 inhibitor, significantly upregulated the synaptic plasticity gene expression and downregulated HDAC2 in SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing amyloid precursor protein (SH-APP cells). Therefore, the introduction of these agents targeting Aβ production, NLRP3-mediated neuroinflammation, and HDAC2 levels will have a translational significance in the prevention of neuroinflammation and associated neurodegeneration in AD patients.</p>

Discrimination of different sound frequencies is pivotal to recognizing and localizing friend and foe. Here, I review the various hair cell-tuning mechanisms used among vertebrates. Electrical resonance, filtering of the receptor potential by voltage-dependent ion channels, is ubiquitous in all non-mammals, but has an upper limit of ~1 kHz. The frequency range is extended by mechanical resonance of the hair bundles in frogs and lizards, but may need active hair-bundle motion to achieve sharp tuning up to 5 kHz.

<p>White matter pathways that surround the hippocampus comprise its afferent and efferent connections, and are therefore crucial in mediating the function of the hippocampus. We recently demonstrated a role for the hippocampus in both spatial memory and olfactory identification in humans. In the current study, we focused our attention on the fimbria-fornix white matter bundle and investigated its relationship with spatial memory and olfactory identification. We administered a virtual navigation task and an olfactory identification task to 55 young healthy adults and measured the volume of the fimbria-fornix. We found that the volume of the right fimbria-fornix and its subdivisions is correlated with both navigational learning and olfactory identification in those who use hippocampus-based spatial memory strategies, and not in those who use caudate nucleus-based navigation strategies. These results are consistent with our recent finding that spatial memory and olfaction rely on similar neural networks and structures.</p>

<p>Coupling of neural oscillations is essential for the transmission of cortical motor commands to motoneuron pools through direct and indirect descending motor pathways. Most studies focus on iso-frequency coupling between brain and muscle activities, i.e., cortico-muscular coherence, which is thought to reflect motor command transmission in the mono-synaptic corticospinal pathway. Compared to this direct pathway, indirect corticobulbospinal motor pathways involve multiple intermediate synaptic connections via spinal interneurons. Neuronal processing of synaptic inputs can lead to modulation of inter-spike intervals which produces cross-frequency coupling. This theoretical study aims to evaluate the effect of the number of synaptic layers in descending pathways on the expression of cross-frequency coupling between supraspinal input and the cumulative output of the motoneuron pool using a computer simulation. We simulated descending pathways as various layers of interneurons with a terminal motoneuron pool using Hogdkin–Huxley styled neuron models. Both cross- and iso-frequency coupling between the supraspinal input and the motorneuron pool output were computed using a novel generalized coherence measure, i.e., n:m coherence. We found that the iso-frequency coupling is only dominant in the mono-synaptic corticospinal tract, while the cross-frequency coupling is dominant in multi-synaptic indirect motor pathways. Furthermore, simulations incorporating both mono-synaptic direct and multi-synaptic indirect descending pathways showed that increased reliance on a multi-synaptic indirect pathway over a mono-synaptic direct pathway enhances the dominance of cross-frequency coupling between the supraspinal input and the motorneuron pool output. These results provide the theoretical basis for future human subject study quantitatively assessing motor command transmission in indirect vs. direct pathways and its changes after neurological disorders such as unilateral brain injury.</p>

<p>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a complex condition that develops after experiencing a severe emotional trauma, with or without physical trauma. There is no known cure and evidence-based treatments, which are effective in reducing symptoms, have low retention rates. It is therefore important, in addition to seeking new therapeutics, to identify ways to reduce the likelihood of developing PTSD. The fact that some, but not all, individuals exposed to the same traumatic event develop PTSD suggests that there is individual susceptibility. Investigating susceptibility and underlying factors will be better guided if there is a coherent framework for such investigations. In this review, we propose that susceptibility is a dynamic state that is comprised of susceptibility factors (before trauma) and sequalae factors (during or after trauma, but before PTSD diagnosis). We define key features of susceptibility and sequalae factors as: (1) they are detectable before trauma (susceptibility factors) or during/shortly after trauma (sequalae factors), (2) they can be manipulated, and (3) manipulation of these factors alters the likelihood of developing PTSD, thus affecting resilience. In this review we stress the importance of investigating susceptibility to PTSD with appropriate animal models, because prospective human studies are expensive and manipulation of susceptibility and sequalae factors for study purposes may not always be feasible. This review also provides a brief overview of a subset of animal models that study PTSD-related behaviors and related alterations in endocrine and brain systems that focus on individual differences, peri- and post-trauma. Attention is drawn to the RISP model (Revealing Individual Susceptibility to a PTSD-like Phenotype) which assesses susceptibility before trauma. Using the RISP model and expression of plasticity-associated immediate early genes, Arc and Homer1a, we have identified impaired hippocampal function as a potential susceptibility factor. We further discuss other putative susceptibility factors and approaches to mitigate them. We assert that this knowledge will guide successful strategies for interventions before, during or shortly after trauma that can decrease the probability of developing PTSD.</p>

<p>ADP-ribosylation of the P2X7k splice variant on mouse T cells by Ecto-ADP-ribosyltransferase ARTC2.2 in response to its substrate extracellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) triggers cell death. Since NAD<sup>+</sup> is released as a danger signal during tissue damage, this NAD<sup>+</sup>-induced cell death (NICD) may impact the survival of other cell populations co-expressing P2X7 and of one of the ARTC2 isoforms (ARTC2.1, ARTC2.2). NICD of brain-resident, non-T cell populations has only been rudimentarily investigated. In this study, we evaluated the susceptibility of two glia cell populations, astrocytes and microglia, towards NICD. We found that astrocytes and microglia strongly upregulate cell surface levels of ARTC2.1 and ADP-ribosylation of cell surface proteins in response to treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) 1 and 2 inhibitor U0126, but do not respond to extracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> with P2X7 activation and induction of cell death. Furthermore, we found that astrocytes and microglia preferentially express the ADP-ribosylation-insensitive P2X7a splice variant, likely accounting for the resistance of these cells to NICD.</p>

Purpose<p>To investigate the mechanisms underlying the gray matter volume (GMV) and functional connectivity (FC) changes in aquaporin-4 antibody-positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) patients.</p>Methods<p>This cross-sectional study consisted of 21 patients with aquaporin-4 antibody-positive NMOSD and 22 age- and sex-matched healthy controls.

NMOSD patients showed significantly decreased FC values (P &lt; 0.05) in both the left and right calcarine, right lingual gyrus and left thalamus, respectively, when compared to HC. We also observed a positive correlation between the FC values of the left thalamus, bilateral calcarine gyrus and the visual acuity, respectively (P &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, a negative association was seen between the duration of the disease, frequency of optic neuritis, and the FC values in the lingual gyrus, bilateral calcarine gyrus, and right lingual gyrus, respectively (P &lt; 0.05).</p>Conclusion<p>Reduced visual acuity and frequency of optic neuritis are associated with alterations in the GMV and FC in NMOSD.

<p>The aim of this article is to introduce the concept of Cognitive Fitness (CF), identify its key ingredients underpinning both real-time task performance and career longevity in high-risk occupations, and to canvas a holistic framework for their assessment, training, and augmentation. CF as a capacity to deploy neurocognitive resources, knowledge and skills to meet the demands of operational task performance, is likely to be multi-faceted and differentially malleable. A taxonomy of CF constructs derived from Cognitive Readiness (CR) and Mental fitness (MF) literature maps into phases of operational cycle from foundational to advanced, mission-ready and recovery. Foundational cognitive attributes, such as attention, executive control and co-action, were hypothesized to be trainable at the initial Cognitive Gym phase. More advanced training targets at the CR phase included stress and arousal regulation, adaptability, teamwork, situation awareness (including detection, sense-making and prediction) and decision making (de-biasing and confidence calibration). The mission-ready training phase is focused on tolerances (to sleep loss, monotony, pain, frustration, uncertainty) and resistance (to distraction, deception or manipulation). Operational Augmentation phase relies on support tools such as decision aids and fatigue countermeasures, while the Recovery phase employs reflexive (e.g., mindfulness), and restorative practices (e.g., nutrition and sleep hygiene). The periodization of cognitive training in this cycle is hypothesized to optimize both real-time cognitive performance and the resilience that enables life-long thriving. One of the most promising avenues of validating this hypothesis is by developing an expert consensus on the key CF ingredients and their relative importance in high-performance settings.</p>

<p>Human obesity is associated with low-grade chronic systemic inflammation, alterations in brain structure and function, and cognitive impairment. Rodent models of obesity show that high-calorie diets cause brain inflammation (neuroinflammation) in multiple regions, including the hippocampus, and impairments in hippocampal-dependent memory tasks. To determine if similar effects exist in humans with obesity, we applied Diffusion Basis Spectrum Imaging (DBSI) to evaluate neuroinflammation and axonal integrity. We examined diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data in two independent cohorts of obese and non-obese individuals (Cohort 1: 25 obese/21 non-obese; Cohort 2: 18 obese/41 non-obese). We applied Tract-based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) to allow whole-brain white matter (WM) analyses and compare DBSI-derived isotropic and anisotropic diffusion measures between the obese and non-obese groups. In both cohorts, the obese group had significantly greater DBSI-derived restricted fraction (DBSI-RF; an indicator of neuroinflammation-related cellularity), and significantly lower DBSI-derived fiber fraction (DBSI-FF; an indicator of apparent axonal density) in several WM tracts (all corrected p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, using region of interest analyses, average DBSI-RF and DBSI-FF values in the hippocampus were significantly greater and lower, respectively, in obese relative to non-obese individuals (Cohort 1: p = 0.045; Cohort 2: p = 0.008). Hippocampal DBSI-FF and DBSI-RF and amygdalar DBSI-FF metrics related to cognitive performance in Cohort 2. In conclusion, these findings suggest that greater neuroinflammation-related cellularity and lower apparent axonal density are associated with human obesity and cognitive performance. Future studies are warranted to determine a potential role for neuroinflammation in obesity-related cognitive impairment.</p>

<p>Classification learning is a preeminent human ability within the animal kingdom but the key mechanisms of brain networks regulating learning remain mostly elusive. Recent neuroimaging advancements have depicted human brain as a complex graph machinery where brain regions are nodes and coherent activities among them represent the functional connections. While long-term motor memories have been found to alter functional connectivity in the resting human brain, a graph topological investigation of the short-time effects of learning are still not widely investigated. For instance, classification learning is known to orchestrate rapid modulation of diverse memory systems like short-term and visual working memories but how the brain functional connectome accommodates such modulations is unclear. We used publicly available repositories (openfmri.org) selecting three experiments, two focused on short-term classification learning along two consecutive runs where learning was promoted by trial-by-trial feedback errors, while a further experiment was used as supplementary control. We analyzed the functional connectivity extracted from BOLD fMRI signals, and estimated the graph information processing in the cerebral networks. The information processing capability, characterized by complex network statistics, significantly improved over runs, together with the subject classification accuracy. Instead, null-learning experiments, where feedbacks came with poor consistency, did not provoke any significant change in the functional connectivity over runs. We propose that learning induces fast modifications in the overall brain network dynamics, definitely ameliorating the short-term potential of the brain to process and integrate information, a dynamic consistently orchestrated by modulations of the functional connections among specific brain regions.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00448">Cross-Situational Statistical Learning of New Words Despite Bilateral Hippocampal Damage and Severe Amnesia</a></h4>

<p>Word learning requires learners to bind together arbitrarily-related phonological, visual, and conceptual information. Prior work suggests that this binding can be robustly achieved via incidental cross-situational statistical exposure to words and referents. When cross-situational statistical learning (CSSL) is tested in the laboratory, there is no information on any given trial to identify the referent of a novel word. However, by tracking which objects co-occur with each word across trials, learners may acquire mappings through statistical association. While CSSL behavior is well-characterized, its brain correlates are not. The arbitrary nature of CSSL mappings suggests hippocampal involvement, but the incremental, statistical nature of the learning raises the possibility of neocortical or procedural learning systems. Prior studies have shown that neurological patients with hippocampal pathology have word-learning impairments, but this has not been tested in a statistical learning paradigm. Here, we used a neuropsychological approach to test whether patients with bilateral hippocampal pathology (N = 3) could learn new words in a CSSL paradigm. In the task, patients and healthy comparison participants completed a CSSL word-learning task in which they acquired eight word/object mappings. During each trial of the CSSL task, participants saw two objects on a computer display, heard one novel word, and selected the most likely referent. Across trials, words were 100% likely to co-occur with their referent, but only 14.3% likely with non-referents. Two of three amnesic patients learned the associations between objects and word forms, although performance was impaired relative to healthy comparison participants. Our findings show that the hippocampus is not strictly necessary for CSSL for words, although it may facilitate such learning. This is consistent with a hybrid account of CSSL supported by implicit and explicit memory systems, and may have translational applications for remediation of (word-) learning deficits in neurological populations with hippocampal pathology.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00081">Inhibitory Network Bistability Explains Increased Interneuronal Activity Prior to Seizure Onset</a></h4>

<p>Recent experimental literature has revealed that GABAergic interneurons exhibit increased activity prior to seizure onset, alongside additional evidence that such activity is synchronous and may arise abruptly. These findings have led some to hypothesize that this interneuronal activity may serve a causal role in driving the sudden change in brain activity that heralds seizure onset. However, the mechanisms predisposing an inhibitory network toward increased activity, specifically prior to ictogenesis, without a permanent change to inputs to the system remain unknown. We address this question by comparing simulated inhibitory networks containing control interneurons and networks containing hyperexcitable interneurons modeled to mimic treatment with 4-Aminopyridine (4-AP), an agent commonly used to model seizures in vivo and in vitro. Our in silico study demonstrates that model inhibitory networks with 4-AP interneurons are more prone than their control counterparts to exist in a bistable state in which asynchronously firing networks can abruptly transition into synchrony driven by a brief perturbation. This transition into synchrony brings about a corresponding increase in overall firing rate. We further show that perturbations driving this transition could arise in vivo from background excitatory synaptic activity in the cortex. Thus, we propose that bistability explains the increase in interneuron activity observed experimentally prior to seizure via a transition from incoherent to coherent dynamics. Moreover, bistability explains why inhibitory networks containing hyperexcitable interneurons are more vulnerable to this change in dynamics, and how such networks can undergo a transition without a permanent change in the drive. We note that while our comparisons are between networks of control and ictogenic neurons, the conclusions drawn specifically relate to the unusual dynamics that arise prior to seizure, and not seizure onset itself. However, providing a mechanistic explanation for this phenomenon specifically in a pro-ictogenic setting generates experimentally testable hypotheses regarding the role of inhibitory neurons in pre-ictal neural dynamics, and motivates further computational research into mechanisms underlying a newly hypothesized multi-step pathway to seizure initiated by inhibition.</p>

<p>Activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP) was discovered and first characterized in the laboratory of Prof. Illana Gozes to be regulated by vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP) toward neuroprotection. Importantly, ADNP is a master regulator of &gt;400 genes, essential for brain formation, while its haploinsufficiency causes cognitive impairments. Recently, de novo mutations in ADNP were identified as leading to the autism-like ADNP syndrome, mimicked by the Adnp-deficient mouse model. Furthermore, novel peptide derivatives of the neuroprotective ADNP-snippet NAP (NAPVSIPQ), developed in our laboratory, include SKIP and the mirroring all D-amino acid SKIP (D-SKIP). We now extended previous evidence suggesting potential antagonistic features for D-SKIP, compared with the neuroprotective peptide SKIP, as was observed by NMR analysis and social/olfactory functional testing. Here, an impact of the Adnp genotype was observed in the Morris Water Maze (MWM) test measuring cognition, coupled with improvement by SKIP, opposing the inert/exacerbating effect of D-SKIP. In the elevated plus-maze and open field tests measuring anxiety-related behaviors, contrasting effects of SKIP and D-SKIP were found, with SKIP improving/preserving the normal phenotype of the mouse, and D-SKIP causing alterations. Lastly, an in silico analysis suggested that SKIP and D-SKIP bind the microtubule end binding (EB) proteins EB1 and EB3 in different conformations, thereby indicating distinctive natures for the two peptides, potentially mediating differential in vivo effects. Altogether, our findings corroborate the notion of D-SKIP acting as an antagonist, thus distinguishing it from the neuroprotective SKIP.</p>

<p>Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) checkpoint blockade with an antibody has been shown to reduce amyloid-β plaques, associated pathologies and cognitive impairment in mouse models. More recently, this approach has shown effectiveness in a tauopathy mouse model to improve cognition and reduce tau lesions. Follow-up studies by other laboratories did not see similar benefits of this type of therapy in other amyloid-β plaque models. Here, we report a modest increase in locomotor activity but no effect on cognition or tau pathology, in a different more commonly used tauopathy model following a weekly treatment for 12 weeks with the same PD-1 antibody and isotype control as in the original Aβ- and tau-targeting studies. These findings indicate that further research is needed before clinical trials based on PD-1 checkpoint immune blockage are devised for tauopathies.</p>

<p>Through a number of an extensive autopsy, biomarker, and genomics studies, researchers have recently defined a novel type of dementia known as limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE). LATE is perhaps best characterized by the presence of hyperphosphorylated TDP-43, which plays multi-functional roles through interactions with DNA and RNA, leading to significant alterations in the transcription and translation of particular genes. As individuals of advanced age represent a rapidly growing demographic group globally, there is a steadily increasing rate of LATE incidence that has to date received insufficient recognition despite its serious implications for public health. TDP-43 is the common pathology of various age-related dementia, therefore, it may be a potential and promising therapeutic target for such diseases. In the present review, we discuss the pathways regulating TDP-43 expression, metabolism, and disease activity in order to better understand the link between TDP-43 proteinopathy and LATE at the genetic, pathological, and clinical levels.</p>

<p>Do subjects with atypical patterns in attentional and executive behaviour show different brain network topology and react differently towards nicotine administration? The efficacy of pro-cognitive drugs like nicotine considerably varies between subjects and previous theoretical and empirical evidence suggest stronger behavioural nicotine effects in subjects with low performance. One problem is, however, how to best define low performance, especially if several cognitive functions are assessed for subject characterisation. We here present a method that used a multivariate, robust outlier detection algorithm to identify subjects with suspicious patterns of performance in attentional and executive functioning. In contrast to univariate approaches, this method is sensitive towards extreme positions within the multidimensional space that do not have to be extreme values in the individual behavioural distributions. The method was applied to a dataset of healthy, non-smoking subjects (n = 34) who were behaviorally characterised by an attention and executive function test on which N = 12 volunteers were classified as outliers. All subjects then underwent a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan to characterise brain network topology and an experimental behavioural paradigm under placebo and nicotine (7 mg patch) that gauged aspects of attention and executive function. Our results indicate that subjects with an atypical multivariate pattern in attention and executive functioning showed significant differences in nodal brain network integration in visual association and pre-motor brain regions during resting state. These differences in brain network topology significantly predicted larger individual nicotine effects on attentional processing. In summary, the current approach successfully identified a subgroup of healthy volunteers with low behavioural performance who differ in brain network topology and attentional benefit from nicotine.</p>

<p>Astronauts return to Earth from spaceflight missions with impaired mobility and balance; recovery can last weeks postflight. This is due in large part to the altered vestibular signaling and sensory reweighting that occurs in microgravity. The neural mechanisms of spaceflight-induced vestibular changes are not well understood. Head-down-tilt bed rest (HDBR) is a common spaceflight analog environment that allows for study of body unloading, fluid shifts, and other consequences of spaceflight. Subjects in this context still show vestibular changes despite being in Earth’s gravitational environment, potentially due to sensory reweighting. Previously, we found evidence of sensory reweighting and reduced neural efficiency for vestibular processing in subjects who underwent a 70-day HDBR intervention. Here we extend this work by evaluating the impact of HDBR paired with elevated carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) to mimic International Space Station conditions on vestibular neural processing. Eleven participants (6 males, 34 ± 8 years) completed 30 days of HDBR combined with 0.5% atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> (HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub>). Participants underwent six functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sessions pre-, during, and post- HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> while we measured brain activity in response to pneumatic skull taps (a validated method of vestibular stimulation). We also measured mobility and balance performance several times before and after the intervention. We found support for adaptive neural changes within the vestibular system during bed rest that subsequently recovered in several cortical and cerebellar regions. Further, there were multiple brain regions where greater pre- to post- deactivation was associated with reduced pre- to post- balance declines. That is, increased deactivation of certain brain regions associated with better balance post-HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub>. We also found that, compared to HDBR alone (n = 13 males; 29 ± 3 years) HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> is associated with greater increases in activation of multiple frontal, parietal, and temporal regions during vestibular stimulation. This suggests interactive or additive effects of bed rest and elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. Finally, we found stronger correlations between pre- to post- HDBR + CO<sub>2</sub> brain changes and dependence on the visual system during balance for subjects who developed signs of Spaceflight-Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS). Together, these findings have clear implications for understanding the neural mechanisms of bed rest and spaceflight-related changes in vestibular processing, as well as adaptation to altered sensory inputs.</p>

<p>The addition and removal of presynaptic terminals reconfigures neuronal circuits of the mammalian neocortex, but little is known about how this presynaptic structural plasticity is controlled. Since mitochondria can regulate presynaptic function, we investigated whether the presence of axonal mitochondria relates to the structural plasticity of presynaptic boutons in mouse neocortex. We found that the overall density of axonal mitochondria did not appear to influence the loss and gain of boutons. However, positioning of mitochondria at individual presynaptic sites did relate to increased stability of those boutons. In line with this, synaptic localization of mitochondria increased as boutons aged and showed differing patterns of localization at en passant and terminaux boutons. These results suggest that mitochondria accumulate locally at boutons over time to increase bouton stability.</p>

<p>Acute liver failure (ALF) implies a severe and rapid liver dysfunction that leads to impaired liver metabolism and hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Recent studies have suggested that several brain alterations such as astrocytic dysfunction and energy metabolism impairment may synergistically interact, playing a role in the development of HE. The purpose of the present study is to investigate early alterations in redox status, energy metabolism and astrocytic reactivity of rats submitted to ALF. Adult male Wistar rats were submitted either to subtotal hepatectomy (92% of liver mass) or sham operation to induce ALF. Twenty-four hours after the surgery, animals with ALF presented higher plasmatic levels of ammonia, lactate, ALT and AST and lower levels of glucose than the animals in the sham group. Animals with ALF presented several astrocytic morphological alterations indicating astrocytic reactivity. The ALF group also presented higher mitochondrial oxygen consumption, higher enzymatic activity and higher ATP levels in the brain (frontoparietal cortex). Moreover, ALF induced an increase in glutamate oxidation concomitant with a decrease in glucose and lactate oxidation. The increase in brain energy metabolism caused by astrocytic reactivity resulted in augmented levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP1) and a decreased activity of the enzymes superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px). These findings suggest that in the early stages of ALF the brain presents a hypermetabolic state, oxidative stress and astrocytic reactivity, which could be in part sustained by an increase in mitochondrial oxidation of glutamate.</p>

<p>Background: A continuous effort has been devoted to identifying factors that contribute to individual differences in pain perception. Amongst the personality traits, Neuroticism is assumed to be the most significant moderator of experimental and clinical pain. Multi-sensory responsiveness to daily sensations has been shown to be associated with pain perception. Yet, neither the relationship between personality traits and multi-sensory responsiveness nor the impact of both these factors to pain perception have been examined. Thus, this study aims to explore the contribution of both multi-sensory responsiveness and personality traits to pain perception in a daily context.</p><p>Methods: A community-based sample of 204 adults completed the Sensory Responsiveness Questionnaire-Intensity Scale (SRQ-IS); the Big Five Inventory (BFI); and the Pain Sensitivity Questionnaire (PSQ).</p><p>Results: The partial eta-square demonstrated that the SRQ-IS Aversive sub-scale score had the strongest relationship with the PSQ-Total score, accounting for 9% of the variation. The regression coefficient relating PSQ-Total score with SRQ-IS Aversive, and BFI sub-scales of Extraversion, Neuroticism and Openness-to-Experience scores was found to be r = 0.39 (p &lt; 0.0001), accounting for 16% of the variance, and yielding a large effect size.</p><p>Discussion: To the best of our knowledge this is the first study to report on the interplay between aversive responsiveness to daily sensations and personality traits of Neuroticism, Openness-to-Experience, and Extraversion as contributing factors to daily pain sensitivity, amongst which aversive responsiveness was found as the major contributing factor. This study may broaden the understanding of the pain experience variability, both in practice and in experimental research.</p>

<p>Targeted memory reactivation (TMR) during slow-wave oscillations (SWOs) in sleep has been demonstrated with sensory cues to achieve about 5–12% improvement in post-nap memory performance on simple laboratory tasks. But prior work has not yet addressed the one-shot aspect of episodic memory acquisition, or dealt with the presence of interference from ambient environmental cues in real-world settings. Further, TMR with sensory cues may not be scalable to the multitude of experiences over one’s lifetime. We designed a novel non-invasive non-sensory paradigm that tags one-shot experiences of minute-long naturalistic episodes in immersive virtual reality (VR) with unique spatiotemporal amplitude-modulated patterns (STAMPs) of transcranial electrical stimulation (tES). In particular, we demonstrated that these STAMPs can be re-applied as brief pulses during SWOs in sleep to achieve about 10–20% improvement in the metamemory of targeted episodes compared to the control episodes at 48 hours after initial viewing. We found that STAMPs can not only facilitate but also impair metamemory for the targeted episodes based on an interaction between pre-sleep metamemory and the number of STAMP applications during sleep. Overnight metamemory improvements were mediated by spectral power increases following the offset of STAMPs in the slow-spindle band (8–12 Hz) for left temporal areas in the scalp electroencephalography (EEG) during sleep. These results prescribe an optimal strategy to leverage STAMPs for boosting metamemory and suggest that real-world episodic memories can be modulated in a targeted manner even with coarser, non-invasive spatiotemporal stimulation.</p>

<p>When designing electrodes and probes for brain–machine interfaces, one of the challenges faced involves minimizing the brain-tissue response, which would otherwise create an environment that is detrimental for the accurate functioning of such probes. Following the implantation process, the brain reacts with a sterile inflammation response and resulting astrocytic glial scar formation, potentially resulting in neuronal cell loss around the implantation site. Such alterations in the naïve brain tissue can hinder both the quality of neuronal recordings, and the efficacy of deep-brain stimulation. In this study, we chronically implanted a glass-supported polyimide microelectrode in the dorsolateral striatum of Sprague–Dawley rats. The effect of high-frequency stimulation (HFS) was investigated using c-fos immunoreactivity techniques. GFAP and ED1 immunohistochemistry were used to analyze the brain-tissue response. No changes in c-fos expression were found for either the acute or chronic stimulus groups; although a c-fos expression was found along the length of the implantation trajectory, following chronic implantation of our stiffened polyimide microelectrode. Furthermore, we also observed the formation of a glial scar around the microelectrode, with an accompanying low number of inflammation cells. Histological and statistical analysis of NeuN-positive cells did not demonstrate a pronounced “kill zone” with accompanying neuronal cell death around the implantation site, neither on the polymer side, nor on the glass side of the PI-glass probe.</p>

<p>Automated cerebrovascular segmentation of time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (TOF-MRA) images is an important technique, which can be used to diagnose abnormalities in the cerebrovascular system, such as vascular stenosis and malformation. Automated cerebrovascular segmentation can direct show the shape, direction and distribution of blood vessels. Although deep neural network (DNN)-based cerebrovascular segmentation methods have shown to yield outstanding performance, they are limited by their dependence on huge training dataset. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised cerebrovascular segmentation method of TOF-MRA images based on DNN and hidden Markov random field (HMRF) model. Our DNN-based cerebrovascular segmentation model is trained by the labeling of HMRF rather than manual annotations. The proposed method was trained and tested using 100 TOF-MRA images. The results were evaluated using the dice similarity coefficient (DSC), which reached a value of 0.79. The trained model achieved better performance than that of the traditional HMRF-based cerebrovascular segmentation method in binary pixel-classification. This paper combines the advantages of both DNN and HMRF to train the model with a not so large amount of the annotations in deep learning, which leads to a more effective cerebrovascular segmentation method.</p>

<p>People living with schizophrenia (SCZ) experience severe brain network deterioration. The brain is constantly fizzling with non-linear causal activities measured by electroencephalogram (EEG) and despite the variety of effective connectivity methods, only few approaches can quantify the direct non-linear causal interactions. To circumvent this problem, we are motivated to quantitatively measure the effective connectivity by multivariate transfer entropy (MTE) which has been demonstrated to be able to capture both linear and non-linear causal relationships effectively. In this work, we propose to construct the EEG effective network by MTE and further compare its performance with the Granger causal analysis (GCA) and Bivariate transfer entropy (BVTE). The simulation results quantitatively show that MTE outperformed GCA and BVTE under varied signal-to-noise conditions, edges recovered, sensitivity, and specificity. Moreover, its applications to the P300 task EEG of healthy controls (HC) and SCZ patients further clearly show the deteriorated network interactions of SCZ, compared to that of the HC. The MTE provides a novel tool to potentially deepen our knowledge of the brain network deterioration of the SCZ.</p>

<p>Neural circuits interconnect to organize large-scale networks that generate perception, cognition, memory, and behavior. Information in the nervous system is processed both through parallel, independent circuits and through intermixing circuits. Analyzing the interaction between circuits is particularly indispensable for elucidating how the brain functions. Monosynaptic circuit tracing with glycoprotein (G) gene-deleted rabies viral vectors (RVΔG) comprises a powerful approach for studying the structure and function of neural circuits. Pseudotyping of RVΔG with the foreign envelope EnvA permits expression of transgenes such as fluorescent proteins, genetically-encoded sensors, or optogenetic tools in cells expressing TVA, a cognate receptor for EnvA. Trans-complementation with rabies virus glycoproteins (RV-G) enables trans-synaptic labeling of input neurons directly connected to the starter neurons expressing both TVA and RV-G. However, it remains challenging to simultaneously map neuronal connections from multiple cell populations and their interactions between intermixing circuits solely with the EnvA/TVA-mediated RV tracing system in a single animal. To overcome this limitation, here, we multiplexed RVΔG circuit tracing by optimizing distinct viral envelopes (oEnvX) and their corresponding receptors (oTVX). Based on the EnvB/TVB and EnvE/DR46-TVB systems derived from the avian sarcoma leukosis virus (ASLV), we developed optimized TVB receptors with lower or higher affinity (oTVB-L or oTVB-H) and the chimeric envelope oEnvB, as well as an optimized TVE receptor with higher affinity (oTVE-H) and its chimeric envelope oEnvE. We demonstrated independence of RVΔG infection between the oEnvA/oTVA, oEnvB/oTVB, and oEnvE/oTVE systems and in vivo proof-of-concept for multiplex circuit tracing from two distinct classes of layer 5 neurons targeting either other cortical or subcortical areas. We also successfully labeled common input of the lateral geniculate nucleus to both cortico-cortical layer 5 neurons and inhibitory neurons of the mouse V1 with multiplex RVΔG tracing. These oEnvA/oTVA, oEnvB/oTVB, and oEnvE/oTVE systems allow for differential labeling of distinct circuits to uncover the mechanisms underlying parallel processing through independent circuits and integrated processing through interaction between circuits in the brain.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01384">Functional Ultrasound (fUS) During Awake Brain Surgery: The Clinical Potential of Intra-Operative Functional and Vascular Brain Mapping</a></h4>

Background and Purpose<p>Oncological neurosurgery relies heavily on making continuous, intra-operative tumor-brain delineations based on image-guidance. Limitations of currently available imaging techniques call for the development of real-time image-guided resection tools, which allow for reliable functional and anatomical information in an intra-operative setting. Functional ultrasound (fUS), is a new mobile neuro-imaging tool with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution, which allows for the detection of small changes in blood dynamics that reflect changes in metabolic activity of activated neurons through neurovascular coupling. We have applied fUS during conventional awake brain surgery to determine its clinical potential for both intra-operative functional and vascular brain mapping, with the ultimate aim of achieving maximum safe tumor resection.</p>Methods<p>During awake brain surgery, fUS was used to image tumor vasculature and task-evoked brain activation with electrocortical stimulation mapping (ESM) as a gold standard. For functional imaging, patients were presented with motor, language or visual tasks, while the probe was placed over (ESM-defined) functional brain areas. For tumor vascular imaging, tumor tissue (pre-resection) and tumor resection cavity (post-resection) were imaged by moving the hand-held probe along a continuous trajectory over the regions of interest.</p>Results<p>A total of 10 patients were included, with predominantly intra-parenchymal frontal and temporal lobe tumors of both low and higher histopathological grades. fUS was able to detect (ESM-defined) functional areas deep inside the brain for a range of functional tasks including language processing. Brain tissue could be imaged at a spatial and temporal resolution of 300 μm and 1.5–2.0 ms respectively, revealing real-time tumor-specific, and healthy vascular characteristics.</p>Conclusion<p>The current study presents the potential of applying fUS during awake brain surgery. We illustrate the relevance of fUS for awake brain surgery based on its ability to capture both task-evoked functional cortical responses as well as differences in vascular characteristics between tumor and healthy tissue. As current neurosurgical practice is still pre-dominantly leaning on inherently limited pre-operative imaging techniques for tumor resection-guidance, fUS enters the scene as a promising alternative that is both anatomically and physiologically informative.</p>

Introduction<p>Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is one of the common and burdensome non-motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, the underlying neuropathology mechanism in PD patients with EDS (PD-EDS) remains unclear. The present study aims to delineate potential locations of structural alteration of subcortical regions in early stage and drug-naïve PD-EDS.</p>Methods<p>The study had 252 patients with PD and 92 matched healthy controls (HC). EDS was estimated with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, with a cutoff of 10. Ultimately, 59 patients were considered as PD-EDS. The remaining 193 were PD patients without EDS (PD-nEDS). FMRIB’s Integrated Registration and Segmentation Tool (FIRST) was employed to assess the volumetric and surface alterations of subcortical nuclei in PD and PD-EDS.</p>Results<p>Volumetric analyses found no difference in the subcortical nucleus volume between PD and HC, or PD-EDS and PD-nEDS groups. The shape analyses revealed the local atrophic changes in bilateral caudate and right putamen in patients with PD. In addition, the hypertrophic changes were located in the right putamen and left pallidum in PD-EDS than in PD-nEDS.</p>Conclusion<p>Our findings revealed the regional hypertrophy of the striatum in PD-EDS. Our results indicate that local hypertrophic striatum would be a valuable early biomarker for detecting the alteration in PD-EDS. The shape analysis contributes valuable information when investigating PD-EDS.</p>

<p>Successive patterns of activation and deactivation in local areas of the brain indicate the mechanisms of information processing in the brain. It is possible that this process can be optimized by principles, such as the maximization of mutual information and the minimization of energy consumption. In the present paper, I showed evidence for this argument by demonstrating the correlation among mutual information, the energy of the activation, and the activation patterns. Modeling the information processing based on the functional connectome datasets of the human brain, I simulated information transfer in this network structure. Evaluating the statistical quantities of the different network states, I clarified the correlation between them. First, I showed that mutual information and network energy have a close relationship, and that the values are maximized and minimized around a same network state. This implies that there is an optimal network state in the brain that is organized according to the principles regarding mutual information and energy. On the other hand, the evaluation of the network structure revealed that the characteristic network structure known as the criticality also emerges around this state. These results imply that the characteristic features of the functional network are also affected strongly by these principles. To assess the functional aspects of this state, I investigated the output activation patterns in response to random input stimuli. Measuring the redundancy of the responses in terms of the number of overlapping activation patterns, the results indicate that there is a negative correlation between mutual information and the redundancy in the patterns, suggesting that there is a trade-off between communication efficiency and robustness due to redundancy, and the principles of mutual information and network energy are important to network formation and its function in the human brain.</p>

<p>Human intelligence has been theorized since the ancient Greeks. Plato and Aristotle incorporated theories of human intelligence into their metaphysical and cosmological theories which informed the social and medical sciences for centuries. With the advent of the 20th century, human intelligence became increasingly standardized based on Intelligence Quotients (IQ). Moreover, multiple theories of human intelligence were posited on morphological features of the human brain, focusing on cranial volume and size of the pre-frontal cortex which was suggestive of superior human cognitive abilities. This article argues that fixation with anatomical features of the brain was tended to ignore the importance of neuro-hormonal regulation which is a more appropriate indicator of human cognitive abilities. The article challenges the correlation between brain size and human cognitive abilities while offering an alternate theory of human cognitive abilities which emphasizes the roles of neurotransmitters, neurotrophins, and enteric gut microbiome (EGM) regulation.</p>

<p>Field potentials (FPs) are easily reached signals that provide information about the brain’s processing. However, FP should be interpreted cautiously since their biophysical bases are complex. The lateral habenula (LHb) is a brain structure involved in the encoding of aversive motivational values. Previous work indicates that the activity of the LHb is relevant for hippocampal-dependent learning. Moreover, it has been proposed that the interaction of the LHb with the hippocampal network is evidenced by the synchronization of LHb and hippocampal FPs during theta rhythm. However, the origin of the habenular FP has not been analyzed. Hence, its validity as a measurement of LHb activity has not been proven. In this work, we used electrophysiological recordings in anesthetized rats and feed-forward modeling to investigate biophysical basis of the FP recorded in the LHb. Our results indicate that the FP in the LHb during theta rhythm is a volume-conducted signal from the hippocampus. This result highlight that FPs must be thoroughly analyzed before its biological interpretation and argues against the use of the habenular FP signal as a readout of the activity of the LHb.</p>

<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a common age-related neurodegenerative disorder with disabling motor symptoms and no available disease modifying treatment. The majority of the PD cases are of unknown etiology, with both genetics and environment playing important roles. Over the past 25 years, however, genetic analysis of patients with familial history of Parkinson’s and, latterly, genome wide association studies (GWAS) have provided significant advances in our understanding of the causes of the disease. These genetic insights have uncovered pathways that are affected in both genetic and sporadic forms of PD. These pathways involve oxidative stress, abnormal protein homeostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and lysosomal defects. In addition, newly identified PD genes and GWAS nominated genes point toward synaptic changes involving vesicles. This review will highlight the genes that contribute PD risk relating to intracellular vesicle trafficking and their functional consequences. There is still much to investigate on this newly identified and converging pathway of vesicular dynamics and PD, which will aid in better understanding and suggest novel therapeutic strategies for PD patients.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01348">A Comparison of Functional Networks Derived From Representational Similarity, Functional Connectivity, and Univariate Analyses</a></h4>

<p>The invention of representational similarity analysis [RSA, following multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA)] has allowed cognitive neuroscientists to identify the representational structure of multiple brain regions, moving beyond functional localization. By comparing these structures, cognitive neuroscientists can characterize how brain areas form functional networks. Univariate analysis (UNIVAR) and functional connectivity analysis (FCA) are two other popular methods to identify functional networks. Despite their popularity, few studies have examined the relationship between networks from RSA with those from UNIVAR and FCA. Thus, the aim of the current study is to examine the similarities between neural networks derived from RSA with those from UNIVAR and FCA to explore how these methods relate to each other. We analyzed the data of a previously published study with the three methods and compared the results by performing (partial) correlation and multiple regression analysis. Our findings reveal that neural networks resulting from RSA, UNIVAR, and FCA methods are highly similar to each other even after ruling out the effect of anatomical proximity between the network nodes. Nevertheless, the neural network from each method shows unique organization that cannot be explained by any of the other methods. Thus, we conclude that the RSA, UNIVAR and FCA methods provide similar but not identical information on how brain regions are organized in functional networks.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2019.00102">Reelin Immunoreactivity in the Adult Spinal Cord: A Comparative Study in Rodents, Carnivores, and Non-human Primates</a></h4>

<p>Reelin is a large extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoprotein secreted by several neuronal populations in a specific manner in both the developing and the adult central nervous system. The extent of Reelin protein distribution and its functional role in the adult neocortex is well documented in different mammal models. However, its role in the adult spinal cord has not been well characterized and its distribution in the rodent spinal cord is fragmentary and has not been investigated in carnivores or primates as of yet. To gain insight into which neuronal populations and specific circuits may be influenced by Reelin in the adult spinal cord, we have conducted light and confocal microscopy study analysis of Reelin-immunoreactive cell types in the adult spinal cord. Here, we describe and compare Reelin immunoreactive cell type and distribution in the spinal cord of adult non-human primate (macaque monkeys, Macaca mulatta), carnivore (ferret, Mustela putorius) and rodent (rat, Rattus norvegicus). Our results show that in all three species studied, Reelin-immunoreactive neurons are present in the intermediate gray matter, ventricular zone and superficial dorsal horn and intermedio-lateral nucleus, while positive cells in the Clarke nucleus are only found in rats and primates. In addition, Reelin intermediolateral neurons colocalize with choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) only in macaque whilst motor neurons also colocalize Reelin and ChAT in macaque, ferret and rat spinal cord. The different expression patterns might reflect a differential role for Reelin in the pathways involved in the coordination of locomotor activity in the fore- and hind limbs.</p>

Adult oligodendrogenesis is regulated by neuronal activity and learning. Can it affect memory processes? In this issue of Neuron, Steadman et al. (2020) found that newly generated oligodendrocytes are crucial for memory acquisition and consolidation and required for the neuronal coupling between brain regions known to be involved in memory.

In this issue of Neuron, Joffe et al. (2020) assess the antidepressant-relevant effects and underlying neural mechanisms of negative allosteric modulators selective for either metabotropic glutamate receptors 2 (mGlu2) or 3 (mGlu3). Negative modulation of both receptors enhanced excitatory glutamatergic input to mouse prefrontal cortex pyramidal cells, leading to antidepressant-relevant actions.

Neurodegenerative diseases are linked to dysfunctional proteostasis and disturbed autophagy. Here, we discuss how the sigma-1 receptor (Sig-1R) may act at the intersection of this interaction, as loss-of-function mutations of this unique chaperone are associated with defective autophagy and its pharmacological activation induces autophagic activity.

Synaptic vesicle fusion is coupled to swift retrieval of vesicle components from the synaptic plasma membrane. Ca2+ has been assumed to be a key mediator of this coupling. In a recent study, Orlando et al. unequivocally demonstrate that Ca2+ is not essential for synaptic vesicle retrieval.

<p>Publication date: October 2020</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 64</p><p>Author(s): Matthieu Louis</p><div><p>The neural logic underlying the conversion of non-stationary (dynamic) olfactory inputs into odor-search behaviors has been difficult to crack due to the distributed nature of the olfactory code — food odors typically co-activate multiple olfactory sensory neurons. In the <em>Drosophila</em> larva, the activity of a single olfactory sensory neuron is sufficient to direct accurate reorientation maneuvers in odor gradients (chemotaxis). In this reduced sensory system, a descending pathway essential for larval chemotaxis has been delineated from the peripheral olfactory system down to the premotor system. Here, I review how anatomical and functional inspections of this pathway have advanced our understanding of the neural mechanisms that convert behaviorally relevant sensory signals into orientation responses.</p></div>

<p>Publication date: October 2020</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 64</p><p>Author(s): Timothy A. Currier, Katherine I. Nagel</p><div><p>Spatial navigation is influenced by cues from nearly every sensory modality and thus provides an excellent model for understanding how different sensory streams are integrated to drive behavior. Here we review recent work on multisensory control of navigation in the model organism <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>, which allows for detailed circuit dissection. We identify four modes of integration that have been described in the literature—suppression, gating, summation, and association—and describe regions of the larval and adult brain that have been implicated in sensory integration. Finally we discuss what circuit architectures might support these different forms of integration. We argue that <em>Drosophila</em> is an excellent model to discover these circuit and biophysical motifs</p></div>
