              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Evolution of pathogen tolerance and emerging infections: A missing experimental paradigm</a></h4>

              
                Researchers worldwide are repeatedly warning us against future zoonotic diseases resulting from humankind’s insurgence into natural ecosystems. The same zoonotic pathogens that cause severe infections in a human host frequently fail to produce any disease outcome in their natural hosts. What precise features of the immune system enable natural reservoirs to carry these pathogens so efficiently? To understand these effects, we highlight the importance of tracing the evolutionary basis of pathogen tolerance in reservoir hosts, while drawing implications from their diverse physiological and life-history traits, and ecological contexts of host-pathogen interactions. Long-term co-evolution might allow reservoir hosts to modulate immunity and evolve tolerance to zoonotic pathogens, increasing their circulation and infectious period. Such processes can also create a genetically diverse pathogen pool by allowing more mutations and genetic exchanges between circulating strains, thereby harboring rare alive-on-arrival variants with extended infectivity to new hosts (i.e., spillover). Finally, we end by underscoring the indispensability of a large multidisciplinary empirical framework to explore the proposed link between evolved tolerance, pathogen prevalence, and spillover in the wild.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Metformin alleviates stress-induced cellular senescence of aging human adipose stromal cells and the ensuing adipocyte dysfunction</a></h4>

              
                Aging is associated with central fat redistribution and insulin resistance. To identify age-related adipose features, we evaluated the senescence and adipogenic potential of adipose-derived-stromal cells (ASCs) from abdominal subcutaneous fat obtained from healthy normal-weight young (&lt;25y) or older women (&gt;60y). Increased cell passages of young-donor ASCs (<i>in vitro</i> aging), resulted in senescence but not oxidative stress. ASC-derived adipocytes presented impaired adipogenesis but no early mitochondrial dysfunction. Conversely, aged-donor ASCs at early passages displayed oxidative stress and mild senescence. ASC-derived adipocytes exhibited oxidative stress, and early mitochondrial dysfunction but adipogenesis was preserved. <i>In vitro</i> aging of aged-donor ASCs resulted in further increased senescence, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress and severe adipocyte dysfunction. When <i>in vitro</i> aged young-donor ASCs were treated with metformin, no alteration was alleviated. Conversely, metformin treatment of aged-donor ASCs decreased oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction resulting in decreased senescence. Metformin's prevention of oxidative stress and of the resulting senescence improved the cells' adipogenic capacity and insulin sensitivity. This effect was mediated by the activation of AMP-activated-protein-kinase as revealed by its specific inhibition and activation. Overall, aging ASC-derived adipocytes presented impaired adipogenesis and insulin sensitivity. Targeting stress-induced senescence of ASCs with metformin may improve age-related adipose tissue dysfunction.

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel gene <I>SCN1A</I> are associated with human epilepsy disorders, but how most of these mutations alter channel properties and result in seizures is unknown. This study focuses on two different mutations occurring at one position within <I>SCN1A</I>. R1648C (R-C) is associated with the severe disorder Dravet syndrome, and R1648H (R-H), with the milder disorder GEFS+. To explore how these different mutations contribute to distinct seizure disorders, <I>Drosophila</I> lines with the R-C or R-H mutation, or R1648R (R-R) control substitution in the fly sodium channel gene <I>para</I> were generated by CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. The R-C and R-H mutations are homozygous lethal. Animals heterozygous for R-C or R-H mutations displayed reduced life spans and spontaneous and temperature-induced seizures not observed in R-R controls. Electrophysiological recordings from adult GABAergic neurons in R-C and R-H mutants revealed the appearance of sustained neuronal depolarizations and altered firing frequency that were exacerbated at elevated temperature. The only significant change observed in underlying sodium currents in both R-C and R-H mutants was a hyperpolarized deactivation threshold at room and elevated temperature compared with R-R controls. Since this change is constitutive, it is likely to interact with heat-induced changes in other cellular properties to result in the heat-induced increase in sustained depolarizations and seizure activity. Further, the similarity of the behavioral and cellular phenotypes in the R-C and R-H fly lines, suggests that disease symptoms of different severity associated with these mutations in humans could be due in large part to differences in genetic background.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Sex Differences in Behavioral and Brainstem Transcriptomic Neuroadaptations following Neonatal Opioid Exposure in Outbred Mice</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The opioid epidemic led to an increase in the number of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) cases in infants born to opioid-dependent mothers. Hallmark features of NOWS include weight loss, severe irritability, respiratory problems, and sleep fragmentation. Mouse models provide an opportunity to identify brain mechanisms that contribute to NOWS. Neonatal outbred Swiss Webster Cartworth Farms White (CFW) mice were administered morphine (15 mg/kg, s.c.) twice daily from postnatal day 1 (P1) to P14, an approximation of the third trimester of human gestation. Female and male mice underwent behavioral testing on P7 and P14 to determine the impact of opioid exposure on anxiety and pain sensitivity. Ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) and daily body weights were also recorded. Brainstems containing pons and medulla were collected during morphine withdrawal on P14 for RNA sequencing. Morphine induced weight loss from P2 to P14, which persisted during adolescence (P21) and adulthood (P50). USVs markedly increased at P7 in females, emerging earlier than males. On P7 and P14, both morphine-exposed female and male mice displayed hyperalgesia on the hot plate and tail-flick assays, with females showing greater hyperalgesia than males. Morphine-exposed mice exhibited increased anxiety-like behavior in the open-field arena on P21. Transcriptome analysis of the brainstem, an area implicated in opioid withdrawal and NOWS, identified pathways enriched for noradrenergic signaling in females and males. We also found sex-specific pathways related to mitochondrial function and neurodevelopment in females and circadian entrainment in males. Sex-specific transcriptomic neuroadaptations implicate unique neurobiological mechanisms underlying NOWS-like behaviors.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Single Dose of Amphetamine Induces Delayed Subregional Attenuation of Cholinergic Interneuron Activity in the Striatum</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Psychostimulants such as amphetamine (AMPH) target dopamine (DA) neuron synapses to engender drug-induced plasticity. While DA neurons modulate the activity of striatal (Str) cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) with regional heterogeneity, how AMPH affects ChI activity has not been elucidated. Here, we applied quantitative fluorescence imaging approaches to map the dose-dependent effects of a single dose of AMPH on ChI activity at 2.5 and 24 h after injection across the mouse Str using the activity-dependent marker phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (p-rpS6<sup>240/244</sup>). AMPH did not affect the distribution or morphology of ChIs in any Str subregion. While AMPH at either dose had no effect on ChI activity after 2.5 h, ChI activity was dose dependently reduced after 24 h specifically in the ventral Str/nucleus accumbens (NAc), a critical site of psychostimulant action. AMPH at either dose did not affect the spontaneous firing of ChIs. Altogether this work demonstrates that a single dose of AMPH has delayed regionally heterogeneous effects on ChI activity, which most likely involves extra-Str synaptic input.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Variability in soil properties influencing pigeonpea (Cajanus cajana L.) yield: a multivariate statistical analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Aims: The aim of the study was to reveal the variability in soil properties influencing pigeonpea (Cajanus cajana L.) seed yield under semi-arid rainfed condition. Methods: Soils were initially classified into series level and further these series were divided into soil-phase units. For two site years viz., 2018-19 and 2019-20, surface soil samples from each soil-phase unit were collected before sowing of pigeonpea and subsequently crop growth parameters at critical stages were recorded. Results: The principal component analysis with varimax rotation resulted in seven components for both the site years, having eigenvalues greater than one, explained more than 80% of the variability. The step wise linear regression analysis showed that the pigeonpea seed yield was linearly correlated with PC3 (p<0.01), PC4 (p<0.01) and PC7 (p<0.05) of soil properties with R2 = 0.679, during 2018-19. Whereas, during 2019-20, the seed yield was linearly correlated with PC1 (p<0.01), PC3 (p<0.01) and PC6 (p<0.05) with R2 = 0.677. In site year 1, the available P2O5, Fe, Zn, S, Cu, number of pods, surface soil moisture determined the yield. In site year 2, the available K2O, P2O5, Fe, Zn, S, clay, CEC and available water content determined the yield. All these variables together explain variability in yield.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Levels of SARS-CoV-2 population exposure are considerably higher than suggested by seroprevalence surveys</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Siyu Chen, Jennifer A. Flegg, Lisa J. White, Ricardo Aguas</p>

Accurate knowledge of prior population exposure has critical ramifications for preparedness plans for future SARS-CoV-2 epidemic waves and vaccine prioritization strategies. Serological studies can be used to estimate levels of past exposure and thus position populations in their epidemic timeline. To circumvent biases introduced by the decay in antibody titers over time, methods for estimating population exposure should account for seroreversion, to reflect that changes in seroprevalence measures over time are the net effect of increases due to recent transmission and decreases due to antibody waning. Here, we present a new method that combines multiple datasets (serology, mortality, and virus positivity ratios) to estimate seroreversion time and infection fatality ratios (IFR) and simultaneously infer population exposure levels. The results indicate that the average time to seroreversion is around six months, IFR is 0.54% to 1.3%, and true exposure may be more than double the current seroprevalence levels reported for several regions of England.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Acetylcholine-gated current translates wake neuronal firing rate information into a spike timing-based code in Non-REM sleep, stabilizing neural network dynamics during memory consolidation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Quinton M. Skilling, Bolaji Eniwaye, Brittany C. Clawson, James Shaver, Nicolette Ognjanovski, Sara J. Aton, Michal Zochowski</p>

Sleep is critical for memory consolidation, although the exact mechanisms mediating this process are unknown. Combining reduced network models and analysis of <i>in vivo</i> recordings, we tested the hypothesis that neuromodulatory changes in acetylcholine (ACh) levels during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep mediate stabilization of network-wide firing patterns, with temporal order of neurons’ firing dependent on their mean firing rate during wake. In both reduced models and <i>in vivo</i> recordings from mouse hippocampus, we find that the relative order of firing among neurons during NREM sleep reflects their relative firing rates during prior wake. Our modeling results show that this remapping of wake-associated, firing frequency-based representations is based on NREM-associated changes in neuronal excitability mediated by ACh-gated potassium current. We also show that learning-dependent reordering of sequential firing during NREM sleep, together with spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), reconfigures neuronal firing rates across the network. This rescaling of firing rates has been reported in multiple brain circuits across periods of sleep. Our model and experimental data both suggest that this effect is amplified in neural circuits following learning. Together our data suggest that sleep may bias neural networks from firing rate-based towards phase-based information encoding to consolidate memories.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Biomedical Data Commons (BMDC) prioritizes B-lymphocyte non-coding genetic variants in Type 1 Diabetes</a></h4>

The repurposing of biomedical data is inhibited by its fragmented and multi-formatted nature that requires redundant investment of time and resources by data scientists. This is particularly true for Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), one of the most intensely studied common childhood diseases. Intense investigation of the contribution of pancreatic β-islet and T-lymphocytes in T1D has been made. However, genetic contributions from B-lymphocytes, which are known to play a role in a subset of T1D patients, remain relatively understudied. We have addressed this issue through the creation of Biomedical Data Commons (BMDC), a knowledge graph that integrates data from multiple sources into a single queryable format. This increases the speed of analysis by multiple orders of magnitude. We develop a pipeline using B-lymphocyte multi-dimensional epigenome and connectome data and deploy BMDC to assess genetic variants in the context of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). Pipeline-identified variants are primarily common, non-coding, poorly conserved, and are of unknown clinical significance. While variants and their chromatin connectivity are cell-type specific, they are associated with well-studied disease genes in T-lymphocytes. Candidates include established variants in the HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DRB1 and IL2RA loci that have previously been demonstrated to protect against T1D in humans and mice providing validation for this method. Others are included in the well-established T1D GRS2 genetic risk scoring method. More intriguingly, other prioritized variants are completely novel and form the basis for future mechanistic and clinical validation studies The BMDC community-based platform can be expanded and repurposed to increase the accessibility, reproducibility, and productivity of biomedical information for diverse applications including the prioritization of cell type-specific disease alleles from complex phenotypes.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Differences in olfactory bulb mitral cell spiking with ortho- and retronasal stimulation revealed by data-driven models</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Michelle F. Craft, Andrea K. Barreiro, Shree Hari Gautam, Woodrow L. Shew, Cheng Ly</p>

The majority of olfaction studies focus on orthonasal stimulation where odors enter via the front nasal cavity, while retronasal olfaction, where odors enter the rear of the nasal cavity during feeding, is understudied. The coding of retronasal odors via coordinated spiking of neurons in the olfactory bulb (OB) is largely unknown despite evidence that higher level processing is different than orthonasal. To this end, we use multi-electrode array <i>in vivo</i> recordings of rat OB mitral cells (MC) in response to a food odor with both modes of stimulation, and find significant differences in evoked firing rates and spike count covariances (i.e., noise correlations). Differences in spiking activity often have implications for sensory coding, thus we develop a single-compartment biophysical OB model that is able to reproduce key properties of important OB cell types. Prior experiments in olfactory receptor neurons (ORN) showed retro stimulation yields slower and spatially smaller ORN inputs than with ortho, yet whether this is consequential for OB activity remains unknown. Indeed with these specifications for ORN inputs, our OB model captures the salient trends in our OB data. We also analyze how first and second order ORN input statistics dynamically transfer to MC spiking statistics with a phenomenological linear-nonlinear filter model, and find that retro inputs result in larger linear filters than ortho inputs. Finally, our models show that the temporal profile of ORN is crucial for capturing our data and is thus a distinguishing feature between ortho and retro stimulation, even at the OB. Using data-driven modeling, we detail how ORN inputs result in differences in OB dynamics and MC spiking statistics. These differences may ultimately shape how ortho and retro odors are coded.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Regulation of integrin and extracellular matrix genes by HNRNPL is necessary for epidermal renewal</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jingting Li, Yifang Chen, Manisha Tiwari, Varun Bansal, George L. Sen</p>

Stratified epithelia such as the epidermis require coordinated regulation of stem and progenitor cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation to maintain homeostasis. Integrin-mediated anchorage of the basal layer stem cells of the epidermis to the underlying dermis through extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins is crucial for this process. It is currently unknown how the expression of these integrins and ECM genes are regulated. Here, we show that the RNA-binding protein (RBP) heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L (HNRNPL) binds to these genes on chromatin to promote their expression. HNRNPL recruits RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to integrin/ECM genes and is required for stabilizing Pol II transcription through those genes. In the absence of HNRNPL, the basal layer of the epidermis where the stem cells reside prematurely differentiates and detaches from the underlying dermis due to diminished integrin/ECM expression. Our results demonstrate a critical role for RBPs on chromatin to maintain stem and progenitor cell fate by dictating the expression of specific classes of genes.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Autoimmune limbic encephalitis (ALE) is the most common type of autoimmune encephalitis (AIE). Subacute memory disturbance, temporal lobe seizures, and psychiatric symptoms are clinical hallmarks of the disease. However, little is known on the factors contributing to cognitive functioning in ALE. Hence, we here investigate major determinants of cognitive functioning in ALE. In a retrospective analysis of 102 patients with ALE, we first compared verbal learning capacity, nonverbal learning capacity, and attentional and executive functioning by absence or presence of different types of neural autoantibodies (AABs). Subsequently we established three linear regression models including 63, 38, and 61 patients, respectively to investigate how cognitive functioning in these domains may depend on common markers of ALE such as intrathecal inflammation, blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-barrier function, mesiotemporal epileptiform discharges and slowing, determined by electroencephalography (EEG) and structural mesiotemporal changes, measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We also accounted for possible effects of cancer- and immunotherapy and other centrally effective medication. There was no effect of AAB status on cognitive functioning. Although the regression models could not predict verbal and nonverbal learning capacity, structural mesiotemporal neural network alterations on T2-/fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)-signal-weighted MRI and mesiotemporal epileptiform discharges or slowing on EEG exerted a significant impact on memory functions. In contrast, the regression model significantly predicted attentional and executive functioning with CSF white blood cell count and centrally effective medication being significant determinants. In this cohort, cognitive functioning in ALE does not depend on the AAB status. Common markers of ALE cannot predict memory functioning that only partially depends on structural and functional alterations of mesiotemporal neural networks. Common markers of ALE significantly predict attentional and executive functioning that is significantly related to centrally effective medication and CSF white blood cell count, which may point toward inflammation affecting brain regions beyond the limbic system.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Environmental lighting conditions play a central role in cognitive function, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Utilizing a diurnal rodent model, the Nile grass rat (<i>Arvicanthis niloticus</i>), we previously found that daytime light intensity affects hippocampal function in this species in a manner similar to its effects in humans. Compared to animals housed in a 12:12 h bright light–dark (brLD) cycle, grass rats kept in a 12:12 h dim light–dark (dimLD) cycle showed impaired spatial memory in the Morris water maze (MWM) and reduced CA1 apical dendritic spine density. The present study explored the neural substrates mediating the effects of daylight intensity on hippocampal function focusing on the hypothalamic orexin (hypocretin) system. First, animals housed in dimLD were treated with daily intranasal administration of orexin A peptide over five training days of the MWM task. Compared to vehicle controls, this treatment led to superior spatial memory accompanied by increased phosphorylation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II α and glutamate receptor 1 within the CA1. To assess the role of hippocampal orexinergic signaling, an adeno-associated viral vector (AAV) expressing an orexin receptor 1 (OX1R) shRNA was injected into the dorsal hippocampus targeting the CA1 of animals housed in brLD. AAV-mediated knockdown of OX1R within the hippocampus resulted in deficits in MWM performance and reduced CA1 apical dendritic spine density. These results are consistent with the view that the hypothalamic orexinergic system underlies the modulatory role of daytime illumination on hippocampal function in diurnal mammals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Temporal dynamic of the hippocampal structural plasticity associated with the fear memory destabilization/reconsolidation process</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Reconsolidation of a contextual fear memory is a protein synthesis-dependent process in which a previously destabilized memory returns to a stable state. This process has become the subject of many studies due to its importance in memory processing, maintenance and updating, and its potential role as a therapeutical target in fear memory disorders such as phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder. In this sense, understanding the underlying mechanisms of memory reconsolidation is paramount in developing potential treatments for such memory dysfunctions. In the present work, we studied the interaction between two key neural structures involved in the reconsolidation process: the basolateral amygdala complex of the amygdala (BLA) and the dorsal hippocampus (DH). Our results show changes in the structural plasticity of the CA1 region of the DH in the form of dendritic spines density changes associated with the destabilization/reconsolidation process. Furthermore, we demonstrate a modulatory role of BLA over such structural plasticity by infusing different drugs such as ifenprodil, a destabilization blocker, and propranolol, a reconsolidation disruptor, in this brain structure. Altogether our work shows a particular temporal dynamic in the CA1 region of DH that accompanies the destabilization/reconsolidation process and aims to provide new information on the underlying mechanisms of this process that potentially contributes for a better understanding of memory storage, maintenance, expression and updating, and its potential medical applications.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Adult‐born neurons promote cognitive flexibility by improving memory precision and indexing</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Adult neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) is an extraordinary form of plasticity fundamental for cognitive flexibility. Recent evidence showed that newborn neurons differentially modulate input to the infra- and supra-pyramidal blades of the DG during the processing of spatial and contextual information, respectively. However, how this differential regulation by neurogenesis is translated into different aspects contributing cognitive flexibility is unclear. Here, we increased adult-born neurons by a genetic expansion of neural stem cells and studied their influence during navigational learning. We found that increased neurogenesis improved both memory precision and flexibility. Interestingly, each of these gains was associated with distinct subregional patterns of activity and better separation of memory representations in the DG-CA3 network. Our results highlight the role of adult-born neurons in promoting memory precision and indexing and suggests their anatomical allocation within specific DG-CA3 compartments, together contributing to cognitive flexibility.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Disrupting the medial prefrontal cortex with designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drug alters hippocampal sharp‐wave ripples and their associated cognitive processes</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) interact during a myriad of cognitive processes including decision-making and long-term memory consolidation. Exactly how the mPFC and hippocampus interact during goal-directed decision-making remains to be fully elucidated. During periods of rest, bursts of high-frequency oscillations, termed sharp-wave ripple (SWR), appear in the local field potential. Impairing SWRs on the maze or during post-learning rest can interfere with memory-guided decision-making and memory consolidation. We hypothesize that the hippocampus and mPFC bidirectionally interact during SWRs to support memory consolidation and decision-making. Rats were trained on the neuroeconomic spatial decision-making task, Restaurant Row, to make serial stay-skip decisions where the amount of effort (delay to reward) varied upon entry to each restaurant. Hippocampal cells and SWRs were recorded in rats with the mPFC transduced with inhibitory DREADDs. We found that disrupting the mPFC impaired consolidating SWRs in the hippocampus. Hippocampal SWR rates depended on the internalized value of the reward (derived from individual flavor preferences), a parameter important in decision-making, and disrupting the mPFC changed this relationship. Additionally, we found a dissociation between SWRs that occurred while rats were on the maze dependent upon whether those SWRs occurred while the rat was anticipating food reward or during post-reward consumption.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Burst activity plays no role in the field‐to‐field variability and rate remapping of grid cells</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Grid cells in rodent medial entorhinal cortex are thought to play a key role for spatial navigation. When the animal is freely moving in an open arena the firing fields of each grid cell tend to form a highly regular, hexagonal lattice spanning the environment. However, firing rates vary from field to field and change under contextual modifications, whereas the field locations shift at most by a small amount under such “rate remapping.” The observed differences in firing rate could reflect overall activity changes or changes in the detailed spike-train statistics. As these two alternatives imply distinct neural coding schemes, we investigated whether temporal firing patterns vary from field to field and whether they change under rate remapping. Focusing on short time scales, we found that the proportion of bursts compared to all discharge events is similar in all firing fields of a given grid cell and does not change under rate remapping. For each cell, mean firing rates with bursts are proportional to mean firing rates without bursts. However, this ratio varies across cells. Additionally, we looked at how rate remapping relates to entorhinal theta-frequency oscillations. Theta-phase coding was preserved despite firing-rate changes from rate remapping but we did not observe differences between the first and second half of the theta cycle, as had been reported for CA1. Our results indicate that both, the heterogeneity between firing fields and rate remapping, are not due to altered firing patterns on short time scales but reflect location-specific changes at the firing-rate level.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Age‐related functional connectivity along the hippocampal longitudinal axis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Accumulated evidence points toward a long-axis functional division of the hippocampus, with its anterior part primarily associated with emotional processes and the posterior with navigation and cognition. It is yet unclear, however, how functional connectivity between areas along the hippocampal longitudinal axis and other brain regions differ, and how they are affected by age. Applying an anatomically driven general linear model-based functional connectivity analysis on a large database of resting-state fMRI data, we demonstrate that independent of age, the posterior hippocampus is functionally connected primarily with sensory and motor areas, the middle hippocampus with the default mode network, and the anterior with limbic and prefrontal regions. Along with an age-related disintegration of intra-hippocampal BOLD signal uniformity, the middle and posterior sub-regions exhibit mostly decreases in their functional connectivity with cortical regions, whereas the anterior hippocampus and ventral striatum appear to become more synchronized with age. These findings indicate that long-axis hippocampal areas are tuned to particular functional networks, which do not age in a unified manner.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Insulin‐like growth factor 1 gene transfer for sporadic Alzheimer's disease: New evidence for trophic factor mediated hippocampal neuronal and synaptic recovery‐based behavior improvement</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder with no cure. Patients typically suffer from cognitive impairment imprinted by irreversible neocortex and hippocampal degeneration with overt synaptic and neuron dysfunction. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) has proven to be a potent neuroprotective molecule in animal models of age-related neurodegeneration. In this regard, adenoviral gene transfer aiming at IGF1 brain overexpression has been hitherto an underexplored approach for the sAD treatment. We postulated enhanced IGF1 signaling in the brain as a restorative means in the diseased brain to revert cognitive deficit and restore hippocampal function. We implemented recombinant adenovirus mediated intracerebroventricular IGF1 gene transfer on the streptozotocin (STZ) induced sAD rat model, using 3-month-old male Sprague Dawley rats. This approach enhanced IGF1 signaling in the hippocampus and dampened sAD phosphorylated Tau. We found a remarkable short-term improvement in species-typical behavior, recognition memory, spatial memory, and depressive-like behavior. Histological analysis revealed a significant recovery of immature hippocampal neurons. We additionally recorded an increase in hippocampal microglial cells, which we suggest to exert anti-inflammatory effects. Finally, we found decreased levels of pre- and postsynaptic proteins in the hippocampus of STZ animals. Interestingly, IGF1 gene transfer increased the levels of PSD95 and GAD65/67 synaptic markers, indicating that the treatment enhanced the synaptic plasticity. We conclude that exogenous activation of IGF1 signaling pathway, 1 week after intracerebroventricular STZ administration, protects hippocampal immature neurons, dampens phosphorylated Tau levels, improves synaptic function and therefore performs therapeutically on the sAD STZ model. Hence, this study provides strong evidence for the use of this trophic factor to treat AD and age-related neurodegeneration.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Fear conditioning potentiates the hippocampal CA1 commissural pathway in vivo and increases awake phase sleep</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus is essential for spatial learning and memory. To assess learning we used contextual fear conditioning (cFC), where animals learn to associate a place with aversive events like foot-shocks. Candidate memory mechanisms for cFC are long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), but there is little direct evidence of them operating in the hippocampus in vivo following cFC. Also, little is known about the behavioral state changes induced by cFC. To address these issues, we recorded local field potentials in freely behaving mice by stimulating in the left dorsal CA1 region and recording in the right dorsal CA1 region. Synaptic strength in the commissural pathway was monitored by measuring field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) before and after cFC. After cFC, the commissural pathway's synaptic strength was potentiated. Although recordings occurred during the wake phase of the light/dark cycle, the mice slept more in the post-conditioning period than in the pre-conditioning period. Relative to awake periods, in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep the fEPSPs were larger in both pre- and post-conditioning periods. We also found a significant negative correlation between the animal's speed and fEPSP size. Therefore, to avoid confounds in the fEFSP potentiation estimates, we controlled for speed-related and sleep-related fEPSP changes and still found that cFC induced long-term potentiation, but no significant long-term depression. Synaptic strength changes were not found in the control group that simply explored the fear-conditioning chamber, indicating that exploration of the novel place did not produce the measurable effects caused by cFC. These results show that following cFC, the CA1 commissural pathway is potentiated, likely contributing to the functional integration of the left and right hippocampi in fear memory consolidation. In addition, the cFC paradigm produces significant changes in an animal's behavioral state, which are observable as proximal changes in sleep patterns.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Delicate balance: the relationship between internal astigmatism and lens astigmatism [version 2; peer review: 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Due to lack of equipment for directly measuring crystal morphology, there has been little research on lenticular astigmatism. The purpose of this study was to accurately explore the correlation between internal astigmatism and lens astigmatism in patients with ametropia. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study conducted in the Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College, China, in September 2020. Diopter values (refractive astigmatism, RA) of patients with ametropia was recorded, and the corneal and lens biological parameters were measured by CASIA2 (corneal/anterior segment optical correlation tomography analyzer). Biometric parameters, including the total corneal astigmatism (total corneal astigmatism, TCA), anterior and posterior curvature radius of the lens (anterior curvature radius of the lens, ACL;  posterior curvature radius of the lens, PCL), internal astigmatism (internal astigmatism, IA), anterior and posterior astigmatism of the lens (anterior astigmatism of the lens, AAL;  posterior astigmatism of the lens, PAL) were measured. Grouping and comparisons were made according to gender and age. Results: In total, 151 participants (293 eyes) were included in the analysis. There were significant ( P<0.05) differences in the IA ( Z=-2.194, P=0.028) according to gender, but not in the other parameters. By age group, there were statistically significant differences in the TCA ( H=10.609, P=0.005), IA ( F=3.722, P=0.025), and PAL ( H=8.254, P=0.016), but not in the others. The IA was positively correlated with the age ( r=0.155, P=0.008), RA ( r=0. 534, P<0.001), AAL ( r=0.308, P<0.001), and was negatively correlated with the TCA ( r=-0.244, P<0.001). The regression equation between the IA and AAL was: Y (IA) =-0.626 +0.447 X (AAL). Conclusions:  Internal astigmatism is mainly related to the anterior astigmatism of the lens, and the higher the anterior astigmatism of the lens, the higher the internal astigmatism; At the same time, internal astigmatism increases with age.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Development, validation and reliability of a questionnaire for assessment of physician's knowledge, attitude and practices (KAPs) regarding foodborne diseases in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The burden of foodborne illness is considered to be high across the world.  Based on the Knowledge-Attitude-Practice (KAP) model, physician’s awareness is essential for conducting individualized treatments, thus reducing the burden of foodborne illness. However, there have been no validated questionnaires specific to the awareness of physicians with foodborne diseases. This study aims to develop and validate a KAP questionnaire for physicians to assess their awareness about the diagnosis and management of foodborne illness.   Methods The questionnaire was developed in three phases: a comprehensive literature review, face and content validity, followed by a reliability test by internal consistency. A cross-sectional study was designed in Abha, Saudi Arabia. Physicians (n=125) were opportunistically recruited from both public and private primary healthcare centers. The questionnaire’s content and validity were confirmed by experts in their corresponding fields. After signing the informed consent, the study participants received the questionnaire to evaluate their KAPs on foodborne diseases.  Results: A total of 160 physicians from both public and private primary health care centers were approached to enrol 125 study participants into the survey (response rate 78.13%). Of the 31 items designed for assessing the KAP of physicians on foodborne illnesses, three items were excluded after Cronbach’s α analysis. In total, 29 items were included in the final set of the questionnaire. Results of different validity and reliability analyses suggest the questionnaire has a high face and content validity as well as good reliability in internal consistency and stability. Conclusions: This study introduces a newly developed questionnaire with good reliability and validity values that can assess physician’s awareness of foodborne disease. The awareness questionnaire, as a study instrument, had a favourable acceptance among physicians. It is a sound method for evaluating and measuring levels of foodborne disease-related awareness among physicians in Abha, Saudi Arabia.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">High flow nasal oxygen for acute type two respiratory failure: a systematic review [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Acute type two respiratory failure (AT2RF) is characterized by high carbon dioxide levels (PaCO2 >6kPa). Non-invasive ventilation (NIV), the current standard of care, has a high failure rate. High flow nasal therapy (HFNT) has potential additional benefits such as CO2 clearance, the ability to communicate and comfort. The primary aim of this systematic review is to determine whether HFNT in AT2RF improves 1) PaCO2, 2) clinical and patient-centred outcomes and 3) to assess potential harms. Methods: We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE and CENTRAL  (January 1999-January 2021). Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies comparing HFNT with low flow nasal oxygen (LFO) or NIV were included. Two authors independently assessed studies for eligibility, data extraction and risk of bias. We used Cochrane risk of bias tool for RCTs and Ottawa-Newcastle scale for cohort studies. Results: From 727 publications reviewed, four RCTs and one cohort study (n=425) were included. In three trials of HFNT vs NIV, comparing PaCO2 (kPa) at last follow-up time point, there was a significant reduction at four hours (1 RCT; HFNT median 6.7, IQR 5.6 – 7.7 vs NIV median 7.6, IQR 6.3 – 9.3) and no significant difference at  24-hours or five days. Comparing HFNT with LFO, there was no significant difference at 30-minutes. There was no difference in intubation or mortality. Conclusions: This review identified a small number of studies with low to very low certainty of evidence. A reduction of PaCO2 at an early time point of four hours post-intervention was demonstrated in one small RCT. Significant limitations of the included studies were lack of adequately powered outcomes and clinically relevant time-points and small sample size. Accordingly, systematic review cannot recommend the use of HFNT as the initial management strategy for AT2RF and trials adequately powered to detect clinical and patient-relevant outcomes are urgently warranted.

                Background: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a global threat to humans and the world’s economy. Effective and safe vaccines against this virus are essential to control and eradicate the pandemic. The currently applied vaccines carry SARS-CoV-2 spike-protein mRNA/cDNA. These vaccines go through several cellular processes in the recipients for producing antigens. On the contrary, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (receptor binding domain)-protein is an antigen. It will directly stimulate antibody production against SARS-CoV-2. Hence, we propose to produce SARS-CoV-2 RBD-protein as a fast acting, effective and safe vaccine.  Methods: We propose to reconstruct a plasmid carrying three types of  DNA sequences: RBD cDNA, FP (fusion peptide) DNA and sfGFP(superfolder green fluorescent protein), cDNA creating the RBD-FP-sfGFP DNA within an orf (open reading frame). Escherichia coli, C2566H, transformed with the reconstructed plasmid will express RBD-FP-sfGFP fusion protein producing green fluorescent cfu (colony forming unit). The RBD-protein will be separated from the sfGFP using an FP specific enterokinase, and eluted by HIC (hydrophobic interaction chromatography), detected with a BioVision Elisa kit, and quantified by spectrophotometry at UV280nm.  Results: The plasmid reconstruct will carry ampr (ampicillin-resistant) gene as a selective marker and a T7 promoter controlling the expression of RBD-FP-sfGFP fusion protein. The transformed Escherichia coli will efficiently express the RBD-FP-sfGFP fusion protein. The highly efficient sfGFP fused within the RBD-FP-sfGFP will produce green fluorescent cfu. The RBD-FP-sfGFP protein extract from the green cfu, digested by enterokinase and separated by the HIC will produce pure RBD protein.  Conclusion: A positive BioVision ELISA test detects <10 pg RBD protein/ml of the sample. A larger sample of the purified RBD protein can be used as a vaccine following a standard formulation and safety protocols. Once administered, the RBD protein will stimulate antibody production against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The RBD protein has no potential to recombine with human genome.

This study highlights the importance of studying PLpro variants in emerging SARS-CoV-2 lineages, as one such variant alters enzyme function.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Condensation tendency and planar isotropic actin gradient induce radial alignment in confined monolayers</a></h4>

              
                A monolayer of highly motile cells can establish long-range orientational order, which can be explained by hydrodynamic theory of active gels and fluids. However, it is less clear how cell shape changes and rearrangement are governed when the monolayer is in mechanical equilibrium states when cell motility diminishes. In this work, we report that rat embryonic fibroblasts (REF), when confined in circular mesoscale patterns on rigid substrates, can transition from the spindle shapes to more compact morphologies.  Cells align radially only at the pattern boundary when they are in the mechanical equilibrium. This radial alignment disappears when cell contractility or cell-cell adhesion is reduced.  Unlike monolayers of spindle-like cells such as NIH-3T3 fibroblasts with minimal intercellular interactions or epithelial cells like Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) with strong cortical actin network, confined REF monolayers present an actin gradient with isotropic meshwork, suggesting the existence of a stiffness gradient. In addition, the REF cells tend to condense on soft substrates, a collective cell behavior we refer to as the 'condensation tendency'. This condensation tendency, together with geometrical confinement, induces tensile prestretch (i.e., an isotropic stretch that causes tissue to contract when released) to the confined monolayer. By developing a Voronoi-cell model, we demonstrate that the combined global tissue prestretch and cell stiffness differential between the inner and boundary cells can sufficiently define the cell radial alignment at the pattern boundary.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Circular RNA repertoires are associated with evolutionarily young transposable elements</a></h4>

              
                Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are found across eukaryotes and can function in post-transcriptional gene regulation. Their biogenesis through a circle-forming backsplicing reaction is facilitated by reverse-complementary repetitive sequences promoting pre-mRNA folding. Orthologous genes from which circRNAs arise, overall contain more strongly conserved splice sites and exons than other genes, yet it remains unclear to what extent this conservation reflects purifying selection acting on the circRNAs themselves. Our analyses of circRNA repertoires from five species representing three mammalian lineages (marsupials, eutherians: rodents, primates) reveal that surprisingly few circRNAs arise from orthologous exonic loci across all species. Even the circRNAs from orthologous loci are associated with young, recently active and species-specific transposable elements, rather than with common, ancient transposon integration events. These observations suggest that many circRNAs emerged convergently during evolution - as a byproduct of splicing in orthologs prone to transposon insertion. Overall, our findings argue against widespread functional circRNA conservation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Vaccination induces rapid protection against bacterial pneumonia via training alveolar macrophage in mice</a></h4>

              
                Vaccination strategies for rapid protection against multidrug-resistant bacterial infection are very important, especially for hospitalized patients who have high risk of exposure to these bacteria. However, few such vaccination strategies exist due to a shortage of knowledge supporting their rapid effect. Here, we demonstrated that a single intranasal immunization of inactivated whole cell of <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> elicits rapid protection against broad <i>A. baumannii</i>-infected pneumonia via training of innate immune response in <i>Rag1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice. Immunization-trained alveolar macrophages (AMs) showed enhanced TNF-α production upon restimulation. Adoptive transfer of immunization-trained AMs into naive mice mediated rapid protection against infection. Elevated TLR4 expression on vaccination-trained AMs contributed to rapid protection. Moreover, immunization-induced rapid protection was also seen in <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> and <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> pneumonia models, but not in <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> and <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> model. Our data reveal that a single intranasal immunization induces rapid and efficient protection against certain Gram-negative bacterial pneumonia via training AMs response, which highlights the importance and the possibility of harnessing trained immunity of AMs to design rapid-effecting vaccine.

                Synaptotagmin 7 (SYT7) has emerged as a key regulator of presynaptic function, but its localization and precise role in the synaptic vesicle cycle remain the subject of debate. Here, we used iGluSnFR to optically interrogate glutamate release, at the single-bouton level, in SYT7KO-dissociated mouse hippocampal neurons. We analyzed asynchronous release, paired-pulse facilitation, and synaptic vesicle replenishment and found that SYT7 contributes to each of these processes to different degrees. ‘Zap-and-freeze’ electron microscopy revealed that a loss of SYT7 diminishes docking of synaptic vesicles after a stimulus and inhibits the recovery of depleted synaptic vesicles after a stimulus train. SYT7 supports these functions from the axonal plasma membrane, where its localization and stability require both γ-secretase-mediated cleavage and palmitoylation. In summary, SYT7 is a peripheral membrane protein that controls multiple modes of synaptic vesicle (SV) exocytosis and plasticity, in part, through enhancing activity-dependent docking of SVs.

                Many primate genes produce circular RNAs (circRNAs). However, the extent of circRNA conservation between closely related species remains unclear. By comparing tissue-specific transcriptomes across over 70 million years of primate evolution, we identify that within 3 million years circRNA expression profiles diverged such that they are more related to species identity than organ type. However, our analysis also revealed a subset of circRNAs with conserved neural expression across tens of millions of years of evolution. By comparing to species-specific circRNAs, we identified that the downstream intron of the conserved circRNAs display a dramatic lengthening during evolution due to the insertion of novel retrotransposons. Our work provides comparative analyses of the mechanisms promoting circRNAs to generate increased transcriptomic complexity in primates.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Diverse inhibitory projections from the cerebellar interposed nucleus</a></h4>

              
                The cerebellum consists of parallel circuit modules that contribute to diverse behaviors, spanning motor to cognitive. Recent work employing cell-type specific tracing has identified circumscribed output channels of the cerebellar nuclei that could confer tight functional specificity. These studies have largely focused on excitatory projections of the cerebellar nuclei, however, leaving open the question of whether inhibitory neurons also constitute multiple output modules. We mapped output and input patterns to intersectionally restricted cell types of the interposed and adjacent interstitial nuclei in mice. In contrast to the widespread assumption of primarily excitatory outputs and restricted inferior olive-targeting inhibitory output, we found that inhibitory neurons from this region ramified widely within the brainstem, targeting both motor- and sensory-related nuclei, distinct from excitatory output targets. Despite differences in output targeting, monosynaptic rabies tracing revealed largely shared afferents to both cell classes. We discuss the potential novel functional roles for inhibitory outputs in the context of cerebellar theory.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Temporo-cerebellar connectivity underlies timing constraints in audition</a></h4>

              
                The flexible and efficient adaptation to dynamic, rapid changes in the auditory environment likely involves generating and updating of internal models. Such models arguably exploit connections between the neocortex and the cerebellum, supporting proactive adaptation. Here we tested whether temporo-cerebellar disconnection is associated with the processing of sound at short-timescales. First, we identify lesion-specific deficits for the encoding of short timescale spectro-temporal non-speech and speech properties in patients with left posterior temporal cortex stroke. Second, using lesion- guided probabilistic tractography in healthy participants, we revealed bidirectional temporo-cerebellar connectivity with cerebellar dentate nuclei and crura I/II. These findings support the view that the encoding and modeling of rapidly modulated auditory spectro-temporal properties can rely on a temporo-cerebellar interface. We discuss these findings in view of the conjecture that proactive adaptation to a dynamic environment via internal models is a generalizable principle.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Developmental change in prefrontal cortex recruitment supports the emergence of value-guided memory</a></h4>

              
                Prioritizing memory for valuable information can promote adaptive behavior across the lifespan, but it is unclear how the neurocognitive mechanisms that enable the selective acquisition of useful knowledge develop. Here, using a novel task coupled with functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined how children, adolescents, and adults (N = 90) learn from experience what information is likely to be rewarding, and modulate encoding and retrieval processes accordingly. We found that the ability to use learned value signals to selectively enhance memory for useful information strengthened throughout childhood and into adolescence. Encoding and retrieval of high- vs. low-value information was associated with increased activation in striatal and prefrontal regions implicated in value processing and cognitive control. Age-related increases in value-based lateral prefrontal cortex modulation mediated the relation between age and memory selectivity. Our findings demonstrate that developmental increases in the strategic engagement of the prefrontal cortex support the emergence of adaptive memory.

                Preterm infants that suffer cerebellar insults often develop motor disorders and cognitive difficulty. Excitatory granule cells, the most numerous neuron type in the brain, are especially vulnerable and likely instigate disease by impairing the function of their targets, the Purkinje cells. Here, we use regional genetic manipulations and in vivo electrophysiology to test whether excitatory neurons establish the firing properties of Purkinje cells during postnatal mouse development. We generated mutant mice that lack the majority of excitatory cerebellar neurons and tracked the structural and functional consequences on Purkinje cells. We reveal that Purkinje cells fail to acquire their typical morphology and connectivity, and that the concomitant transformation of Purkinje cell firing activity does not occur either. We also show that our mutant pups have impaired motor behaviors and vocal skills. These data argue that excitatory cerebellar neurons define the maturation time-window for postnatal Purkinje cell functions and refine cerebellar-dependent behaviors.

                Social behaviour is a hallmark of complex animal systems; however, some species appear to have secondarily lost this social ability. In these non-social species, whether social abilities are permanently lost or suppressed is unclear. The blind cavefish <i>Astyanax mexicanus</i> is known to be asocial. Here, we reveal that cavefish exhibited social-like interactions in familiar environments but suppressed these interactions in stress-associated unfamiliar environments. Furthermore, the level of suppression in sociality was positively correlated with that of stereotypic repetitive behaviour, as seen in mammals. Treatment with a human antipsychotic drug targeting the dopaminergic system induced social-like interactions in cavefish, even in unfamiliar environments, while reducing repetitive behaviour. Overall, these results suggest that the antagonistic association between repetitive and social-like behaviours is deeply shared from teleosts through mammals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Short-term assessment of subfoveal injection of AAV2-hCHM gene augmentation in choroideremia using adaptive optics ophthalmoscopy</a></h4>

              
                Subretinal injection for gene augmentation in retinal degenerations forcefully detaches the neural retina from the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), potentially damaging photoreceptors and/or RPE cells. Here, we use adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO) to assess the short-term integrity of the cone mosaic following subretinal injections of AAV2-hCHM gene augmentation in subjects with choroideremia (CHM). Nine adult CHM patients received uniocular subfoveal injections of low dose (5x10^10 vector genome (vg) per eye, n=5) or high dose (1x10^11 vg per eye, n=4) AAV2-hCHM. The macular regions of both eyes were imaged pre- and one-month post-injection using a custom-built, multimodal AOSLO. Post-injection cone inner segment mosaics were compared to pre-injection mosaics at multiple regions of interest (ROIs). Post-injection AOSLO images showed preservation of the cone mosaic in all 9 AAV2-hCHM injected eyes. Mosaics appeared intact and contiguous one-month post-injection, with the exception of foveal disruption in one patient. Co-localized optical coherence tomography showed foveal cone outer segment (COS) shortening post-injection (significant, n=4; non-significant, n=4; unchanged, n=1). Integrity of the cone mosaic is maintained following subretinal delivery of AAV2-hCHM, providing strong evidence in support of the safety of the injections. Minor foveal thinning observed following surgery corresponds with short-term COS shortening rather than cone cell loss.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Activity-dependent modulation of NMDA receptors by endogenous zinc shapes dendritic function in cortical neurons.</a></h4>

              
                Activation of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) has been proposed to be a key component of single neuron computations in vivo. However is unknown if specific mechanisms control the function of such receptors and modulate input-output transformations performed by cortical neurons under in vivo-like conditions. Here we found that in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons (L2/3 PNs), repeated synaptic stimulation results in an activity-dependent decrease in NMDARs activity by vesicular zinc. Such a mechanism shifted the threshold for dendritic non-linearities and strongly reduced LTP induction. Modulation of NMDARs was cell- and pathway-specific, being present selectively in L2/3-L2/3 connections but absent in ascending bottom-up inputs originating from L4 neurons. Numerical simulations highlighted that activity-dependent modulation of NMDARs has an important influence in dendritic computations endowing L2/3 PN dendrites with the ability to sustain dendritic non-linear integrations constant across different regimes of synaptic activity like those found in vivo. The present results therefore provide a new perspective on the action of vesicular zinc in cortical circuits by highlighting the role of this endogenous ion in normalizing dendritic integration of PNs during a constantly changing synaptic input pattern.

                Optogenetics is a modern technique which has been recently expanded to non-neuronal cell types, e.g., astrocytes, and involves targeted gene delivery of light-sensitive ion channels like Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2). Optogenetic regulation of astrocytic activity can be used for therapeutic intervention of several neurological disorders. Astrocytic gene delivery, viz adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors, have proven to be robust, time-, and cost-efficient contrary to the generation of transgenic animal models. When transducing astrocytes with an AAV vector, it is imperative to perform a serotype evaluation of the AAV vector due to variability in serotype transduction efficiency depending on species, target region and construct length. Rats have been a very successful animal model for studying a variety of brain disorders, from which ChR2-based intervention of astrocytes will benefit. However, the most efficient AAV capsid serotype targeting astrocytes for ChR2 expression in the in vivo rat brain cortex has not been characterized. To address this, we have evaluated AAV serotypes 1, 5, and 8 of the vector AAV-GFAP-hChR2(H134)-mCherry targeting astrocytes in the rat brain neocortex. Results show that serotype 8 exhibits promising transduction patterns, as it has demonstrated the highest tangential and radial viral spread in the rat brain. Our research will facilitate translational research for future applications of optogenetics involving the transduction of rat brain cortical astrocytes.

                Binocular vision requires proper developmental wiring of eye-specific inputs to the brain. Axons from the two eyes initially overlap in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus and undergo activity-dependent competition to segregate into target domains. The synaptic basis of such refinement is unknown. Here we used volumetric super-resolution imaging to measure the nanoscale molecular reorganization of developing retinogeniculate eye-specific synapses in the mouse brain. The outcome of binocular synaptic competition was determined by the relative eye-specific maturation of presynaptic vesicle content. Genetic disruption of spontaneous retinal activity prevented subsynaptic vesicle pool maturation, recruitment of vesicles to the active zone, synaptic development and eye-specific competition. These results reveal an activity-dependent presynaptic basis for axonal refinement in the mammalian visual system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Intrinsic neural activity predisposes susceptibility to a body illusion</a></h4>

              
                Susceptibility to the rubber hand illusion (RHI) varies. Thus far, however, there is no consensus as regards how to explain this variation. Previous studies, focused on the role of multisensory integration, have searched for neural correlates of the illusion. Those studies, however, have failed to identify a sufficient set of functionally specific neural correlates. An alternative explanation of the illusion is that it results from demand characteristics, chiefly variability in the disposition to respond to imaginative suggestion: the degree to which intrinsic neural activity allows for a blurring of boundaries between self and external objects. Some evidence suggests that frontal alpha power is one means of tracking neural instantiations of self; therefore, we hypothesized that the higher the frontal alpha power during eyes-closed resting state, the more stable the self. As a corollary, we infer that the more stable the self, the less susceptible are participants to a blurring of boundaries, to feeling that the rubber hand belongs to them. Indeed, we found that frontal alpha amplitude oscillations negatively correlate with susceptibility. Moreover, since alpha and delta oscillations seem to be associated in pathological states that allow for a blurring of boundaries between self and external objects, we conjectured that the high frontal alpha power observed in low-RHI participants is modulated by delta frequency oscillations. Indeed, we found this to be the case. Based on our findings we propose that the two explanatory frameworks might be complementary: that is, the neural correlates of multisensory integration might be necessary for the RHI, but a sufficient explanation requires investigation of variable intrinsic neural activity that acts to modulate how the brain responds to incompatible sensory stimuli.

                Although the hippocampus is generally considered a cognitive center for spatial representation, learning and memory, increasing evidence supports its roles in regulation of locomotion. However, the neuronal mechanisms of hippocampal regulation of locomotion and exploratory behavior remain unclear. Here we found that the inhibitory hippocampo-septal projection bi-directionally controls locomotion speed of mice. Pharmacogenetic activation of these septum-projecting interneurons decreased locomotion and exploratory behavior. Similarly, activation of the hippocampus-originated inhibitory terminal in the medial septum reduced locomotion. On the other hand, inhibition of the hippocampus-originated inhibitory terminal increased locomotion. The locomotion-regulative roles were specific to the septal projecting interneurons as activation of hippocampal interneurons projecting to the retrosplenial cortex did not change animal locomotion. Therefore, this study reveals a specific long-range inhibitory output from the hippocampus in the regulation of animal locomotion.

                Mapping the entire frequency bandwidth of neuronal oscillations in the brain is of paramount importance for understanding physiological and pathological states. The ability to record simultaneously infraslow activity (<0.1 Hz) and higher frequencies (0.1-600 Hz) using the same recording electrode would particularly benefit epilepsy research. However, commonly used metal microelectrode technology is not well suited for recording infraslow activity. Here we use flexible graphene depth neural probes (gDNP), consisting of a linear array of graphene microtransistors, to concurrently record infraslow and high frequency neuronal activity in awake rodents. We show that gDNPs can reliably record and map with high spatial resolution seizures, post-ictal spreading depolarisation, and high frequency epileptic activity through cortical laminae to the CA1 layer of the hippocampus in a mouse model of chemically-induced seizures. We demonstrate functionality of chronically implanted devices over 10 weeks by recording with high fidelity spontaneous spike-wave discharges and associated infraslow activity in a rat model of absence epilepsy. Altogether, our work highlights the suitability of this technology for in vivo electrophysiology research, in particular, to examine the contributions of infraslow activity to seizure initiation and termination.

                Memories are stored in the brain as cellular ensembles activated during learning and reactivated during retrieval. Using the Tet-tag system, we labeled dorsal dentate gyrus (dDG) neurons activated by positive, neutral or negative experiences with channelrhodopsin-2. Following fear-conditioning, these cells were artificially reactivated during fear memory recall. Optical stimulation of a competing positive memory was sufficient to disrupt reconsolidation, thereby reducing conditioned fear acutely and enduringly. Moreover, mice demonstrated operant responding for reactivation of a positive memory, confirming its reward-like properties. These results show that interference from a rewarding experience can counteract negative states. While interference induced by memory reactivation involved a relatively small set of neurons, we also found that activating a large population of randomly labeled dDG neurons was effective at disrupting fear reconsolidation. Importantly, reconsolidation-interference was specific to the fear memory. These findings implicate the dDG as a potential therapeutic node for modulating memories to suppress fear.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Limitations of a proposed correction for slow drifts in decision criterion</a></h4>

              
                Trial history biases in decision-making tasks are thought to reflect systematic updates of decision variables, therefore their precise nature informs conclusions about underlying heuristic strategies and learning processes. However, random drifts in decision variables can corrupt this inference by mimicking the signatures of systematic updates. Hence, identifying the trial-by-trial evolution of decision variables requires methods that can robustly account for such drifts. Recent studies (Lak 20, Mendonca 20) have made important advances in this direction, by proposing a convenient method to correct for the influence of slow drifts in decision criterion, a key decision variable. Here we apply this correction to a variety of updating scenarios, and evaluate its performance. We show that the correction fails for a wide range of commonly assumed systematic updating strategies, distorting one's inference away from the veridical strategies towards a narrow subset. To address these limitations, we propose a model-based approach for disambiguating systematic updates from random drifts, and demonstrate its success on real and synthetic datasets. We show that this approach accurately recovers the latent trajectory of drifts in decision criterion as well as the generative systematic updates from simulated data. Our results offer recommendations for methods to account for the interactions between history biases and slow drifts, and highlight the advantages of incorporating assumptions about the generative process directly into models of decision-making.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Regulation of the cognitive aging process by the transcriptional repressor RP58</a></h4>

              
                Aging involves a decline in physiology which is a natural event in all living organisms. An accumulation of DNA damage contributes to the progression of aging. DNA is continually damaged by exogenous sources and endogenous sources. If the DNA repair pathway operates normally, DNA damage is not life threatening. However, impairments of the DNA repair pathway may result in an accumulation of DNA damage, which has a harmful effect on health and causes an onset of pathology. RP58, a zinc-finger transcriptional repressor, plays a critical role in cerebral cortex formation. Recently, it has been reported that the expression level of RP58 decreases in the aged human cortex. Furthermore, the role of RP58 in DNA damage is inferred by the involvement of DNMT3, which acts as a co-repressor for RP58, in DNA damage. Therefore, RP58 may play a crucial role in the DNA damage associated with aging. In the present study, we investigated the role of RP58 in aging. We used RP58 hetero-knockout and wild-type mice in adolescence, adulthood, or old age. We performed immunohistochemistry to determine whether microglia and DNA damage markers responded to the decline in RP58 levels. Furthermore, we performed an object location test to measure cognitive function, which decline with age. We found that the wild-type mice showed an increase in single-stranded DNA and gamma-H2AX foci. These results indicate an increase in DNA damage or dysfunction of DNA repair mechanisms in the hippocampus as age-related changes. Furthermore, we found that, with advancing age, both the wild-type and hetero-knockout mice showed an impairment of spatial memory for the object and increase in reactive microglia in the hippocampus. However, the RP58 hetero-knockout mice showed these symptoms earlier than the wild-type mice did. These results suggest that a decline in RP58 level may lead to the progression of aging.

                Purpose: This study aimed to develop a new 3D dual-echo rosette k-space trajectory, specifically for applications of ultra-short echo time (UTE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The direct imaging of the myelin bilayer, which has ultra-short transverse relaxation time (uT2), was acquired to test the performance of the proposed UTE sequence. Theory and Methods: The rosette trajectory was developed based on rotations of a "petal-like" pattern in the kx-ky plane, with oscillated extensions in kz-direction for 3D coverage. Five healthy volunteers were recruited and underwent ten dual-echo rosette UTE scans with varied echo times (TEs). Dual-exponential model fitting was performed to separate uT2 signals, with the output of uT2 fraction, uT2 value and long T2 value. Results: The reconstructed images' signal contrast between white matter (WM) and grey matter (GM) increased with longer TEs. The WM regions had higher uT2 fraction values than GM (10.9% {+/-} 1.9% vs. 5.7% {+/-} 2.4%). The uT2 value was about 0.12 milliseconds in WM. Conclusion: The higher uT2 fraction value in WM compared to GM demonstrated the ability of the proposed sequence to capture rapidly decaying signals.

                Confidence is typically defined as a subjective judgment about whether a decision is right. Decisions are based on sources of information that come from various cognitive domains and are processed in different brain systems. An unsettled question is whether the brain computes confidence in a similar manner whatever the domain or in a manner that would be idiosyncratic to each domain. To address this issue, human participants of both sexes performed a new paradigm probing confidence in decisions made about the same material (history and geography statements), but based on different cognitive processes: semantic memory for deciding whether the statement was true or false, and duration perception for deciding whether the statement display was long or short. At the behavioral level, we found that the same factors (difficulty, accuracy, response time and confidence in the preceding decision) predicted confidence judgments in both tasks. At the neural level, we observed using fMRI that confidence judgments in both tasks were associated to activity in the same brain regions: positively in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and negatively in a prefronto-parietal network. Together, these findings suggest the existence of a shared brain system that generates confidence judgments in a similar manner across cognitive domains.

                Free gaze and the use of dynamically changing video stimuli are typically avoided in EEG exper- iments to avoid artefacts and confounds related to uncontrolled eye movements. Yet, often it is unclear whether these artificial secondary manipulations might have unwanted effects on the pri- mary measures of interest and for a growing number of research questions removing them would be beneficial: Among those is the investigation of visual aesthetic experiences, which typically involve open-ended exploration of highly variable stimuli. Here we aimed to quantify the effect of fixation task and using still vs. movie stimuli on EEG signal quality and several behavioral and physiological measures of interest during an aesthetic rating task. Participants observed scenes from landscapes and dance performances and rated each stimulus for both aesthetic appeal and their state of boredom while watching it. The scenes were presented either as dynamic video clips or static pictures, and participants observed them either with unconstrained gaze or under attempted fixation We recorded EEG, ECG and eyetracking from 43 participants. An auditory stream of 40Hz amplitude modulated pink noise was played during each trial and signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) of the auditory steady-state response measured at the scalp was extracted as a proxy measure for overall EEG signal quality. The study including hypotheses and a priori power analysis was preregistered. We found that both behavioral ratings were influenced by the experimental conditions: boredom and aesthetic ratings were positively affected by dynamic video stimuli, indicating that these are experienced as more engaging; both these effects were stronger in dance. As already reported before, landscape stimuli were experienced as more appealing. Fixaton task, on the other hand, had no significant effect on the ratings which is encouraging given how canonically it is applied. Eye movements were significantly affected not only by viewing task, but by stimulus dynamics and content as well: we observed fewer eyeblinks, saccades and microsaccades in video stimuli, and fewer saccades but more microsaccades in dance than in landscape stimuli, with several significant interactions. EEG SNR, to our surprise, was barely affected by fixation task - despite only minimal preprocessing and no trial rejection. We nevertheless believe that the new metric is sensitive to capture noise: it was significantly correlated with the number of eye blinks, and after cleaning the dataset with an ICA based preprocessing pipeline the significant effect of fixation task and the correlation with blink rate vanished. We see these as promising results indicating that at least in the lab more liberal experimental conditions could be achieved without significant loss of signal quality. Specifically the use of dynamic video material bears a lot of potential for future investigations in human neurophysiological studies.

                Ability to efficiently extinguish fear memories is critical for individual well-being, and extinction impairments are commonly observed in a variety of neuropsychiatric conditions. Efficient extinction is also a critical component of exposure therapy, the most widely utilized form of treatment for anxiety and trauma/stressor-related disorders. While individual as well as sex-related differences in extinction are recognized, their neurobiological underpinnings remain unclear. To examine neurobehavioral and molecular features that may contribute to the efficacy of fear memory extinction in genetically similar subjects raised in the same conditions, extinction learning was analyzed in the cohorts of inbred wild-type male and female mice. We showed that unlike memory acquisition, anxiety status of the animals appeared to significantly influence extinction. Interestingly, the effect was sex-specific: the level of anxiety-related behavior inversely correlated with extinction efficacy in male mice only. Significant difference in hippocampal expression of anxiolytic Corticotropin Releasing Hormone Receptor 2 (CRHR2) between the male, but not female animals differing in extinction efficacy, suggests that CRHR2 may serve as a key factor underlying sexually dimorphic interplay between anxiety and fear memory extinction. Our results emphasize the need for tailoring treatment strategies for anxiety and fear-related disorders in accordance with the patient sex and identify specific neurobehavioral and molecular features potentially important for such adjustments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Experience-dependent changes in hippocampal spatial activity and hippocampal circuit function are disrupted in a rat model of Fragile X Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a common single gene cause of intellectual disability and Autism Spectrum Disorder. Cognitive inflexibility is one of the hallmarks of FXS, with affected individuals showing extreme difficulty adapting to novel or complex situations. To explore the neural correlates of this cognitive inflexibility, we used a rat model of FXS (Fmr1 KO), and recorded from the CA1 region of the hippocampus while animals habituated in a novel environment for two consecutive days. On the first day of exploration, the firing rate and spatial tuning of CA1 pyramidal neurons was similar between wild-type (WT) and Fmr1 KO rats. However, while CA1 pyramidal neurons from WT rats showed experience-dependent changes in firing and spatial tuning between the first and second day of exposure to the environment, these changes were decreased or absent in CA1 neurons of Fmr1 KO rats. These findings were consistent with increased excitability of Fmr1 KO CA1 neurons in ex-vivo hippocampal slices, which correlated with reduced synaptic inputs from the medial entorhinal cortex. Lastly, activity patterns of CA1 pyramidal neurons were discoordinated with respect to hippocampal oscillatory activity in Fmr1 KO rats. These findings suggest a network-level origin of cognitive deficits in FXS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Similar cognitive processing synchronizes brains, hearts, and eyes</a></h4>

              
                Neural, physiological and behavioral signals synchronize between human subjects in a variety of settings. Multiple hypotheses have been proposed to explain this interpersonal synchrony, but there is no clarity under which conditions it arises, for which signals, or whether there is a common underlying mechanism. We hypothesized that similar cognitive processing of a shared stimulus is the source of interpersonal synchrony, measured here as inter-subject correlation. To test this we presented informative videos to participants in an attentive and distracted condition and subsequently measured information recall. Inter-subject correlation was observed for electro-encephalography, gaze position, pupil size and heart rate, but not respiration and head movements. The strength of correlation was co-modulated in the different signals, changed with attentional state, and predicted subsequent recall of information presented in the videos. There was robust within-subject coupling between brain, heart and eyes, but not respiration or head movements. The results suggest that inter-subject correlation is the result of similar cognitive processing and thus emerges only for those signals that exhibit a robust brain-body connection. While physiological and behavioral fluctuations may be driven by multiple features of the stimulus, correlation with other individuals is co-modulated by the level of attentional engagement with the stimulus.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sensorimotor feedback loops are selectively sensitive to reward</a></h4>

              
                While it is well established that motivational factors such as earning more money for performing well improve motor performance, how the motor system implements this improvement remains unclear. For instance, feedback-based control, which uses sensory feedback from the body to correct for errors in movement, improves with greater reward. But feedback control encompasses many feedback loops with diverse characteristics such as the brain regions involved and their response time. Which specific loops drive these performance improvements with reward is unknown, even though their diversity makes it unlikely that they are contributing uniformly. This lack of mechanistic insight leads to practical limitations in applications using reward, such as clinical rehabilitation, athletic coaching, and brain-inspired robotics. We systematically tested the effect of reward on the latency (how long for a corrective response to arise?) and gain (how large is the corrective response?) of eight distinct sensorimotor feedback loops in humans. Only the feedback responses known to rely on prefrontal associative cortices showed sensitivity to reward, while feedback responses that relied mainly on premotor and sensorimotor cortex did not show sensitivity to reward. Our results may have implications regarding feedback control performance in pathologies showing a cognitive decline, or on athletic coaching. For instance, coaching methodologies that rely on reinforcement or "reward shaping" may need to specifically target aspects of movement that rely on reward-sensitive feedback responses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Circumscribing laser cuts attenuate seizure propagation in a mouse model of focal epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                In partial onset epilepsy, seizures arise focally in the brain and often propagate, causing acute behavior changes, chronic cognitive decline, and increased mortality. Patients frequently become refractory to medical management, leaving neurosurgical resection of the seizure focus as a primary treatment, which can cause neurologic deficits. In the cortex, focal seizures are thought to spread through horizontal connections in layers II/III, suggesting that selectively severing these connections could block seizure propagation while preserving normal columnar circuitry and function. We induced focal neocortical epilepsy in mice and used tightly-focused femtosecond-duration laser pulses to create a sub-surface, open-cylinder cut surrounding the seizure focus and severing cortical layers II-IV. We monitored seizure propagation using electrophysiological recordings at the seizure focus and at distant electrodes for 3-8 months. With laser cuts, only 5% of seizures propagated to the distant electrodes, compared to 85% in control animals. Laser cuts also decreased the number of seizures that were initiated, so that the average number of propagated seizures per day decreased from 42 in control mice to 1.5 with laser cuts. Physiologically, these cuts produced a modest decrease in cortical blood flow that recovered within days and, at one month, left a ~20-m wide scar with increased gliosis and localized inflammatory cell infiltration but minimal collateral damage. When placed over motor cortex, cuts did not cause notable deficits in a skilled reaching task. Femtosecond laser produced sub-surface cuts hold promise as a novel neurosurgical approach for intractable focal cortical epilepsy, as might develop following traumatic brain injury.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The dissociable effects of reward on sequential motor behaviour</a></h4>

              
                Reward has consistently been shown to enhance motor performance however its beneficial effects appear to be largely unspecific. While reward has been shown to invigorate performance, it also enhances learning and/or retention. Therefore, a mechanistic account of the effects of reward on motor behaviour is lacking. Here we tested the hypothesis that these distinct reward-based improvements are driven by dissociable reward types: explicit reward (i.e. money) and performance feedback (i.e. points). Experiment 1 showed that explicit reward instantaneously improved movement times (MT) using a novel sequential reaching task. In contrast, performance-based feedback led to learning-related improvements. Importantly, pairing both maximised MT performance gains and accelerated movement fusion. Fusion describes an optimisation process during which neighbouring sequential movements blend together to form singular actions. Results from experiment 2 served as a replication and showed that fusion led to enhanced performance speed whilst also improving movement efficiency through increased smoothness. Finally, experiment 3 showed that these improvements in performance persist for 24 hours even without reward availability. This highlights the dissociable impact of explicit reward and performance feedback, with their combination maximising performance gains and leading to stable improvements in the speed and efficiency of sequential actions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Genome-wide mapping implicates R-loops in lineage-specific processes and formation of DNA break hotspots in neural stem/progenitor cells</a></h4>

              
                Recent work has revealed classes of recurrent DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in neural stem/progenitor cells, including transcription-associated, promoter-proximal breaks and recurrent DSB clusters in late-replicating, long neural genes. However, the mechanistic factors promoting these different classes of DSBs in neural stem/progenitor cells are not understood. Here, we elucidated the genome-wide landscape of DNA:RNA hybrid structures called "R-loops" in primary neural stem/progenitor cells in order to assess their contribution to the different classes of DNA break "hotspots". We report that R-loops in neural stem/progenitor cells are associated primarily with transcribed regions that replicate early and genes that show GC skew in their promoter region. Surprisingly, the majority of genes with recurrent DSB clusters in long, neural genes does not show substantial R-loop accumulation. We implicate R-loops in promoter-proximal DNA break formation in highly transcribed, early replicating regions and conclude that R-loops are not a driver of recurrent double-strand break cluster formation in most long, neural genes. Together, our study provides an understanding of how R-loops may contribute to DNA break hotspots and affect lineage-specific processes in neural stem/progenitor cells.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuromuscular connectomes across development reveal synaptic ordering rules</a></h4>

              
                The connections between motor neurons and muscle fibers are dramatically reorganized in early postnatal life. This work attempts to better understand this synaptic rewiring by using a connectomic approach, i.e., tracing out all the connections between motor neurons and muscle fibers, at successive ages in a small mouse muscle. We reconstructed 31 partial-complete neuromuscular connectomes, using serial section scanning electron microscopy in a neonatal mouse and Brainbow-based and XFP-based fluorescent reconstructions in older animals. Our data included a total of more than 6000 neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), including complete connectomes from one newborn, seven developmental ages (P6-P9), and two adults. Analysis confirmed the massive rewiring that takes place as axons prune their motor units but add more synaptic areas at the NMJs with which they remain in contact. Interestingly, we found synaptic ordering rules that likely underlie this circuit maturation and yield the resulting adult neuromuscular pattern, as manifest in Henneman's size principle. In particular, by analyzing both the identities of axons sharing NMJs at developing ages and muscle fibers with multiple endplates, we found evidence suggesting an activity-based linear ranking of motor neurons such that neurons co-innervated the same endplates and same muscle fibers (if there were more than one endplate) when the axons were similar in activity and hence rank. In addition, this ranking provided a means for understanding action at a distance in which the activity at one neuromuscular junction can impact the fate of the axons at another junction at a different site on the same muscle fiber. These activity-dependent mechanisms provide insight into the means by which timing of activity among different axons innervating the same population of cells, that start out with nearly all-to-all connectivity, can produce a well-organized system of axons, a system that is necessary for the recruitment order of neurons during a graded behavior like muscle contraction.

                Chronic Levodopa therapy, the gold-standard treatment of Parkinson's Disease (PD), leads to the emergence of involuntary movements, called levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID). Cerebellar stimulations have been shown to decrease LID severity in PD patients. Here, in order to determine how cerebellar stimulations induce LID alleviation, we performed daily short trains of optogenetic stimulations of Purkinje cells (PC) in freely moving mice. We demonstrated that these stimulations are sufficient to suppress LID or even prevent their development. This symptomatic relief is accompanied by the normalization of aberrant neuronal discharge in the cerebellar nuclei, the motor cortex and the parafascicular thalamus. Inhibition of the cerebello-parafascicular pathway counteracted the beneficial effect of cerebellar stimulations. Moreover, cerebellar stimulations reversed plasticity in D1 striatal neurons and normalized the overexpression of FosB, a transcription factor causally linked to LID. These findings demonstrate LID alleviation and prevention by daily PC stimulations, which restore the function of a wide brain motor network, and may be valuable for LID treatment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hybrid EEG-EMG system to detect steering actions in car driving settings</a></h4>

              
                Understanding mental processes in complex human behaviour is a key issue in the context of driving, representing a milestone for developing user-centred assistive driving devices. Here we propose a hybrid method based on electroencephalographic (EEG) and electromyographic (EMG) signatures to distinguish left from right steering in driving scenarios. Twenty-four participants took part in the experiment consisting of recordings 128-channel EEG as well as EMG activity from deltoids and forearm extensors in non-ecological and ecological steering tasks. Specifically, we identified the EEG mu rhythm modulation correlates with motor preparation of self-paced steering actions in the non-ecological task, while the concurrent EMG activity of the left (right) deltoids correlates with right (left) steering. Consequently, we exploited the mu rhythm de-synchronization resulting from the non-ecological task to detect the steering side by means of a cross-correlation analysis with the ecological EMG signals. Results returned significant cross-correlation values showing the coupling between the non-ecological EEG feature and the muscular activity collected in ecological driving conditions. Moreover, such cross-correlation patterns discriminate left from right steering with an earlier dynamic with respect to the single EMG signal. This hybrid system overcomes the limitation of the EEG signals collected in ecological settings such as low reliability, accuracy and adaptability, thus adding to the EMG the characteristic predictive power of the cerebral data. These results are a proof of concept of how it is possible to complement different physiological signals to control the level of assistance needed by the driver.

                Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a chronic relapsing brain disorder characterized by an impaired ability to stop or control alcohol consumption despite adverse social, occupational, or health consequences. AUD affects nearly one-third of adults at some point during their lives, with an associated cost of approximately $249 billion annually in the U.S. alone. The effects of alcohol consumption are expected to increase significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, with alcohol sales increased by approximately 54%, potentially exacerbating health concerns and risk-taking behaviors. Unfortunately, existing pharmacological and behavioral therapies for AUD have historically been associated with poor success rates, with approximately 40% of individuals relapsing within three years of treatment. Pre-clinical studies have shown that chronic alcohol consumption leads to significant changes in synaptic function within the dorsal medial striatum (DMS), one of the brain regions associated with AUD and responsible for mediating goal-directed behavior. Specifically, chronic alcohol consumption has been associated with hyperactivity of dopamine receptor 1 (D1) medium spiny neurons (MSN) and hypoactivity of dopamine receptor 2 (D1) MSNs within the DMS. Optogenetic, chemogenetic, and transgenic approaches have demonstrated that reducing the D1/D2 MSN signaling imbalance decreases alcohol self-administration in rodent models of AUD. However, these approaches cannot be studied clinically at this time. Here, we present an electrical stimulation alternative that uses ultra-low (<=1Hz) frequency (ULF) spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) to reduce DMS D1/D2 MSN signaling imbalances by stimulating D1-MSN afferents into the GPi and ACC glutamatergic projections to the DMS in a time-locked stimulation sequence. Our data suggest that GPi/ACC ULF-STDP selectively decreases DMS D1-MSN hyperactivity leading to reduced alcohol consumption without evoking undesired affective behaviors in a two-bottle choice mouse model of AUD.

                In 2011, Brants, Wagemans, & Op de Beeck (JOCN 23:12, pp. 3949-3958) trained eight individuals to become Greeble experts, and found neuronal inversion effects [NIEs; i.e., higher Fusiform Face Area (FFA) activity for upright, rather than inverted Greebles]. These effects were also found for faces, both before and after training. By claiming to have replicated the seminal Greeble training study (i.e., Gauthier, Tarr, Anderson, Skudlarski, & Gore, 1999, Nat Neurosci, 2, 568-573), Brants et al. interpreted these results as participants viewing Greebles as faces throughout training, contrary to the original argument of subjects becoming Greeble experts only after training. However, such a claim presents two issues. First, the behavioral training results of Brants et al. did not replicate those of Gauthier et al (1999), raising concerns of whether the right training regime had been adopted. Second, both a literature review and meta-analysis of NIE in the FFA suggest its unreliability as an index of face(-like) processing. To empirically evaluate these issues, the present study compared two documented training paradigms (i.e., Gauthier & Tarr, 1997, Vision Res, 37, 1673-1682; and Gauthier, Williams, Tarr, & Tanaka, 1998, Vision Res, 38, 2401-2428) and explored their impact on the FFA. The results showed significant increases in the FFA for Greebles, and a clear neural "adaptation" (i.e., decreased activity for faces following Greebles, but not following non-face objects, in the FFA) both only in the Gauthier97 group, and only after training, reflecting clear modulation of expertise following "appropriate" training. In both groups, no clear NIE for faces nor Greebles were found. Collectively, these data invalidate the two assumptions behind the Brants et al. findings, and provide not only the updated support, but also the new evidence, for the perceptual expertise hypothesis of FFA.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Perception affects the brain's metabolic response to sensory stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Processing of incoming sensory stimulation triggers an increase of cerebral perfusion and blood oxygenation (neurovascular response) as well as an alteration of the metabolic neurochemical profile (neurometabolic response). Here we show that perceived and unperceived isoluminant chromatic flickering stimuli designed to have similar neurovascular responses as measured by blood oxygenation level dependent functional MRI (BOLD-fMRI) in primary visual cortex (V1) have markedly different neurometabolic responses as measured by functional MRS. In particular, a significant regional buildup of lactate, an index of aerobic glycolysis, and glutamate, an index of malate-aspartate shuttle, occurred in V1 only when the flickering is perceived, without any relation with behavioral or physiological variables. Wheras the BOLD-fMRI signal in V1, a proxy for input to V1, was insensitive to flickering perception by design, the BOLD-fMRI signal in secondary visual areas was larger during perceived than unperceived flickering indicating increased output from V1. These results indicate that the upregulation of energy metabolism induced by visual stimulation depends on the type of information processing taking place in V1, and that 1H-fMRS provides unique information about local input/output balance that is not measured by BOLD-fMRI.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Characterization of striatal dopamine projections across striatal subregions in behavioral flexibility</a></h4>

              
                Behavioral flexibility is key to survival in a dynamic environment. While flexible, goal-directed behaviors are initially dependent on dorsomedial striatum, they become dependent on lateral striatum with extended training as behaviors become inflexible. Similarly, dopamine release shifts from ventromedial to lateral striatum across learning, and impairment of lateral dopamine release disrupts habitual, inflexible responding. This raises the possibility that lateral dopamine release is a causative mechanism in establishing inflexible behaviors late in training, though this has not been directly tested. Here, we utilized optogenetics to activate dopamine terminals in dorsal medial (DMS), dorsal lateral (DLS), and ventral (NAc) striatum in DATcre mice to determine how specific dopamine subpopulations impact behavioral flexibility. Mice performed a reversal task in which they self-stimulated DMS, DLS, or NAc dopamine terminals by pressing one of two levers before action-outcome lever contingencies were reversed. Consistent with presumed ventromedial/lateral striatal function, we found that mice self-stimulating ventromedial dopamine terminals rapidly reversed lever preference following contingency reversal, while mice self-stimulating dopamine terminals in DLS showed impaired reversal learning. These impairments were characterized by more regressive errors and reliance on lose-stay strategies following reversal, suggesting reward insensitivity and overreliance on previously learned actions. This study supports a model of striatal function in which dorsomedial dopamine facilitates goal-directed responding, and dorsolateral dopamine release is a key mechanism in supporting the transition toward inflexible behaviors.

	<p>The memory literature has identified interference and inhibition as two major sources of forgetting. While interference is generally considered to be a passive cause of forgetting arising from exposure to additional information that impedes subsequent recall of target information, inhibition concerns a more active and goal-directed cause of forgetting that can be achieved intentionally. Over the past 25 years, our knowledge of the neural mechanisms underlying both interference-induced and inhibition-induced forgetting has expanded substantially. The present paper gives a critical overview of this research, pointing out empirical gaps in the current work and providing suggestions for future studies.</p>

	<p>Sarcopenia, a geriatric syndrome involving loss of muscle mass and strength, is often associated with the early phases of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Pathological hallmarks of AD including amyloid β (Aβ) aggregates which can be found in peripheral tissues such as skeletal muscle. However, not much is currently known about their possible involvement in sarcopenia. We investigated neuronal innervation in skeletal muscle of Tg2576 mice, a genetic model for Aβ accumulation. We examined cholinergic innervation of skeletal muscle in adult Tg2576 and wild type mice by immunofluorescence labeling of tibialis anterior (TA) muscle sections using antibodies raised against neurofilament light chain (NFL) and acetylcholine (ACh) synthesizing enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). Combining this histological approach with real time quantification of mRNA levels of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, we demonstrated that in the TA of Tg2576 mice, neuronal innervation is significantly reduced and synaptic area is smaller and displays less ChAT content when compared to wild type mice. Our study provides the first evidence of reduced cholinergic innervation of skeletal muscle in a mouse model of Aβ accumulation. This evidence sustains the possibility that sarcopenia in AD originates from Aβ-mediated cholinergic loss.</p>

	<p>The antisense oligonucleotide nusinersen has been shown to improve trunk and limb motor function in patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Bulbar dysfunction, which is regularly present in SMA, is not captured by standard motor scores, and validated measurement instruments to assess it have not yet been established. Data on whether and how bulbar function changes under gene-based therapies in adult SMA patients are also unavailable. Here, we present data on the course of bulbar dysfunction assessed prospectively before nusinersen treatment initiation and 6 and 14 months later in 23 adult SMA patients using the Sydney Swallow Questionnaire (SSQ) and the bulbar subscore of the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale Revised (ALSFRS-R). While no improvement in bulbar scores was observed under treatment with nusinersen, the absence of a decline still implies a therapeutic effect of nusinersen on bulbar dysfunction. The results of this study aim to contribute to a standardized assessment of bulbar function in adult SMA patients, which may show therapeutic effects of gene-based therapies that are not evident from standard motor scores.</p>

	<p>Disruption of normal intrauterine brain development is a significant consequence of premature birth and may lead to serious complications, such as neonatal brain injury (NBI). This prospective case-control longitudinal study aimed at determining the levels and prognostic value of serum activin A during the first three days of life in human premature neonates which later developed NBI. It was conducted in a single tertiary hospital and eligible participants were live-born premature (&amp;amp;lt;34 weeks) neonates. Each case (n = 29) developed NBI in the form of an intraventricular haemorrhage, or periventricular leukomalacia, and was matched according to birth weight and gestational age to one neonate with normal head ultrasound scans. Serum activin A levels in both groups showed a stable concentration during the first three days of life as no difference was observed within the two groups from the first to the third day. Neonates diagnosed with NBI had significantly higher activin A levels during the first two days of life compared to control neonates and its levels correlated to the severity of NBI during the second and third day of life. Although serum activin A on the second day was the best predictor for neonates at risk to develop NBI, the overall predictive value was marginally fair (area under the ROC-curve 69.2%). Activin A, in combination with other biomarkers, may provide the first clinically useful panel for the early detection of premature neonates at high risk of NBI.</p>

                Kim et al. find that critical COVID-19 is associated with enhanced eosinophil-mediated inflammation when compared to non-critical cases. Increased Th2-biased immune responses, accompanying overt complement activation, are seen in the critical group. These findings suggest that enhanced eosinophil-mediated inflammation and dysregulated humoral responses might be drivers of severe COVID-19.

                What features are important for circuit robustness? Reciprocal inhibition is a building block in many circuits. We used dynamic clamp to create reciprocally inhibitory circuits from GM neurons of the crab stomatogastric ganglion by injecting artificial synaptic and hyperpolarization-activated inward (H) currents. In "release", the active neuron controls the off/on transitions. In "escape", the inhibited neuron controls the transitions. We characterized the robustness of escape and release circuits to alterations in circuit parameters, temperature, and neuromodulation. Escape circuits rely on tight correlations between synaptic and H conductances to generate bursting but are resilient to temperature increase. Release circuits are robust to variations in synaptic and H conductances but fragile to temperature increase. The modulatory current (IMI) restores oscillations in release circuits but has little effect in escape. Thus, the same perturbation can have dramatically different effects depending on the circuits' mechanism of operation that may not be observable from circuit output.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Synchronous spiking of cerebellar Purkinje cells during control of movements</a></h4>

              
                The information that the brain transmits from one region to another is often viewed through the lens of firing rates. However, if the output neurons could vary the timing of their spikes with respect to each other, then through synchronization they could highlight information that may be critical for control of behavior. In the cerebellum, the computations that are performed by the cerebellar cortex are conveyed to the nuclei via inhibition. Yet, synchronous activity entrains nucleus neurons, making them fire. Does the cerebellar cortex rely on spike synchrony within populations of Purkinje cells (P-cells) to convey information to the nucleus? We recorded from multiple P-cells while marmosets performed saccadic eye movements and organized them into populations that shared a complex spike response to error. Before movement onset, P-cells transmitted information via a rate code: the simple spike firing rates predicted the direction and velocity of the impending saccade. However, during the saccade, the spikes became temporally aligned within the population, signaling when to stop the movement. Thus, the cerebellar cortex relies on spike synchronization within a population of P-cells, not individual firing rates, to convey to the nucleus when to stop a movement.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Intergenerational effects of a paternal Western diet during adolescence on offspring gut microbiota, stress reactivity and social behavior</a></h4>

              
                The global consumption of highly processed, calorie-dense foods has contributed to an epidemic of overweight and obesity, along with negative consequences for metabolic dysfunction and disease susceptibility. As it becomes apparent that overweight and obesity have ripple effects through generations, understanding of the processes involved is required, in both maternal and paternal epigenetic inheritance. We focused on the patrilineal effects of a Western-style high-fat (21%) and high-sugar (34%) diet (WD) compared to control diet (CD) during adolescence and investigated F0 and F1 mice for physiological and behavioral changes. F0 males (fathers) showed increased body weight, impaired glycemic control, and decreased attractiveness to females. Paternal WD caused significant phenotypic changes in F1 offspring, including higher body weights of pups, increased Actinobacteria abundance in the gut microbiota (ascertained using 16S microbiome profiling), a food preference for WD pellets, increased male dominance and attractiveness to females, as well as decreased behavioral despair. These results collectively demonstrate the long-term intergenerational effects of a Western-style diet during paternal adolescence. The behavioral and physiological alterations in F1 offspring provide evidence of adaptive paternal programming via epigenetic inheritance. These findings have important implications for understanding paternally mediated intergenerational inheritance, and its relevance to offspring health and disease susceptibility.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Behavioral prioritization enhances working memory precision and neural population gain</a></h4>

              
                Humans allocate visual working memory (WM) resource according to behavioral relevance, resulting in more precise memories for more important items. Theoretically, items may be maintained by feature-tuned neural populations, where the relative gain of the populations encoding each item determines precision. To test this hypothesis, we compared the amplitudes of delay-period activity in the different parts of retinotopic maps representing each of several WM items, predicting amplitude would track with behavioral priority. Using fMRI, we scanned participants while they remembered the location of multiple items over a WM delay, then reported the location of one probed item using a memory-guided saccade. Importantly, items were not equally probable to be probed (0.6, 0.3, 0.1, 0.0), which was indicated with a pre-cue. We analyzed fMRI activity in ten visual field maps in occipital, parietal, and frontal cortex known to be important for visual WM. In early visual cortex, but not association cortex, the amplitude of BOLD activation within voxels corresponding to the retinotopic location of visual WM items increased with the priority of the item. Interestingly, these results were contrasted with a common finding that higher-level brain regions had greater delay-period activity, demonstrating a dissociation between the absolute amount of activity in a brain area, and the activity of different spatially-selective populations within it. These results suggest that the distribution of WM resources according to priority sculpts the relative gains of neural populations that encode items, offering a neural mechanism for how prioritization impacts memory precision.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Temporal filters in response to presynaptic spike trains: Interplay of cellular, synaptic and short-term plasticity time scales</a></h4>

              
                Temporal filters, the ability of postsynaptic neurons to preferentially select certain presynaptic input patterns, have been shown to be associated with the notion of information filtering and coding of sensory inputs. Their properties can be dynamically characterized as the transient responses to periodic presynaptic inputs. Short-term plasticity (STP) has been proposed to be an important player in the generation of temporal filters, but the response of postsynaptic neurons to presynaptic inputs depends on a collection of time scales in addition to STP's, which conspire to create temporal filters: the postsynaptic time scales generated by the cellular intrinsic currents and the presynaptic time scales captured by the ISI distribution patterns. The mechanisms by which these time scales and the processes giving rise to them interact to produce temporal filters in response to presynaptic input spike trains are not well understood. We carry out a systematic modeling and computational analysis to understand how the postsynaptic low-, high- and band-pass temporal filters are generated in response to periodic presynaptic spike trains in the presence STP, and how the dynamic properties of these filters depend on the interplay of a hierarchy of processes: arrival of the presynaptic spikes, the activation of STP and its effect on the synaptic connection efficacy, and the response of the postsynaptic cell. The time scales associated with each of these processes operate at the short-term, single-event level (they are activated at the arrival of each presynaptic spike) and collectively produce the long-term time scales that determine the shape and properties of the filters. We develop a series of mathematical tools to address these issues for a relatively simple model where depression and facilitation interact only at the level of the synaptic efficacy change as time progresses and we extend our results and tools to account for more complex models that involve interactions at the STP level and multiple STP time scales. We use these tools to understand the mechanisms of generation of temporal filters in the postsynaptic cells in terms of the properties and dynamics of the interacting building blocks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multi-functional feedforward inhibitory circuits for cortical odor processing</a></h4>

              
                Feedforward inhibitory circuits are key contributors to the complex interplay between excitation and inhibition in the brain. Little is known about the function of feedforward inhibition in the primary olfactory (piriform) cortex. Using in vivo two-photon targeted patch clamping and calcium imaging in mice, we find that odors evoke strong excitation in two classes of interneurons - neurogliaform (NG) cells and horizontal (HZ) cells - that provide feedforward inhibition in layer 1 of the piriform cortex. NG cells fire much earlier than HZ cells following odor onset, a difference that can be attributed to the faster odor-driven excitatory synaptic drive that NG cells receive from the olfactory bulb. As a consequence, NG cells strongly but transiently inhibit odor-evoked excitation in layer 2 principal cells, whereas HZ cells provide more diffuse and prolonged feedforward inhibition. Our findings reveal unexpected complexity in the operation of inhibition in the piriform cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Epilepsy-causing KCNT1 variants increase KNa1.1 channel activity by disrupting the activation gate.</a></h4>

              
                Gain-of-function pathogenic missense KCNT1 variants are associated with several developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEE). With few exceptions, patients are heterozygous and there is a paucity of mechanistic information about how pathogenic variants increase KNa1.1 channel activity and the behaviour of heterotetrameric channels comprising both wild-type (WT) and variant subunits. To better understand these, we selected a range of variants across the DEE spectrum, involving mutations in different protein domains and studied their functional properties. Whole-cell electrophysiology was used to characterise homomeric and heteromeric KNa1.1 channel assemblies carrying DEE-causing variants in the presence and absence of 10 mM intracellular sodium. Voltage-dependent activation of homomeric variant KNa1.1 assemblies were more hyperpolarised than WT KNa1.1 and, unlike WT KNa1.1, exhibited voltage-dependent activation in the absence of intracellular sodium. Heteromeric channels formed by co-expression of WT and variant KNa1.1 had activation kinetics intermediate of homomeric WT and variant KNa1.1 channels, with residual sodium-independent activity. In general, WT and variant KNa1.1 activation followed a single exponential, with time constants unaffected by voltage or sodium. Mutating the threonine in the KNa1.1 selectivity filter disrupted voltage-dependent activation, but sodium-dependence remained intact. Our findings suggest that KNa1.1 gating involves a sodium-dependent activation gate that modulates a voltage-dependent selectivity filter gate. Collectively, all DEE-associated KNa1.1 mutations lowered the energetic barrier for sodium-dependent activation, but some also had direct effects on selectivity filter gating. Destabilisation of the inactivated unliganded channel conformation can explain how DEE-causing amino acid substitutions in diverse regions of the channel structure all cause gain-of-function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spatial working memory representations in human cortex are robust to a task-irrelevant interrupting stimulus</a></h4>

              
                Visual working memory (WM) enables the maintenance and manipulation of information no longer accessible in the visual world. Previous research has identified spatial WM representations in activation patterns in visual, parietal, and frontal cortex. In natural vision, the period between the encoding of information into WM and the time when it is used to guide behavior (the delay period) is rarely "empty", as is the case in most of the above laboratory experiments. In naturalistic conditions, eye movements, movement of the individual, and events in the environment result in visual signals which may overwrite or impair the fidelity of WM representations, especially in early sensory cortices. Here, we evaluated the extent to which a brief, irrelevant interrupting visual stimulus presented during a spatial WM delay period impaired behavioral performance and WM representation fidelity assayed using an image reconstruction technique (inverted encoding model). On each trial, participants (both sexes) viewed two target dots and were immediately post-cued to remember the precise spatial position of one dot. On 50% of trials, a brief interrupter stimulus appeared. While we observed strong transient univariate visual responses to the distracter stimulus, we saw no change in reconstructed neural WM representations under distraction, nor a change in behavioral performance on a continuous recall task. This suggests that spatial WM representations may be particularly robust to interference from incoming task-irrelevant visual information, perhaps related to their role in guiding movements.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Robust effects of working memory demand during naturalistic language comprehension in language-selective cortex</a></h4>

              
                A standard view of human language processing is that comprehenders build richly structured mental representations of natural language utterances, word by word, using computationally costly memory operations supported by domain-general working memory resources. However, three core claims of this view have been questioned, with some prior work arguing that (1) rich word-by-word structure building is not a core function of the language comprehension system, (2) apparent working memory costs are underlyingly driven by word predictability (surprisal), and/or (3) language comprehension relies primarily on domain-general rather than domain-specific working memory resources. In this work, we simultaneously evaluate all three of these claims using naturalistic comprehension in fMRI. In each participant, we functionally localize (a) a language-selective network and (b) a 'multiple-demand' network that supports working memory across domains, and we analyze the responses in these two networks of interest during naturalistic story listening with respect to a range of theory-driven predictors of working memory demand under rigorous surprisal controls. Results show robust surprisal-independent effects of word-by-word memory demand in the language network and no effect of working memory demand in the multiple demand network. Our findings thus support the view that language comprehension (1) entails word-by-word structure building using (2) computationally intensive memory operations that are not explained by surprisal. However, these results challenge (3) the domain-generality of the resources that support these operations, instead indicating that working memory operations for language comprehension are carried out by the same neural resources that store linguistic knowledge.

	<p>This study aims to investigate possible different outcomes in the inpatient treatment of anorexia nervosa (AN) related to different timings of psychopharmacological and nutritional interventions. A retrospective observational study was conducted, involving young patients hospitalized for AN, treated with naso-gastric tube feeding (NGT). Participants were divided into five groups according to early (0–7 days) or late (8+ days) introduction of atypical antipsychotics (AAP) and NGT: early AAP-early NGT (EE), early AAP-late NGT (EL), late AAP-early NGT (LE), late AAP-late NGT (LL) and a control group treated with NGT only (NGT). Concurrent clinical and treatment variables were analyzed. AN psychopathology was measured with the Eating Disorder Inventory-3 (EDI-3) EDRC score. Outcomes were assessed as admission-discharge body-mass index (BMI) improvement and length of hospital stay (LOS). Contributions of variables related to outcomes were assessed with multifactorial-analyses of variance (MANOVA). Seventy-nine patients were enrolled in the study. LOS was different among treatment groups (F (4, 75) = 5.993, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and EE patients showed lower LOS than LE (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and LL (p = 0.025) patients. BMI improvement was not significantly different among treatment groups but correlated negatively with age (F (1, 72) = 10.130, p = 0.002), and admission BMI (F (1, 72) = 14.681, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). In conclusion, patients treated with early AAP and early NGT showed lower LOS than those treated with late AAP. Prognostic treatment variables should be investigated in wider samples.</p>

	<p>Background: Conventional L5 corpectomy requires a large incision and an extended period of intraoperative fluoroscopy. We describe herein a new L5 corpectomy technique. Methods: A 79-year-old woman was referred to our hospital for leg pain and lower back pain due to an L5 vertebral fracture. Her daily life had been affected by severe lower back pain and sciatica for more than 2 months. We initially performed simple decompression surgery, but this proved effective for only 10 months. Results: For revision surgery, the patient underwent minimally invasive L5 corpectomy with a navigated expandable cage without fluoroscopy. The second surgery took 215 min, and estimated blood loss was 750 milliliters. The revision surgery proved successful, and the patient could then walk using a cane. In terms of clinical outcomes, the Oswestry Disability Index improved from 66% to 24%, and the visual analog scale score for lower back pain improved from 84 to 31 mm at the 1-year follow-up. Conclusions: Minimally invasive L5 corpectomy with a navigated expandable vertebral cage is effective for reducing cage misplacement and surgical invasiveness. With this new technique, surgeons and operating room staff can avoid the risk of adverse events due to intraoperative radiation exposure.</p>

	<p>High doses of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive component of cannabis, have been shown to have anxiogenic effects. Additionally, THC effects have been shown to be modulated by genotype, including the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1130233 at the protein kinase AKT1 gene, a key component of the dopamine signalling cascade. As such, it is likely that epigenetic methylation around this SNP may affect AKT gene expression, which may in turn impact on the acute effects of THC on brain function. We investigated the genetic (AKT1 rs1130233) and epigenetic modulation of brain function during fear processing in a 2-session, double-blind, cross-over, randomized placebo-controlled THC administration, in 36 healthy males. Fear processing was assessed using an emotion (fear processing) paradigm, under functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Complete genetic and fMRI data were available for 34 participants. THC caused an increase in anxiety and transient psychotomimetic symptoms and para-hippocampal gyrus/ amygdala activation. Number of A alleles at the AKT1 rs1130233 SNP, and percentage methylation at the CpG11–12 site, were independently associated with a greater effect of THC on activation in a network of brain regions including left and right parahippocampal gyri, respectively. AKT1 rs1130233 moderation of the THC effect on left parahippocampal activation persisted after covarying for methylation percentage, and was partially mediated in sections of the left parahippocampal gyrus/ hippocampus by methylation percentage. These results may offer an example of how genetic and epigenetic variations influence the psychotomimetic and neurofunctional effects of THC.</p>

	<p>Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are part of the same pathophysiological spectrum and have common genetic and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. Our aim here was to identify causative gene variants in a cohort of Greek patients with FTD, ALS and FTD-ALS, to measure levels of CSF biomarkers and to investigate genotype-phenotype/CSF biomarker associations. In this cohort of 130 patients (56 FTD, 58 ALS and 16 FTD-ALS), we performed C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion analysis, whole exome sequencing and measurement of “classical” (Aβ42, total tau and phospho-tau) and novel (TDP-43) CSF biomarkers and plasma progranulin. Through these analyses, we identified 14 patients with C9orf72 repeat expansion and 11 patients with causative variants in other genes (three in TARDBP, three in GRN, three in VCP, one in FUS, one in SOD1). In ALS patients, we found that levels of phospho-tau were lower in C9orf72 repeat expansion and MAPT c.855C&amp;amp;gt;T (p.Asp285Asp) carriers compared to non-carriers. Additionally, carriers of rare C9orf72 and APP variants had lower levels of total tau and Aβ42, respectively. Plasma progranulin levels were decreased in patients carrying GRN pathogenic variants. This study expands the genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of FTD/ALS and offers insights in possible genotypic/CSF biomarker associations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Relation of Pre‐stroke Aspirin Use With Cerebral Infarct Volume and Functional Outcomes</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We investigated a) the associations between pre-stroke aspirin use and thrombus burden, infarct volume, hemorrhagic transformation, early neurological deterioration (END), and functional outcome, and b) whether stroke subtypes modify these associations in first-ever ischemic stroke.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This multicenter MRI-based study included 5,700 consecutive patients with acute first-ever ischemic stroke, who did not undergo intravenous thrombolysis or endovascular thrombectomy, from May-2011 through February-2014. Propensity score-based augmented inverse probability weighting was performed to estimate adjusted effects of pre-stroke aspirin use.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The mean age was 67 years (41% women), and 15.9% (n = 907) were taking aspirin before stroke. Pre-stroke aspirin use (vs non-use) was significantly related to a reduced infarct volume (by 30%), particularly in large artery atherosclerosis stroke (by 45%). In cardioembolic stroke, pre-stroke aspirin use was associated with a ~ 50% lower incidence of END (adjusted difference [95% CI], −5.4% [−8.9 to −1.9]). Thus, pre-stroke aspirin use was associated with ~30% higher likelihood of favorable outcome (3-month modified Rankin Scale score &lt; 3), particularly in large artery atherosclerosis stroke and cardioembolic stroke (adjusted difference [95% CI], 7.2% [1.8 to 12.5] and 6.4% [1.7 to 11.1], respectively). Pre-stroke aspirin use (vs non-use) was associated with 85% less frequent cerebral thrombus-related susceptibility vessel sign (SVS) in large artery atherosclerosis stroke (adjusted difference [95% CI], −1.4% [−2.1 to −0.8], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and was associated with ~40% lower SVS-volumes, particularly in cardioembolic stroke (adjusted difference [95% CI], −0.16 cm<sup>3</sup> [−0.29 to −0.02], <i>p</i> = 0.03). Moreover, pre-stroke aspirin use was not significantly associated with hemorrhagic transformation (adjusted difference, −1.1%; <i>p</i> = 0.09).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Pre-stroke aspirin use associates with improved functional independence in patients with first-ever ischemic large arterial stroke by reducing infarct volume and/or END, likely by decreasing thrombus burden, without increased risk of hemorrhagic transformation.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>On behalf of the German Neurological Society (DGN), a study was conducted into how far former chairmen, honorary chairmen, and honorary members could be regarded as incriminated from the National Socialist period. While an online supplement of this journal presents seven individual biographies (in six papers) by way of example, this paper offers an overview summarizing the project results and introducing the biographies.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The first part and the methodological section discuss the difficulties of retrospectively identifying neurologists involved in the Nazi movement. Formal characteristics (eg, membership of the Nazi Party (NSDAP) or other Nazi organizations or participation in Nazi crimes) and content-related clues (eg, statements reflecting Nazi ideology, personal contacts with Nazi officials or active support of the system) can be helpful.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The second part summarizes the principal results of a study of 28 German and Austrian neuroscientists with regard to their involvement and their post-war careers. Six of the seven “founding fathers” of the DGN were former NSDAP members; 10 of the 13 presidents in office until 1976 had belonged to Nazi organizations—the NSDAP, the SA (“Brownshirts”) or the SS (“Blackshirts”). Moreover, seven out of 10 honorary presidents had formal or substantive links to National Socialism. Of the German and Austrian honorary members appointed up to 1985, two-thirds had leanings to Nazi ideology or the National Socialist system.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This paper concludes by outlining how the DGN and its members are currently addressing this historical legacy in order to establish a responsible culture of remembrance. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Two common and distinct forms of variation in human functional brain networks</a></h4>

              
                The cortex has a characteristic layout with specialized functional areas forming distributed large-scale networks. However, substantial work shows striking variation in this organization across people, which relates to differences in behavior. While a dominant assumption is that cortical 'variants' represent boundary shifts in the borders between regions, here we show that variants can also occur at a distance from their typical position, forming ectopic intrusions. Both forms of variants are common across individuals, but the forms differ in their location, network linkages, and activations during tasks. Sub-groups of individuals share similar variant properties, but sub-grouping on the two variant forms appears independent. This work argues that individual differences in brain organization commonly occur in two dissociable forms, border shifts and ectopic intrusions, that must be separately accounted for in the analysis of cortical systems across people. This work expands our knowledge of cortical variation in humans and helps reconceptualize the discussion of how cortical systems variability arises and links to individual differences in behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">CUX2 mutations in temporal lobe epilepsy; increased kainate susceptibility and excitatory input to hippocampus in deficient mice</a></h4>

              
                CUX2 gene encodes a transcription factor that controls neuronal proliferation, dendrite branching and synapse formation, locating at the epilepsy-associated chromosomal region 12q24 that we previously identified by a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in Japanese population. A CUX2 recurrent de novo variant p.E590K has been described in patients with rare epileptic encephalopathies and the gene is a candidate for the locus, however the mutation may not be enough to generate the genome-wide significance in the GWAS and whether CUX2 variants appear in other types of epilepsies and physiopathological mechanisms are remained to be investigated. Here in this study, we conducted targeted sequencings of CUX2, a paralog CUX1 and its short isoform CASP harboring a unique C-terminus on 271 Japanese patients with a variety of epilepsies, and found that multiple CUX2 missense variants, other than the p.E590K, and some CASP variants including a deletion, predominantly appeared in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Human cell culture and fly dendritic arborization analyses revealed loss-of- function properties for the CUX2 variants. Cux2- and Casp-specific knockout mice both showed high susceptibility to kainate, increased excitatory cell number in the entorhinal cortex, and significant enhancement in glutamatergic synaptic transmission to the hippocampus. CASP and CUX2 proteins physiologically bound to each other and co-expressed in excitatory neurons in brain regions including the entorhinal cortex. These results suggest that CUX2 and CASP variants contribute to the TLE pathology through a facilitation of excitatory synaptic transmission from entorhinal cortex to hippocampus.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Genetically engineered microglia-like cells have therapeutic potential for neurodegenerative disease</a></h4>

              
                Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell gene therapy (HSPC-GT) results in the engraftment of genetically modified microglia-like cells (MLCs) in the brain. While HSPC-GT has shown a clear neurological benefit in the clinic for specific rare diseases, the nature of MLC engraftment in the brain and the functional characteristics of MLCs remain contentious. Here we comprehensively characterized how different routes of administration affect the engraftment and biodistribution of genetically engineered HSPC-derivatives in mice. Using high-throughput single-cell profiling, we show that MLCs bear a transcriptional signature similar to resident microglia rather than invading macrophages. However, MLCs could clearly be distinguished from resident microglia by expression of a specific set of genes. Finally, in murine models of Parkinson's disease and frontotemporal dementia, we demonstrate that MLCs can provide therapeutically relevant levels of protein to the brain, thereby potentially opening avenues of HSPC-GT to address the underlying disease etiology of these and other similar disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transcriptional and translational regulation of pathogenesis in Alzheimer's disease model mice</a></h4>

              
                Background: Defining the cellular mechanisms that drive Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis and progression will be aided by studies defining how gene expression patterns change during pre-symptomatic AD and the ensuing periods of steadily declining cognition. Previous studies have emphasized changes in transcriptional regulation, but not translational regulation, leaving the ultimate results of gene expression alterations relatively unexplored in the context of AD. Objective: To identify genes whose expression might be regulated at the transcriptional, and especially at the translational levels in AD, we analyzed gene expression in cerebral cortex of two AD model mouse strains, CVN (APPSwDI;NOS2-/-) and Tg2576 (APPSw), and their companion wild type (WT) strains at 6 months of age by tandem RNA-Seq and Ribo-Seq (ribosome profiling). Methods: Identical starting pools of bulk RNA were used for RNA-Seq and Ribo-Seq. Differential gene expression analysis was performed at the transcriptional and translational levels separately, and also at the translational efficiency level. Regulated genes were functionally evaluated by gene ontology tools. Results: Compared to WT mice, AD model mice had similar levels of transcriptional regulation, but displayed differences in translational regulation. A specific microglial signature associated with early stages of A{beta} accumulation was up-regulated at both transcriptome and translatome levels in CVN mice. Although the two mice strains did not share many regulated genes, they showed common regulated pathways related to APP metabolism associated with neurotoxicity and neuroprotection. Conclusion: This work represents the first genome-wide study of brain translational regulation in animal models of AD, and provides evidence of a tight and early translational regulation of gene expression controlling the balance between neuroprotective and neurodegenerative processes in brain.

                Batten disease is unique among lysosomal storage disorders for the early and profound manifestation in the central nervous system, but little is known regarding potential neuron-specific roles for the disease-associated proteins. We demonstrate substantial overlap in the protein interactomes of three transmembrane Batten proteins (CLN3, CLN6, and CLN8), and that their absence leads to synaptic depletion of key partners (i.e. SNAREs and tethers) and aberrant synaptic SNARE dynamics in vivo, demonstrating a novel shared etiology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A CLN6-CRMP2-KLC4 complex regulates anterograde ER-derived vesicle trafficking in cortical neurites</a></h4>

              
                As neurons establish extensive connections throughout the central nervous system, the transport of cargo along the microtubule network of the axon is crucial for differentiation and homeostasis. Specifically, building blocks such as membrane and cytoskeletal components, organelles, transmembrane receptors, adhesion molecules, and peptide neurotransmitters all require proper transport to the presynaptic compartment. Here, we identify a novel complex regulating vesicular endoplasmic reticulum transport in neurites, composed of CLN6: an ER-associated protein of relatively unknown function implicated in CLN6-Batten disease; CRMP2: a tubulin binding protein important in regulating neurite microtubule dynamics; and KLC4: a classic transport motor protein. We show that this 'CCK' complex allows ER-derived vesicles to migrate to the distal end of the axon, aiding in proper neurite outgrowth and arborization. In the absence of CLN6, the CCK complex does not function effectively, leading to reduced vesicular transport, stunted neurite outgrowth, and deficits in CRMP2 binding to other protein partners. Treatment with a CRMP2 modulating compound, lanthionine ketimine ester, partially restores these deficits in CLN6-deficient mouse neurons, indicating that stabilization of CRMP2 interacting partners may prove beneficial in lieu of complete restoration of the CCK complex. Taken together, these findings reveal a novel mechanism of ER-derived vesicle transport in the axon and provide new insights into therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative disease.

                Laughter is a contagious prosocial signal that conveys bonding motivation; adult crying conversely communicates desire for social proximity by signalling distress. Endogenous mu-opioid receptors (MORs) modulate sociability in humans and non-human primates. In this combined PET-fMRI study (n=17) we tested whether central MOR tone is associated with regional brain responses to social signals of laughter and crying sounds. MOR availability was measured with positron emission tomography using high-affinity agonist radioligand [11C]carfentanil. Haemodynamic responses to social laughter and crying sounds were measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Social laughter evoked activation in the auditory cortex, insula, cingulate cortex, amygdala, primary and secondary somatosensory cortex, primary and secondary motor cortex; crying sounds led to more restricted activation in auditory cortex and nearby areas. MOR availability was negatively correlated with the haemodynamic responses to social laughter in primary and secondary somatosensory cortex, primary and secondary motor cortex, posterior insula, posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, cuneus, temporal gyri, and lingual gyrus. For crying-evoked activations, MOR availability was negatively correlated with medial and lateral prefrontal haemodynamic responses. Altogether our findings highlight the role of MOR system in modulating acute brain responses to both positive and negative social signals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Adropin confers neuroprotection and promotes functional recovery from ischemic stroke</a></h4>

              
                Adropin is a highly-conserved peptide that has been shown to preserve endothelial barrier function. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption is a key pathological event in cerebral ischemia. However, the effects of adropin on ischemic stroke outcomes remain unexplored. Hypothesizing that adropin exerts neuroprotective effects by maintaining BBB integrity, we investigated the role of adropin in stroke pathology utilizing loss- and gain-of-function genetic approaches combined with pharmacological treatment with synthetic adropin peptide. Stroke decreased endogenous adropin levels in the brain and plasma. Adropin treatment or transgenic adropin overexpression robustly reduced brain injury and improved long-term sensorimotor and cognitive function in young and aged mice subjected to ischemic stroke. In contrast, genetic deletion of adropin exacerbated ischemic brain injury. Mechanistically, adropin neuroprotection depends on endothelial nitric oxide synthase and is associated with reduced BBB permeability and neuroinflammation. We identify adropin as a novel neuroprotective peptide with the potential to improve stroke outcomes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Inter-species comparison of the orientation algorithm directing larval chemotaxis in the genus Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Animals differ in their appearances and behaviors. While many genetic studies have addressed the origins of phenotypic differences between fly species, we are still lacking a quantitative assessment of the variability in the way different fly species behave. We tackled this question in one of the most robust behaviors displayed by Drosophila: chemotaxis. At the larval stage, Drosophila melanogaster navigate odor gradients by combining four sensorimotor routines in a multilayered algorithm: a modulation of the overall locomotor speed and turn rate; a bias in turning during down-gradient motion; a bias in turning toward the gradient; the local curl of trajectories toward the gradient ("weathervaning"). Using high-resolution tracking and behavioral quantification, we characterized the olfactory behavior of eight closely related species of the Drosophila group in response to 19 ecologically-relevant odors. Significant changes are observed in the receptive field of each species, which is consistent with the rapid evolution of the peripheral olfactory system. Our results reveal substantial inter-species variability in the algorithms directing larval chemotaxis. While the basic sensorimotor routines are shared, their parametric arrangements can vary dramatically across species. The present analysis sets the stage for deciphering the evolutionary relationships between the structure and function of neural circuits directing orientation behaviors in Drosophila.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dual regulation of spine-specific and synapse-to-nucleus signaling by PKCδ during plasticity</a></h4>

              
                The activity-dependent plasticity of synapses is believed to be the cellular basis of learning. These synaptic changes are mediated through the coordination of local biochemical reactions in synapses and changes in gene transcription in the nucleus to modulate neuronal circuits and behavior. The protein kinase C (PKC) family of isozymes has long been established as critical for synaptic plasticity. However, due to a lack of suitable isozyme-specific tools, the role of the novel subfamily of PKC isozymes is largely unknown. Here, through the development of FLIM-FRET activity sensors, we investigate novel PKC isozymes in synaptic plasticity in mouse CA1 pyramidal neurons. We find that PKC{delta} is activated downstream of TrkB and that the spatiotemporal nature of its activation depends on the plasticity stimulation. In response to single spine plasticity, PKC{delta} is activated primarily in the stimulated spine and is required for local expression of plasticity. However, in response to multi-spine stimulation, a long-lasting and spreading activation of PKC{delta} scales with the number of spines stimulated and, by regulating CREB activity, couples spine plasticity to transcription in the nucleus. Thus, PKC{delta} plays a dual functional role in facilitating synaptic plasticity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Development of infants' neural speech processing and its relation to later language skills: an MEG study</a></h4>

              
                The 'sensitive period' for phonetic learning (~6-12 months) is one of the earliest milestones in language acquisition where infants start to become specialized in processing speech sounds in their native language. In the last decade, advancements in neuroimaging technologies for infants are starting to shed light on the underlying neural mechanisms supporting this important learning period. The current study reports on the largest longitudinal dataset to date with the aim to replicate and extend on two important questions: 1) what are the developmental changes during the 'sensitive period' for native and nonnative speech processing? 2) how does native and nonnative speech processing in infants predict later language outcomes? Fifty-four infants were recruited at 7 months of age and their neural processing of speech was measured using Magnetoencephalography (MEG). Specifically, the neural sensitivity to a native and a nonnative speech contrast was indexed by the mismatch response (MMR). They repeated the measurement again at 11 months of age and their language development was further tracked from 12 months to 30 months of age using the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (CDI). Using an a prior Region-of-Interest (ROI) approach, we observed significant increases for the Native MMR in the left inferior frontal region (IF) and superior temporal region (ST) from 7 to 11 months, but not for the Nonnative MMR. Complementary whole brain comparison revealed more widespread developmental changes for both contrasts. However, only individual differences in the left IF and ST for the Nonnative MMR at 11 months of age were significant predictors of individual vocabulary growth up to 30 months of age. An exploratory machine-learning based analysis further revealed that whole brain MMR for both Native and Nonnative contrasts can robustly predict later outcomes, but with very different underlying spatial-temporal patterns. The current study extends our current knowledge and suggests that native and nonnative speech processing may follow different developmental trajectories and utilize different mechanisms that are relevant for later language skills.

	<p>Introduction: This paper describes a case of bi-frontal vasogenic oedema associated with bilateral frontal lobe and left parietal lobe white matter lesions where extensive investigations, including brain biopsy, failed to establish a diagnosis. Case Report: A 67-year-old female presented with three weeks’ history of memory loss, fatigue, insomnia, nausea, and occasional dysphasia. Physical examination was unremarkable, yet cerebral CT and MRI showed bilateral frontal lobe vasogenic oedema. Extensive investigations, including: biochemical; radiological; immunological; microbiological; haematological; histopathological; and cytological, failed to establish a confirmed diagnosis. A multidisciplinary team could not achieve a consensus for this atypical presentation. Brain biopsy was unusual, showing destructive inflammatory and subtly granulomatous disease, but an exhaustive list of auxiliary tests could not confirm a cause, and consensus favoured glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) autoimmune encephalopathy. Discussion: A definitive diagnosis could not be established for this patient despite a gamut of investigations. Although some of the presenting features were consistent with GFAP astrocytopathy, initial staining of the patient’s CSF for neuronal antibodies was negative. Her symptoms and radiological changes of brain imaging improved without any corticosteroid therapy. Conclusions: Through this case report, the aim is to add to the repository of neurological sciences in the hope that future similar presentations could potentially lead to discovery of a new aetiology or contribute towards better understanding of an existing disease process.</p>

	<p>Although fatigue is one of the most disabling symptoms of MS, its pathogenesis is not well understood yet. This study aims to introduce a new holistic approach to measure fatigue and its influencing factors via a mobile app. Fatigue is measured with different patient-reported outcome measures (Visual Analog Scale, Fatigue Severity Scale) and tests (Symbol Digit Modalities Test). The influencing vital and environmental factors are captured with a smartwatch and phone sensors. Patients can track these factors within the app. To individually counteract their fatigue, a fatigue course, based on the current treatment guidelines, was implemented. The course implies knowledge about fatigue and MS, exercises, energy-conservation management, and cognitive behavioral therapy. Based on the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change, the design of the Fimo health app follows the ten strategies of the process of change, which is a proven approach to designing health intervention programs. By monitoring fatigue and individual influencing factors, patients can better understand and manage their fatigue. They can share their data and insights about fatigue and its influencing factors with their doctors. Thus, they can receive individualized therapies and drug plans.</p>

	<p>Since ancient times, animal models have provided fundamental information in medical knowledge. This also applies for discoveries in the field of inherited peripheral neuropathies (IPNs), where they have been instrumental for our understanding of nerve development, pathogenesis of neuropathy, molecules and pathways involved and to design potential therapies. In this review, we briefly describe how animal models have been used in ancient medicine until the use of rodents as the prevalent model in present times. We then travel along different examples of how rodents have been used to improve our understanding of IPNs. We do not intend to describe all discoveries and animal models developed for IPNs, but just to touch on a few arbitrary and paradigmatic examples, taken from our direct experience or from literature. The idea is to show how strategies have been developed to finally arrive to possible treatments for IPNs.</p>

	<p>This is a study of the collocation of Chinese verbs with different lexical aspects and aspect markers. Using event-related potentials (ERPs), we explored the processing of aspect violation sentences. In the experiment, we combined verbs of various lexical aspect types with the progressive aspect marker zhe, and the combination of the achievement verbs and the progressive aspect marker zhe constituted the sentence’s aspect violation. The participants needed to judge whether a sentence was correct after it was presented. Finally, we observed and analyzed the components of ERPs. The results suggest that when the collocation of aspect markers and lexical aspect is ungrammatical, the N400-like and P600 are elicited on aspect markers, while the late AN is elicited by the word after the aspect marker. P600 and N400-like show that the collocation of Chinese verbs with various lexical aspects and aspect markers involve not only syntactic processing, but also the semantic processing; and the late AN may have been due to the syntax revision and the conclusion at the end of sentences.</p>

	<p>The secondary impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are distress triggers and risk factors for mental health. Conversely, self-compassion skills and compassionate thoughts/behaviors towards suffering may contribute to their alleviation. Both psychological constructs are interrelated in life-threatening diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). The Teruel Study retrospectively evaluated the impact of strict confinement on the 44 people with MS of this Spanish province and 24 caregivers, specifically assessing (1) fears and perceptions; (2) self-compassion (people with MS) and compassion (caregivers); (3) physical and mental health, and fatigue. Despite better housing conditions, people with MS considered confinement very difficult to handle, more than their caregivers, but they were less afraid of COVID-19 and worsening of MS. Still, they recognized worse health than before confinement. Reclusion and lack of walks were the worst of confinement. Caregivers also referred to lack of leisure and uncertainty–fear. All agreed the best was staying with the family, but some found ‘nothing’ positive. Self-compassion remained moderate–high and strongly correlated with their moderate levels of social function, vitality, physical role, and global health. Physical and cognitive fatigue scores were high, and self-compassion negatively correlated with them, explaining a 19% variance in global health. The high compassion of the caregivers did not correlate with any variable.</p>

	<p>Background. Motor imagery engages much of the same neural circuits as an overt movement. Therefore, the mental rehearsal of movements is often used to supplement physical training and might aid motor neurorehabilitation after stroke. One attempt to capture the brain’s involvement in imagery involves the use, as a marker, of the depression or event-related desynchronization (ERD) of thalamocortical sensorimotor rhythms found in a human electroencephalogram (EEG). Using fast real-time processing, it is possible to make the subject aware of their own brain reactions or—even better—to turn them into actions through a technology called the brain–computer interface (BCI). However, it remains unclear whether BCI-enabled imagery facilitates a stronger or qualitatively different brain response compared to the open-loop training. Methods. Seven healthy volunteers who were experienced in both closed and open-loop motor imagery took part in six experimental sessions over a period of 4.5 months, in which they performed kinesthetic imagery of a previously known set of finger and arm movements with simultaneous 30-channel EEG acquisition. The first and the last session mostly consisted of feedback trials in which the subjects were presented with the classification results of the EEG patterns in real time; during the other sessions, no feedback was provided. Spatiotemporal and amplitude features of the ERD patterns concomitant with imagery were compared across experimental days and between feedback conditions using linear mixed-effects modeling. Results. The main spatial sources of ERD appeared to be highly stable across the six experimental days, remaining nearly identical in five of seven subjects (Pearson’s ρ &amp;amp;gt; 0.94). Only in one subject did the spatial pattern of activation statistically significantly differ (p = 0.009) between the feedback and no-feedback conditions. Real-time visual feedback delivered through the BCI did not significantly increase the ERD strength. Conclusion. The results imply that the potential benefits of MI could be yielded by well-habituated subjects with a simplified open-loop setup, e.g., through at-home self-practice.</p>

	<p>A substantial amount of amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulates in the occipital cortices; however, it draws less attention. We investigated the clinical implications of Aβ accumulation in the occipital lobes in the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) continuum. [18F]-Florbetaben amyloid PET scans were performed in a total of 121 AD or amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients. Of the 121 patients, 74 Aβ positive patients were divided into occipital Aβ positive (OCC+) and occipital Aβ negative (OCC−) groups based on Aβ accumulation in the bilateral occipital lobes. The OCC+ group (41/74, 55.4%) was younger and had a younger age at onset than the OCC− group. The OCC+ group also had an increased standard uptake value ratio in the occipital lobes and greater cortical thinning in relevant areas. The OCC+ group had a higher global deterioration scale, lower performance for the copy, immediate recall, delayed recall, and recognition in Rey–Osterrieth Complex Figure tests than the OCC- group, although both groups had similar disease durations. AD or aMCI patients in the OCC+ group exhibited features noted in early onset AD with relevant neuropsychological and image findings. Occipital Aβ positivity in amyloid PET scans need to be considered as an underestimated marker of early onset AD continuum.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is an inherited neurological disease defined by progressive movement incoordination. We undertook a comprehensive characterization of the spatial profile and progressive evolution of structural brain abnormalities in people with FRDA.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A coordinated international analysis of regional brain volume using magnetic resonance imaging data charted the whole-brain profile, interindividual variability, and temporal staging of structural brain differences in 248 individuals with FRDA and 262 healthy controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The brainstem, dentate nucleus region, and superior and inferior cerebellar peduncles showed the greatest reductions in volume relative to controls (Cohen <i>d</i> = 1.5–2.6). Cerebellar gray matter alterations were most pronounced in lobules I–VI (<i>d</i> = 0.8), whereas cerebral differences occurred most prominently in precentral gyri (<i>d</i> = 0.6) and corticospinal tracts (<i>d</i> = 1.4). Earlier onset age predicted less volume in the motor cerebellum (<i>r</i>
<sub>
   <i>max</i>
</sub> = 0.35) and peduncles (<i>r</i>
<sub>
   <i>max</i>
</sub> = 0.36). Disease duration and severity correlated with volume deficits in the dentate nucleus region, brainstem, and superior/inferior cerebellar peduncles (<i>r</i>
<sub>
   <i>max</i>
</sub> = −0.49); subgrouping showed these to be robust and early features of FRDA, and strong candidates for further biomarker validation. Cerebral white matter abnormalities, particularly in corticospinal pathways, emerge as intermediate disease features. Cerebellar and cerebral gray matter loss, principally targeting motor and sensory systems, preferentially manifests later in the disease course.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>FRDA is defined by an evolving spatial profile of neuroanatomical changes beyond primary pathology in the cerebellum and spinal cord, in line with its progressive clinical course. The design, interpretation, and generalization of research studies and clinical trials must consider neuroanatomical staging and associated interindividual variability in brain measures.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Parkinson's disease (PD) manifests in motor dysfunction, non-motor symptoms, and eventual dementia (PDD). Neuropathological hallmarks include nigrostriatal neurodegeneration, Lewy body (LB) pathology, and neuroinflammation. Alpha-synuclein (α-syn), a primary component of LBs, is implicated in PD pathogenesis, accumulating, and aggregating in both familial and sporadic PD. However, as α-syn pathology is often comorbid with amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and phosphorylated tau (pTau) tangles in PDD, it is still unclear whether α-syn is the primary cause of neurodegeneration in sporadic PDD. We aimed to determine how the absence of α-syn would affect PDD manifestation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>IFN-β knockout (<i>Ifnb</i>
<sup>
   <i>−/−</i>
</sup>) mice spontaneously develop progressive behavior abnormalities and neuropathology resembling PDD, notably with α-syn<sup>+</sup> LBs. We generated <i>Ifnb/Snca</i> double knockout (DKO) mice and evaluated their behavior and neuropathology compared with wild-type (Wt), <i>Ifnb</i>
<sup>
   <i>−/−</i>
</sup>, and <i>Snca</i>
<sup>
   <i>−/−</i>
</sup> mice using immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, immunoblots, qPCR, and modification of neuronal signaling.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><i>Ifnb/Snca</i> DKO mice developed all clinical PDD-like behavioral manifestations induced by IFN-β loss. Independently of α-syn expression, lack of IFN-β alone induced Aβ plaques, pTau tangles, and LB-like Aβ<sup>+</sup>/pTau<sup>+</sup> inclusion bodies and neuroinflammation. IFN-β loss caused significant elevated glial and neuronal TNF-α and neuronal TNFR1, associated with neurodegeneration. Restoring neuronal IFN-β signaling or blocking TNFR1 rescued caspase 3/t-BID-mediated neuronal-death through upregulation of c-FLIP<sub>S</sub> and lowered intraneuronal Aβ and pTau accumulation.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings increase our understanding of PD pathology and suggest that targeting α-syn alone is not sufficient to mitigate disease. Targeting specific aspects of neuroinflammation, such as aberrant neuronal TNF-α/TNFR1 or IFN-β/IFNAR signaling, may attenuate disease. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

                Hypercoagulation is a hallmark of both the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). It increases the risk for vascular thrombosis, including peripheral artery diseases. Among others, acute limb ischemia (ALI) is one of most common complications that requires immediate and prompt treatments to reduce morbidity and mortality. However, the complex interplay between COVID-19, T2DM and its complications (e.g., diabetic nephropathy), and ALI creates a great challenge in the management of the disease. Here, we present a case of a 59-year-old diabetic female with progressive pain in her left leg in the last five years, which was significantly intensified following COVID-19 diagnosis. Bluish coloration, numbness and functional impairments were observed during examinations with no palpable pulsation on left posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries. The patient also had diabetic nephropathy (stage III), hypoalbuminemia, anemia and a urinary tract infection that complicated the management of the disease. Due to the excruciating pain and the worsening of the limb conditions, right leg revascularization and left leg amputation were performed at day 14 after admission. Following the surgeries, no more pain was observed and patient was discharged for further follow-up at the outpatient clinic.

                <p>by Hidenori Tanaka, Jason F. Kreisberg, Trey Ideker</p>

Despite the growing constellation of genetic loci linked to common traits, these loci have yet to account for most heritable variation, and most act through poorly understood mechanisms. Recent machine learning (ML) systems have used hierarchical biological knowledge to associate genetic mutations with phenotypic outcomes, yielding substantial predictive power and mechanistic insight. Here, we use an ontology-guided ML system to map single nucleotide variants (SNVs) focusing on 6 classic phenotypic traits in natural yeast populations. The 29 identified loci are largely novel and account for ~17% of the phenotypic variance, versus <3% for standard genetic analysis. Representative results show that sensitivity to hydroxyurea is linked to SNVs in two alternative purine biosynthesis pathways, and that sensitivity to copper arises through failure to detoxify reactive oxygen species in fatty acid metabolism. This work demonstrates a knowledge-based approach to amplifying and interpreting signals in population genetic studies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Inactivation mode of sodium channels defines the different maximal firing rates of conventional versus atypical midbrain dopamine neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Christopher J. Knowlton, Tabea Ines Ziouziou, Niklas Hammer, Jochen Roeper, Carmen C. Canavier</p>

Two subpopulations of midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons are known to have different dynamic firing ranges <i>in vitro</i> that correspond to distinct projection targets: the originally identified conventional DA neurons project to the dorsal striatum and the lateral shell of the nucleus accumbens, whereas an atypical DA population with higher maximum firing frequencies projects to prefrontal regions and other limbic regions including the medial shell of nucleus accumbens. Using a computational model, we show that previously identified differences in biophysical properties do not fully account for the larger dynamic range of the atypical population and predict that the major difference is that originally identified conventional cells have larger occupancy of voltage-gated sodium channels in a long-term inactivated state that recovers slowly; stronger sodium and potassium conductances during action potential firing are also predicted for the conventional compared to the atypical DA population. These differences in sodium channel gating imply that longer intervals between spikes are required in the conventional population for full recovery from long-term inactivation induced by the preceding spike, hence the lower maximum frequency. These same differences can also change the bifurcation structure to account for distinct modes of entry into depolarization block: abrupt versus gradual. The model predicted that in cells that have entered depolarization block, it is much more likely that an additional depolarization can evoke an action potential in conventional DA population. New experiments comparing lateral to medial shell projecting neurons confirmed this model prediction, with implications for differential synaptic integration in the two populations.

The human brain tracks amplitude fluctuations of both speech and music, which reflects acoustic processing in addition to the encoding of higher-order features and one’s cognitive state. Comparing neural tracking of speech and music envelopes can elucidate stimulus-general mechanisms, but direct comparisons are confounded by differences in their envelope spectra. Here, we use a novel method of frequency-constrained reconstruction of stimulus envelopes using EEG recorded during passive listening. We expected to see music reconstruction match speech in a narrow range of frequencies, but instead we found that speech was reconstructed better than music for all frequencies we examined. Additionally, models trained on all stimulus types performed as well or better than the stimulus-specific models at higher modulation frequencies, suggesting a common neural mechanism for tracking speech and music. However, speech envelope tracking at low frequencies, below 1 Hz, was associated with increased weighting over parietal channels, which was not present for the other stimuli. Our results highlight the importance of low-frequency speech tracking and suggest an origin from speech-specific processing in the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis of COVID-19 exit strategies in an individual-based transmission model</a></h4>

Many countries are currently dealing with the COVID-19 epidemic and are searching for an exit strategy such that life in society can return to normal. To support this search, computational models are used to predict the spread of the virus and to assess the efficacy of policy measures before actual implementation. The model output has to be interpreted carefully though, as computational models are subject to uncertainties. These can stem from, e.g., limited knowledge about input parameters values or from the intrinsic stochastic nature of some computational models. They lead to uncertainties in the model predictions, raising the question what distribution of values the model produces for key indicators of the severity of the epidemic. Here we show how to tackle this question using techniques for uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis. We assess the uncertainties and sensitivities of four exit strategies implemented in an agent-based transmission model with geographical stratification. The exit strategies are termed Flattening the Curve, Contact Tracing, Intermittent Lockdown and Phased Opening. We consider two key indicators of the ability of exit strategies to avoid catastrophic health care overload: the maximum number of prevalent cases in intensive care (IC), and the total number of IC patient-days in excess of IC bed capacity. Our results show that uncertainties not directly related to the exit strategies are secondary, although they should still be considered in comprehensive analysis intended to inform policy makers. The sensitivity analysis discloses the crucial role of the intervention uptake by the population and of the capability to trace infected individuals. Finally, we explore the existence of a safe operating space. For Intermittent Lockdown we find only a small region in the model parameter space where the key indicators of the model stay within safe bounds, whereas this region is larger for the other exit strategies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">STDP and the distribution of preferred phases in the whisker system</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nimrod Sherf, Maoz Shamir</p>

Rats and mice use their whiskers to probe the environment. By rhythmically swiping their whiskers back and forth they can detect the existence of an object, locate it, and identify its texture. Localization can be accomplished by inferring the whisker’s position. Rhythmic neurons that track the phase of the whisking cycle encode information about the azimuthal location of the whisker. These neurons are characterized by preferred phases of firing that are narrowly distributed. Consequently, pooling the rhythmic signal from several upstream neurons is expected to result in a much narrower distribution of preferred phases in the downstream population, which however has not been observed empirically. Here, we show how spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) can provide a solution to this conundrum. We investigated the effect of STDP on the utility of a neural population to transmit rhythmic information downstream using the framework of a modeling study. We found that under a wide range of parameters, STDP facilitated the transfer of rhythmic information despite the fact that all the synaptic weights remained dynamic. As a result, the preferred phase of the downstream neuron was not fixed, but rather drifted in time at a drift velocity that depended on the preferred phase, thus inducing a distribution of preferred phases. We further analyzed how the STDP rule governs the distribution of preferred phases in the downstream population. This link between the STDP rule and the distribution of preferred phases constitutes a natural test for our theory.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Hierarchy and control of ageing-related methylation networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Gergely Palla, Péter Pollner, Judit Börcsök, András Major, Béla Molnár, István Csabai</p>

DNA methylation provides one of the most widely studied biomarkers of ageing. Since the methylation of CpG dinucleotides function as switches in cellular mechanisms, it is plausible to assume that by proper adjustment of these switches age may be tuned. Though, adjusting hundreds of CpG methylation levels coherently may never be feasible and changing just a few positions may lead to biologically unstable state.
A prominent example of methylation-based age estimators is provided by Horvath’s clock, based on 353 CpG dinucleotides, showing a high correlation (not necessarily causation) with chronological age across multiple tissue types. On this small subset of CpG dinucleotides we demonstrate how the adjustment of one methylation level leads to a cascade of changes at other sites. Among the studied subset, we locate the most important CpGs (and related genes) that may have a large influence on the rest of the sub-system. According to our analysis, the structure of this network is way more hierarchical compared to what one would expect based on ensembles of uncorrelated connections. Therefore, only a handful of CpGs is enough to modify the system towards a desired state.
When propagation of the change over the network is taken into account, the resulting modification in the predicted age can be significantly larger compared to the effect of isolated CpG perturbations. By adjusting the most influential single CpG site and following the propagation of methylation level changes we can reach up to 5.74 years in virtual age reduction, significantly larger than without taking into account of the network control. Extending our approach to the whole methylation network may identify key nodes that have controller role in the ageing process.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Transcriptomic entropy benchmarks stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte maturation against endogenous tissue at single cell level</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Suraj Kannan, Michael Farid, Brian L. Lin, Matthew Miyamoto, Chulan Kwon</p>

The immaturity of pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived tissues has emerged as a universal problem for their biomedical applications. While efforts have been made to generate adult-like cells from PSCs, direct benchmarking of PSC-derived tissues against <i>in vivo</i> development has not been established. Thus, maturation status is often assessed on an <i>ad-hoc</i> basis. Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers a promising solution, though cross-study comparison is limited by dataset-specific batch effects. Here, we developed a novel approach to quantify PSC-derived cardiomyocyte (CM) maturation through transcriptomic entropy. Transcriptomic entropy is robust across datasets regardless of differences in isolation protocols, library preparation, and other potential batch effects. With this new model, we analyzed over 45 scRNA-seq datasets and over 52,000 CMs, and established a cross-study, cross-species CM maturation reference. This reference enabled us to directly compare PSC-CMs with the <i>in vivo</i> developmental trajectory and thereby to quantify PSC-CM maturation status. We further found that our entropy-based approach can be used for other cell types, including pancreatic beta cells and hepatocytes. Our study presents a biologically relevant and interpretable metric for quantifying PSC-derived tissue maturation, and is extensible to numerous tissue engineering contexts.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Adaptation supports short-term memory in a visual change detection task</a></h4>

The maintenance of short-term memories is critical for survival in a dynamically changing world. Previous studies suggest that this memory can be stored in the form of persistent neural activity or using a synaptic mechanism, such as with short-term plasticity. Here, we compare the predictions of these two mechanisms to neural and behavioral measurements in a visual change detection task. Mice were trained to respond to changes in a repeated sequence of natural images while neural activity was recorded using two-photon calcium imaging. We also trained two types of artificial neural networks on the same change detection task as the mice. Following fixed pre-processing using a pretrained convolutional neural network, either a recurrent neural network (RNN) or a feedforward neural network with short-term synaptic depression (STPNet) was trained to the same level of performance as the mice. While both networks are able to learn the task, the STPNet model contains units whose activity are more similar to the <i>in vivo</i> data and produces errors which are more similar to the mice. When images are omitted, an unexpected perturbation which was absent during training, mice often do not respond to the omission but are more likely to respond to the subsequent image. Unlike the RNN model, STPNet produces a similar pattern of behavior. These results suggest that simple neural adaptation mechanisms may serve as an important bottom-up memory signal in this task, which can be used by downstream areas in the decision-making process.

                Background: Biomarkers are measurable indicators of normal biological processes, which provide an objective assessment of the physiologic state of living systems. Saliva contains several biomarkers that serve as a diagnostic tool in health and disease. Evaluation of a multitude of salivary components could potentially predict the clinical outcome. This is especially critical in a chronic, potentially life-threatening condition like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Scrupulous evaluation of relevant biomarkers could facilitate the early detection of HIV, determine the stage of infection and monitor the disease progression. Currently, there is a paucity of validated biomarkers in saliva predicting the disease progression in people living with HIV. In this scoping review, we aim to provide an overview of the available evidence on salivary markers associated with the progression of disease in people living with HIV. Methods: The authors shall develop a tailored search strategy for each database using relevant keywords. We will search for eligible studies indexed in the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and gray literature. We will restrict the search to studies published in the English language. Following deduplication, all search results will be exported to the EPPI reviewer web, where two independent reviewers using a data extraction tool developed and pretested by the review authors will screen eligible studies. The result of this review will be reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist and reporting guidelines. Discussion: The proposed scoping review protocol will enable the identification and assessment of salivary biomarkers, which can predict disease progression in patients with HIV infection. The synthesis of evidence from this review will assist in improving our current understanding of biomarkers used to evaluate the progression of HIV infection.

                Background: Occupational contact with dust particles is a well-known phenomenon, particularly in developing countries of the world. Crystalline silica present in marble dust is the main etiology of a rising prevalence of obstructive lung diseases in marble stone workers, who are in direct contact with marble dust in the surrounding environment during their regular work.  The purpose of this study was to compare the pulmonary function parameters of workers in marble workshops and age matched healthy individuals in the Lahore District of Pakistan. Methods: The study included 164 male individuals, 82 individuals working in marble workshops and 82 healthy individuals from the same community. Data were collected through in-person interviews using a structured questionnaire after obtaining written consent. A Spiro Lab spirometry for pulmonary function tests was used to identify any change in the lung function parameters. FVC% (forced vital capacity), FEV 1 (forced expiratory volume in first second) and FEV1 / FVC ratio were evaluated. Results: Mean age in the exposed group (marble workers) and non-exposed group (healthy individuals) were 29.92 ± 6.19 and 30.58 ± 6.37 years, respectively. The mean years of work experience of the exposed group was 11.92 ± 5.67 years. A statistically insignificant difference was observed between marble exposed workers & healthy individuals from the demographic variables. Lung function parameters in marble workers exhibited a highly significant (P < 0.001) decrease in FVC%, FEV1 & FEV1 / FVC ratio when compared to healthy individuals. Seventy-one percent of marble workers had abnormal pulmonary parameters whereas 34% of workers had restrictive pulmonary impairment. Marble workers who had worked for more than 15 years had a highly significant risk of developing abnormal pulmonary function (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Continuous exposure to marble dust deteriorates the lung function of marble workers.

                Background: A recommender system captures the user preferences and behaviour to provide a relevant recommendation to the user. In a hybrid model-based recommender system, it requires a pre-trained data model to generate recommendations for a user. Ontology helps to represent the semantic information and relationships to model the expressivity and linkage among the data. Methods: We enhanced the matrix factorization model accuracy by utilizing ontology to enrich the information of the user-item matrix by integrating the item-based and user-based collaborative filtering techniques. In particular, the combination of enriched data, which consists of semantic similarity together with rating pattern, will help to reduce the cold start problem in the model-based recommender system. When the new user or item first coming into the system, we have the user demographic or item profile that linked to our ontology. Thus, semantic similarity can be calculated during the item-based and user-based collaborating filtering process. The item-based and user-based filtering process are used to predict the unknown rating of the original matrix. Results: Experimental evaluations have been carried out on the MovieLens 100k dataset to demonstrate the accuracy rate of our proposed approach as compared to the baseline method using (i) Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and (ii) combination of item-based collaborative filtering technique with SVD. Experimental results demonstrated that our proposed method has reduced the data sparsity from 0.9542% to 0.8435%. In addition, it also indicated that our proposed method has achieved better accuracy with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.9298, as compared to the baseline method (RMSE: 0.9642) and the existing method (RMSE: 0.9492). Conclusions: Our proposed method enhanced the dataset information by integrating user-based and item-based collaborative filtering techniques. The experiment results shows that our system has reduced the data sparsity and has better accuracy as compared to baseline method and existing method.

                Despite the intervention of WHO on vaccination for reducing the spread of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), there are records of the high prevalence of HBV in some regions. In this paper, a mathematical model was formulated to analyze the acquisition and transmission process of the virus with the view of identifying the possible way of reducing the menace and mitigating the risk of the virus. The models' positivity and boundedness were demonstrated using well-known theorems. Equating the differential equations to zero demonstrates the equilibria of the solutions i.e., the disease-free and endemic equilibrium. The next Generation Matrix method was used to compute the basic reproduction number for the models. Local and global stabilities of the models were shown via linearization and Lyapunov function methods respectively. The importance of testing and treatment on the dynamics of HBV were fully discussed in this paper. It was discovered that testing at the acute stage of the virus and chronic unaware state helps in better management of the virus.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Association between maternal antenatal care visits and newborn low birth weight in Bangladesh: a national representative survey [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Low Birth Weight (LBW) is a global health concern for childhood mortality and morbidity. The objectives of this study were to assess the association between the number of Antenatal Care Visits (ANC) and LBW among Bangladeshi newborns, and to identify the demographic and socio-economic predictors of LBW.   Methods: Our present cross-sectional study is based on the secondary data of the Bangladesh Demography and Health Survey (BDHS) 2014. Complete data of 4,235 (weighted) mother-child pairs were included in the analysis.   Results: The overall prevalence of LBW among newborns were found to be 19.3% (95% CI: 17.8-20.9). Among the mothers who received antenatal care services 1-3 times during pregnancy, 35% had less possibility of having LBW babies [COR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.50-0.85]. The association remained significant after adjusting the analysis with the sex of the newborn, administrative regions (division), maternal educational status, mother’s weight status and fathers’ occupation [AOR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.55-0.99]. Additionally, the sex of the newborn, division, maternal education, maternal weight status, and fathers’ occupational status were found to be significantly associated with LBW.   Conclusion: Increasing the coverage of antenatal services and enabling mothers to receive quality antenatal services may substantially contribute to reducing the prevalence of LBW in Bangladesh.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">A dopamine gradient controls access to distributed working memory in the large-scale monkey cortex</a></h4>

              
                Little is known about how dopamine outside of the prefrontal cortex affects working memory. Froudist-Walsh et al. identify a gradient of dopamine receptors in the macaque cortex and use this to build a large-scale computational cortex model. A gradient of cortical dopamine modulation provides a parsimonious explanation for diverse findings in the literature.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.nature.com/ncomms/rss/current">ADAR-mediated RNA editing of DNA:RNA hybrids is required for DNA double strand break repair</a></h4>

              
                <p>Nature Communications, Published online: 17 September 2021; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25790-2">doi:10.1038/s41467-021-25790-2</a></p>Different roles of specific RNA-related factors in DNA repair have now been reported. Here the authors reveal a role for RNA-editing by ADAR in DNA end resection following double strand break formation and a change in pattern of ADAR2-mediated A-to-I editing.
