Theta rhythms govern rodent sniffing and whisking, and human language processing. Human psychophysics suggests a role for theta also in visual attention. However, little is known about theta in visual areas and its attentional modulation. We used electrocorticography (ECoG) to record local field potentials (LFPs) simultaneously from areas V1, V2,...<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/hsm1FIi0O7E" width="1" />

Various forms of synaptic plasticity underlie aspects of learning and memory. Synaptic augmentation is a form of short-term plasticity characterized by synaptic enhancement that persists for seconds following specific patterns of stimulation. The mechanisms underlying this form of plasticity are unclear but are thought to involve residual presynaptic Ca2+.

Abstract
<p>Protein interacting with C-kinase 1 (PICK1) is a widely expressed scaffold protein known to interact via its PSD-95/discs-large/ZO-1 (PDZ)-domain with several membrane proteins including the dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT), the primary target for cocaine’s reinforcing actions. Here, we establish the importance of PICK1 for behavioral effects observed after both acute and repeated administration of cocaine. In PICK1 knock-out (KO) mice, the acute locomotor response to a single injection of cocaine was markedly attenuated. Moreover, in support of a role for PICK1 in neuroadaptive changes induced by cocaine, we observed diminished cocaine intake in a self-administration paradigm. Reduced behavioral effects of cocaine were not associated with decreased striatal DAT distribution and most likely not caused by the ~30% reduction in synaptosomal DA uptake observed in PICK1 KO mice. The PICK1 KO mice demonstrated preserved behavioral responses to DA receptor agonists supporting intact downstream DA receptor signaling. Unexpectedly, we found a prominent increase in striatal DA content and levels of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in PICK1 KO mice. Chronoamperometric recordings showed enhanced DA release in PICK1 KO mice, consistent with increased striatal DA pools. Viral-mediated knock-down (KD) of PICK1 in cultured dopaminergic neurons increased TH expression, supporting a direct cellular effect of PICK1. In summary, in addition to demonstrating a key role of PICK1 in mediating behavioral effects of cocaine, our data reveal a so far unappreciated role of PICK1 in DA homeostasis that possibly involves negative regulation of striatal TH levels.</p>

Abstract
<p>Interconnections between the olfactory bulb and the amygdala are a major pathway for triggering strong behavioral responses to a variety of odorants. However, while this broad mapping has been established, the patterns of amygdala feedback connectivity and the influence on olfactory circuitry remain unknown. Here, using a combination of neuronal tracing approaches, we dissect the connectivity of a cortical amygdala [posteromedial cortical nucleus (PmCo)] feedback circuit innervating the mouse accessory olfactory bulb. Optogenetic activation of PmCo feedback mainly results in feedforward mitral cell (MC) inhibition through direct excitation of GABAergic granule cells. In addition, LED-driven activity of corticofugal afferents increases the gain of MC responses to olfactory nerve stimulation. Thus, through corticofugal pathways, the PmCo likely regulates primary olfactory and social odor processing.</p>

<p>The heterotrimeric G-protein transducin mediates visual signaling in vertebrate photoreceptor cells. Many aspects of the function of transducin were learned from knock-out mice lacking its individual subunits. Of particular interest is the knockout of its rod-specific -subunit (G<sub>1</sub>). Two studies using independently generated mice documented that this knockout results in a considerable &gt;60-fold reduction in the light sensitivity of affected rods, but provided different interpretations of how the remaining α-subunit (Gα<sub>t</sub>) mediates phototransduction without its cognate Gβ<sub>1</sub><sub>1</sub>-subunit partner. One study found that the light sensitivity reduction matched a corresponding reduction in Gα<sub>t</sub> content in the light-sensing rod outer segments and proposed that Gα<sub>t</sub> activation is supported by remaining Gβ<sub>1</sub> associating with other G subunits naturally expressed in photoreceptors. In contrast, the second study reported the same light sensitivity loss but a much lower, only approximately sixfold, reduction of Gα<sub>t</sub> and proposed that the light responses of these rods do not require Gβ at all. To resolve this controversy and elucidate the mechanism driving visual signaling in G<sub>1</sub> knock-out rods, we analyzed both mouse lines side by side. We first determined that the outer segments of both mice have identical Gα<sub>t</sub> content, which is reduced ~65-fold from the wild-type (WT) level. We further demonstrated that the remaining Gβ<sub>1</sub> is present in a complex with endogenous G<sub>2</sub> and G<sub>3</sub> subunits and that these complexes exist in wild-type rods as well. Together, these results argue against the idea that Gα<sub>t</sub> alone supports light responses of G<sub>1</sub> knock-out rods and suggest that Gβ<sub>1</sub><sub>1</sub> is not unique in its ability to mediate vertebrate phototransduction.</p>

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Ngang Heok   Tang, Yishi   Jin<br /> Development of a neuron critically depends on the organization of its cytoskeleton. Cytoskeletal components, such as tubulins and actins, have the remarkable ability to organize themselves into filaments and networks to support specialized and compartmentalized functions. Alterations in cytoskeletal proteins have long been associated with a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders. This review focuses on recent findings, primarily from forward genetic screens in Caenorhabditis elegans that illustrate how different tubulin protein isotypes can play distinct roles in neuronal development and function. Additionally, we discuss studies revealing new regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, and highlight recent technological advances in in vivo imaging and functional dissection of the neuronal cytoskeleton. <br /><br />

Publication date: October 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 52<br />     Author(s): Manuel   Valero, Liset Menendez   de la Prida<br /> Understanding how the brain represents events is a fundamental question in neuroscience. The entorhinal–hippocampal system is central to such representations, which are severely compromised in some neurological diseases. In spite of much progress, a comprehensive, integrated view of spatial, temporal and other aspects of episodic representation remains elusive. Here, we review recent data on the role of cell-type specific entorhinal inputs which excite deep and superficial CA1 pyramidal cells by direct and indirect pathways. We discuss how an entorhinal dialogue with deep-superficial CA1 cells can multiplex neuronal activity along theta phases and how their reactivation may be segregated during sharp-wave ripples. Thus, deep and superficial CA1 sublayers provide substrate for general hippocampal function. <br /> <h3 class="h3">Graphical abstract</h3> <img alt="image" height="159" src="http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959438817302994-fx1.jpg" width="301" /><br />

Publication date: October 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 52<br />     Author(s): Yutaka   Yoshida, Tadashi   Isa<br /> An ability to control dexterous hand movements is considered to parallel the evolutionary development of the corticospinal tract and the appearance of direct connections between corticospinal neurons and motoneurons (the corticomotoneuronal (CM) pathway), which developed uniquely in higher primates. However, recent studies have revealed that some non-primate animal species have higher levels of dexterity than previously supposed, and in higher primates, various indirect non-CM descending pathways have been shown to participate in the control of dexterous movements. More recently, the CM pathway was shown to exist in rodents during early development, suggesting that rodents and primates diverged in their reliance on the CM pathway at some point in evolution, thus challenging the traditional view of the sequential development of hand control from rodents to primates. <br /><br />

Publication date: October 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 52<br />     Author(s): Robert R   Rozeske, Cyril   Herry<br /> The behavioral repertoire of an organism can be highly diverse, spanning from social to defensive. How an animal efficiently switches between distinct behaviors is a fundamental question whose inquiry will provide insights into the mechanisms that are necessary for an organism's survival. Previous work aimed at identifying the neural systems responsible for defensive behaviors, such as freezing, has demonstrated critical interactions between the prefrontal cortex and amygdala. Indeed, this foundational research has provided an indispensable anatomical framework that investigators are now using to understand the physiological mechanisms of defined neural circuits within the prefrontal cortex that code for the rapid and flexible expression of defensive behaviors. Here we review recent findings demonstrating temporal and rate coding mechanisms of freezing behavior in the prefrontal cortex. We hypothesize that anatomical features, such as target structure and cortical layer, as well as the nature of the information to be coded, may be critical factors determining the coding scheme. Furthermore, detailed behavioral analyses may reveal subtypes of defensive behaviors that represent the principle factor governing coding selection. <br /><br />

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Tara E   Tracy, Li   Gan<br /> The accumulation of pathological tau in the brain is associated with neuronal deterioration and cognitive impairments in tauopathies including Alzheimer's disease. Tau, while primarily localized in the axons of healthy neurons, accumulates in the soma and dendrites of neurons under pathogenic conditions. Tau is found in both presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments of neurons in Alzheimer's disease. New research supports that soluble forms of tau trigger pathophysiology in the brain by altering properties of synaptic and neuronal function at the early stages of disease progression, before neurons die. Here we review the current understanding of how tau-mediated synaptic and neuronal dysfunction contributes to cognitive decline. Delineating the mechanisms by which pathogenic tau alters synapses, dendrites and axons will help lay the foundation for new strategies that can restore neuronal function in tauopathy. <br /><br />

Publication date: December 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 53<br />     Author(s): Henrik   Boije, Klas   Kullander<br /> The spinal circuitry governing the undulatory movements of swimming vertebrates consist of excitatory and commissural inhibitory interneurons and motor neurons. This locomotor network generates the rhythmic output, coordinate left/right alternation, and permit communication across segments. Through evolution, more complex movement patterns have emerged, made possible by sub-specialization of neural populations within the spinal cord. Walking tetrapods use a similar basic circuitry, but have added layers of complexity for the coordination of intralimbic flexor and extensor muscles as well as interlimbic coordination between the body halves and fore/hindlimbs. Although the basics of these circuits are known there is a gap in our knowledge regarding how different speeds and gaits are coordinated. Analysing subpopulations among described neuronal populations may bring insight into how changes in locomotor output are orchestrated by a hard-wired network. <br /><br />

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Haiwen   Chen, Ai-Hui   Tang, Thomas A   Blanpied<br /> Synapses differ markedly in their performance, even amongst those on a single neuron. The mechanisms that drive this functional diversification are of great interest because they enable adaptive behaviors and are targets of pathology. Considerable effort has focused on elucidating mechanisms of plasticity that involve changes to presynaptic release probability and the number of postsynaptic receptors. However, recent work is clarifying that nanoscale organization of the proteins within glutamatergic synapses impacts synapse function. Specifically, active zone scaffold proteins form nanoclusters that define sites of neurotransmitter release, and these sites align transsynaptically with clustered postsynaptic receptors. These nanostructural characteristics raise numerous possibilities for how synaptic plasticity could be expressed. <br /><br />

Publication date: October 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 52<br />     Author(s): Adil G   Khan, Sonja B   Hofer<br /> Vision is an active process. What we perceive strongly depends on our actions, intentions and expectations. During visual processing, these internal signals therefore need to be integrated with the visual information from the retina. The mechanisms of how this is achieved by the visual system are still poorly understood. Advances in recording and manipulating neuronal activity in specific cell types and axonal projections together with tools for circuit tracing are beginning to shed light on the neuronal circuit mechanisms of how internal, contextual signals shape sensory representations. Here we review recent work, primarily in mice, that has advanced our understanding of these processes, focusing on contextual signals related to locomotion, behavioural relevance and predictions. <br /><br />

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Anne   Bertolotti<br /> Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's, Huntington's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and prion disorders are devastating neurodegenerative diseases of increasing prevalence in aging populations. Although clinically different, they share similar molecular features: the accumulation of one or two proteins in abnormal conformations inside or outside neurons. Enhancing protein quality control systems could be a useful strategy to neutralize the abnormal proteins causing neurodegenerative diseases. This review emphasizes the subcellular location of protein deposits in neurodegenerative diseases and the need to tailor strategies aimed at boosting protein quality control systems to the affected subcellular compartment. Inhibition of a protein phosphatase terminating the unfolded protein response will be discussed as a strategy to protect from diseases associated with misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. <br /><br />

Publication date: December 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 53<br />     Author(s): Emilia   Favuzzi, Beatriz   Rico<br /> The complexity and precision of cortical circuitries is achieved during development due to the exquisite diversity of synapse types that is generated in a highly regulated manner. Here, we review the recent increase in our understanding of how synapse type-specific molecules differentially regulate the development of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Moreover, several synapse subtype-specific molecules have been shown to control the targeting, formation or maturation of particular subtypes of excitatory synapses. Because inhibitory neurons are extremely diverse, a similar molecular diversity is likely to underlie the development of different inhibitory synapses making it a promising topic for future investigation in the field of the synapse development. <br /><br />

Publication date: December 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 53<br />     Author(s): Clinton   Cave, Shanthini   Sockanathan<br /> The embryonic generation of motor neurons is a complex process involving progenitor patterning, fate specification, differentiation, and maturation. Throughout this progression, the differential expression of transcription factors has served as our road map for the eventual cell fate of nascent motor neurons. Recent findings from in vivo and in vitro models of motor neuron development have expanded our understanding of how transcription factors govern motor neuron identity and their individual regulatory mechanisms. With the advent of next generation sequencing approaches, researchers now have unprecedented access to the gene regulatory dynamics involved in motor neuron development and are uncovering new connections linking neurodevelopment and neurodegenerative disease. <br /><br />

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Sylvain   Rama, Mickaël   Zbili, Dominique   Debanne<br /> Axons link distant brain regions and are usually considered as simple transmission cables in which reliable propagation occurs once an action potential has been generated. Safe propagation of action potentials relies on specific ion channel expression at strategic points of the axon such as nodes of Ranvier or axonal branch points. However, while action potentials are generally considered as the quantum of neuronal information, their signaling is not entirely digital. In fact, both their shape and their conduction speed have been shown to be modulated by activity, leading to regulations of synaptic latency and synaptic strength. We report here newly identified mechanisms of (1) safe spike propagation along the axon, (2) compartmentalization of action potential shape in the axon, (3) analog modulation of spike-evoked synaptic transmission and (4) alteration in conduction time after persistent regulation of axon morphology in central neurons. We discuss the contribution of these regulations in information processing. <br /><br />

Publication date: October 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 52<br />     Author(s): Kanika   Bansal, Johan   Nakuci, Sarah Feldt   Muldoon<br /> Many recent efforts in computational modeling of macro-scale brain dynamics have begun to take a data-driven approach by incorporating structural and/or functional information derived from subject data. Here, we discuss recent work using personalized brain network models to study structure–function relationships in human brains. We describe the steps necessary to build such models and show how this computational approach can provide previously unobtainable information through the ability to perform virtual experiments. Finally, we present examples of how personalized brain network models can be used to gain insight into the effects of local stimulation and improve surgical outcomes in epilepsy. <br /> <h3 class="h3">Graphical abstract</h3> <img alt="image" height="93" src="http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959438818300059-fx1.jpg" width="301" /><br />

Publication date: October 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 52<br />     Author(s): Rebecca A   Piskorowski, Vivien   Chevaleyre<br /> The hippocampus is a central region in the coding of spatial, temporal and episodic memory. Recent discoveries have revealed surprising and complex roles of the small area CA2 in hippocampal function. Lesion studies have revealed that this region is required for social memory formation. Area CA2 is targeted by extra-hippocampal paraventricular inputs that release vasopressin and can act to enhance social memory performance. In vivo recordings have revealed nonconventional activity by neurons in this region that act to both initiate hippocampal sharp-wave ripple events as well as encode spatial information during immobility. Silencing of CA2 pyramidal neurons has revealed that this area also acts to control hippocampal network excitability during encoding, and this balance of excitation and inhibition is disrupted in disease. This review summarizes recent findings and attempts to integrate these results into pre-existing models. <br /><br />

However, bulk of evidence demonstrates the requirement of the reciprocal interactions between cortical and thalamic neurons as key for the correct development of functional thalamocortical circuits. This reciprocal loop of connections is essential for sensory processing as well as for the execution of complex sensory-motor tasks. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of how mutual collaborations between both brain regions define area patterning and cell differentiation in the thalamus and cortex. <br /><br />

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Craig   Blackstone<br /> Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are neurologic disorders characterized by prominent lower-extremity spasticity, resulting from a length-dependent axonopathy of corticospinal upper motor neurons. They are among the most genetically-diverse neurologic disorders, with &amp;gt;80 distinct genetic loci and over 60 identified genes. Studies investigating the molecular pathogenesis underlying HSPs have emphasized the importance of converging cellular pathogenic themes in the most common forms of HSP, providing compelling targets for therapy. Most notably, these include organelle shaping and biogenesis as well as membrane and cargo trafficking. <br /><br />

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Kelsey A   Herrmann, Heather T   Broihier<br /> Although retrograde neurotrophin signaling has provided an immensely influential paradigm for understanding growth factor signaling in the nervous system, recent studies indicate that growth factors also signal via cell-autonomous, or autocrine, mechanisms. Autocrine signals have been discovered in many neuronal contexts, providing insights into their regulation and function. The growing realization of the importance of cell-autonomous signaling stems from advances in both conditional genetic approaches and in sophisticated analyses of growth factor dynamics, which combine to enable rigorous in vivo dissection of signaling pathways. Here we review recent studies defining autocrine roles for growth factors such as BDNF, and classical morphogens, including Wnts and BMPs, in regulating neuronal development and plasticity. Collectively, these studies highlight an intimate relationship between activity-dependent autocrine signaling and synaptic plasticity, and further suggest a common principle for coordinating paracrine and autocrine signaling in the nervous system. <br /><br />

Publication date: August 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 51<br />     Author(s): Patrick   Lüningschrör, Michael   Sendtner<br /> Regulated release of neurotransmitter depends on the orchestrated function of a large number of proteins in the presynaptic compartment. When synaptic vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane, these membranes and the attached proteins are endocytosed and either recycled or degraded. This turnover needs to be tightly regulated in a timely and spatially confined manner. Increasing evidence suggests that these mechanisms do not only serve for the removal of defective synaptic vesicles or structural proteins of the active zone but also contribute to pathways regulating synaptic strength. The corresponding presynaptic autophagy system thus appears also important for synaptic maintenance and plasticity. Exciting new studies provide evidence how the autophagy machinery recognizes and degrades synaptic components and lay the ground to understand how autophagy in the presynaptic compartment contributes to modulation and maintenance of synaptic function. <br /><br />

Incorporating somatosensory representation into striatal functions</a></h4>

Publication date: October 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 52<br />     Author(s): David   Robbe<br /> A long-standing hypothesis postulates that the striatum is essential for the concurrent selection of adaptive actions and repression of inappropriate alternatives. Here, classical and recent anatomical and physiological studies are reviewed to show that, in mammals, the striatum can detect discrete task-relevant sensory stimuli and continuously track somatosensory information associated with the generation of simple movements and more complex actions. Rather than contributing to the immediate selection of actions, the striatum may monitor the sensorimotor state of animals by integrating somatosensory information and motor-related signals on a moment-by-moment basis. Such function could be critical for the progressive acquisition or updating of adaptive actions and the emergence of an embodied sense of time. <br /><br />

<p>Evidence accumulation models of simple decision-making have long assumed that
the brain estimates a scalar decision variable corresponding to the
log-likelihood ratio of the two alternatives. Typical neural implementations of
this algorithmic cognitive model assume that large numbers of neurons are each
noisy exemplars of the scalar decision variable. Here we propose a neural
implementation of the diffusion model in which many neurons construct and
maintain the Laplace transform of the distance to each of the decision bounds.
As in classic findings from brain regions including LIP, the firing rate of
neurons coding for the Laplace transform of net accumulated evidence grows to a
bound during random dot motion tasks. However, rather than noisy exemplars of a
single mean value, this approach makes the novel prediction that firing rates
grow to the bound exponentially, across neurons there should be a distribution
of different rates. A second set of neurons records an approximate inversion of
the Laplace transform, these neurons directly estimate net accumulated
evidence. In analogy to time cells and place cells observed in the hippocampus
and other brain regions, the neurons in this second set have receptive fields
along a "decision axis." This finding is consistent with recent findings from
rodent recordings. This theoretical approach places simple evidence
accumulation models in the same mathematical language as recent proposals for
representing time and space in cognitive models for memory.

<p>This paper proposes and implements an intuitive and pervasive solution for
neonatal EEG monitoring assisted by sonification and deep learning AI that
provides information about neonatal brain health to all neonatal healthcare
professionals, particularly those without EEG interpretation expertise. The
system aims to increase the demographic of clinicians capable of diagnosing
abnormalities in neonatal EEG. The proposed system uses a low-cost and
low-power EEG acquisition system. An Android app provides single-channel EEG
visualization, traffic-light indication of the presence of neonatal seizures
provided by a trained, deep convolutional neural network and an algorithm for
EEG sonification, designed to facilitate the perception of changes in EEG
morphology specific to neonatal seizures. The multifaceted EEG interpretation
framework is presented and the implemented mobile platform architecture is
analyzed with respect to its power consumption and accuracy.

<p>The brain is a system operating on multiple time scales, and characterisation
of dynamics across time scales remains a challenge. One framework to study such
dynamics is that of fractal geometry. However, currently there exists no
established method for the study of brain dynamics using fractal geometry, due
to the many challenges in the conceptual and technical understanding of the
methods. We aim to highlight some of the practical challenges of applying
fractal geometry to brain dynamics and propose solutions to enable its wider
use in neuroscience. Using intracranially recorded EEG and simulated data, we
compared monofractal and multifractal methods with regards to their sensitivity
to signal variance. We found that both correlate closely with signal variance,
thus not offering new information about the signal. However, after applying an
epoch-wise standardisation procedure to the signal, we found that multifractal
measures could offer non-redundant information compared to signal variance,
power and other established EEG signal measures. We also compared different
multifractal estimation methods and found that the Chhabra-Jensen algorithm
performed best. Finally, we investigated the impact of sampling frequency and
epoch length on multifractal properties. Using epileptic seizures as an example
event in the EEG, we show that there may be an optimal time scale for detecting
temporal changes in multifractal properties around seizures. The practical
issues we highlighted and our suggested solutions should help in developing a
robust method for the application of fractal geometry in EEG signals. Our
analyses and observations also aid the theoretical understanding of the
multifractal properties of the brain and might provide grounds for new
discoveries in the study of brain signals. These could be crucial for
understanding of neurological function and for the developments of new
treatments.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03881">How the visual system can detect feature homogeneity from spike latencies. (arXiv:1806.03881v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>We propose that homogeneous image regions may be used to quickly segment a
visual scene, when an object hypothesis is not yet available. In a cooperative
model of the konio-cellular and the parvo- or magno-cellular visual pathway of
primates, we demonstrate how homogeneity-selective responses can be gained from
LGN neurons using a spike-latency code, and how these responses can confine
edge detection to borders between mid-sized objects. We propose that
spike-latency-based homogeneity detection is a general neural principle that
may apply to any sensory feature and modality. The mechanism is sensitive to
exact spike timing, which makes it vulnerable to noise. Nevertheless we
demonstrate how the mechanism can be made robust against realistic levels of
neural cross talk in the brain. We show that biphasic synaptic events do yield
very sharp post synaptic currents that maintain good separation of homogeneity
responses in massively noisy environments. The same technique opens up a neural
method of tuning neurons to varying degrees of homogeneity. The simple neural
implementation, generality, robustness, and variable tuning make
homogeneity-detection an attractive scheme of computation in spiking neural
networks and in the brain.

<p>To make decisions organisms often accumulate information across multiple
timescales. However, most experimental and modeling studies of decision-making
focus on sequences of independent trials. On the other hand, natural
environments are characterized by long temporal correlations, and evidence used
to make a present choice is often relevant to future decisions. To understand
decision-making under these conditions we analyze how a model ideal observer
accumulates evidence to freely make choices across a sequence of correlated
trials. We use principles of probabilistic inference to show that an ideal
observer incorporates information obtained on one trial as an initial bias on
the next. This bias decreases the time, but not the accuracy of the next
decision. Furthermore, in finite sequences of trials the rate of reward is
maximized when the observer deliberates longer for early decisions, but
responds more quickly towards the end of the sequence. Our model also explains
experimentally observed patterns in decision times and choices, thus providing
a mathematically principled foundation for evidence-accumulation models of
sequential decisions.

<p>Random noise plays a beneficial role in cognitive processing and produces
measurable improvement in simulations and biological agents' task performance.
Stochastic facilitation, the phenomenon of additive noise improving signal
transmission in complex systems, has been shown to occur in a variety of neural
contexts. However, neuroscience analyses to date have not fully explored the
colours that neural noise could be. The literature shows a 1/f pink noise power
spectrum distribution at many levels, but many less rigourous studies assume
white noise, with little justification of why that assumption is made. In this
work, we briefly review the colours of noise and their useful applications in
other fields. If we consider that noise is not so black and white, we could
more colourfully regularize artificial neural networks and re-investigate some
surprising results about how the brain benefits from noise.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03504">Universality in human cortical folding across lobes of individual brains. (arXiv:1806.03504v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>Background: We have previously demonstrated that cortical folding across
mammalian species follows a universal scaling law that can be derived from a
simple theoretical model. The same scaling law has also been shown to hold
across brains of our own species, irrespective of age or sex. These results,
however, only relate measures of complete cortical hemispheres. There are known
systematic variations in morphology between different brain regions, and
region-specific changes with age. It is therefore of interest to extend our
analyses to different cortical regions, and analyze the scaling law within an
individual brain.
</p>
<p>Methods: To directly compare the morphology of sub-divisions of the cortical
surface in a size-independent manner, we base our method on a topological
invariant of closed surfaces. We reconstruct variables of a complete hemisphere
from each lobe of the brain so that it has the same gyrification index, average
thickness and average Gaussian curvature.
</p>
<p>Results: We show that different lobes are morphologically diverse but obey
the same scaling law that was observed across human subjects and across
mammalian species. This is also the case for subjects with Alzheimer's disease.
The age-dependent offset changes at similar rates for all lobes in healthy
subjects, but differs most dramatically in the temporal lobe in Alzheimer's
disease.
</p>
<p>Significance: Our results further support the idea that while morphological
parameters can vary locally across the cortical surface/across subjects of the
same species/across species, the processes that drive cortical gyrification are
universal.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>We frequently encounter the same item in different contexts, and when that happens, memories of earlier encounters can get reactivated. We examined how existing memories are changed as a result of such reactivation. We hypothesized that when an item’s initial and subsequent neural representations overlap, this allows the initial item to become associated with novel contextual information, interfering with later retrieval of the initial context. Specifically, we predicted a negative relationship between representational similarity across repeated experiences of an item and subsequent source memory for the initial context. We tested this hypothesis in an fMRI study, in which objects were presented multiple times during different tasks. We measured the similarity of the neural patterns in lateral occipital cortex that were elicited by the first and second presentations of objects, and related this neural overlap score to subsequent source memory. Consistent with our hypothesis, greater item-specific pattern similarity was linked to worse source memory for the initial task. In contrast, greater reactivation of the initial context was associated with better source memory. Our findings suggest that the influence of novel experiences on an existing context memory depends on how reliably a shared component (i.e., item) is represented across these episodes.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Event-related fluctuations of neural oscillatory amplitude are reported widely in the context of cognitive processing and are typically interpreted as a marker of brain “activity”. However, the precise nature of these effects remains unclear; in particular, whether such fluctuations reflect local dynamics, integration between regions, or both, is unknown. Here, using magnetoencephalography, we show that movement induced oscillatory modulation is associated with transient connectivity between sensorimotor regions. Further, in resting-state data, we demonstrate a significant association between oscillatory modulation and dynamic connectivity. A confound with such empirical measurements is that increased amplitude necessarily means increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR): this means that the question of whether amplitude and connectivity are genuinely coupled, or whether increased connectivity is observed purely due to increased SNR is unanswered. Here, we counter this problem by analogy with computational models which show that, in the presence of global network coupling and local multistability, the link between oscillatory modulation and long-range connectivity is a natural consequence of neural networks. Our results provide evidence for the notion that connectivity is mediated by neural oscillations, and suggest that time–frequency spectrograms are not merely a description of local synchrony but also reflect fluctuations in long-range connectivity.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Considerable evidence has shown that prefrontal neurons expressing D1-type dopamine receptors (D1DRs) are critical for working memory, flexibility, and timing. This line of work predicts that frontal neurons expressing D1DRs mediate cognitive processing. During timing tasks, one form this cognitive processing might take is time-dependent ramping activity—monotonic changes in firing rate over time. Thus, we hypothesized the prefrontal D1DR+ neurons would strongly exhibit time-dependent ramping during interval timing. We tested this idea using an interval-timing task in which we used optogenetics to tag D1DR+ neurons in the mouse medial frontal cortex (MFC). While 23% of MFC D1DR+ neurons exhibited ramping, this was significantly less than untagged MFC neurons. By contrast, MFC D1DR+ neurons had strong delta-frequency (1–4 Hz) coherence with other MFC ramping neurons. This coherence was phase-locked to cue onset and was strongest early in the interval. To test the significance of these interactions, we optogenetically stimulated MFC D1DR+ neurons early versus late in the interval. We found that 2-Hz stimulation early in the interval was particularly effective in rescuing timing-related behavioral performance deficits in dopamine-depleted animals. These findings provide insight into MFC networks and have relevance for disorders such as Parkinson’s disease and schizophrenia.</span>

Cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) is a widespread problem for the increasing population of cancer survivors. Our understanding of the nature, causes, and prevalence of CRCI is hampered by a reliance on clinical neuropsychological methods originally designed to detect focal lesions. Future progress will require collaboration between neuroscience and clinical neuropsychology.

Acute exposure to a salient stressor, such as in post-traumatic stress disorder, can have lasting impacts upon an individual and society. To study stress in rodents, some naturalistic methods have included acute exposure to a predator odor, such as the synthetized fox odor 2,4,5,trimethyl-3-thiazoline (TMT). These experiments explore the stress-related behaviors and cortical activity induced by TMT exposure in adult male C57BL/6J mice and the influence of the stress neuropeptide, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) on these responses. Compared to H2O, mice exposed to TMT in the home cage showed increased avoidance and defensive burying indicative of evident stress responses. Consistent with stress-induced activation of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), we found that the prelimbic (PL) and infralimbic (IL) subregions of the mPFC had elevated c-Fos immunolabeling after TMT compared to H2O. Slice physiology recordings were performed in layers 2/3 and 5 of the PL and IL, following TMT or H2O exposure. In TMT mice, PL layers 2/3 showed heightened spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic currents and synaptic drive, suggesting TMT enhanced excitatory transmission. Synaptic drive in PL was increased in both TMT and H2O mice following bath application of CRF, and systemic pretreatment with the CRF-R1 antagonist CP154526 reduced excitatory transmission in TMT mice, but not H2O mice. CP154526 also reduced stress-reactive behaviors induced by TMT.

The Irregularity Age Map (IAM) for the unsupervised assessment of brain white matter hyperintensities (WMH) opens several opportunities in machine learning-based brain MRI analysis, including transfer task adaptation learning in the MRI brain lesion's segmentation and prediction of lesion progression and regression. The lack of need for manual labels is useful for transfer learning. Whereas, the nature of IAM itself can be exploited for predicting lesion progression/regression. In this study, we propose the use of task adaptation transfer learning for WMH segmentation using CNN through weakly-training UNet and UResNet using the output from IAM and the use of IAM for predicting patterns of WMH progression and regression.

Brain signals recorded with electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG) and related techniques often have poor signal-to-noise ratio due to the presence of multiple competing sources and artifacts. A common remedy is to average over repeats of the same stimulus, but this is not applicable for temporally extended stimuli that are presented only once (speech, music, movies, natural sound). An alternative is to average responses over multiple subjects that were presented with the same identical stimuli, but differences in geometry of brain sources and sensors reduce the effectiveness of this solution. Multiway canonical correlation analysis (MCCA) brings a solution to this problem by allowing data from multiple subjects to be fused in such a way as to extract components common to all. This paper reviews the method, offers application examples that illustrate its effectiveness, and outlines the caveats and risks entailed by the method.

The proinflammatory cytokine Interleukin-17 (IL-17) is produced mainly by Th17 cells and has been implicated in pain regulation. However, synaptic mechanisms by which IL-17 regulates pain transmission are unknown. Here we report that glia-produced IL-17 suppresses inhibitory synaptic transmission in spinal cord pain circuit and drives chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain. We observed respective expression of IL-17 and its receptor IL-17R in spinal cord astrocytes and neurons. Patch clamp recording in spinal cord slices revealed that IL-17 not only enhanced EPSCs but also suppressed IPSCs and GABA-induced currents in lamina IIo somatostatin-expressing neurons. Spinal IL-17 was upregulated after paclitaxel treatment, and intrathecal IL-17R blockade reduced paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain. In dorsal root ganglia, respective IL-17 and IL-17R expression in satellite glial cells and neurons was sufficient and required for inducing neuronal hyperexcitability after paclitaxel. Together, our data show that IL-17/IL-17R mediate both central and peripheral neuron-glial interactions in chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.

All-optical registration of neuronal and astrocytic activities within the intact mammalian brain has improved significantly with recent advances in optical sensors and biophotonics. However, relating single-synapse release events and local astroglial responses to sensory stimuli in an intact animal has not hitherto been feasible. Here, we present a multiplexed multiphoton excitation imaging approach for assessing the relationship between presynaptic Ca2+ entry at thalamocortical axonal boutons and perisynaptic astrocytic Ca2+ elevations, induced by whisker stimulation in the barrel cortex of C57BL/6 mice. We find that, unexpectedly, Ca2+ elevations in the perisynaptic astrocytic regions consistently precede local presynaptic Ca2+ signals during spontaneous brain activity associated with anaesthesia. The methods described here can be adapted to a variety of optical sensors and are compatible with experimental designs that might necessitate repeated sampling of single synapses over a longitudinal behavioural paradigm.

There is considerable inter-individual variability in the efficacy of opioids for treating chronic breathlessness. Studies in pain, another aversive symptom, have demonstrated that negative affective qualities (e.g., anxiety, depression) can exacerbate pain and diminish opioid efficacy. We questioned whether such mechanisms may also be relevant for breathlessness. Methods: We first investigated the relationship between opioid efficacy and physiological/behavioural qualities. We utilised two existing opioid datasets: a clinical study in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and a functional magnetic resonance brain imaging study of breathlessness in healthy volunteers, employing hierarchical cluster analyses to determine the relationship between physiology, behaviour and opioid responsiveness. We then investigated how opioid efficacy relates to anticipatory brain activity using linear regression in the healthy volunteers. Results: Consistent across both datasets, reduced opioid efficacy was more closely associated with negative affect than with baseline physiology and self-reported breathlessness scores. Furthermore, in healthy individuals, brain activity in anterior cingulate and ventromedial prefrontal cortices during anticipation of breathlessness was inversely correlated with opioid effectiveness. Conclusion: Diminished opioid efficacy for relief of breathlessness may be associated with high negative affective and is correlated with the magnitude of brain activity during anticipation of breathlessness. Clinical implications. Negative affect may influence perceptual systems to become less responsive to opioid therapy.

Inhibition of midbrain dopamine neurons is thought to underlie the signaling of events that are less rewarding than expected and drive learning based on these negative prediction errors. It has recently been shown that Kv4.3 channels influence the integration of inhibitory inputs in specific subpopulations of dopamine neurons. The functional properties of Kv4.3 channels are themselves strongly determined by the binding of auxiliary {beta}-subunits; among them KChIP4a stands-out for its unique combination of modulatory effects. These include decreasing surface membrane trafficking and slowing inactivation kinetics. Therefore, we hypothesized that KChIP4a expression in dopamine neurons could play a crucial role in behavior, in particular by affecting the computation of negative prediction errors. We developed a mouse line where the alternative exon that codes for the KChIP4a splice variant was selectively deleted in midbrain dopamine neurons. In a reward-based reinforcement learning task, we observed that dopamine neuron-specific KChIP4a deletion selectively accelerated the rate of extinction learning, without impacting the acquisition of conditioned responses. We further found that this effect was due to a faster decrease in the initiation rate of goal-directed behaviors, and not faster increases in action disengagement. Furthermore, computational fitting of the behavioral data with a Rescorla-Wagner model confirmed that the observed phenotype was attributable to a selective increase in the learning rate from negative prediction errors. Finally, KChIP4a deletion did not affect performance in other dopamine-sensitive behavioral tasks that did not involve learning from disappointing events, including an absence of effects on working memory, locomotion and novelty preference. Taken together, our results demonstrate that an exon- and midbrain dopamine neuron-specific deletion of an A-type K+ channel {beta}-subunit leads to a selective gain of function in extinction learning.

Brain Network Models have become a promising theoretical framework in simulating signals that are representative of whole brain activity such as resting state fMRI. However, it has been difficult to compare the complex brain activity between simulated and empirical data. Previous studies have used simple metrics that surmise coordination between regions such as functional connectivity, and we extend on this by using various different dynamical analysis tools that are currently used to understand resting state fMRI. We show that certain properties correspond to the structural connectivity input that is shared between the models, and certain dynamic properties relate more to the mathematical description of the Brain Network Model. We conclude that the dynamic properties that gauge more temporal structure rather than spatial coordination in the rs-fMRI signal seem to provide the largest contrasts between different BNMs and the unknown empirical dynamical system. Our results will be useful in constraining and developing more realistic simulations of whole brain activity.

High frequency repetitive TMS (HF-rTMS) to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is an approved option for the treatment of depression, but there is also much variability in the resulting antidepressant response. This variability is believed to arise from various factors, an important one of which being the method by which rTMS is targeted to the optimal stimulation site in the left DLPFC. To more accurately target HF-rTMS at left DLPFC, we present a new method for target selection based on individual rsfMRI data. We show in 23 healthy subjects that the new proposed method of target selection is reproducible and yields left DLPFC targets whose functional connectivity correlates more negatively with subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) than targets based on standard MNI coordinates. Since previous work has highlighted higher negative connectivity with the sgACC as an important feature of targets for higher antidepressant effect of HF-rTMS, the targets selected by the new method can be expected to lead to a higher therapeutic response. Additionally, the mechanism of action of an entire single session of HF-rTMS (3000 pulses) in healthy subjects has not been reported. We show significant decreases in functional connectivity of the default mode network in sgACC and ventral striatum (vStr) regions, peaking at 27-32 minutes after stimulation. Also, we report a negative correlation between the magnitude of this decrease in the right sgACC and the harm avoidance domain measure from the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI). This finding points towards the possibility of using the harm avoidance measure as a predictor of HF-rTMS response. In addition, the decreased functional connectivity of the default mode network in right nucleus accumbens (NAcc) correlates with a short-term decrease in self-rated negative emotions from the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) i.e. the lower the functional connectivity of right NAcc with the default mode network, the lower the reported perception of negative mood by the subjects. This suggests a mechanism by which changes induced by rTMS influence the perception of negative mood in recipients.

Modulation is essential for adjusting neurons to prevailing conditions and differing demands. Yet understanding how modulators adjust neuronal properties to alter information processing remains unclear, as is the impact of neuromodulation on energy consumption. Here we combine two computational models, one Hodgkin-Huxley type and the other analytic, to investigate the effects of neuromodulation upon Drosophila melanogaster photoreceptors. Voltage-dependent K+ conductances: (i) activate upon depolarisation to reduce membrane resistance and adjust bandwidth to functional requirements; (ii) produce negative feedback to increase bandwidth in an energy efficient way; (iii) produce shunt-peaking thereby increasing the membrane gain bandwidth product; and (iv) inactivate to amplify low frequencies. Through their effects on the voltage-dependent K+ conductances, three modulators, serotonin, calmodulin and PIP2, trade-off voltage-contrast gain against membrane bandwidth. Serotonin shifts the photoreceptor performance towards higher voltage-contrast gains and lower membrane bandwidths, whereas PIP2 and calmodulin shifts performance towards lower voltage-contrast gains and higher membrane bandwidths. These neuromodulators have little effect upon the overall energy consumed by photoreceptors, instead they redistribute the energy invested in gain versus bandwidth. This demonstrates how modulators can shift neuronal information processing within the limitations of biophysics and energy consumption.

Fast bidirectional replays of place cell activity reflecting previous paths, and stripped off any instantial specifics of the animal's locomotion such as its speed or the duration of stops, have been observed during rest in rodents. Mechanisms underlying replays are not fully understood, as previous models depend on assumptions about the path, and on instantial specifics of motion. Relying on sharp-wave events, dendritic spikes and cholinergic modulation, we propose a spiking network model that stores traversed paths on a behavioral timescale with single exposure and produces fast bidirectional replays of corresponding place cell sequences independent of instantial specifics and the path taken. With the model, we make an experimentally verifiable prediction, the sequence cell population, whose firing follows a predefined sequential activity pattern independent of the environment. Furthermore, we hypothesize a functional role for disinhibition as behavioral time pacemaker, enforcing progression of sequence cell activity to match place sequences traversed.

Background: Neuropsychiatric disease has polygenic determinants but is often precipitated by environmental pressures, including adverse perinatal events. However, the way in which genetic vulnerability and early-life adversity interact remains obscure. Preterm birth is associated with abnormal brain development and psychiatric disease. We hypothesised that the extreme environmental stress of premature extra-uterine life could contribute to neuroanatomic abnormality in genetically vulnerable individuals. Methods: We combined Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from 194 infants, born before 33 weeks of gestation, to test the prediction that: the characteristic deep grey matter abnormalities seen in preterm infants are associated with polygenic risk for psychiatric illness. Summary statistics from a meta-analysis of SNP data for five psychiatric disorders were used to compute individual polygenic risk scores (PRS). The variance explained by the PRS in the relative volumes of four deep grey matter structures (caudate nucleus, thalamus, subthalamic nucleus and lentiform nucleus) was estimated using linear regression both for the full, mixed-ancestral, cohort and a subsample of European infants. Results: The PRS was negatively associated with: lentiform volume in the full cohort ({beta}=-0.24, p=8x10-4) and the European subsample ({beta}=-0.24, p=8x10-3); and with subthalamic nuclear volume in the full cohort ({beta}=-0.18, p=0.01) and the European subsample ({beta}=-0.26, p=3x10-3). Conclusions: Genetic variants associated with neuropsychiatric disease increase vulnerability to abnormal deep grey matter development and are associated with neuroanatomic changes in the perinatal period. This suggests a mechanism by which perinatal adversity leads to later neuropsychiatric disease in genetically predisposed individuals.

Females with autism spectrum disorder have been reported to exhibit fewer and less severe restricted and repetitive behaviors and interests compared to males. This difference might indicate sex specific alterations of brain networks involved in autism symptom domains, especially within cortico-striatal and sensory integration networks. This study used a well-controlled twin design to examine sex differences in brain anatomy in relation to repetitive behaviors. In 75 twin pairs (n=150, 62 females, 88 males) enriched for autism spectrum disorder (n=32), and other neurodevelopmental disorders (n =32), we explored the association of restricted and repetitive behaviors and interests, operationalized by the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (C domain) and the Social Responsiveness Scale-2 (Restricted Interests and Repetitive Behavior subscale), with cortical volume, surface area and thickness of neocortical, sub-cortical and cerebellar networks. Co-twin control analyses revealed within-pair associations between RRBI symptoms and the right intraparietal sulcus and right orbital gyrus in females only. These findings endorse the importance of investigating sex differences in the neurobiology of autism symptoms, and indicate different etiological pathways underlying restricted and repetitive behaviors and interests in females and males.

<p>by Adrien Henry, Mathieu Hemery, Paul François</p>

Molecular networks are at the core of most cellular decisions, but are often difficult to comprehend. Reverse engineering of network architecture from their functions has proved fruitful to classify and predict the structure and function of molecular networks, suggesting new experimental tests and biological predictions. We present <i>φ</i>-evo, an open-source program to evolve <i>in silico</i> phenotypic networks performing a given biological function. We include implementations for evolution of biochemical adaptation, adaptive sorting for immune recognition, metazoan development (somitogenesis, hox patterning), as well as Pareto evolution. We detail the program architecture based on C, Python 3, and a Jupyter interface for project configuration and network analysis. We illustrate the predictive power of <i>φ</i>-evo by first recovering the asymmetrical structure of the <i>lac</i> operon regulation from an objective function with symmetrical constraints. Second, we use the problem of hox-like embryonic patterning to show how a single effective fitness can emerge from multi-objective (Pareto) evolution. <i>φ</i>-evo provides an efficient approach and user-friendly interface for the phenotypic prediction of networks and the numerical study of evolution itself.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8XzRpNVsmSQ" width="1" />

<p>by Michael Trogdon, Brian Drawert, Carlos Gomez, Samhita P. Banavar, Tau-Mu Yi, Otger Campàs, Linda R. Petzold</p>

The localization (or polarization) of proteins on the membrane during the mating of budding yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>) is an important model system for understanding simple pattern formation within cells. While there are many existing mathematical models of polarization, for both budding and mating, there are still many aspects of this process that are not well understood. In this paper we set out to elucidate the effect that the geometry of the cell can have on the dynamics of certain models of polarization. Specifically, we look at several spatial stochastic models of Cdc42 polarization that have been adapted from published models, on a variety of tip-shaped geometries, to replicate the shape change that occurs during the growth of the mating projection. We show here that there is a complex interplay between the dynamics of polarization and the shape of the cell. Our results show that while models of polarization can generate a stable polarization cap, its localization at the tip of mating projections is unstable, with the polarization cap drifting away from the tip of the projection in a geometry dependent manner. We also compare predictions from our computational results to experiments that observe cells with projections of varying lengths, and track the stability of the polarization cap. Lastly, we examine one model of actin polarization and show that it is unlikely, at least for the models studied here, that actin dynamics and vesicle traffic are able to overcome this effect of geometry.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HB-3yftCf6M" width="1" />

<p>by Angelika Manhart, Stefanie Windner, Mary Baylies, Alex Mogilner</p>

Many types of large cells have multiple nuclei. In skeletal muscle fibers, the nuclei are distributed along the cell to maximize their internuclear distances. This myonuclear positioning is crucial for cell function. Although microtubules, microtubule associated proteins, and motors have been implicated, mechanisms responsible for myonuclear positioning remain unclear. We used a combination of rough interacting particle and detailed agent-based modeling to examine computationally the hypothesis that a force balance generated by microtubules positions the muscle nuclei. Rather than assuming the nature and identity of the forces, we simulated various types of forces between the pairs of nuclei and between the nuclei and cell boundary to position the myonuclei according to the laws of mechanics. We started with a large number of potential interacting particle models and computationally screened these models for their ability to fit biological data on nuclear positions in hundreds of <i>Drosophila</i> larval muscle cells. This reverse engineering approach resulted in a small number of feasible models, the one with the best fit suggests that the nuclei repel each other and the cell boundary with forces that decrease with distance. The model makes nontrivial predictions about the increased nuclear density near the cell poles, the zigzag patterns of the nuclear positions in wider cells, and about correlations between the cell width and elongated nuclear shapes, all of which we confirm by image analysis of the biological data. We support the predictions of the interacting particle model with simulations of an agent-based mechanical model. Taken together, our data suggest that microtubules growing from nuclear envelopes push on the neighboring nuclei and the cell boundaries, which is sufficient to establish the nearly-uniform nuclear spreading observed in muscle fibers.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nOcrMsLp00k" width="1" />

<p>by Suma Ghosh, Matthew J. Ferrari, Ashutosh K. Pathak, Isabella M. Cattadori</p>

Understanding the mechanisms that generate complex host-parasite interactions, and how they contribute to variation between and within hosts, is important for predicting risk of infection and transmission, and for developing more effective interventions based on parasite properties. We used the <i>T. retortaeformis</i> (TR)-rabbit system and developed a state-space mathematical framework to capture the variation in intensity of infection and egg shedding in hosts infected weekly, then treated with an anthelminthic and subsequently re-challenged following the same infection regime. Experimental infections indicate that parasite intensity accumulates more slowly in the post-anthelminthic phase but reaches similar maximum numbers. By contrast, parasite EPG (eggs per gram of feces) shed from rabbits in the post-treatment phase is lower and less variable through time. Inference based on EPG alone suggests a decline in parasite intensity over time. Using a state-space model and incorporating all sources of cross-sectional and longitudinal data, we show that while parasite intensity remains relatively constant in both experimental phases, shedding of eggs into the environment is increasingly limited through changes in parasite growth. We suggest that host immunity directly modulates both the accumulation and the growth of the parasite, and indirectly affects transmission by limiting parasite length and thus fecundity. This study provides a better understanding of how within-host trophic interactions influence different components of a helminth population. It also suggests that heterogeneity in parasite traits should be addressed more carefully when examining and managing helminth infections in the absence of some critical data on parasite dynamics.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aq6_Ne53vz8" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>Ethanol has robust effects on presynaptic activity in many neurons, however, it is not yet clear how this drug acts within this compartment to change neural activity, nor the significance of this change on behavior and physiology <i>in vivo</i>. One possible presynaptic effector for ethanol is the Munc13-1 protein. Herein, we show that ethanol binding to the rat Munc13-1 C1 domain, at concentrations consistent with binge exposure, reduces diacylglycerol (DAG) binding. The inhibition of DAG binding is predicted to reduce the activity of Munc13-1 and presynaptic release. In <i>Drosophila</i>, we show that sedating concentrations of ethanol significantly reduce synaptic vesicle release in olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), while having no significant impact on membrane depolarization and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into the presynaptic compartment. These data indicate that ethanol targets the active zone in reducing synaptic vesicle exocytosis. <i>Drosophila</i>, haploinsufficent for the Munc13-1 ortholog <i>Dunc13</i>, are more resistant to the effect of ethanol on presynaptic inhibition. Genetically reducing the activity of <i>Dunc13</i> through mutation or expression of RNAi transgenes also leads to a significant resistance to the sedative effects of ethanol. The neuronal expression of <i>Munc13-1</i> in heterozygotes for a <i>Dunc13</i> loss-of-function mutation can largely rescue the ethanol sedation resistance phenotype, indicating a conservation of function between <i>Munc13-1</i> and <i>Dunc13</i> in ethanol sedation. Hence, reducing <i>Dunc13</i> activity leads to naïve physiological and behavioral resistance to sedating concentrations of ethanol. We propose that reducing <i>Dunc13</i> activity, genetically or pharmacologically by ethanol binding to the C1 domain of Munc13-1/Dunc13, promotes a homeostatic response that leads to ethanol tolerance.</p>

Abstract<p>Grid cells in layer II of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC LII) generate multiple regular firing fields in response to the position and speed of an individual within the environment. They exhibit a protracted postnatal development and, in the adult, show activity differences along the dorsoventral axis (DVA). Evidence suggests parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons, most of which are perisomatic-targeting cells, play a crucial role in generation of the hexagonal grid cell activity pattern. We therefore hypothesized that the development and organization of PV+ perisomatic terminals in MEC LII reflects the postnatal emergence of the hexagonal firing pattern and dorsoventral differences seen in grid cell activity. We used immuno-electron microscopy to examine the development of PV+ perisomatic terminals and their target somata within dorsal and ventral MEC LII in rats of postnatal days (P)10, 15 and 30. We demonstrate that in dorsal and ventral MEC LII, the cross-sectional area of somata and number and density of perisomatic PV+ terminals increase between P10 and P15. A simultaneous decrease was observed in cross-sectional area of PV+ terminals. Between P15 and P30, both MEC regions showed an increase in PV+ terminal size and percentage of PV+ terminals containing mitochondria, which may enable grid cell activity to emerge and stabilize. We also report that dorsal somata are larger and apposed by more PV+ terminals than ventral somata at all stages, suggesting a protracted maturation in the ventral portion and a possible gradient in soma size and PV+ basket innervation along the DVA in the adult.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Grid cells within layer II of the medial entorhinal cortex produce a regular firing pattern in response to the environment during exploration. This pattern emerges after eye-opening in rodents and exhibits a gradient along the dorsoventral axis. Input from parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) interneurons is crucial for maintaining the grid pattern; however, how the PV+ innervation develops is unclear. Here we examine the structural development of dorsal and ventral perisomatic PV+ terminals and target somata. We show that the size of grid-related somata and number of PV+ terminals increase before eye-opening whereas PV+ terminals increase in size during grid activity stabilization. We further demonstrate that maturation in the ventral part is delayed, and that there are dorsoventral differences in young adults.</p>

Abstract<p>Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is caused by clotting in the cerebral arteries, leading to brain oxygen deprivation and cerebral infarction. Recombinant human tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is currently the only FDA-approved drug for ischemic stroke. However, tPA has to be administered within 4.5 h from the disease onset and delayed treatment of tPA can increase the risk of neurovascular impairment, including neuronal cell death, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, and hemorrhagic transformation. A key contributing factor for tPA-induced neurovascular impairment is activation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). We used a clinically-relevant mouse embolic model of focal-cerebral ischemia by insertion of a single embolus of blood clot to block the right middle cerebral artery. We showed that administration of the potent and highly selective gelatinase inhibitor SB-3CT extends the time window for administration of tPA, attenuating infarct volume, mitigating BBB disruption, and antagonizing the increase in cerebral hemorrhage induced by tPA treatment. We demonstrated that SB-3CT attenuates tPA-induced expression of vascular MMP-9, prevents gelatinase-mediated cleavage of extracellular laminin, rescues endothelial cells, and reduces caveolae-mediated transcytosis of endothelial cells. These results suggest that abrogation of MMP-9 activity mitigates the detrimental effects of tPA treatment, thus the combination treatment holds great promise for extending the therapeutic window for tPA thrombolysis, which opens the opportunity for clinical recourse to a greater number of patients.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Endovascular thrombectomy benefited patients with disproportionately severe clinical deficit relative to infarct volume and provides a surgical option for treatment of ischemic stroke. Tissue-plasminogen activator (tPA) is the only FDA-approved clot-dissolving drug for treatment of ischemic stroke. However, its beneficial effect is seen only within 4.5 hours from the onset of stroke, with better outcomes observed the sooner treatment is given. Major risk is MMP-9–mediated neurovascular impairment. We document that early administration of the pharmacological agent SB<sub>3</sub>CT reduces MMP-9 levels and mitigates the side effects associated with tPA. Furthermore, it extends the time window for treatment with tPA after stroke holding great potential for both disease intervention and benefiting patients who might not otherwise be candidates for treatment with tPA.</p>

Abstract<p>The mushroom body (MB) in insects is known as a major center for associative learning and memory, though exact locations for the correlating memory traces remain to be elucidated. Here we asked whether presynaptic boutons of olfactory projection neurons in the main input site of the MB undergo neuronal plasticity during classical odor-reward conditioning and correlate with the conditioned behavior. We simultaneously measured Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in the boutons and conditioned behavioral responses to learned odors in honeybees. We found that the absolute amount of the neural change for the rewarded but not for the unrewarded odor was correlated with the behavioral learning rate across individuals. The temporal profile of the induced changes matched with odor response dynamics of the MB-associated inhibitory neurons, suggestive of activity modulation of boutons by this neural class. We hypothesize the circuit-specific neural plasticity relates to the learned value of the stimulus and underlies the conditioned behavior of the bees.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> In order to understand memory processing in the brain, it is important to identify the synaptic locations and activities where memory information is stored. This requires monitoring neuronal activity in behaving animals, a technically very demanding task especially in tiny insects. Here we succeeded to measure neuronal activity from restrained yet behaving honeybees. We recorded the activity of olfactory projection neurons from the mushroom body, an insect brain center for learning and memory, while bees are performing an olfactory reward learning task. We found that the amount of neural plasticity correlates with the quantitative expression of a learned behavior to the sugar rewarded odor. Our results contribute to the understanding of the physiologic basis of memory formation in an insect brain.</p>

<p>Significant training is required to visually interpret neonatal EEG signals.
This study explores alternative sound-based methods for EEG interpretation
which are designed to allow for intuitive and quick differentiation between
healthy background activity and abnormal activity such as seizures. A novel
method based on frequency and amplitude modulation (FM/AM) is presented. The
algorithm is tuned to facilitate the audio domain perception of rhythmic
activity which is specific to neonatal seizures. The method is compared with
the previously developed phase vocoder algorithm for different time compressing
factors. A survey is conducted amongst a cohort of non-EEG experts to
quantitatively and qualitatively examine the performance of sound-based methods
in comparison with the visual interpretation. It is shown that both
sonification methods perform similarly well, with a smaller inter-observer
variability in comparison with visual. A post-survey analysis of results is
performed by examining the sensitivity of the ear to frequency evolution in
audio.

<p>Despite the fact that the Kendall correlation is becoming recognized as an
important tool in neuroscience, most standard algorithms to compute the Kendall
correlation of large spike trains are computationally very slow. Here we
present a new, significantly faster method for calculating the Kendall
correlation of spike trains that takes advantage of their structure. We show
that our method is more than 300 times faster than traditional approaches for
particularly large, sparse spike trains, and still more than 10 times faster
for large, but considerably less sparse, spike trains. A MATLAB function
executing the method described here was made freely available on-line.

<p>Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on objects and scenes have
shown intriguing ability to predict some response properties of visual cortical
neurons. However, the factors and computations that give rise to such ability,
and the role of intermediate processing stages in explaining changes that
develop across areas of the cortical hierarchy, are poorly understood. We
focused on the sensitivity to textures as a paradigmatic example, since recent
neurophysiology experiments provide rich data pointing to texture sensitivity
in secondary but not primary visual cortex. We developed a quantitative
approach for selecting a subset of the neural unit population from the CNN that
best describes the brain neural recordings. We found that the first two layers
of the CNN showed qualitative and quantitative correspondence to the cortical
data across a number of metrics. This compatibility was reduced for the
architecture alone rather than the learned weights, for some other related
hierarchical models, and only mildly in the absence of a nonlinear computation
akin to local divisive normalization. Our results show that the CNN class of
model is effective for capturing changes that develop across early areas of
cortex, and has the potential to facilitate understanding of the computations
that give rise to hierarchical processing in the brain.

<p>Neural circuits in the retina divide the incoming visual scene into more than
a dozen distinct representations that are sent on to central brain areas, such
as the lateral geniculate nucleus and the superior colliculus. The retina can
be viewed as a parallel image processor made of a multitude of small
computational devices. Neural circuits of the retina are constituted by various
cell types that separate the incoming visual information in different channels.
Visual information is processed by retinal neural circuits and several
computations are performed extracting distinct features from the visual scene.
The aim of this article is to understand the computational basis involved in
processing visual information which finally leads to several feature detectors.
Therefore, the elements that form the basis of retinal computations will be
explored by explaining how oscillators can lead to a final output with
computational meaning. Linear versus nonlinear systems will be presented and
the retina will be placed in the context of a nonlinear system. Finally,
simulations will be presented exploring the concept of the retina as a
nonlinear system which can perform understandable computations converting a
known input into a predictable output.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstarct</div>An ensemble of neurons can provide a dynamic representation of external stimuli, ongoing processes, or upcoming actions. This dynamic representation could be achieved by changes in the activity of individual neurons and/or their interactions. To investigate these possibilities, we simultaneously recorded from ensembles of prefrontal neurons in non-human primates during a memory-guided saccade task. Using both decoding and encoding methods, we examined changes in the information content of individual neurons and that of ensembles between visual encoding and saccadic target selection. We found that individual neurons maintained their limited spatial sensitivity between these cognitive states, whereas the ensemble selectively improved its encoding of spatial locations far from the neurons’ preferred locations. This population-level “encoding expansion” was not due to the ceiling effect at the preferred locations and was accompanied by selective changes in noise correlations for non-preferred locations. Moreover, the encoding expansion was observed for ensembles of different types of neurons and could not be explained by shifts in the preferred location of individual neurons. Our results demonstrate that the representation of space by neuronal ensembles is dynamically enhanced prior to saccades, and this enhancement occurs alongside changes in noise correlations more than changes in the activity of individual neurons.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Verbal fluency tasks are generally thought to be mediated by frontal brain regions for letter fluency and temporal regions for category fluency. This idea, however, is primarily based on lesion studies and adapted versions of the fluency tasks in functional neuroimaging, without fundamental evidence from structural neuroimaging in healthy individuals. We investigated the cortical structural correlates of letter and category fluency, including overlapping and different regions, in 505 individuals who participated in a community-based study of healthy aging. The correlation between cortical thickness and verbal fluency in whole-brain analyses revealed distinct cortical signatures for letter fluency, primarily in frontal regions, and category fluency, in frontal and temporal-parietal regions. There was a dissociation in the left inferior frontal gyrus between letter and category fluency, with increased thickness in the posterior-dorsal versus anterior-ventral parts, respectively. These results distinguish the detailed anatomical correlates for verbal fluency within the coarse frontal-temporal distinction inferred from lesion studies and among the mixture of regions identified in functional neuroimaging. The evidence for the anatomical substrates of letter and category fluency, each recruiting slightly different language and cognitive processes, can serve both clinical applications as well as a deeper theoretical understanding of the organization of the cerebral cortex.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Anatomo-clinical evidence from motor-awareness disorders after brain-damages suggests that the premotor cortex (PMC) is involved in motor-monitoring of voluntary actions. Indeed, PMC lesions prevent patients from detecting the mismatch between intended, but not executed, movements with the paralyzed limb. This functional magnetic resonance imaging study compared, in healthy subjects, free movements against blocked movements, precluded by a cast. Cast-related corticospinal excitability changes were investigated by using transcranial magnetic stimulation. Immediately after the immobilization, when the cast prevented the execution of left-hand movements, the contralateral right (ventral) vPMC showed both increased hemodynamic activity and increased functional connectivity with the hand area in the right somatosensory cortex, suggesting a vPMC involvement in detecting the mismatch between planned and executed movements. Crucially, after 1 week of immobilization, when the motor system had likely learned that no movement could be executed and, therefore, predictions about motor consequences were changed, vPMC did not show the enhanced activity as if no incongruence has to be detected. This can be interpreted as a consequence of the plastic changes induced by long-lasting immobilization, as also proved by the cast-related corticospinal excitability modulation in our subjects. The present findings highlight the crucial role of vPMC in the anatomo-functional network generating the human motor-awareness.</span>

Autism Spectrum Disorder is phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous, but genomic analyses have identified candidate susceptibility genes. We present a CRISPR gene editing strategy to insert a protein tag and premature termination sites creating an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) knockout resource for functional studies of 10 ASD-relevant genes (AFF2/FMR2, ANOS1, ASTN2, ATRX, CACNA1C, CHD8, DLGAP2, KCNQ2, SCN2A, TENM1). Neurogenin 2 (NEUROG2)-directed differentiation of iPSCs allowed production of cortical excitatory neurons, and mutant proteins were not detectable. RNAseq revealed convergence of several neuronal networks. Using both patch-clamp and multi-electrode array approaches, the electrophysiological deficits measured were distinct for different mutations. However, they culminated in a consistent reduction in synaptic activity, including reduced spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic current frequencies in AFF2/FMR2-, ASTN2-, ATRX-, KCNQ2- and SCN2A-null neurons. Despite ASD susceptibility genes belonging to different gene ontologies, isogenic stem cell resources can reveal common functional phenotypes, such as reduced functional connectivity.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) causes devastating cognitive decline and has no disease-modifying therapies. Neuroinflammation is a significant contributor to disease progression but its precise contribution remains unclear. An emerging literature indicates that secondary inflammatory insults including acute trauma and infection alter the trajectory of chronic neurodegenerative diseases and the roles of microglia and astrocytes require elucidation. The current study, using the APP/PS1 mouse model of AD, demonstrates that microglia are primed by {beta}-amyloid pathology to induce exaggerated IL-1{beta} responses to acute stimulation with LPS or IL-1{beta}. Despite disease-associated NLRP3 inflammasome activation, evidenced by ASC speck formation, APP/PS1 microglial cells show neither IL-1{beta} induction nor NFB p65 nuclear localisation. Upon secondary stimulation with LPS or IL-1{beta}, NFB-p65 nuclear localisation and exaggerated pro-IL-1 induction occur. Microglial priming was also unmasked by secondary stimulation with systemic LPS leading to significant cognitive impairment in APP/PS1 mice compared to WT LPS-treated mice. Astrocytes have also recently emerged as displaying significant phenotypic heterogeneity. Here, by-passing microglial priming, and acutely challenging mice with intra-hippocampal IL-1{beta} we demonstrate that astrocytes proximal to A{beta}-plaques are also primed to produce exaggerated CCL2, CXCL1 and CXCL10 responses. Many astrocytosis-associated genes in APP/PS1 mice share these exaggerated responses to IL-1{beta}, while others are equally induced in both strains. Collectively the data show that the amyloid-laden brain shows multiple vulnerabilities to secondary inflammatory challenge: both microglia and astrocytes are primed to produce exaggerated secondary inflammation and systemic LPS is sufficient to cause cognitive impairments relevant to delirium, selectively in animals with prior amyloid pathology.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/344135v1?rss=1">Decoding Hierarchical Control of Sequential Behavior in Oscillatory EEG Activity</a></h4>

Despite strong theoretical reasons for assuming that abstract representations organize complex action sequences in terms of subplans (chunks) and sequential positions, we lack methods to directly track such content-independent, hierarchical representations in humans. We applied time-resolved, multivariate decoding analysis to the pattern of rhythmic EEG activity that was registered while participants planned and executed individual elements from pre-learned, structured sequences. Across three experiments, the theta and alpha-band activity independently coded basic elements and abstract control representations, in particular the ordinal position of basic elements, but also the identity and position of chunks. Further, a robust representation of higher-level, chunk identity information was only found in individuals with above-median working memory capacity, potentially providing a neural-level explanation for working-memory differences in sequential performance. Our results suggest that by decoding oscillations we can track how the cognitive system traverses through the states of a hierarchical control structure.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/344028v1?rss=1">Optimizing sequential decisions in the drift-diffusion model</a></h4>

To make decisions organisms often accumulate information across multiple timescales. However, most experimental and modeling studies of decision-making focus on sequences of independent trials. On the other hand, natural environments are characterized by long temporal correlations, and evidence used to make a present choice is often relevant to future decisions. To understand decision-making under these conditions we analyze how a model ideal observer accumulates evidence to freely make choices across a sequence of correlated trials. We use principles of probabilistic inference to show that an ideal observer incorporates information obtained on one trial as an initial bias on the next. This bias decreases the time, but not the accuracy of the next decision. Furthermore, in finite sequences of trials the rate of reward is maximized when the observer deliberates longer for early decisions, but responds more quickly towards the end of the sequence. Our model also explains experimentally observed patterns in decision times and choices, thus providing a mathematically principled foundation for evidence-accumulation models of sequential decisions.

Recent studies of bulk microglia have provided insights into the role of this immune cell type in central nervous system development, homeostasis and dysfunction. Nonetheless, our understanding of the diversity of human microglial cell states remains limited. Microglia are highly plastic and have multiple different roles, making the extent of phenotypic heterogeneity a central question, especially in light of the development of therapies targeting this cell type. Here, we investigated the population structure of human microglia by single-cell RNA-sequencing. Using surgical- and autopsy-derived cortical brain samples, we identified 14 human microglial subpopulations and noted substantial intra- and inter-individual heterogeneity. These putative subpopulations display divergent associations with Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and other diseases. Several states show enrichment for genes found in disease-associated mouse microglial states, suggesting additional diversity among human microglia. Overall, human microglia appear to exist in different functional states with varying levels of involvement in different brain pathologies.

Neuronal and behavioral thresholds were measured simultaneously as trained male macaques performed a yaw rotation discrimination task in darkness. When corrected to account for variations in neuronal direction preferences, neurons in the vestibular nuclei and semicircular canal afferents had discrimination thresholds that were only two-fold smaller than behavioral thresholds. There was no significant trial-by-trial correlation between neuronal activity and perceptual decisions, despite the presence of significant pair-wise noise correlations. The lack of choice-related activity during rotation discrimination contrasts with the robust correlations observed previously between brainstem neurons and choices during translation perception. These results suggest task-dependent differences in subcortical processing of vestibular signals, as well as how signals related to perceptual decisions may propagate back to early stages of sensory processing.

The hypothalamic neuropeptide oxytocin has been reported to enhance emotional empathy in association with reduced amygdala activation, although to date studies have not investigated empathy for individuals expressing self-conscious, moral emotions which engage mentalizing as well as emotion processing networks. In the current randomized, double-blind placebo controlled functional MRI experiment on 70 male and female subjects we have therefore investigated the effects of intranasal oxytocin (40 IU) on behavioral and neural responses to embarrassment experienced by others or by self. Results showed that oxytocin significantly increased ratings of both empathic and self-embarrassment and concomitantly decreased skin conductance response and activation in the right amygdala and insula but not in the medial prefrontal cortex. The amygdala effects of oxytocin were associated with the magnitude of the skin conductance response and trait anxiety scores. Overall our results demonstrate that oxytocin increases ratings of self- and other embarrassment and that this is associated with reduced physiological arousal and activity in neural circuitry involved in emotional arousal. The neural effects of oxytocin are also stronger in individuals with high trait anxiety suggesting that it may particularly reduce their anxiety in embarrassing situations.

<p>by Tobias S. Brett, Eamon B. O’Dea, Éric Marty, Paige B. Miller, Andrew W. Park, John M. Drake, Pejman Rohani</p>

Epidemic transitions are an important feature of infectious disease systems. As the transmissibility of a pathogen increases, the dynamics of disease spread shifts from limited stuttering chains of transmission to potentially large scale outbreaks. One proposed method to anticipate this transition are early-warning signals (EWS), summary statistics which undergo characteristic changes as the transition is approached. Although theoretically predicted, their mathematical basis does not take into account the nature of epidemiological data, with are typically aggregated into periodic case reports and subject to reporting error. The viability of EWS for epidemic transitions therefore remains uncertain. Here we demonstrate that most EWS can predict emergence even when calculated from imperfect data. We quantify performance using the area under the curve (AUC) statistic, a measure of how well an EWS distinguishes between numerical simulations of an emerging disease and one which is stationary. Values of the AUC statistic are compared across a range of different reporting scenarios. We find that different EWS respond to imperfect data differently. The mean, variance and first differenced variance all perform well unless reporting error is highly overdispersed. The autocorrelation, autocovariance and decay time perform well provided that the aggregation period of the data is larger than the serial interval and reporting error is not highly overdispersed. The coefficient of variation, skewness and kurtosis are found to be unreliable indicators of emergence. Overall, we find that seven of ten EWS considered perform well for most realistic reporting scenarios. We conclude that imperfect epidemiological data is not a barrier to using EWS for many potentially emerging diseases.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IrC-01N73dA" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>In this paper, we investigate how subtle differences in hearing acuity affect the neural systems supporting speech processing in young adults. Auditory sentence comprehension requires perceiving a complex acoustic signal and performing linguistic operations to extract the correct meaning. We used functional MRI to monitor human brain activity while adults aged 18–41 years listened to spoken sentences. The sentences varied in their level of syntactic processing demands, containing either a subject-relative or object-relative center-embedded clause. All participants self-reported normal hearing, confirmed by audiometric testing, with some variation within a clinically normal range. We found that participants showed activity related to sentence processing in a left-lateralized frontotemporal network. Although accuracy was generally high, participants still made some errors, which were associated with increased activity in bilateral cingulo-opercular and frontoparietal attention networks. A whole-brain regression analysis revealed that activity in a right anterior middle frontal gyrus (aMFG) component of the frontoparietal attention network was related to individual differences in hearing acuity, such that listeners with poorer hearing showed greater recruitment of this region when successfully understanding a sentence. The activity in right aMFGs for listeners with poor hearing did not differ as a function of sentence type, suggesting a general mechanism that is independent of linguistic processing demands. Our results suggest that even modest variations in hearing ability impact the systems supporting auditory speech comprehension, and that auditory sentence comprehension entails the coordination of a left perisylvian network that is sensitive to linguistic variation with an executive attention network that responds to acoustic challenge.</p>

<p>The assumption that action and perception can be investigated independently
is entrenched in theories, models and experimental approaches across the brain
and mind sciences. In cognitive science, this has been a central point of
contention between computationalist and 4Es (enactive, embodied, extended and
embedded) theories of cognition, with the former embracing the "classical
sandwich", modular, architecture of the mind and the latter actively denying
this separation can be made. In this work we suggest that the modular
independence of action and perception strongly resonates with the separation
principle of control theory and furthermore that this principle provides formal
criteria within which to evaluate the implications of the modularity of action
and perception. We will also see that real-time feedback with the environment,
often considered necessary for the definition of 4Es ideas, is not however a
sufficient condition to avoid the "classical sandwich". Finally, we argue that
an emerging framework in the cognitive and brain sciences, active inference,
extends ideas derived from control theory to the study of biological systems
while disposing of the separation principle, describing non-modular models of
behaviour strongly aligned with 4Es theories of cognition.

<p>by Benjamin Werner, Andrea Sottoriva</p>

The immortal strand hypothesis poses that stem cells could produce differentiated progeny while conserving the original template strand, thus avoiding accumulating somatic mutations. However, quantitating the extent of non-random DNA strand segregation in human stem cells remains difficult <i>in vivo</i>. Here we show that the change of the mean and variance of the mutational burden with age in healthy human tissues allows estimating strand segregation probabilities and somatic mutation rates. We analysed deep sequencing data from healthy human colon, small intestine, liver, skin and brain. We found highly effective non-random DNA strand segregation in all adult tissues (mean strand segregation probability: 0.98, standard error bounds (0.97,0.99)). In contrast, non-random strand segregation efficiency is reduced to 0.87 (0.78,0.88) in neural tissue during early development, suggesting stem cell pool expansions due to symmetric self-renewal. Healthy somatic mutation rates differed across tissue types, ranging from 3.5 × 10<sup>−9</sup>/bp/division in small intestine to 1.6 × 10<sup>−7</sup>/bp/division in skin.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JlwnjY5R61I" width="1" />

<p>by Ya-Zhou Shi, Lei Jin, Chen-Jie Feng, Ya-Lan Tan, Zhi-Jie Tan</p>

RNA pseudoknots are a kind of minimal RNA tertiary structural motifs, and their three-dimensional (3D) structures and stability play essential roles in a variety of biological functions. Therefore, to predict 3D structures and stability of RNA pseudoknots is essential for understanding their functions. In the work, we employed our previously developed coarse-grained model with implicit salt to make extensive predictions and comprehensive analyses on the 3D structures and stability for RNA pseudoknots in monovalent/divalent ion solutions. The comparisons with available experimental data show that our model can successfully predict the 3D structures of RNA pseudoknots from their sequences, and can also make reliable predictions for the stability of RNA pseudoknots with different lengths and sequences over a wide range of monovalent/divalent ion concentrations. Furthermore, we made comprehensive analyses on the unfolding pathway for various RNA pseudoknots in ion solutions. Our analyses for extensive pseudokonts and the wide range of monovalent/divalent ion concentrations verify that the unfolding pathway of RNA pseudoknots is mainly dependent on the relative stability of unfolded intermediate states, and show that the unfolding pathway of RNA pseudoknots can be significantly modulated by their sequences and solution ion conditions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VbDC_Iw4jyk" width="1" />

<p>by Shivam Gupta, Julien Varennes, Hendrik C. Korswagen, Andrew Mugler</p>

Important cellular processes such as migration, differentiation, and development often rely on precise timing. Yet, the molecular machinery that regulates timing is inherently noisy. How do cells achieve precise timing with noisy components? We investigate this question using a first-passage-time approach, for an event triggered by a molecule that crosses an abundance threshold and that is regulated by either an accumulating activator or a diminishing repressor. We find that either activation or repression outperforms an unregulated strategy. The optimal regulation corresponds to a nonlinear increase in the amount of the target molecule over time, arises from a tradeoff between minimizing the timing noise of the regulator and that of the target molecule itself, and is robust to additional effects such as bursts and cell division. Our results are in quantitative agreement with the nonlinear increase and low noise of <i>mig-1</i> gene expression in migrating neuroblast cells during <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> development. These findings suggest that dynamic regulation may be a simple and powerful strategy for precise cellular timing.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5cQl5NSCSNQ" width="1" />

The Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is a complex, multifactorial disorder that develops slowly over time presenting itself with large differences among MetS patients. We applied a systems biology approach to describe and predict the onset and progressive development of MetS, in a study that combined <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in silico</i> models. A new data-driven, physiological model (MINGLeD: Model INtegrating Glucose and Lipid Dynamics) was developed, describing glucose, lipid and cholesterol metabolism. Since classic kinetic models cannot describe slowly progressing disorders, a simulation method (ADAPT) was used to describe longitudinal dynamics and to predict metabolic concentrations and fluxes. This approach yielded a novel model that can describe long-term MetS development and progression. This model was integrated with longitudinal <i>in vivo</i> data that was obtained from male APOE*3-Leiden.CETP mice fed a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet for three months and that developed MetS as reflected by classical symptoms including obesity and glucose intolerance. Two distinct subgroups were identified: those who developed dyslipidemia, and those who did not. The combination of MINGLeD with ADAPT could correctly predict both phenotypes, without making any prior assumptions about changes in kinetic rates or metabolic regulation. Modeling and flux trajectory analysis revealed that differences in liver fluxes and dietary cholesterol absorption could explain this occurrence of the two different phenotypes. In individual mice with dyslipidemia dietary cholesterol absorption and hepatic turnover of metabolites, including lipid fluxes, were higher compared to those without dyslipidemia. Predicted differences were also observed in gene expression data, and consistent with the emergence of insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis, two well-known MetS co-morbidities. Whereas MINGLeD specifically models the metabolic derangements underlying MetS, the simulation method ADAPT is generic and can be applied to other diseases where dynamic modeling and longitudinal data are available.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MIj7qbH_8I8" width="1" />

<p>Probabilistic atlases provide essential spatial contextual information for
image interpretation, Bayesian modeling, and algorithmic processing. Such
atlases are typically constructed by grouping subjects with similar demographic
information. Importantly, use of the same scanner minimizes inter-group
variability. However, generalizability and spatial specificity of such
approaches is more limited than one might like. Inspired by Commowick
"Frankenstein's creature paradigm" which builds a personal specific anatomical
atlas, we propose a data-driven framework to build a personal specific
probabilistic atlas under the large-scale data scheme. The data-driven
framework clusters regions with similar features using a point distribution
model to learn different anatomical phenotypes. Regional structural atlases and
corresponding regional probabilistic atlases are used as indices and targets in
the dictionary. By indexing the dictionary, the whole brain probabilistic
atlases adapt to each new subject quickly and can be used as spatial priors for
visualization and processing. The novelties of this approach are (1) it
provides a new perspective of generating personal specific whole brain
probabilistic atlases (132 regions) under data-driven scheme across sites. (2)
The framework employs the large amount of heterogeneous data (2349 images). (3)
The proposed framework achieves low computational cost since only one affine
registration and Pearson correlation operation are required for a new subject.
Our method matches individual regions better with higher Dice similarity value
when testing the probabilistic atlases. Importantly, the advantage the
large-scale scheme is demonstrated by the better performance of using
large-scale training data (1888 images) than smaller training set (720 images).

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02230">Color induction in equiluminant flashed stimuli. (arXiv:1806.02230v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>Color induction is the influence of the surrounding color (inducer) on the
perceived color of a central region. There are two different types of color
induction: color contrast (the color of the central region shifts away from
that of the inducer) and color assimilation (the color shifts towards the color
of the inducer). Several studies on these effects used uniform and striped
surrounds, reporting color contrast and color assimilation, respectively. Other
authors (Kaneko and Murakami, J Vision, 2012) studied color induction using
flashed uniform surrounds, reporting that the contrast was higher for shorter
flash duration. Extending their work, we present new psychophysical results
using both flashed and static (i.e., non-flashed) equiluminant stimuli for both
striped and uniform surround. Similarly to them, for uniform surround stimuli
we observed color contrast, but we did not obtain the maximum contrast for the
shortest (10 ms) flashed stimuli, but for 40 ms. We only observed this maximum
contrast for red, green and lime inducers, while for a purple inducer we
obtained an asymptotic profile along flash duration. For striped stimuli, we
observed color assimilation only for the static (infinite flash duration)
red-green surround inducers (red 1st inducer, green 2nd inducer). For the other
inducers' configurations, we observed color contrast or no induction. Since
other works showed that non-equiluminant striped static stimuli induce color
assimilation, our results also suggest that luminance differences could be a
key factor to induce it.

<p>Spike sorting refers to the problem of assigning action potentials observed
in extra-cellular recordings of neural activity to the neuron(s) from which
they originate. We cast this problem as one of learning a convolutional
dictionary from raw multi-electrode waveform data, subject to sparsity
constraints. In this context, sparsity refers to the number of neurons that are
allowed to spike simultaneously. The convolutional dictionary setting, along
with its assumptions (e.g. refractoriness) that are motivated by the
spike-sorting problem, let us give theoretical bounds on the sample complexity
of spike sorting as a function of the number of underlying neurons, the rate of
occurrence of simultaneous spiking, and the firing rate of the neurons. We
derive memory/computation-efficient convolutional versions of OMP (cOMP) and
KSVD (cKSVD), popular algorithms for sparse coding and dictionary learning
respectively. We demonstrate via simulations that an algorithm that alternates
between cOMP and cKSVD can recover the underlying spike waveforms successfully,
assuming few neurons spike simultaneously, and is stable in the presence of
noise. We also apply the algorithm to extra-cellular recordings from a tetrode
in the rat Hippocampus.

<p>Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are recently highly successful in
generative applications involving images and start being applied to time series
data. Here we describe EEG-GAN as a framework to generate
electroencephalographic (EEG) brain signals. We introduce a modification to the
improved training of Wasserstein GANs to stabilize training and investigate a
range of architectural choices critical for time series generation (most
notably up- and down-sampling). For evaluation we consider and compare
different metrics such as Inception score, Frechet inception distance and
sliced Wasserstein distance, together showing that our EEG-GAN framework
generated naturalistic EEG examples. It thus opens up a range of new generative
application scenarios in the neuroscientific and neurological context, such as
data augmentation in brain-computer interfacing tasks, EEG super-sampling, or
restoration of corrupted data segments. The possibility to generate signals of
a certain class and/or with specific properties may also open a new avenue for
research into the underlying structure of brain signals.

The human dopamine transporter (hDAT) is located on presynaptic neurons, where it plays an essential role in limiting dopaminergic signaling by temporarily curtailing high neurotransmitter concentration through rapid re-uptake. Transport by hDAT is energized by transmembrane ionic gradients. Dysfunction of this transporter leads to disease states, such as Parkinson’s disease, bipolar disorder or depression. It has been shown that hDAT and other members of the monoamine transporter family exist in oligomeric forms at the plasma membrane. Several residues are known to be involved in oligomerization, but interaction interfaces, oligomer orientation and the quarternary arrangement in the plasma membrane remain poorly understood. Here we examine oligomeric forms of hDAT using a direct approach, by following dimerization of two randomly-oriented hDAT transporters in 512 independent simulations, each being 2 μs in length. We employed the DAFT (docking assay for transmembrane components) approach, which is an unbiased molecular dynamics simulation method to identify oligomers, their conformations and populations. The overall ensemble of a total of &gt;1 ms simulation time revealed a limited number of symmetric and asymmetric dimers. The identified dimer interfaces include all residues known to be involved in dimerization. Importantly, we find that the surface of the bundle domain is largely excluded from engaging in dimeric interfaces. Such an interaction would typically lead to inhibition by stabilization of one conformation, while substrate transport relies on a large scale rotation between the inward-facing and the outward-facing state.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EkmGr5vNPfk" width="1" />

<p>by Lucas Boczkowski, Emanuele Natale, Ofer Feinerman, Amos Korman</p>

Biological systems can share and collectively process information to yield emergent effects, despite inherent noise in communication. While man-made systems often employ intricate structural solutions to overcome noise, the structure of many biological systems is more amorphous. It is not well understood how communication noise may affect the computational repertoire of such groups. To approach this question we consider the basic collective task of rumor spreading, in which information from few knowledgeable sources must reliably flow into the rest of the population. We study the effect of communication noise on the ability of groups that lack stable structures to efficiently solve this task. We present an impossibility result which strongly restricts reliable rumor spreading in such groups. Namely, we prove that, in the presence of even moderate levels of noise that affect all facets of the communication, no scheme can significantly outperform the trivial one in which agents have to wait until directly interacting with the sources—a process which requires linear time in the population size. Our results imply that in order to achieve efficient rumor spread a system must exhibit either some degree of structural stability or, alternatively, some facet of the communication which is immune to noise. We then corroborate this claim by providing new analyses of experimental data regarding recruitment in <i>Cataglyphis niger</i> desert ants. Finally, in light of our theoretical results, we discuss strategies to overcome noise in other biological systems.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/x-ijtk1KgGA" width="1" />

<p>by Koichi Higashi, Shinya Suzuki, Shin Kurosawa, Hiroshi Mori, Ken Kurokawa</p>

As data for microbial community structures found in various environments has increased, studies have examined the relationship between environmental labels given to retrieved microbial samples and their community structures. However, because environments continuously change over time and space, mixed states of some environments and its effects on community formation should be considered, instead of evaluating effects of discrete environmental categories. Here we applied a hierarchical Bayesian model to paired datasets containing more than 30,000 samples of microbial community structures and sample description documents. From the training results, we extracted latent environmental topics that associate co-occurring microbes with co-occurring word sets among samples. Topics are the core elements of environmental mixtures and the visualization of topic-based samples clarifies the connections of various environments. Based on the model training results, we developed a web application, LEA (Latent Environment Allocation), which provides the way to evaluate typicality and heterogeneity of microbial communities in newly obtained samples without confining environmental categories to be compared. Because topics link words and microbes, LEA also enables to search samples semantically related to the query out of 30,000 microbiome samples.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/o92_2kUTykI" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>Presurgical planning for brain tumor resection aims at delineating eloquent tissue in the vicinity of the lesion to spare during surgery. To this end, noninvasive neuroimaging techniques such as functional MRI and diffusion-weighted imaging fiber tracking are currently employed. However, taking into account this information is often still insufficient, as the complex nonlinear dynamics of the brain impede straightforward prediction of functional outcome after surgical intervention. Large-scale brain network modeling carries the potential to bridge this gap by integrating neuroimaging data with biophysically based models to predict collective brain dynamics. As a first step in this direction, an appropriate computational model has to be selected, after which suitable model parameter values have to be determined. To this end, we simulated large-scale brain dynamics in 25 human brain tumor patients and 11 human control participants using The Virtual Brain, an open-source neuroinformatics platform. Local and global model parameters of the Reduced Wong–Wang model were individually optimized and compared between brain tumor patients and control subjects. In addition, the relationship between model parameters and structural network topology and cognitive performance was assessed. Results showed (1) significantly improved prediction accuracy of individual functional connectivity when using individually optimized model parameters; (2) local model parameters that can differentiate between regions directly affected by a tumor, regions distant from a tumor, and regions in a healthy brain; and (3) interesting associations between individually optimized model parameters and structural network topology and cognitive performance.</p>

The specificity of these factors in transcriptional regulation is conferred by the complexes that they form with other proteins such as LIM-domain-binding (Ldb) proteins and LIM-domain only (LMO) proteins. Unlike LIM-TFs, these proteins do not bind DNA directly. LMO proteins are negative regulators of LIM-TFs and function by competing with LIM-TFs for binding to Ldb's. Although the LIM-TF Lmx1a is expressed in the developing mouse hindbrain, which provides many of the extrinsic signals for inner ear formation, conditional knock-out embryos of both sexes show that the inner ear source of Lmx1a is the major contributor of ear patterning. In addition, we have found that the reciprocal interaction between Lmx1a and Lmo4 (a LMO protein within the inner ear) mediates the formation of both vestibular and auditory structures. Lmo4 negatively regulates Lmx1a to form the three sensory cristae, the anterior semicircular canal, and the shape of the utricle in the vestibule. Furthermore, this negative regulation blocks ectopic sensory formation in the cochlea. In contrast, Lmx1a negatively regulates Lmo4 in mediating epithelial resorption of the canal pouch, which gives rise to the anterior and posterior semicircular canals. We also found that Lmx1a is independently required for the formation of the endolymphatic duct and hair cells in the basal cochlear region.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The mammalian inner ear is a structurally complex organ responsible for detecting sound and maintaining balance. Failure to form the intricate 3D structure of this organ properly during development most likely will result in sensory deficits on some level. Here, we provide genetic evidence that a transcription factor, Lmx1a, interacts with its negative regulator, Lmo4, to pattern various vestibular and auditory components of the mammalian inner ear. Identifying these key molecules that mediate formation of this important sensory organ will be helpful for designing strategies and therapeutics to alleviate hearing loss and balance disorders.</p>

<p>BDNF is a growth factor with important roles in the nervous system in both physiological and pathological conditions, but the mechanisms controlling its secretion are not completely understood. Here, we show that ARMS/Kidins220 negatively regulates BDNF secretion in neurons from the CNS and PNS. Downregulation of the ARMS/Kidins220 protein in the adult mouse brain increases regulated BDNF secretion, leading to its accumulation in the striatum. Interestingly, two mouse models of Huntington's disease (HD) showed increased levels of ARMS/Kidins220 in the hippocampus and regulated BDNF secretion deficits. Importantly, reduction of ARMS/Kidins220 in hippocampal slices from HD mice reversed the impaired regulated BDNF release. Moreover, there are increased levels of ARMS/Kidins220 in the hippocampus and PFC of patients with HD. ARMS/Kidins220 regulates Synaptotagmin-IV levels, which has been previously observed to modulate BDNF secretion. These data indicate that ARMS/Kidins220 controls the regulated secretion of BDNF and might play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of HD.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> BDNF is an important growth factor that plays a fundamental role in the correct functioning of the CNS. The secretion of BDNF must be properly controlled to exert its functions, but the proteins regulating its release are not completely known. Using neuronal cultures and a new conditional mouse to modulate ARMS/Kidins220 protein, we report that ARMS/Kidins220 negatively regulates BDNF secretion. Moreover, ARMS/Kidins220 is overexpressed in two mouse models of Huntington's disease (HD), causing an impaired regulation of BDNF secretion. Furthermore, ARMS/Kidins220 levels are increased in brain samples from HD patients. Future studies should address whether ARMS/Kidins220 has any function on the pathophysiology of HD.</p>

<p>Severed axon tips reform growth cones following spinal cord injury that fail to regenerate, in part, because they become embedded within an inhibitory extracellular matrix. Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) are the major axon inhibitory matrix component that is increased within the lesion scar and in perineuronal nets around deafferented neurons. We have recently developed a novel peptide modulator (intracellular sigma peptide) of the cognate receptor of CSPGs, protein tyrosine phosphatase  (RPTP), which has been shown to markedly improve sensorimotor function, micturition, and coordinated locomotor behavior in spinal cord contused rats. However, the mechanism(s) underlying how modulation of RPTP mediates axon outgrowth through inhibitory CSPGs remain unclear. Here, we describe how intracellular sigma peptide modulation of RPTP induces enhanced protease Cathepsin B activity. Using DRG neurons from female Sprague Dawley rats cultured on an aggrecan/laminin spot assay and a combination of biochemical techniques, we provide evidence suggesting that modulation of RPTP regulates secretion of proteases that, in turn, relieves CSPG inhibition through its digestion to allow axon migration though proteoglycan barriers. Understanding the mechanisms underlying RPTP modulation elucidates how axon regeneration is impaired by proteoglycans but can then be facilitated following injury.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Following spinal cord injury, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) upregulate and potently inhibit axon regeneration and functional recovery. Protein tyrosine phosphatase  (RPTP) has been identified as a critical cognate receptor of CSPGs. We have previously characterized a synthetic peptide (intracellular sigma peptide) that targets the regulatory intracellular domain of the receptor to allow axons to regenerate despite the presence of CSPGs. Here, we have found that one important mechanism by which peptide modulation of the receptor enhances axon outgrowth is through secretion of a protease, Cathepsin B, which enables digestion of CSPGs. This work links protease secretion to the CSPG receptor RPTP for the first time with implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying neural regeneration and plasticity.</p>

<p>How does human brain stimulation result in lasting changes in cortical excitability? Uncertainty on this question hinders the development of personalized brain stimulation therapies. To characterize how cortical excitability is altered by stimulation, we applied repetitive direct electrical stimulation in eight human subjects (male and female) undergoing intracranial monitoring. We evaluated single-pulse corticocortical-evoked potentials (CCEPs) before and after repetitive stimulation across prefrontal (<i>n</i> = 4), temporal (<i>n</i> = 1), and motor (<i>n</i> = 3) cortices. We asked whether a single session of repetitive stimulation was sufficient to induce excitability changes across distributed cortical sites. We found a subset of regions at which 10 Hz prefrontal repetitive stimulation resulted in both potentiation and suppression of excitability that persisted for at least 10 min. We then asked whether these dynamics could be modeled by the prestimulation connectivity profile of each subject. We found that cortical regions (1) anatomically close to the stimulated site and (2) exhibiting high-amplitude CCEPs underwent changes in excitability following repetitive stimulation. We demonstrate high accuracy (72–95%) and discriminability (81–99%) in predicting regions exhibiting changes using individual subjects' prestimulation connectivity profile, and show that adding prestimulation connectivity features significantly improved model performance. The same features predicted regions of modulation following motor and temporal cortices stimulation in an independent dataset. Together, baseline connectivity profile can be used to predict regions susceptible to brain changes and provides a basis for personalizing brain stimulation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Brain stimulation is increasingly used to treat neuropsychiatric disorders by inducing excitability changes at specific brain regions. However, our understanding of how, when, and where these changes are induced is critically lacking. We inferred plasticity in the human brain after applying electrical stimulation to the brain's surface and measuring changes in excitability. We observed excitability changes in regions anatomically and functionally closer to the stimulation site. Those in responsive regions were accurately predicted using a classifier trained on baseline brain network characteristics. Finally, we showed that the excitability changes can potentially be monitored in real-time. These results begin to fill basic gaps in our understanding of stimulation-induced brain dynamics in humans and offer pathways to optimize stimulation protocols.</p>

<p>The present study demonstrates HIV-1 Tat-mediated epigenetic downregulation of microglial miR-124 and its association with microglial activation. Exposure of mouse primary microglia isolated from newborn pups of either sex to HIV-1 Tat resulted in decreased expression of primary miR-124-1, primary miR-124-2 as well as the mature miR-124. In parallel, HIV-1 Tat exposure to mouse primary microglial cells resulted in increased expression of DNA methylation enzymes, such as DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B, which were also accompanied by increased global DNA methylation. Bisulfite-converted genomic DNA sequencing in the HIV-1 Tat-exposed mouse primary microglial cells further confirmed increased DNA methylation of the primary miR-124-1 and primary miR-124-2 promoters. Bioinformatic analyses identified MECP2 as a novel 3'-UTR target of miR-124. This was further validated in mouse primary microglial cells wherein HIV-1 Tat-mediated downregulation of miR-124 resulted in increased expression of MECP2, leading in turn to further repression of miR-124 via the feedback loop. In addition to MECP2, miR-124 also modulated the levels of STAT3 through its binding to the 3'-UTR, leading to microglial activation. Luciferase assays and Ago2 immunoprecipitation determined the direct binding between miR-124 and 3'-UTR of both MECP2 and STAT3. Gene silencing of <i>MECP2</i> and <i>DNMT1</i> and overexpression of miR-124 blocked HIV-1 Tat-mediated downregulation of miR-124 and microglial activation. <i>In vitro</i> findings were also confirmed in the basal ganglia of SIV-infected rhesus macaques (both sexes). In summary, our findings demonstrate a novel mechanism of HIV-1 Tat-mediated activation of microglia via downregulation of miR-124, leading ultimately to increased MECP2 and STAT3 signaling.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Despite the effectiveness of combination antiretroviral therapy in controlling viremia, the CNS continues to harbor viral reservoirs. The persistence of low-level virus replication leads to the accumulation of early viral proteins, including HIV-1 Tat protein. Understanding the epigenetic/molecular mechanism(s) by which viral proteins, such as HIV-1 Tat, can activate microglia is thus of paramount importance. This study demonstrated that HIV-1 Tat-mediated DNA methylation of the miR-124 promoter leads to its downregulation with a concomitant upregulation of the MECP2-STAT3-IL6, resulting in microglial activation. These findings reveal an unexplored epigenetic/molecular mechanism(s) underlying HIV-1 Tat-mediated microglial activation, thereby providing a potential target for the development of therapeutics aimed at ameliorating microglial activation and neuroinflammation in the context of HIV-1 infection.</p>

<p>Transporter-mediated glutamate uptake plays an essential role in shaping synaptic neurotransmission. The rapid removal of synaptically released glutamate ensures the high temporal dynamics characteristic of fast excitatory chemical neurotransmission and prevents the overexcitation of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors that have been implicated in synaptic plasticity impairments and cell death. Despite clear regional differences in plasticity and excitotoxic thresholds, few studies have compared extracellular glutamate dynamics across different brain regions and in response to a range of neural activity including plasticity-inducing stimuli. Here, we used the rapid extracellular fluorescent glutamate sensor iGluSnFR (intensity-based glutamate-sensing fluorescent reporter) and high-speed imaging (205 frames per second) to quantify relative differences in glutamate clearance rates over a wide range of presynaptic activity <i>in situ</i> in the hippocampus, cortex, and striatum of male C57/BL6NCrl mice. We found that the hippocampus was significantly more efficient than the cortex and striatum at clearing synaptically released glutamate and that this efficiency could be attributed, at least in part, to faster glutamate diffusion away from the release site. In addition, we found that pharmacological inhibition of GLT-1, the brain's most abundant glutamate transporter, slowed clearance rates to only a fraction (~20–25%) of the effect induced by nonselective transporter blockade, regardless of the brain region and the duration of presynaptic activity. In all, our data reveal clear regional differences in glutamate dynamics after neural activity and suggest that non-GLT-1 transporters can make a large contribution to the rate of glutamate clearance in the hippocampus, cortex, and striatum.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Glutamate is the brain's most abundant neurotransmitter, and although essential for rapid cell–cell communication, too much glutamate can negatively impact cellular health. Extracellular glutamate levels are tightly regulated by membrane-bound transporters that rapidly remove the glutamate that is released during neural activity, thereby shaping both the spatial and temporal dynamics of excitatory neurotransmission. Using high-speed imaging of an optical sensor of extracellular glutamate, we show that glutamate dynamics vary widely from one brain region to the next and are highly dependent on the duration of synaptic activity. Our data demonstrate the heterogeneous nature of glutamate regulation in the brain and suggest that such regional differences can dramatically affect both the localization and duration of postsynaptic receptor activation during synaptic neurotransmission.</p>

<p>Cholinergic afferents from the basal forebrain (BF) can influence cortical activity on rapid time scales, enabling sensory information processing and exploratory behavior. However, our understanding of how synaptically released acetylcholine (ACh) influences cellular targets in distinct cortical layers remains incomplete. Previous studies have shown that rapid changes in cortical dynamics induced by phasic BF activity can be mediated by the activation of nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs) expressed in distinct types of GABAergic interneurons. In contrast, muscarinic ACh receptors (mAChRs) are assumed to be involved in slower and more diffuse ACh signaling following sustained increases in afferent activity. Here, we examined the mechanisms underlying fast cholinergic control of cortical circuit dynamics by pairing optical stimulation of cholinergic afferents with evoked activity in somatosensory cortical slices of mice of either sex. ACh release evoked by single stimuli led to a rapid and persistent suppression of cortical activity, mediated by mAChRs expressed in layer 4 and to a lesser extent, by nAChRs in layers 1–3. In agreement, we found that cholinergic inputs to layer 4 evoked short-latency and long-lasting mAChR-dependent inhibition of the large majority of excitatory neurons, whereas inputs to layers 1–3 primarily evoked nAChR-dependent excitation of different classes of interneurons. Our results indicate that the rapid cholinergic control of cortical network dynamics is mediated by both nAChRs and mAChRs-dependent mechanisms, which are expressed in distinct cortical layers and cell types.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Acetylcholine (ACh) release from basal forebrain (BF) afferents to cortex influences a variety of cognitive functions including attention, sensory processing, and learning. Cholinergic control occurs on the time scale of seconds and is mediated by BF neurons that generate action potentials at low rates, indicating that ACh acts as a point-to-point neurotransmitter. Our findings highlight that even brief activation of cholinergic afferents can recruit both nicotinic and muscarinic ACh receptors expressed in several cell types, leading to modulation of cortical activity on distinct time scales. Furthermore, they indicate that the initial stages of cortical sensory processing are under direct cholinergic control.</p>

<p>To identify mechanisms of behavioral evolution, we investigated the hindbrain circuit that generates distinct vocal patterns in two closely related frog species. Male <i>Xenopus laevis</i> and <i>Xenopus petersii</i> produce courtship calls that include a fast trill: trains of ~60 Hz sound pulses. Although fast trill rates are similar, <i>X. laevis</i> fast trills have a longer duration and period than those of <i>X. petersii</i>. To pinpoint the neural basis of these differences, we used whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in a key premotor hindbrain nucleus (the <i>Xenopus</i> parabrachial area, PB<sub>X</sub>) in <i>ex vivo</i> brains that produce fictive vocalizations, vocal nerve activity corresponding to advertisement call patterns. We found two populations of PB<sub>X</sub> neurons with distinct properties: fast trill neurons (FTNs) and early vocal neurons (EVNs). FTNs, but not EVNs, appear to be intrinsically tuned to produce each species' call patterns because: (1) <i>X. laevis</i> FTNs generate longer and slower depolarizations than <i>X. petersii</i> FTNs during their respective fictive vocalizations, (2) current steps in FTNs induce burst durations that are significantly longer in <i>X. laevis</i> than <i>X. petersii</i>, and (3) synaptically isolated FTNs oscillate in response to NMDA in a species-specific manner: longer and slower in <i>X. laevis</i> than in <i>X. petersii</i>. Therefore, divergence of premotor neuron membrane properties is a strong candidate for generating vocal differences between species.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The vertebrate hindbrain includes multiple neural circuits that generate rhythmic behaviors including vocalizations. Male African clawed frogs produce courtship calls that are unique to each species and differ in temporal patterns. Here, we identified two functional subtypes of neurons located in the parabrachial nucleus: a hindbrain region implicated in vocal and respiratory control across vertebrates. One of these neuronal subtypes exhibits distinct properties across species that can account for the evolutionary divergence of song patterns. Our results suggest that changes to this group of neurons during evolution may have had a major role in establishing novel behaviors in closely related species.</p>

<p>Synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1) binds Ca<sup>2+</sup> through its tandem C2 domains (C2A and C2B) and triggers Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent neurotransmitter release. Here, we show that <i>snt-1</i>, the homolog of mammalian Syt1, functions as the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for both tonic and evoked neurotransmitter release at the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> neuromuscular junction. Mutations that disrupt Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding in double C2 domains of SNT-1 significantly impaired tonic release, whereas disrupting Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding in a single C2 domain had no effect, indicating that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding of the two C2 domains is functionally redundant for tonic release. Stimulus-evoked release was significantly reduced in <i>snt-1</i> mutants, with prolonged release latency as well as faster rise and decay kinetics. Unlike tonic release, evoked release was triggered by Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding solely to the C2B domain. Moreover, we showed that SNT-1 plays an essential role in the priming process in different subpopulations of synaptic vesicles with tight or loose coupling to Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We showed that SNT-1 in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> regulates evoked neurotransmitter release through Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to its C2B domain in a similar way to Syt1 in the mouse CNS and the fly neuromuscular junction. However, the largely decreased tonic release in <i>snt-1</i> mutants argues SNT-1 has a clamping function. Indeed, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding mutations in the C2 domains in SNT-1 significantly reduced the frequency of the miniature EPSC, indicating that SNT-1 also acts as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for tonic release. Therefore, revealing the differential mechanisms between invertebrates and vertebrates will provide significant insights into our understanding how synaptic vesicle fusion is regulated.</p>

<p>Disruptions of dopamine (DA) signaling contribute to a broad spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders, including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), addiction, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Despite evidence that risk for these disorders derives from heritable variation in DA-linked genes, a better understanding is needed of the molecular and circuit context through which gene variation drives distinct disease traits. Previously, we identified the DA transporter (DAT) variant Val559 in subjects with ADHD and established that the mutation supports anomalous DAT-mediated DA efflux (ADE). Here, we demonstrate that region-specific contributions of D<sub>2</sub> autoreceptors (D2AR) to presynaptic DA homeostasis dictate the consequences of Val559 expression in adolescent male mice. We show that activation of D2ARs in the WT dorsal striatum (DS), but not ventral striatum (VS), increases DAT phosphorylation and surface trafficking. In contrast, the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is D2AR-dependent in both regions. In the DS but not VS of Val559 mice, tonic activation of D2ARs drives a positive feedback loop that promotes surface expression of efflux-prone DATs, raising extracellular DA levels and overwhelming DAT-mediated DA clearance capacity. Whereas D2ARs that regulate DAT are tonically activated in the Val559 DS, D2ARs that regulate TH become desensitized, allowing maintenance of cytosolic DA needed to sustain ADE. Together with prior findings, our results argue for distinct D2AR pools that regulate DA synthesis versus DA release and inactivation and offer a clear example of how the penetrance of gene variation can be limited to a subset of expression sites based on differences in intersecting regulatory networks.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Altered dopamine (DA) signaling has been linked to multiple neuropsychiatric disorders. In an effort to understand and model disease-associated DAergic disturbances, we previously screened the DA transporter (DAT) in subjects with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and identified multiple, functionally impactful, coding variants. One of these variants, Val559, supports anomalous DA efflux (ADE) and in transgenic mice leads to changes in locomotor patterns, psychostimulant sensitivity, and impulsivity. Here, we show that the penetrance of Val559 ADE is dictated by region-specific differences in how presynaptic D<sub>2</sub>-type autoreceptors (D2ARs) constrain DA signaling, biasing phenotypic effects to dorsal striatal projections. The Val559 model illustrates how the impact of genetic variation underlying neuropsychiatric disorders can be shaped by the differential engagement of synaptic regulatory mechanisms.</p>

<p>Mutations or altered protein levels of SHANK3 are implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders such as Phelan–McDermid syndrome, autism spectrum disorders, and schizophrenia (Guilmatre et al., 2014). Loss of SHANK3 in mouse models results in decreased synapse density and reduction in the levels of multiple synaptic proteins (Jiang and Ehlers, 2013). The family of SHANK scaffolding molecules are among the most heavily ubiquitinated proteins at the postsynaptic density. The ubiquitin-dependent proteasome degradation of SHANK is regulated by synaptic activity and may contribute to activity-dependent synaptic remodeling (Ehlers, 2003; Shin et al., 2012). However, the identity of the specific deubiquitinating enzymes and E3 ligases that regulate SHANK ubiquitination at synapses are unknown. Here we identify USP8/UBPY as a deubiquitinating enzyme that regulates SHANK3 and SHANK1 ubiquitination and protein levels. In primary rat neurons, USP8 enhances SHANK3 and SHANK1 protein levels via deubiquitination and increases dendritic spine density. Additionally, USP8 is essential for changes in SHANK3 protein levels following synaptic activity modulation. These data identify USP8 as a key modulator of SHANK3 downstream of synaptic activity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Precise regulation of the protein levels of the postsynaptic scaffolding protein SHANK3 is essential for proper neurodevelopment. Mutations of <i>SHANK3</i> have been identified in Phelan–McDermid syndrome, autism spectrum disorders, and schizophrenia (Guilmatre et al., 2014). In this research, we identify USP8 as a key enzyme that regulates SHANK3 protein levels in neurons. USP8 acts to deubiquitinate SHANK3, which prevents its proteasomal-mediated degradation and enhances overall dendritic spine stability. In the future, the modulation of USP8 deubiquitinating activity could potentially be used to titrate the protein levels of SHANK3 to ameliorate disease.</p>

<p>Retinoic acid (RA) and its receptors (RARs) are well established essential transcriptional regulators during embryonic development. Recent findings in cultured neurons identified an independent and critical post-transcriptional role of RA and RARα in the homeostatic regulation of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in mature neurons. However, the functional relevance of synaptic RA signaling <i>in vivo</i> has not been established. Here, using somatosensory cortex as a model system and the RARα conditional knock-out mouse as a tool, we applied multiple genetic manipulations to delete RARα postnatally in specific populations of cortical neurons, and asked whether synaptic RA signaling observed in cultured neurons is involved in cortical information processing <i>in vivo</i>. Indeed, conditional ablation of RARα in mice via a CaMKIIα-Cre or a layer 5-Cre driver line or via somatosensory cortex-specific viral expression of Cre-recombinase impaired whisker-dependent texture discrimination, suggesting a critical requirement of RARα expression in L5 pyramidal neurons of somatosensory cortex for normal tactile sensory processing. Transcranial two-photon imaging revealed a significant increase in dendritic spine elimination on apical dendrites of somatosensory cortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons in these mice. Interestingly, the enhancement of spine elimination is whisker experience-dependent as whisker trimming rescued the spine elimination phenotype. Additionally, experiencing an enriched environment improved texture discrimination in RARα-deficient mice and reduced excessive spine pruning. Thus, RA signaling is essential for normal experience-dependent cortical circuit remodeling and sensory processing.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The importance of synaptic RA signaling has been demonstrated in <i>in vitro</i> studies. However, whether RA signaling mediated by RARα contributes to neural circuit functions <i>in vivo</i> remains largely unknown. In this study, using a RARα conditional knock-out mouse, we performed multiple regional/cell-type-specific manipulation of RARα expression in the postnatal brain, and show that RARα signaling contributes to normal whisker-dependent texture discrimination as well as regulating spine dynamics of apical dendrites from layer (L5) pyramidal neurons in S1. Deletion of RARα in excitatory neurons in the forebrain induces elevated spine elimination and impaired sensory discrimination. Our study provides novel insights into the role of RARα signaling in cortical processing and experience-dependent spine maturation.</p>

<p>Visual working memory (VWM) recruits a broad network of brain regions, including prefrontal, parietal, and visual cortices. Recent evidence supports a "sensory recruitment" model of VWM, whereby precise visual details are maintained in the same stimulus-selective regions responsible for perception. A key question in evaluating the sensory recruitment model is how VWM representations persist through distracting visual input, given that the early visual areas that putatively represent VWM content are susceptible to interference from visual stimulation.</p>
<p>To address this question, we used a functional magnetic resonance imaging inverted encoding model approach to quantitatively assess the effect of distractors on VWM representations in early visual cortex and the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), another region previously implicated in the storage of VWM information. This approach allowed us to reconstruct VWM representations for orientation, both before and after visual interference, and to examine whether oriented distractors systematically biased these representations. In our human participants (both male and female), we found that orientation information was maintained simultaneously in early visual areas and IPS in anticipation of possible distraction, and these representations persisted in the absence of distraction. Importantly, early visual representations were susceptible to interference; VWM orientations reconstructed from visual cortex were significantly biased toward distractors, corresponding to a small attractive bias in behavior. In contrast, IPS representations did not show such a bias. These results provide quantitative insight into the effect of interference on VWM representations, and they suggest a dynamic tradeoff between visual and parietal regions that allows flexible adaptation to task demands in service of VWM.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Despite considerable evidence that stimulus-selective visual regions maintain precise visual information in working memory, it remains unclear how these representations persist through subsequent input. Here, we used quantitative model-based fMRI analyses to reconstruct the contents of working memory and examine the effects of distracting input. Although representations in the early visual areas were systematically biased by distractors, those in the intraparietal sulcus appeared distractor-resistant. In contrast, early visual representations were most reliable in the absence of distraction. These results demonstrate the dynamic, adaptive nature of visual working memory processes, and provide quantitative insight into the ways in which representations can be affected by interference. Further, they suggest that current models of working memory should be revised to incorporate this flexibility.</p>

<p>Self-injurious behavior (SIB) is commonly observed in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders, as well as in nonclinical populations with stress-related mental-health problems. However, the exact circuitry mechanisms underlying SIB have remained poorly understood. Here, with bilateral injection of muscimol into the entopeduncular nucleus (EP), we established a rat model of SIB. Following the muscimol injection, the male rats exhibited in a dose-dependent manner stereotypic self-biting behavior that lasted for hours and often resulted in wounds of various severities. The SIB was associated with an elevated level of serum corticosterone and could be exacerbated by enhancing the corticosterone signaling and, conversely, alleviated by inhibiting the corticosterone signaling. Activity mapping using c-fos immunostaining, combined with connectivity mapping using herpes simplex virus-based anterograde tracing from the EP and pseudorabies virus-based retrograde tracing from the masseter muscle, revealed the potential involvement of many brain areas in SIB. In particular, the lateral habenula (LHb) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA), the two connected brain areas involved in stress response and reward processing, showed a significant increase in neuronal activation during SIB. Furthermore, suppressing the LHb activity or modulating the GABAergic transmission in the VTA could significantly reduce the occurrence of SIB. These results demonstrate the importance of stress hormone signaling and the LHb–VTA circuit in modulating SIB resulting from EP malfunction, and suggest potential targets for therapeutic intervention of SIB and related disorders.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Self-injurious behavior (SIB) occurs in ~4% of the general population, with substantially higher occurrence among adolescents and patients of neuropsychiatric disorders. Stress has been linked to the occurrence of SIB, yet the underlying mechanisms have remained unclear. Using a rat model of SIB induced by disruption of activity in the entopeduncular nucleus (EP), we found that the behavior is regulated by stress and linked to corticosterone signaling. Viral tracing and c-fos immunostaining revealed the involvement of various subcortical areas, especially the EP–lateral habenula (LHb)–ventral tegmental area (VTA) circuit, in SIB. Furthermore, regulating activity in the LHb or the VTA alleviates SIB. These results may have implications in the development of new strategies for treating SIB.</p>

<p>Neural progenitor cells in the developing dorsal forebrain give rise to excitatory neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes for the neocortex. While we are starting to gain a better understanding about the mechanisms that direct the formation of neocortical neurons and astrocytes, far less is known about the molecular mechanisms that instruct dorsal forebrain progenitors to make oligodendrocytes. In this study, we show that Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling is required in dorsal progenitors for their late embryonic transition to oligodendrogenesis. Using genetic lineage-tracing in mice of both sexes, we demonstrate that most oligodendrocytes in the embryonic neocortex derive from Emx1<sup>+</sup> dorsal forebrain progenitors. Deletion of the Shh signaling effector <i>Smo</i> specifically in Emx1<sup>+</sup> progenitors led to significantly decreased oligodendrocyte numbers in the embryonic neocortex. Conversely, knock-out of the Shh antagonist <i>Sufu</i> was sufficient to increase neocortical oligodendrogenesis. Using conditional knock-out strategies, we found that Shh ligand is supplied to dorsal progenitors through multiple sources. Loss of <i>Shh</i> from Dlx5/6<sup>+</sup> interneurons caused a significant reduction in oligodendrocytes in the embryonic neocortex. This phenotype was identical to that observed upon <i>Shh</i> deletion from the entire CNS using <i>Nestin-Cre</i>, indicating that interneurons migrating into the neocortex from the subpallium are the primary neural source of Shh for dorsal oligodendrogenesis. Additionally, deletion of <i>Shh</i> from migrating interneurons together with the choroid plexus epithelium led to a more severe loss of oligodendrocytes, suggesting that the choroid plexus is an important non-neural source of Shh ligand. Together, our studies demonstrate that the dorsal wave of neocortical oligodendrogenesis occurs earlier than previously appreciated and requires highly regulated Shh signaling from multiple embryonic sources.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Most neocortical oligodendrocytes are made by neural progenitors in the dorsal forebrain, but the mechanisms that specify this fate are poorly understood. This study identifies Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling as a critical pathway in the transition from neurogenesis to oligodendrogenesis in dorsal forebrain progenitors during late embryonic development. The timing of this neuron-to-glia "switch" coincides with the arrival of migrating interneurons into the dorsal germinal zone, which we identify as a critical source of Shh ligand, which drives oligodendrogenesis. Our data provide evidence for a new model in which Shh signaling increases in the dorsal forebrain late in embryonic development to provide a temporally regulated mechanism that initiates the third wave of neocortical oligodendrogenesis.</p>

Abstract<p>Animals and humans rapidly detect specific features of sounds, but the time courses of the underlying neural response for different stimulus categories is largely unknown. Furthermore, the intricate functional organization of auditory information processing pathways is poorly understood. Here, we computed neuronal response latencies from simultaneously recorded spike trains and local field potentials (LFPs) along the first two stages of cortical sound processing, primary auditory cortex (A1) and lateral belt (LB), of awake, behaving macaques. Two types of response latencies were measured for spike trains as well as LFPs: 1) <i>Onset latency,</i> time-locked to onset of external auditory stimuli, and 2) <i>selection latency,</i> time taken from stimulus onset to a selective response to a specific stimulus category. Trial-by-trial LFP onset latencies predominantly reflecting synaptic input arrival typically preceded spike onset latencies, assumed to be representative of neuronal output indicating that both areas may receive input environmental signals and relay the information to the next stage. In A1, simple sounds, such as pure tones, yielded shorter spike onset latencies compared to complex sounds, such as monkey vocalizations (‘coos’). This trend was reversed in LB, indicating a hierarchical functional organization of auditory cortex in the macaque. LFP selection latencies in A1 were always shorter than those in LB for both PT and Coo reflecting the serial arrival of stimulus-specific information in these areas. Thus, chronometry on spike-LFP signals revealed some of the effective neural circuitry underlying complex sound discrimination.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Auditory core (A1) and lateral belt (LB) areas are key subdivisions of auditory cortex. A1 plays crucial role in processing of simple stimuli such as pure tones whereas LB for processing of complex sounds. Both areas receive direct inputs from medial geniculate nucleus and have recurrent connections. Nonetheless, the functional connectivity patterns between these subdivisions while processing different sound categories are poorly understood. Using simultaneous spike-LFP recordings our study reveals that information about the presence of a stimuli in the environment arrive concurrently in core and LB, however the information related to neuronal discrimination may arrive at different times indicating both parallel and serial information transmission pathways exist and their presence is guided by the context of the task.</p>

<p>Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are becoming increasingly popular
models to predict neural responses in visual cortex. However, contextual
effects, which are prevalent in neural processing and in perception, are not
explicitly handled by current CNNs, including those used for neural prediction.
In primary visual cortex, neural responses are modulated by stimuli spatially
surrounding the classical receptive field in rich ways. These effects have been
modeled with divisive normalization approaches, including flexible models where
spatial normalization is recruited only to the degree responses from center and
surround locations are deemed statistically dependent. We propose a flexible
normalization model applied to mid-level representations of deep CNNs as a
tractable way to study contextual normalization mechanisms in mid-level visual
areas. This approach captures non-trivial spatial dependencies among mid-level
features in CNNs, such as those present in textures and other visual stimuli
that arise from tiling high order features, geometrically. We expect that the
proposed approach can make predictions about when spatial normalization might
be recruited in mid-level cortical areas. We also expect this approach to be
useful as part of the CNN toolkit, therefore going beyond more restrictive
fixed forms of normalization.

<p>How stable and general is behavior once reached maximum learning? To answer
this question and understand post-acquisition behavior and its related
individual differences, we explore analytic models of Pavlovian conditioning
extending the basic associative model of Hull (i.e., the Rescorla-Wagner model
with just one cue) and propose three new models valid for individual data,
which we argue to be quite natural. The first two are descriptive settings: (i)
a framework of dynamical models inspired by the classical mechanics of a
particle in a given potential, which comprises Hull model and also a specific
model encoding resistance to learning in the first few sessions followed by an
over-optimal response peak; (ii) the most direct stochastic extension of Hull
model, characterized by the presence of stochastic noise; (iii) a theory where
response fluctuations are described by quantum mechanics and based on the
general framework of dynamical models (i) explaining the noise met in (ii) and
giving characteristic predictions. We ran an unusually long experiment with 32
rats over 3960 trials, where we excluded habituation and other well-known
phenomena as sources of variability in the subjects' performance. The best
nonlinear regression to averaged data and 60% of individual data is Hull's
model, while for the remaining 40% of the subjects the dynamical model (i)
provides a better fit. The noise encountered in all individual responses is
white, thus confirming the simplest version of model (ii) but standing in
contrast with the colored-noise findings in human performance. Finally, data
are compatible with theory (iii), although experimental uncertainties dominate
the result. On the other hand, data do not favor models with a long-memory
effect or where response variability is solely described by a random fractal.

<p>Synchronization plays a fundamental role in healthy cognitive and motor
function. However, how synchronization depends on the interplay between local
dynamics, coupling and topology and how prone to synchronization a network with
given topological organization is are still poorly understood issues. To
investigate the synchronizability of both anatomical and functional brain
networks various studies resorted to the Master Stability Function (MSF)
formalism, an elegant tool which allows analysing the stability of synchronous
states in a dynamical system consisting of many coupled oscillators. Here, we
argue that brain dynamics does not fulfil the formal criteria under which
synchronizability is usually quantified and, perhaps more importantly, what
this measure itself quantifies refers to a global dynamical condition that
never holds in the brain (not even in the most pathological conditions), and
therefore no neurophysiological conclusions should be drawn based on it. We
discuss the meaning of synchronizability and its applicability to neuroscience
and propose alternative ways to quantify brain networks synchronization.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Learning to associate stressful events with specific environmental contexts depends on excitatory transmission in the hippocampus, but how this information is transmitted to the neocortex for lasting memory storage is unclear. We identified dorsal hippocampal (DH) projections to the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), which arise mainly from the subiculum and contain either the vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGlut1) or vGlut2. Both vGlut1<sup>+</sup> and vGlut2<sup>+</sup> axons strongly excite and disynaptically inhibit RSC pyramidal neurons in superficial layers, but vGlut2<sup>+</sup> axons trigger greater inhibition that spreads to deep layers, indicating that these pathways engage RSC circuits via partially redundant, partially differentiated cellular mechanisms. Using contextual fear conditioning in mice to model contextual associative memories, together with chemogenetic axonal silencing, we found that vGlut1<sup>+</sup> projections are principally involved in processing recent context memories whereas vGlut2<sup>+</sup> projections contribute to their long-lasting storage. Thus, within the DH→RSC pathway, engagement of vGlut1<sup>+</sup> and vGlut2<sup>+</sup> circuits differentially contribute to the formation and persistence of fear-inducing context memories.</span>

Whereas accumulating evidence indicates that specification of subclasses of neocortical neurons starts at the time of their final mitotic divisions, when cellular diversity is specified in the Dentate Gyrus remains largely unknown. Here we show that semilunar cells, like mossy cells, originate from the earliest stages of developmental neurogenesis and that early born neurons form age-matched circuits with each other. Besides morphology, adult semilunar cells display characteristic electrophysiological features that differ from most neurons but are shared among early born granule cells. Therefore, an early birthdate specifies adult granule cell physiology and connectivity whereas additional factors may combine to produce morphological identity.</span>

This account has been inconclusive because it is based on neuropsychological evidence, in which lesion-deficit relationships are difficult to localize precisely, and functional neuroimaging data, which is spatially precise but cannot demonstrate whether the ATL activity is necessary for exception word reading. To address these issues, we used a technique with good spatial specificity—repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)—to demonstrate a necessary role of ATL in exception word reading. Following rTMS to left ventral ATL, healthy Japanese adults made more regularization errors in reading Japanese exception words. We successfully simulated these results in a computational model in which exception word reading was underpinned by semantic activations. The ATL is critically and selectively involved in reading exception words.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) offers the opportunity to delineate individual-specific brain networks. A major question is whether individual-specific network topography (i.e., location and spatial arrangement) is behaviorally relevant. Here, we propose a multi-session hierarchical Bayesian model (MS-HBM) for estimating individual-specific cortical networks and investigate whether individual-specific network topography can predict human behavior. The multiple layers of the MS-HBM explicitly differentiate intra-subject (within-subject) from inter-subject (between-subject) network variability. By ignoring intra-subject variability, previous network mappings might confuse intra-subject variability for inter-subject differences. Compared with other approaches, MS-HBM parcellations generalized better to new rs-fMRI and task-fMRI data from the same subjects. More specifically, MS-HBM parcellations estimated from a single rs-fMRI session (10 min) showed comparable generalizability as parcellations estimated by 2 state-of-the-art methods using 5 sessions (50 min). We also showed that behavioral phenotypes across cognition, personality, and emotion could be predicted by individual-specific network topography with modest accuracy, comparable to previous reports predicting phenotypes based on connectivity strength. Network topography estimated by MS-HBM was more effective for behavioral prediction than network size, as well as network topography estimated by other parcellation approaches. Thus, similar to connectivity <span style="font-style: italic;">strength</span>, individual-specific network <span style="font-style: italic;">topography</span> might also serve as a fingerprint of human behavior.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The hallmark pathology underlying Parkinson disease (PD) is progressive synucleinopathy, beginning in caudal brainstem that later spreads rostrally. However, the primarily subcortical pathology fails to account for the wide spectrum of clinical manifestations in PD. To reconcile these observations, resting-state functional dysfunction across connectivity (FC) can be used to examine dysfunction across distributed brain networks. We measured FC in a large, single-site study of nondemented PD (<span style="font-style: italic;">N</span> = 107; OFF medications) and healthy controls (<span style="font-style: italic;">N</span> = 46) incorporating rigorous quality control measures and comprehensive sampling of cortical, subcortical and cerebellar regions. We employed novel statistical approaches to determine group differences across the entire connectome, at the network-level, and for select brain regions. Group differences respected well-characterized network delineations producing a striking “block-wise” pattern of network-to-network effects. Surprisingly, these results demonstrate that the greatest FC differences involve sensorimotor, thalamic, and cerebellar networks, with notably smaller striatal effects. Split-half replication demonstrates the robustness of these results. Finally, block-wise FC correlations with behavior suggest that FC disruptions may contribute to clinical manifestations in PD. Overall, these results indicate a concerted breakdown of functional network interactions, remote from primary pathophysiology, and suggest that FC deficits in PD are related to emergent network-level phenomena rather than focal pathology.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Modifications of neuronal migration during development, including processes that control cortical lamination are associated with functional deficits at adult stage. Here, we report for the first time that the lack of the serine protease tissue-type Plasminogen Activator (tPA), previously characterized as a neuromodulator and a gliotransmitter, leads to an altered cortical lamination in adult. This results in a neuronal migration defect of tPA deficient neurons which are stopped in the intermediate zone at E16. This phenotype is rescued by re-expressing a wild-type tPA in cortical neurons at E14 but not by a tPA that cannot interact with NMDAR. We thus hypothetized that the tPA produced by cortical neuronal progenitors can control their own radial migration through a mechanism dependent of NMDAR expressed at the surface of radial glial cells (RGC). Accordingly, conditional deletion of tPA in neuronal progenitors at E14 or overexpression of a dominant-negative NMDAR that cannot bind tPA in RGC also delayed neuronal migration. Moreover, the lack of tPA lead to an impaired maturation and orientation of RGC. These data provide the first demonstration that the neuronal serine protease tPA is an actor of a proper corticogenesis by its ability to control NMDAR signaling in RGC.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Recent studies of semantic memory have focused on dissociating the neural bases of two foundational components of human thought: taxonomic categories, which group similar objects like dogs and seals based on features, and thematic categories, which group dissimilar objects like dogs and leashes based on events. While there is emerging consensus that taxonomic concepts are represented in the anterior temporal lobe, there is disagreement over whether thematic concepts are represented in the angular gyrus (AG). We previously found AG sensitivity to both kinds of concepts; however, some accounts suggest that such activity reflects inhibition of irrelevant information rather than thematic activation. To test these possibilities, an fMRI experiment investigated both types of conceptual relations in the AG during two semantic judgment tasks. Each task trained participants to give negative responses (inhibition) or positive responses (activation) to word pairs based on taxonomic and thematic criteria of relatedness. Results showed AG engagement during both negative judgments and thematic judgments, but not during positive judgments about taxonomic pairs. Together, the results suggest that activity in the AG reflects functions that include both thematic (but not taxonomic) processing and inhibiting irrelevant semantic information.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>One critical feature of any well-engineered system is its resilience to perturbation and minor damage. The purpose of the current study was to investigate how resilience is achieved in higher cognitive systems, which we explored through the domain of semantic cognition. Convergent evidence implicates the bilateral anterior temporal lobes (ATLs) as a conceptual knowledge hub. While bilateral damage to this region produces profound semantic impairment, unilateral atrophy/resection or transient perturbation has a limited effect. Two neural mechanisms might underpin this resilience to unilateral ATL damage: 1) the undamaged ATL upregulates its activation in order to compensate; and/or 2) prefrontal regions involved in control of semantic retrieval upregulate to compensate for the impoverished semantic representations that follow from ATL damage. To test these possibilities, 34 postsurgical temporal lobe epilepsy patients and 20 age-matched controls were scanned whilst completing semantic tasks. Pictorial tasks, which produced bilateral frontal and temporal activation, showed few activation differences between patients and control participants. Written word tasks, however, produced a left-lateralized activation pattern and greater differences between the groups. Patients with right ATL resection increased activation in left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Patients with left ATL resection upregulated both the right ATL and right IFG. Consistent with recent computational models, these results indicate that 1) written word semantic processing in patients with ATL resection is supported by upregulation of semantic knowledge and control regions, principally in the undamaged hemisphere, and 2) pictorial semantic processing is less affected, presumably because it draws on a more bilateral network.</span>

Mechanisms of epigenetic regulation, including DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, and histone post-translational modifications, are involved in multiple aspects of neuronal function and development. Recent discoveries have shed light on critical functions of chromatin in the aging brain, with an emerging realization that the maintenance of a healthy brain relies heavily on epigenetic mechanisms. Here, we present recent advances, with a focus on histone modifications and the implications for several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Huntington’s disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

<p>by Christian Klos, Daniel Miner, Jochen Triesch</p>

Recent experiments have demonstrated that visual cortex engages in spatio-temporal sequence learning and prediction. The cellular basis of this learning remains unclear, however. Here we present a spiking neural network model that explains a recent study on sequence learning in the primary visual cortex of rats. The model posits that the sequence learning and prediction abilities of cortical circuits result from the interaction of spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) and homeostatic plasticity mechanisms. It also reproduces changes in stimulus-evoked multi-unit activity during learning. Furthermore, it makes precise predictions regarding how training shapes network connectivity to establish its prediction ability. Finally, it predicts that the adapted connectivity gives rise to systematic changes in spontaneous network activity. Taken together, our model establishes a new conceptual bridge between the structure and function of cortical circuits in the context of sequence learning and prediction.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zOLtDY7_1Wk" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>Action potentials (APs) are electric phenomena that are recorded both intracellularly and extracellularly. APs are usually initiated in the short segment of the axon called the axon initial segment (AIS). It was recently proposed that at the onset of an AP the soma and the AIS form a dipole. We study the extracellular signature [the extracellular AP (EAP)] generated by such a dipole. First, we demonstrate the formation of the dipole and its extracellular signature in detailed morphological models of a reconstructed pyramidal neuron. Then, we study the EAP waveform and its spatial dependence in models with axonal AP initiation and contrast it with the EAP obtained in models with somatic AP initiation. We show that in the models with axonal AP initiation the dipole forms between somatodendritic compartments and the AIS, and not between soma and dendrites as in the classical models. The soma–dendrites dipole is present only in models with somatic AP initiation. Our study has consequences for interpreting extracellular recordings of single-neuron activity and determining electrophysiological neuron types, but also for better understanding the origins of the high-frequency macroscopic extracellular potentials recorded in the brain.</p>

Abstract<p>Phelan-McDermid Syndrome (PMS) is a rare genetic disorder in which one copy of the <i>SHANK3</i> gene is missing or mutated, leading to a global developmental delay, intellectual disability, and autism. Multiple intragenic promoters and alternatively spliced exons are responsible for the formation of numerous isoforms. Many genetically-modified mouse models of PMS have been generated but most disrupt only some of the isoforms. In contrast, the vast majority of known <i>SHANK3</i> mutations found in patients involve deletions that disrupt all isoforms. Here, we report the production and thorough behavioral characterization of a new mouse model in which all <i>Shank3</i> isoforms are disrupted. Domains and tasks examined in adults included measures of general health, neurological reflexes, motor abilities, sensory reactivity, social behavior, repetitive behaviors, cognition and behavioral inflexibility and anxiety. Our mice are more severely affected than previously published models. While the deficits were typically more pronounced in homozygotes, an intermediate phenotype was observed for heterozygotes in many paradigms. As in other <i>Shank3</i> mouse models, stereotypies, including increased grooming, were observed. Additionally, sensory alterations were detected in both neonatal and adult mice and motor behavior was strongly altered, especially in the open field and rotarod locomotor tests. While social behaviors measured with the 3-chambered social approach and male-female interaction tests were not strongly impacted, Shank3-deficient mice displayed a strong escape behavior and avoidance of inanimate objects in novel object recognition, repetitive novel object contact, marble burying and nest building tasks, indicating increased novelty-induced anxiety. Similarly, increased freezing was observed during fear conditioning training and amygdala-dependent cued retrieval. Finally, deficits were observed in both initial training and reversal in the Barnes maze and in contextual fear memory that are memory tasks involving hippocampal-prefrontal circuits. In contrast, working memory in the Y-maze spontaneous alternation test was not altered. This new mouse model of PMS, engineered to most closely represent human mutations, recapitulates core symptoms of PMS providing improvements for both construct and face validity, compared to previous models.</p><p><b>Significant Statement</b> Phelan-McDermid syndrome, caused by happloinsufficiency of <i>Shank3</i>, is a severe and complex neurodevelopmental disorder. This study investigates the behavioral consequences of a disruption of all <i>Shank3</i> isoforms in neonatal and adult mice using a detailed battery o<i>f</i> tests tailored to investigate core symptoms and usual comorbidities of PMS. We found that our new model is more severely affected than previously published mouse models with only partial deletions of <i>Shank3</i> and more closely recapitulates symptoms of PMS thus providing improvements for both construct and face validity. Our results highlight the significance of using a mouse model with a complete deletion of <i>Shank3</i> for studying mechanisms underlying autism spectrum disorder and PMS, carrying preclinical studies and testing test novel therapeutic approaches.</p>

<p>by Philipp Schustek, Rubén Moreno-Bote</p>

While previous studies have shown that human behavior adjusts in response to uncertainty, it is still not well understood how uncertainty is estimated and represented. As probability distributions are high dimensional objects, only constrained families of distributions with a low number of parameters can be specified from finite data. However, it is unknown what the structural assumptions are that the brain uses to estimate them. We introduce a novel paradigm that requires human participants of either sex to explicitly estimate the dispersion of a distribution over future observations. Judgments are based on a very small sample from a centered, normally distributed random variable that was suggested by the framing of the task. This probability density estimation task could optimally be solved by inferring the dispersion parameter of a normal distribution. We find that although behavior closely tracks uncertainty on a trial-by-trial basis and resists an explanation with simple heuristics, it is hardly consistent with parametric inference of a normal distribution. Despite the transparency of the simple generating process, participants estimate a distribution biased towards the observed instances while still strongly generalizing beyond the sample. The inferred internal distributions can be well approximated by a nonparametric mixture of spatially extended basis distributions. Thus, our results suggest that fluctuations have an excessive effect on human uncertainty judgments because of representations that can adapt overly flexibly to the sample. This might be of greater utility in more general conditions in structurally uncertain environments.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/o3YR8jyibrQ" width="1" />

Determining how proteins interact to form stable complexes is of crucial importance, for example in the development of novel therapeutics. Computational methods to determine the thermodynamically stable conformation of complexes from the structure of the binding partners, such as RosettaDock, might potentially emerge to become a promising alternative to traditional structure determination methods. However, while models virtually identical to the correct experimental structure can in some cases be generated, the main difficulty remains to discriminate correct or approximately correct models from decoys. This is due to the ruggedness of the free-energy landscape, the approximations intrinsic in the scoring functions, and the intrinsic flexibility of proteins. Here we show that molecular dynamics simulations performed starting from a number top-scoring models can not only discriminate decoys and identify the correct structure, but may also provide information on an initial map of the free energy landscape that elucidates the binding mechanism.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nukuSUmhrVc" width="1" />

<p>by Xiaoru Xue, Chuan Xue, Min Tang</p>

Recent experiments showed that engineered <i>Escherichia coli</i> colonies grow and self-organize into periodic stripes with high and low cell densities in semi-solid agar. The stripes develop sequentially behind a radially propagating colony front, similar to the formation of many other periodic patterns in nature. These bacteria were created by genetically coupling the intracellular chemotaxis pathway of wild-type cells with a quorum sensing module through the protein CheZ. In this paper, we develop multiscale models to investigate how this intracellular pathway affects stripe formation. We first develop a detailed hybrid model that treats each cell as an individual particle and incorporates intracellular signaling via an internal ODE system. To overcome the computational cost of the hybrid model caused by the large number of cells involved, we next derive a mean-field PDE model from the hybrid model using asymptotic analysis. We show that this analysis is justified by the tight agreement between the PDE model and the hybrid model in 1D simulations. Numerical simulations of the PDE model in 2D with radial symmetry agree with experimental data semi-quantitatively. Finally, we use the PDE model to make a number of testable predictions on how the stripe patterns depend on cell-level parameters, including cell speed, cell doubling time and the turnover rate of intracellular CheZ.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/s7yiJrNeGjk" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>Pyramidal neurons in hippocampal area CA2 are distinct from neighboring CA1 in that they resist synaptic long-term potentiation (LTP) at CA3 Schaffer collateral synapses. Regulator of G protein signaling 14 (RGS14) is a complex scaffolding protein enriched in CA2 dendritic spines that naturally blocks CA2 synaptic plasticity and hippocampus-dependent learning, but the cellular mechanisms by which RGS14 gates LTP are largely unexplored. A previous study has attributed the lack of plasticity to higher rates of calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) buffering and extrusion in CA2 spines. Additionally, a recent proteomics study revealed that RGS14 interacts with two key Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated proteins in CA2 neurons: calcium/calmodulin and CaMKII. Here, we investigated whether RGS14 regulates Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in its host CA2 neurons. We found that the nascent LTP of CA2 synapses caused by genetic knockout (KO) of RGS14 in mice requires Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent postsynaptic signaling through NMDA receptors, CaMK, and PKA, revealing similar mechanisms to those in CA1. We report that RGS14 negatively regulates the long-term structural plasticity of dendritic spines of CA2 neurons. We further show that wild-type (WT) CA2 neurons display significantly attenuated spine Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients during structural plasticity induction compared with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients from CA2 spines of RGS14 KO mice and CA1 controls. Finally, we demonstrate that acute overexpression of RGS14 is sufficient to block spine plasticity, and elevating extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels restores plasticity to RGS14-expressing neurons. Together, these results demonstrate for the first time that RGS14 regulates plasticity in hippocampal area CA2 by restricting Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations in CA2 spines and downstream signaling pathways.</p>

Abstract
<p>Aging increases the risk of abrupt declines in cognitive function after an event that triggers immune system activation (e.g. surgery, infection, or injury). This phenomenon is poorly understood, but rodent models may provide clues. We have previously shown that aging (24-mo-old) F344xBN rats generally do not show significant physical or cognitive impairments. However, their brains mount an exaggerated inflammatory response to signals triggered by a peripheral immune challenge (an intraperitoneal injection of <i>Escherichia coli</i> or laparotomy). Their hippocampal levels of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β are significantly elevated for at least 8 d, but generally less than 14 d, after infection or surgery. This IL-1β elevation is mirrored by prolonged deficits in a hippocampus-dependent long-term memory task. In contrast, young (3-mo-old) counterparts exhibit only transient elevations in IL-1β that drop to near baseline levels within 24 h. We previously demonstrated that theta burst–evoked late-phase long-term potentiation (L-LTP)—a BDNF-dependent form of synaptic plasticity—is impaired in hippocampal area CA1 of aged animals 4 d after infection. Also, levels of mature brain-derived neurotrophic factor (mBDNF)—the protein isoform required for stabilization of L-LTP—are reduced in hippocampal synaptoneurosomes of aged animals at the same time point. In this study, we investigated whether the deficits in L-LTP and mBDNF persist in parallel with the elevation in IL-1β and impairment in memory. This was the case, consistent with the idea that an exaggerated brain inflammatory response may compromise memory consolidation in part by altering availability of mBDNF to stabilize memory-related synaptic plasticity.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0159-18.2018v1?rss=1">Neurodynamic Evidence Supports a Forced-Excursion Model of Decision-Making under Speed/Accuracy Instructions</a></h4>

Abstract<p>Evolutionary pressures suggest that choices should be optimised to maximise rewards, by appropriately trading speed for accuracy. This speed-accuracy tradeoff (SAT) is commonly explained by variation in just the baseline-to-boundary distance, i.e. excursion, of accumulation-to-bound models of perceptual decision making. However, neural evidence is not consistent with this explanation. A compelling account of speeded choice should explain both overt behaviour and the full range of associated brain signatures. Here, we reconcile seemingly contradictory behavioural and neural findings. In two variants of the same experiment, we triangulated upon the neural underpinnings of the SAT in the human brain using both EEG and TMS. We found that distinct neural signals, namely the ERP centroparietal positivity (CPP) and a smoothed motor-evoked potential (MEP) signal, which have both previously been shown to relate to decision-related accumulation, revealed qualitatively similar average neurodynamic profiles with only subtle differences between SAT conditions. These signals were then modelled from behaviour by either incorporating traditional boundary variation or utilising a forced excursion. These model variants are mathematically equivalent, in terms of their behavioural predictions, hence providing identical fits to correct and erroneous reaction time distributions. However, the forced-excursion version instantiates SAT via a more global change in parameters and implied neural activity, a process conceptually akin to, but mathematically distinct from, urgency. This variant better captured both ERP and MEP neural profiles, suggesting that the SAT may be implemented via neural gain modulation, and reconciling standard modelling approaches with human neural data.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Successful organisms need to make the right choice fast. To make such decisions, we are regularly forced to trade speed for accuracy. This trade-off has been explained in behavioural models using a single free parameter reflecting response caution. However, neural evidence suggests that more widespread changes are associated with quick versus accurate decisions. Here, we suggest a model which reconciles these seemingly contradictory findings. This ‘forced-excursion’ model is mathematically equivalent to standard models of response caution but implies a global modulation in activity akin to a change in neural gain or urgency. Re-expressed in this way, the model is able to account for both behavioural and neural data from two separate neural recording techniques.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0125-18.2018v1?rss=1">Ethanol Regulates Presynaptic Activity and Sedation through Presynaptic Unc13 Proteins in Drosophila</a></h4>

Abstract<p>Ethanol has robust effects on presynaptic activity in many neurons, however, it isn't yet clear how this drug acts within this compartment to change neural activity, nor the significance of this change on behavior and physiology <i>in vivo</i>. One possible presynaptic effector for ethanol is the Munc13-1 protein. Herein, we show that ethanol binding to the rat Munc13-1 C1 domain, at concentrations consistent with binge exposure, reduces diacylglycerol binding. The inhibition of diacylglycerol binding is predicted to reduce the activity of Munc13-1 and presynaptic release. In <i>Drosophila</i>, we show that sedating concentrations of ethanol significantly reduce synaptic vesicle release in olfactory sensory neurons, while having no significant impact on membrane depolarization and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into the presynaptic compartment. These data indicate that ethanol targets the active zone in reducing synaptic vesicle exocytosis. <i>Drosophila,</i> haploinsufficent for the Munc13-1 ortholog <i>Dunc13</i>, are more resistant to the effect of ethanol on presynaptic inhibition. Genetically reducing the activity of <i>Dunc13</i> through mutation or expression of RNAi transgenes also leads to a significant resistance to the sedative effects of ethanol. The neuronal expression of <i>Munc13-1</i> in heterozygotes for a <i>Dunc13</i> loss-of-function mutation can largely rescue the ethanol sedation resistance phenotype, indicating a conservation of function between <i>Munc13-1</i> and <i>Dunc13</i> in ethanol sedation. Hence, reducing <i>Dunc13</i> activity leads to naïve physiological and behavioral resistance to sedating concentrations of ethanol. We propose that reducing <i>Dunc13</i> activity, genetically or pharmacologically by ethanol binding to the C1 domain of Munc13-1/Dunc13, promotes a homeostatic response that leads to ethanol tolerance.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> At relatively low concentrations, ethanol inhibits the activity of many presynaptic termini (Liu and Hunt, 1999). Homeostatic changes in presynaptic activity are proposed to underlie the formation of functional tolerance (Koob and Bloom, 1988; Ghezzi and Atkinson, 2011). We do not currently know where ethanol binds to bring about changes in presynaptic activity and homeostasis. We now show that ethanol will bind to the C1 domain of the Munc13-1 protein at intoxicating concentrations and inhibit the binding of diacylglycerol. Reducing the activity of the <i>Drosophila</i> Dunc13 ortholog leads to a homeostatic change that promotes behavioral and physiologic resistance to intoxicating levels of ethanol. Hence, Unc13 proteins are likely sites for ethanol’s action within the presynaptic compartment that bring about tolerance.</p>

As in all biological systems, neurons and their networks must balance precision with variability. Phenotypic precision and phenotypic variability can both occur with remarkable robustness, where robustness is defined as the ability to tolerate perturbation. Variability in genotype–phenotype mapping produces phenotypic variability despite identical genetic information. The resulting variability among genetically identical neurons can contribute to the robustness of brain development. Similarly, variability of genetically identical individuals can contribute to evolutionary robustness.

In 2012, Schaefer et al. revealed that microglia regulate the emergence of functional connectivity by engulfing and selectively eliminating synapses in the retinogeniculate system. This synaptic pruning mechanism, which is activity dependent and relies on the complement cascade, has helped define microglia as a central contributor to normal wiring and to brain disorders.

By the early 2000s there was strong support for the idea that synaptic function and plasticity required AMPA glutamate receptor trafficking through constitutive and regulated internalization and exocytosis. In 2002, Borgdorff and Choquet demonstrated that AMPA receptors could also diffuse laterally in the membrane and become stabilized near synapses. Subsequent studies extended this work, establishing a fundamental role for lateral diffusion in synaptic function and plasticity.

Today, we understand peptide transmitters to be signaling molecules that modulate neural activity. However, in 1982 little was known about neuropeptides and their role in neural communication. The influential 1982 paper by Jan and Jan reported definitive evidence that a presynaptically released neuropeptide evokes postsynaptic responses in an identified cholinergic synapse, thereby fueling a new era in neuroscience.

In 1992, Brose et al. showed that the synaptic vesicle (SV) protein p65/synaptotagmin (syt) 1 binds – in a mutually dependent manner – Ca2+ and anionic phospholipids, prompting the idea that it functions as a Ca2+ sensor for exocytosis. These findings now define two key aspects of excitation–secretion coupling.

Seizures occur in a recurrent manner with intermittent states of interictal and ictal discharges (IIDs and IDs). The transitions to and from IDs are determined by a set of processes, including synaptic interaction and ionic dynamics. Although mathematical models of separate types of epileptic discharges have been developed, modeling the transitions between states remains a challenge. A simple generic mathematical model of seizure dynamics (Epileptor) has recently been proposed by Jirsa et al. (2014); however, it is formulated in terms of abstract variables. In this paper, a minimal population-type model of IIDs and IDs is proposed that is as simple to use as the Epileptor, but the suggested model attributes physical meaning to the variables. The model is expressed in ordinary differential equations for extracellular potassium and intracellular sodium concentrations, membrane potential, and short-term synaptic depression variables. A quadratic integrate-and-fire model driven by the population input current is used to reproduce spike trains in a representative neuron. In simulations, potassium accumulation governs the transition from the silent state to the state of an ID. Each ID is composed of clustered IID-like events. The sodium accumulates during discharge and activates the sodium-potassium pump, which terminates the ID by restoring the potassium gradient and thus polarizing the neuronal membranes. The whole-cell and cell-attached recordings of a 4-AP-based in vitro model of epilepsy confirmed the primary model assumptions and predictions. The mathematical analysis revealed that the IID-like events are large-amplitude stochastic oscillations, which in the case of ID generation are controlled by slow oscillations of ionic concentrations. The IDs originate in the conditions of elevated potassium concentrations in a bath solution via a saddle-node-on-invariant-circle-like bifurcation for a non-smooth dynamical system. By providing a minimal biophysical description of ionic dynamics and network interactions, the model may serve as a hierarchical base from a simple to more complex modeling of seizures.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XazCEKR1hck" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Dopamine plays a key role in the cellular and behavioral responses to drugs of abuse, but the implication of metabotropic regulatory input to dopaminergic neurons on acute drug effects and subsequent drug-related behavior remains unclear. Here, we used chemogenetics (DREADD; Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs) to modulate dopamine signaling and activity prior to cocaine administration in mice. We show that chemogenetic inhibition of dopaminergic ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons differentially affects locomotor and reward-related behavioral responses to cocaine. Stimulation of Gi-coupled DREADD (hM4Di) expressed in dopaminergic VTA neurons persistently reduced the locomotor response to repeated cocaine injections. An attenuated locomotor response was even seen when a dual-viral vector approach was used to restrict hM4Di-expression to dopaminergic VTA neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens. Surprisingly, despite the attenuated locomotor response, hM4Di-mediated inhibition of dopaminergic VTA neurons did not prevent cocaine sensitization, and the inhibitory effect of hM4Di-mediated inhibition was eliminated after withdrawal. In the conditioned place preference paradigm, hM4Di-mediated inhibition did not affect cocaine-induced place preference; however, the extinction period was extended. Also, hM4Di-mediated inhibition had no effect on preference for a sugar-based reward over water but impaired motivation to work for the same reward in a touchscreen-based motivational assay. In addition to support that VTA dopaminergic neurons operate as regulators of reward motivation towards both sugar and cocaine, our data suggest that repeated cocaine exposure leads to adaptations in the VTA that surmount the ability of Gi-signaling to suppress and regulate VTA dopaminergic neuronal activity.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> The addictive properties of cocaine and other drugs of abuse are tightly coupled to altered dopamine (DA) neurotransmission mediated by dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Here, we used DREADD (Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs) to investigate how modulation of these neurons via G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) affects the behavioral effects of cocaine. The data substantiate dopaminergic VTA neurons as a prime regulator of explorative locomotion and reward motivation as well as they reveal a delicate role of metabotropic Gi-coupled input with differential effects during acute, repeated and sensitized responses to cocaine. The results may provide an important framework for exploring new principles for addiction treatment via modulation of GPCR signaling within the dopaminergic system.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/22/5220?rss=1">Pregnancy-Associated Plasma Protein-aa Regulates Photoreceptor Synaptic Development to Mediate Visually Guided Behavior</a></h4>

<p>To guide behavior, sensory systems detect the onset and offset of stimuli and process these distinct inputs via parallel pathways. In the retina, this strategy is implemented by splitting neural signals for light onset and offset via synapses connecting photoreceptors to ON and OFF bipolar cells, respectively. It remains poorly understood which molecular cues establish the architecture of this synaptic configuration to split light-onset and light-offset signals. A mutant with reduced synapses between photoreceptors and one bipolar cell type, but not the other, could reveal a critical cue. From this approach, we report a novel synaptic role for <i>pregnancy-associated plasma protein aa</i> (<i>pappaa</i>) in promoting the structure and function of cone synapses that transmit light-offset information. Electrophysiological and behavioral analyses indicated <i>pappaa</i> mutant zebrafish have dysfunctional cone-to-OFF bipolar cell synapses and impaired responses to light offset, but intact cone-to-ON bipolar cell synapses and light-onset responses. Ultrastructural analyses of <i>pappaa</i> mutant cones showed a lack of presynaptic domains at synapses with OFF bipolar cells. <i>pappaa</i> is expressed postsynaptically to the cones during retinal synaptogenesis and encodes a secreted metalloprotease known to stimulate insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) signaling. Induction of dominant-negative IGF1 receptor expression during synaptogenesis reduced light-offset responses. Conversely, stimulating IGF1 signaling at this time improved <i>pappaa</i> mutants' light-offset responses and cone presynaptic structures. Together, our results indicate Pappaa-regulated IGF1 signaling as a novel pathway that establishes how cone synapses convey light-offset signals to guide behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Distinct sensory inputs, like stimulus onset and offset, are often split at distinct synapses into parallel circuits for processing. In the retina, photoreceptors and ON and OFF bipolar cells form discrete synapses to split neural signals coding light onset and offset, respectively. The molecular cues that establish this synaptic configuration to specifically convey light onset or offset remain unclear. Our work reveals a novel cue: <i>pregnancy-associated plasma protein aa</i> (<i>pappaa</i>), which regulates photoreceptor synaptic structure and function to specifically transmit light-offset information. Pappaa is a metalloprotease that stimulates local insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) signaling. IGF1 promotes various aspects of synaptic development and function and is broadly expressed, thus requiring local regulators, like Pappaa, to govern its specificity.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/22/5209?rss=1">Conditional Bistability, a Generic Cellular Mnemonic Mechanism for Robust and Flexible Working Memory Computations</a></h4>

<p>Persistent neural activity, the substrate of working memory, is thought to emerge from synaptic reverberation within recurrent networks. However, reverberation models do not robustly explain the fundamental dynamics of persistent activity, including high-spiking irregularity, large intertrial variability, and state transitions. While cellular bistability may contribute to persistent activity, its rigidity appears incompatible with persistent activity labile characteristics. Here, we unravel in a cellular model a form of spike-mediated conditional bistability that is robust and generic. and provides a rich repertoire of mnemonic computations. Under asynchronous synaptic inputs of the awakened state, conditional bistability generates spiking/bursting episodes, accounting for the irregularity, variability, and state transitions characterizing persistent activity. This mechanism has likely been overlooked because of the subthreshold input it requires, and we predict how to assess it experimentally. Our results suggest a reexamination of the role of intrinsic properties in the collective network dynamics responsible for flexible working memory.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This study unravels a novel form of intrinsic neuronal property: conditional bistability. We show that, thanks to its conditional character, conditional bistability favors the emergence of flexible and robust forms of persistent activity in PFC neural networks, in opposition to previously studied classical forms of absolute bistability. Specifically, we demonstrate for the first time that conditional bistability (1) is a generic biophysical spike-dependent mechanism of layer V pyramidal neurons in the PFC and that (2) it accounts for essential neurodynamical features for the organization and flexibility of PFC persistent activity (the large irregularity and intertrial variability of the discharge and its organization under discrete stable states), which remain unexplained in a robust fashion by current models.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/22/5196?rss=1">Neural Mechanisms Underlying Individual Differences in Control-Averse Behavior</a></h4>

<p>When another person tries to control one's decisions, some people might comply, but many will feel the urge to act against that control. This control aversion can lead to suboptimal decisions and it affects social interactions in many societal domains. To date, however, it has been unclear what drives individual differences in control-averse behavior. Here, we address this issue by measuring brain activity with fMRI while healthy female and male human participants made choices that were either free or controlled by another person, with real consequences to both interaction partners. In addition, we assessed the participants' affects, social cognitions, and motivations via self-reports. Our results indicate that the social cognitions perceived distrust and lack of understanding for the other person play a key role in explaining control aversion at the behavioral level. At the neural level, we find that control-averse behavior can be explained by functional connectivity between the inferior parietal lobule and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, brain regions commonly associated with attention reorientation and cognitive control. Further analyses reveal that the individual strength of functional connectivity complements and partially mediates the self-reported social cognitions in explaining individual differences in control-averse behavior. These findings therefore provide valuable contributions to a more comprehensive model of control aversion.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Control aversion is a prevalent phenomenon in our society. When someone tries to control their decisions, many people tend to act against the control. This can lead to suboptimal decisions such as noncompliance to medical treatments or disobeying the law. The degree to which individuals engage in control-averse behavior, however, varies significantly. Understanding the proximal mechanisms that underlie individual differences in control-averse behavior has potential policy implications, for example, when designing policies aimed at increasing compliance with vaccination recommendations, and is therefore a highly relevant research goal. Here, we identify a neural mechanism between parietal and prefrontal brain regions that can explain individual differences in control-averse behavior. This mechanism provides novel insights into control aversion beyond what is accessible through self-reports.</p>

Abstract
<p>Increased permeability of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) following cerebral injury results in regional extravasation of plasma proteins and can critically contribute to the pathogenesis of epilepsy. Here, we comprehensively explore the spatiotemporal evolution of a main extravasation component, albumin, and illuminate associated responses of the neurovascular unit (NVU) contributing to early epileptogenic neuropathology. We applied translational <i>in vivo</i> MR imaging and complementary immunohistochemical analyses in the widely used rat pilocarpine post–status epilepticus (SE) model. The observed rapid BBB leakage affected major epileptogenesis-associated brain regions, peaked between 1 and 2 d post-SE, and rapidly declined thereafter, accompanied by cerebral edema generally following the same time course. At peak of BBB leakage, serum albumin colocalized with NVU constituents, such as vascular components, neurons, and brain immune cells. Surprisingly, astroglial markers did not colocalize with albumin, and aquaporin-4 (AQP4) was clearly reduced in areas of leaky BBB, indicating a severe disturbance of astrocyte-mediated endothelial-neuronal coupling. In addition, a distinct adaptive reorganization process of the NVU vasculature apparently takes place at sites of albumin presence, substantiated by reduced immunoreactivity of endothelial and changes in vascular basement membrane markers. Taken together, degenerative events at the level of the NVU, affecting vessels, astrocytes, and neurons, seem to outweigh reconstructive processes. Considering the rapidly occurring BBB leakage and subsequent impairment of the NVU, our data support the necessity of a prompt BBB-restoring treatment as one component of rational therapeutic intervention to prevent epileptogenesis and the development of other detrimental sequelae of SE.</p>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The anterior insula (AI) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) are engaged in various cognitive and affective processes. An influential account posits that the AI and dACC’s ubiquitous engagements reflect their role in the transient capture of attention by salient stimuli. Using fMRI here we tested this claim and functionally dissociated these regions. In the first experiment, we compared these regions’ responses to emotion-laden and emotion-neutral salient “oddball” movie events. We found that while the AI only responded transiently to the onset and offset of neutral events, its response to affective events was sustained, challenging the transient attention capture account. By contrast, dACC remained transient regardless of event type. A second experiment distinguished the information encoded by these brain regions with the presentation of behaviorally salient events that require either maintaining the current task set or updating to a different one; the AI was found to signal the presence of the behaviorally relevant events, while the dACC was associated with switching of attention settings in response to the events. We conclude that AI and dACC are involved in signaling the presence of potentially or de facto behaviorally significant events and updating internal attention settings in response to these events, respectively.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Synaptosomal associated protein 25 kDa (SNAP25) is an essential component of the SNARE complex regulating synaptic vesicle fusion. SNAP25 deficiency has been implicated in a variety of cognitive disorders. We ablated SNAP25 from selected neuronal populations by generating a transgenic mouse (B6-Snap25tm3mcw (Snap25-flox)) with LoxP sites flanking exon5a/5b. In the presence of Cre-recombinase, Snap25-flox is recombined to a truncated transcript. Evoked synaptic vesicle release is severely reduced in Snap25 conditional knockout (cKO) neurons as shown by live cell imaging of synaptic vesicle fusion and whole cell patch clamp recordings in cultured hippocampal neurons. We studied Snap25 cKO in subsets of cortical projection neurons in vivo (L5—Rbp4-Cre; L6—Ntsr1-Cre; L6b—Drd1a-Cre). cKO neurons develop normal axonal projections, but axons are not maintained appropriately, showing signs of swelling, fragmentation and eventually complete absence. Onset and progression of degeneration are dependent on the neuron type, with L5 cells showing the earliest and most severe axonal loss. Ultrastructural examination revealed that cKO neurites contain autophagosome/lysosome-like structures. Markers of inflammation such as Iba1 and lipofuscin are increased only in adult cKO cortex. Snap25 cKO can provide a model to study genetic interactions with environmental influences in several disorders.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Local gyrification index (LGI), a metric quantifying cortical folding, was evaluated in 105 boys with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 49 typically developing (TD) boys at 3 and 5 years-of-age. At 3 years-of-age, boys with ASD had reduced gyrification in the fusiform gyrus compared with TD boys. A longitudinal evaluation from 3 to 5 years revealed that while TD boys had stable/decreasing LGI, boys with ASD had increasing LGI in right inferior temporal gyrus, right inferior frontal gyrus, right inferior parietal lobule, and stable LGI in left lingual gyrus. LGI was also examined in a previously defined neurophenotype of boys with ASD and disproportionate megalencephaly. At 3 years-of-age, this subgroup exhibited increased LGI in right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, and paracentral cortex, and left cingulate cortex and superior frontal gyrus relative to TD boys and increased LGI in right paracentral lobule and parahippocampal gyrus, and left precentral gyrus compared with boys with ASD and normal brain size. In summary, this study identified alterations in the pattern and development of LGI during early childhood in ASD. Distinct patterns of alterations in subgroups of boys with ASD suggests that multiple neurophenotypes exist and boys with ASD and disproportionate megalencephaly should be evaluated separately.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>There is little understanding of the structural underpinnings of the functional reorganization of the cortex in the congenitally blind human. Taking advantage of the extensive characterization of the macaque visual system, we examine in macaque the influence of congenital blindness resulting from the removal of the retina during in utero development. This effectively removes the normal influence of the thalamus on cortical development leading to an induced hybrid cortex (HC) combining features of primary visual and extrastriate cortex. Retrograde tracers injected in HC reveal a local, intrinsic connectivity characteristic of higher order areas and show that the HC receives a uniquely strong, purely feedforward projection from striate cortex but no ectopic inputs, except from subiculum, and entorhinal cortex. Statistical modeling of quantitative connectivity data shows that HC is relatively high in the cortical hierarchy and receives a reinforced input from ventral stream areas while the overall organization of the functional streams are conserved. The directed and weighted anophthalmic cortical graph from the present study can be used to construct dynamic and structural models. These findings show how the sensory periphery governs cortical phenotype and reveal the importance of developmental arealization for understanding the functional reorganization in congenital blindness.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The human pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pACC) encompasses 7 distinct cyto- and receptorarchitectonic areas. We lack a detailed understanding of the functions in which they are involved, and stereotaxic maps are not available. We present an integrated structural/functional map of pACC based on probabilistic cytoarchitectonic mapping and meta-analytic connectivity modeling and quantitative functional decoding. Due to the restricted spatial resolution of functional imaging data relative to the microstructural parcellation, areas p24a of the callosal sulcus and p24b on the surface of the cingulate gyrus were merged into a “gyral component” (p24ab) of area p24, and areas pv24c, pd24cv, and pd24cd, located within the cingulate sulcus were merged into a “sulcal component” (p24c) for meta-analytic analysis. Area p24ab was specifically associated with interoception, p24c with the inhibition of action, and p32, which was also activated by emotion induction tasks pertaining negatively valenced stimuli, with the ability to experience empathy. Thus, area p32 could be classified as cingulate association cortex playing a crucial role in the cognitive regulation of emotion. By this spectrum of functions, pACC is a structurally and functionally heterogeneous region, clearly differing from other parts of the anterior and middle cingulate cortex.</span>

Recent years have seen a flourishing literature on detection of circulating autoantibodies against neurotransmitter receptors in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. These studies have generated hope for a better understanding of the underlying molecular dysfunctions and for appropriate therapeutic strategies. However, the detection of these autoantibodies in healthy subjects, and the lack of mechanistic insights have fostered debate about the pathogenic role of such autoantibodies. Here, we specifically discuss the biological evidence linking autoantibodies directed against the glutamatergic N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR-Abs) and psychosis, emphasising recent single-molecule imaging investigations that unveiled the impaired surface trafficking of NMDAR in the presence of NMDAR-Abs from psychotic patients.
