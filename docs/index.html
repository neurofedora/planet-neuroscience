              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Experimental study and machine learning model to predict formability of magnesium alloy sheet [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Magnesium alloy is not only light in weight but also possesses moderate strength. Magnesium AZ31-H24 alloy sheet has many applications in the automotive and aerospace industries. Experimental stretch forming tests are performed on this sheet to measure the material’s formability by constructing forming limit diagrams. Methods: Several tests of Nakazima were carried out on rectangular samples at 24, 250, 350°C and 0.01, 0.001 mm/s using a hemispherical punch. The work done to predict the formability of magnesium alloys has not been recorded in recent literature on machine learning models. Hence, the researchers of this article choose to explore the same and build three models to predict the formability of magnesium alloy through Random Forest algorithm, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Multiple linear Regression. Results: The Random Forest showed high accuracy of 96% in prediction. Conclusions: It is concluded that the need for physical experiments can be greatly minimized in formability studies by using machine learning concepts.

	<p>Pain is often debilitating, and is associated with many pathologies, as either a cause or consequence. Pharmacological interventions, such as opioids, to manage pain may lead to potential problems, such as addiction. When pain is controlled and managed, it can prevent negative associated outcomes affiliated with disease. Music is a low-cost option that shows promise in the management of painful circumstances. Music therapy has provided potent options for pain relief across a variety of ages and populations. As a nonpharmacological alternative or complement lacking side effects, music interventions are growing in clinical application and research protocols. This article considers the neurological implications of varying kinds of pain to provide working considerations that preempt the use of music and music-therapy applications in treating pain.</p>

	<p>Background. After the declaration of the pandemic status in several countries, the continuity of face-to-face visits in psychiatric facilities has been delayed or even interrupted to reduce viral spread. Little is known about the personality factors associated with medication beliefs and adherence amongst individuals with mental illness during the COVID-19 pandemic. This brief report describes a preliminary naturalistic longitudinal study that explored whether the Big Five personality traits prospectively moderate the effects of medication beliefs on changes in adherence during the pandemic for a group of outpatients with psychosis or bipolar disorder. Methods. Thirteen outpatients undergoing routine face-to-face follow-up assessments during the pandemic were included (41 observations overall) and completed the Revised Italian Version of the Ten-Item Personality Inventory, the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire, the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale&amp;amp;mdash;8-item and the Beck Depression Inventory&amp;amp;mdash;II. Results. Participants had stronger concerns about their psychiatric medications rather than beliefs about their necessity, and adherence to medications was generally low. Participants who had more necessity beliefs than concerns had better adherence to medications. People scoring higher in Conscientiousness and Neuroticism traits and more concerned about the medication side effects had poorer adherence. Conclusions. These preliminary data suggest the importance of a careful assessment of the adherence to medications amongst people with psychosis/bipolar disorder during the pandemic. Interventions aimed to improve adherence might focus on patients&amp;amp;rsquo; medication beliefs and their Conscientiousness and Neuroticism personality traits.</p>

	<p>The paper proposes an ecological and portable protocol for the large-scale collection of reading data in high-functioning autism spectrum disorder (ASD) children based on recording the finger movements of a subject reading a text displayed on a tablet touchscreen. By capitalizing on recent evidence that movements of a finger that points to a scene or text during visual exploration or reading may approximate eye fixations, we focus on recognition of written content and function words, pace of reading, and accuracy in reading comprehension. The analysis showed significant differences between typically developing and ASD children, with the latter group exhibiting greater variation in levels of reading ability, slower developmental pace in reading speed, less accurate comprehension, greater dependency on word length and word frequency, less significant prediction-based processing, as well as a monotonous, steady reading pace with reduced attention to weak punctuation. Finger-tracking patterns provides evidence that ASD readers may fail to integrate single word processing into major syntactic structures and lends support to the hypothesis of an impaired use of contextual information to predict upcoming stimuli, suggesting that difficulties in perception may arise as difficulties in prediction.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neuroscience Milestones: Developing Standardized Core-Competencies for Research-Based Neuroscience Trainees</a></h4>

              
                <p>In the medical field, the implementation of Milestones by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) has provided a common understanding among clinical and academic supervisors and trainees related to the development of core competencies during graduate medical training. These Milestones help establish developmental trajectories and aspirational goals for the trainee. Unfortunately, training in graduate and postgraduate neuroscience lacks a standardized developmental progression of competencies or outcomes expected of trainees. Without such standardizations, it may be difficult for both the mentor and trainee to identify levels of improvement, which may impact the trainee's future success. Here, we discuss the value of developing a nonexhaustive framework that may be used to evaluate trainees with the expectation that it will provide a template to help with the development of future neuroscientists.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Glycerol-3-Phosphate Shuttle Is a Backup System Securing Metabolic Flexibility in Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Electrical activity in neurons is highly energy demanding and accompanied by rises in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, in turn, secures energy supply by pushing mitochondrial metabolism either through augmented NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) transfer into mitochondria via the malate&ndash;aspartate shuttle (MAS) or via direct activation of dehydrogenases of the TCA cycle after passing into the matrix through the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter (MCU). Another Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive booster of mitochondrial ATP synthesis is the glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle (G3PS), whose role in neuronal energy supply has remained elusive. Essential components of G3PS are expressed in hippocampal neurons. Single neuron metabolic measurements in primary hippocampal cultures derived from rat pups of either sex reveal only moderate, if any, constitutive activity of G3PS. However, during electrical activity neurons fully rely on G3PS when MAS and MCU are unavailable. Under these conditions, G3PS is required for appropriate action potential firing. Accordingly, G3PS safeguards metabolic flexibility of neurons to cope with energy demands of electrical signaling.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions are known to provide a link between the energy-demanding electrical activity and an adequate ATP supply in neurons. To do so, Ca<sup>2+</sup> acts both from outside and inside of the mitochondrial inner membrane. Neuronal function critically depends on this regulation, and its defects are often found in various neurologic disorders. Although interest in neuronal metabolism has increased, many aspects thereof have remained unresolved. In particular, a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) shuttling system, the glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle, has been largely ignored with respect to its function in neurons. Our results demonstrate that this shuttle is functional in hippocampal neurons and safeguards ATP supply and appropriate action potential firing when malate aspartate shuttle and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter are unavailable, thereby ensuring neuronal metabolic flexibility.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Antagonistic Activities of Fmn2 and ADF Regulate Axonal F-Actin Patch Dynamics and the Initiation of Collateral Branching</a></h4>

              
                <p>Interstitial collateral branching of axons is a critical component in the development of functional neural circuits. Axon collateral branches are established through a series of cellular processes initiated by the development of a specialized, focal F-actin network in axons. The formation, maintenance and remodeling of this F-actin patch is critical for the initiation of axonal protrusions that are subsequently consolidated to form a collateral branch. However, the mechanisms regulating F-actin patch dynamics are poorly understood. Fmn2 is a formin family member implicated in multiple neurodevelopmental disorders. We find that Fmn2 regulates the initiation of axon collateral protrusions in chick spinal neurons and in zebrafish motor neurons. Fmn2 localizes to the protrusion-initiating axonal F-actin patches and regulates the lifetime and size of these F-actin networks. The F-actin nucleation activity of Fmn2 is necessary for F-actin patch stability but not for initiating patch formation. We show that Fmn2 insulates the F-actin patches from disassembly by the actin-depolymerizing factor, ADF, and promotes long-lived, larger patches that are competent to initiate axonal protrusions. The regulation of axonal branching can contribute to the neurodevelopmental pathologies associated with Fmn2 and the dynamic antagonism between Fmn2 and ADF may represent a general mechanism of formin-dependent protection of Arp2/3-initiated F-actin networks from disassembly.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Axonal branching is a key process in the development of functional circuits and neural plasticity. Axon collateral branching is initiated by the elaboration of F-actin filaments from discrete axonal F-actin networks. We show that the neurodevelopmental disorder-associated formin, Fmn2, is a critical regulator of axon collateral branching. Fmn2 localizes to the collateral branch-inducing F-actin patches in axons and regulates the stability of these actin networks. The F-actin nucleation activity of Fmn2 protects the patches from ADF-mediated disassembly. Opposing activities of Fmn2 and ADF exert a dynamic regulatory control on axon collateral branch initiation and may underly the neurodevelopmental defects associated with Fmn2.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Offset Responses in the Auditory Cortex Show Unique History Dependence</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sensory responses typically vary depending on the recent history of sensory experience. This is essential for processes, including adaptation, efficient coding, and change detection. In the auditory cortex (AC), the short-term history dependence of sound-evoked (onset) responses has been well characterized. Yet many AC neurons also respond to sound terminations, and little is known about the history dependence of these "offset" responses, whether the short-term dynamics of onset and offset responses are correlated, or how these properties are distributed among cell types. Here we presented awake male and female mice with repeating noise burst stimuli while recording single-unit activity from primary AC. We identified parvalbumin and somatostatin interneurons through optotagging, and also separated narrow-spiking from broad-spiking units. We found that offset responses are typically less depressive than onset responses, and this result was robust to a variety of stimulus parameters, controls, measurement types, and selection criteria. Whether a cell's onset response facilitates or depresses does not predict whether its offset response facilitates or depresses. Cell types differed in the dynamics of their onset responses, and in the prevalence, but not the dynamics, of their offset responses. Finally, we clustered cells according to spiking responses and found that response clusters were associated with cell type. Each cluster contained cells of several types, but even within a cluster, cells often showed cell type-specific response dynamics. We conclude that onset and offset responses are differentially influenced by recent sound history, and discuss the implications of this for the encoding of ongoing sound stimuli.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Sensory neuron responses depend on stimulus history. This history dependence is crucial for sensory processing, is precisely controlled at individual synapses and circuits, and is adaptive to the specific requirements of different sensory systems. In the auditory cortex, neurons respond to sound cessation as well as to sound itself, but how history dependence is used along this separate, "offset" information stream is unknown. We show that offset responses are more facilitatory than sound responses, even in neurons where sound responses depress. In contrast to sound onset responses, offset responses are absent in many cells, are relatively homogeneous, and show no cell type-specific differences in history dependence. Offset responses thus show unique response dynamics, suggesting their unique functions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Interfacing Motor Units in Nonhuman Primates Identifies a Principal Neural Component for Force Control Constrained by the Size Principle</a></h4>

              
                <p>Motor units convert the last neural code of movement into muscle forces. The classic view of motor unit control is that the CNS sends common synaptic inputs to motoneuron pools and that motoneurons respond in an orderly fashion dictated by the size principle. This view, however, is in contrast with the large number of dimensions observed in motor cortex, which may allow individual and flexible control of motor units. Evidence for flexible control of motor units may be obtained by tracking motor units longitudinally during tasks with some level of behavioral variability. Here we identified and tracked populations of motor units in the brachioradialis muscle of two macaque monkeys during 10 sessions spanning &gt;1 month with a broad range of rate of force development (1.8&ndash;38.6 N &middot; m &middot; s<sup>&ndash;1</sup>). We found a very stable recruitment order and discharge characteristics of the motor units over sessions and contraction trials. The small deviations from orderly recruitment were fully predicted by the motor unit recruitment intervals, so that small shifts in recruitment thresholds happened only during contractions at a high rate of force development. Moreover, we also found that one component explained more than ~50% of the motor unit discharge rate variance, and that the remaining components represented a time-shifted version of the first. In conclusion, our results show that the recruitment of motoneurons is determined by the interplay of the size principle and common input and that this recruitment scheme is not violated over time or by the speed of the contractions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> With a new noninvasive high-density electromyographic framework, we show the activity of motor unit ensembles in macaques during voluntary contractions. The discharge characteristics of brachioradialis motor units revealed a relatively fixed recruitment order and discharge characteristics across days and rate of force developments. These results were further confirmed through invasive axonal stimulation and recordings of intramuscular electromyographic activity from 16 arm muscles. The study shows for the first time the feasibility of longitudinal noninvasive motor unit interfacing and tracking of the same motor units in nonhuman primates.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Selective Enhancement of Post-Sleep Visual Motion Perception by Repetitive Tactile Stimulation during Sleep</a></h4>

              
                <p>Tactile sensations can bias visual perception in the awake state while visual sensitivity is known to be facilitated by sleep. It remains unknown, however, whether the tactile sensation during sleep can bias the visual improvement after sleep. Here, we performed nap experiments in human participants (<I>n</I> = 56, 18 males, 38 females) to demonstrate that repetitive tactile motion stimulation on the fingertip during slow wave sleep selectively enhanced subsequent visual motion detection. The visual improvement was associated with slow wave activity. The high activation at the high beta frequency was found in the occipital electrodes after the tactile motion stimulation during sleep, indicating a visual-tactile cross-modal interaction during sleep. Furthermore, a second experiment (<I>n</I> = 14, 14 females) to examine whether a hand- or head-centered coordination is dominant for the interpretation of tactile motion direction showed that the biasing effect on visual improvement occurs according to the hand-centered coordination. These results suggest that tactile information can be interpreted during sleep, and can induce the selective improvement of post-sleep visual motion detection.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Tactile sensations can bias our visual perception as a form of cross-modal interaction. However, it was reported only in the awake state. Here we show that repetitive directional tactile motion stimulation on the fingertip during slow wave sleep selectively enhanced subsequent visual motion perception. Moreover, the visual improvement was positively associated with sleep slow wave activity. The tactile motion stimulation during slow wave activity increased the activation at the high beta frequency over the occipital electrodes. The visual improvement occurred in agreement with a hand-centered reference frame. These results suggest that our sleeping brain can interpret tactile information based on a hand-centered reference frame, which can cause the sleep-dependent improvement of visual motion detection.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Robust Effects of Working Memory Demand during Naturalistic Language Comprehension in Language-Selective Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>To understand language, we must infer structured meanings from real-time auditory or visual signals. Researchers have long focused on word-by-word structure building in working memory as a mechanism that might enable this feat. However, some have argued that language processing does not typically involve rich word-by-word structure building, and/or that apparent working memory effects are underlyingly driven by <I>surprisal</I> (how predictable a word is in context). Consistent with this alternative, some recent behavioral studies of naturalistic language processing that control for surprisal have not shown clear working memory effects. In this fMRI study, we investigate a range of theory-driven predictors of word-by-word working memory demand during naturalistic language comprehension in humans of both sexes under rigorous surprisal controls. In addition, we address a related debate about whether the working memory mechanisms involved in language comprehension are language specialized or domain general. To do so, in each participant, we functionally localize (1) the language-selective network and (2) the "multiple-demand" network, which supports working memory across domains. Results show robust surprisal-independent effects of memory demand in the language network and no effect of memory demand in the multiple-demand network. Our findings thus support the view that language comprehension involves computationally demanding word-by-word structure building operations in working memory, in addition to any prediction-related mechanisms. Further, these memory operations appear to be primarily conducted by the same neural resources that store linguistic knowledge, with no evidence of involvement of brain regions known to support working memory across domains.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This study uses fMRI to investigate signatures of working memory (WM) demand during naturalistic story listening, using a broad range of theoretically motivated estimates of WM demand. Results support a strong effect of WM demand in the brain that is distinct from effects of word predictability. Further, these WM demands register primarily in language-selective regions, rather than in "multiple-demand" regions that have previously been associated with WM in nonlinguistic domains. Our findings support a core role for WM in incremental language processing, using WM resources that are specialized for language.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Data-Driven Clustering of Functional Signals Reveals Gradients in Processing Both within the Anterior Hippocampus and across Its Long Axis</a></h4>

              
                <p>A particularly elusive puzzle concerning the hippocampus is how the structural differences along its long anteroposterior axis might beget meaningful functional differences, particularly in terms of the granularity of information processing. One measure posits to quantify this granularity by calculating the average statistical independence of the BOLD signal across neighboring voxels, or intervoxel similarity (IVS), and has shown the anterior hippocampus to process coarser-grained information than the posterior hippocampus. This measure, however, has yielded opposing results in studies of developmental and healthy aging samples, which also varied in fMRI acquisition parameters and hippocampal parcellation methods. To reconcile these findings, we measured IVS across two separate resting-state fMRI acquisitions and compared the results across many of the most widely used parcellation methods in a large young-adult sample of male and female humans (Acquisition 1, <I>N</I> = 233; Acquisition 2, <I>N</I> = 176). Finding conflicting results across acquisitions and parcellations, we reasoned that a data-driven approach to hippocampal parcellation is necessary. To this end, we implemented a group masked independent components analysis to identify functional subunits of the hippocampus, most notably separating the anterior hippocampus into separate anterior-medial, anterior-lateral, and posteroanterior-lateral components. Measuring IVS across these components revealed a decrease in IVS along the medial-lateral axis of the anterior hippocampus but an increase from anterior to posterior. We conclude that intervoxel similarity is deeply affected by parcellation and that grounding one's parcellation in a functionally informed approach might allow for a more complex and reliable characterization of the hippocampus.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Processing information along hierarchical scales of granularity is critical for many of the feats of cognition considered most human. Recently, the changes in structure, cortical connectivity, and apparent functional properties across parcels of the hippocampal long axis have been hypothesized to underlie this hierarchical gradient in information processing. We show here, however, that the choice of parcellation method itself drastically affects one particular measure of granularity across the hippocampus and that a functionally informed approach to parcellation reveals gradients both within the anterior hippocampus and in nonlinear form across the long axis. These results point to the issue of parcellation as a critical one in the study of the hippocampus and reorient interpretation of existing results.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Speech Understanding Oppositely Affects Acoustic and Linguistic Neural Tracking in a Speech Rate Manipulation Paradigm</a></h4>

              
                <p>When listening to continuous speech, the human brain can track features of the presented speech signal. It has been shown that neural tracking of acoustic features is a prerequisite for speech understanding and can predict speech understanding in controlled circumstances. However, the brain also tracks linguistic features of speech, which may be more directly related to speech understanding. We investigated acoustic and linguistic speech processing as a function of varying speech understanding by manipulating the speech rate. In this paradigm, acoustic and linguistic speech processing is affected simultaneously but in opposite directions: When the speech rate increases, more acoustic information per second is present. In contrast, the tracking of linguistic information becomes more challenging when speech is less intelligible at higher speech rates. We measured the EEG of 18 participants (4 male) who listened to speech at various speech rates. As expected and confirmed by the behavioral results, speech understanding decreased with increasing speech rate. Accordingly, linguistic neural tracking decreased with increasing speech rate, but acoustic neural tracking increased. This indicates that neural tracking of linguistic representations can capture the gradual effect of decreasing speech understanding. In addition, increased acoustic neural tracking does not necessarily imply better speech understanding. This suggests that, although more challenging to measure because of the low signal-to-noise ratio, linguistic neural tracking may be a more direct predictor of speech understanding.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> An increasingly popular method to investigate neural speech processing is to measure neural tracking. Although much research has been done on how the brain tracks acoustic speech features, linguistic speech features have received less attention. In this study, we disentangled acoustic and linguistic characteristics of neural speech tracking via manipulating the speech rate. A proper way of objectively measuring auditory and language processing paves the way toward clinical applications: An objective measure of speech understanding would allow for behavioral-free evaluation of speech understanding, which allows to evaluate hearing loss and adjust hearing aids based on brain responses. This objective measure would benefit populations from whom obtaining behavioral measures may be complex, such as young children or people with cognitive impairments.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Connectivity-Defined Subdivisions of the Intraparietal Sulcus Respond Differentially to Abstraction during Decision-Making</a></h4>

              
                <p>The intraparietal sulcus (IPS) has been implicated in numerous functions that range from representation of visual stimuli to action planning, but its role in abstract decision-making has been unclear, in part because low-level functions often act as confounds. Here, we address this problem using a task that dissociates abstract decision-making from sensory salience, attentional control, motor planning, and motor output. Functional MRI data were collected from healthy female and male human subjects while they performed a policy abstraction task requiring use of a more abstract (second-order) rule to select between two less abstract (first-order) rules that informed the motor response. By identifying IPS subdivisions with preferential connectivity to prefrontal regions that are differentially responsive to task abstraction, we found that a caudal IPS (cIPS) subregion with strongest connectivity to the pre-premotor cortex was preferentially active for second-order cues, whereas a rostral IPS subregion (rIPS) with strongest connectivity to the dorsal premotor cortex was active during attentional control over first-order cues. These effects for abstraction were seen in addition to cIPS activity that was specific to sensory salience, and rIPS activity that was specific to motor output. Notably, topographic responses to the second-order cue were detected along the caudal-rostral axis of IPS, mirroring the broader organization seen in lateral prefrontal cortex. Together, these data demonstrate that subregions within IPS exhibit activity responsive to policy abstraction, and they suggest that IPS may be organized into frontoparietal subnetworks that support hierarchical cognitive control.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Abstract decision-making allows us to flexibly adapt our behavior to new contexts. Although much previous work has focused on the role of lateral prefrontal cortex in such decisions, the contributions of parietal cortex have been relatively understudied. Here, we demonstrate that spatially segregated subregions of human IPS with strong functional connections to lateral prefrontal cortex demonstrate activity selective for abstract decisions. This activity can be distinguished from responses resulting from cognitive processes related to sensory salience, attentional control, motor planning, and movement. Together, these findings indicate that different task demands are reflected in the topography of IPS, and they explicitly reveal a role in abstract decision-making.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">STAT1 Contributes to Microglial/Macrophage Inflammation and Neurological Dysfunction in a Mouse Model of Traumatic Brain Injury</a></h4>

              
                <p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) triggers a plethora of inflammatory events in the brain that aggravate secondary injury and impede tissue repair. Resident microglia (Mi) and blood-borne infiltrating macrophages (M) are major players of inflammatory responses in the post-TBI brain and possess high functional heterogeneity. However, the plasticity of these cells has yet to be exploited to develop therapies that can mitigate brain inflammation and improve the outcome after TBI. This study investigated the transcription factor STAT1 as a key determinant of proinflammatory Mi/M responses and aimed to develop STAT1 as a novel therapeutic target for TBI using a controlled cortical impact model of TBI on adult male mice. TBI induced robust upregulation of STAT1 in the brain at the subacute injury stage, which occurred primarily in Mi/M. Intraperitoneal administration of fludarabine, a selective STAT1 inhibitor, markedly alleviated proinflammatory Mi/M responses and brain inflammation burden after TBI. Such phenotype-modulating effects of fludarabine on post-TBI Mi/M were reproduced by tamoxifen-induced, selective KO of STAT1 in Mi/M (STAT1 mKO). By propelling Mi/M away from a detrimental proinflammatory phenotype, STAT1 mKO was sufficient to reduce long-term neurologic deficits and brain lesion size after TBI. Importantly, short-term fludarabine treatment after TBI elicited long-lasting improvement of TBI outcomes, but this effect was lost on STAT1 mKO mice. Together, our study provided the first line of evidence that STAT1 causatively determines the proinflammatory phenotype of brain Mi/M after TBI. We also showed promising preclinical data supporting the use of fludarabine as a novel immunomodulating therapy to TBI.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The functional phenotype of microglia and macrophages (Mi/M) critically influences brain inflammation and the outcome after traumatic brain injury (TBI); however, no therapies have been developed to modulate Mi/M functions to treat TBI. Here we report, for the first time, that the transcription factor STAT1 is a key mediator of proinflammatory Mi/M responses in the post-TBI brain, the specific deletion of which ameliorates neuroinflammation and improves long-term functional recovery after TBI. We also show excellent efficacy of a selective STAT1 inhibitor fludarabine against TBI-induced functional deficits and brain injury using a mouse model, presenting STAT1 as a promising therapeutic target for TBI.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Ventral Hippocampal Formation Is the Primary Epileptogenic Zone in a Rat Model of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                <p>Temporal lobe epilepsy is common, but mechanisms of seizure initiation are unclear. We evaluated seizure initiation in female and male rats that had been systemically treated with pilocarpine, a widely used model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Local field potential (LFP) recordings from many brain regions revealed variable sites of earliest recorded seizure activity, but mostly the ventral hippocampal formation. To test whether inactivation of the ventral hippocampal formation would reduce seizures, mini-osmotic pumps were used to continually and focally deliver TTX. High doses of TTX infused unilaterally into the ventral hippocampal formation blocked seizures reversibly but also reduced LFP amplitudes in remote brain regions, indicating distant effects. A lower dose did not reduce LFP amplitudes in remote brain regions but did not reduce seizures when infused unilaterally. Instead, seizures tended to initiate in the contralateral ventral hippocampal formation. Bilateral infusion of the lower dose into the ventral hippocampal formation reduced seizure frequency 85%. Similar bilateral treatment in the amygdala was not effective. Bilateral infusion of the dorsal hippocampus reduced seizure frequency, but only 17%. Together, these findings reveal that the ventral hippocampal formation is a primary bilaterally independent epileptogenic zone, and the dorsal hippocampus is a secondary epileptogenic zone in pilocarpine-treated rats. This is consistent with many human patients, and the results further validate the LFP method for identifying seizure onset zones. Finally, the findings are more consistent with a focal mechanism of ictogenesis rather than one involving a network of interdependent nodes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> To better understand how seizures start, investigators need to know where seizures start in the animal models they study. In the widely used pilocarpine-treated rat model of temporal lobe epilepsy, earliest seizure activity was most frequently recorded in the ventral hippocampal formation. Confirming the primary role of the ventral hippocampal formation, seizure frequency was reduced most effectively when it was inactivated focally, bilaterally, and continually with infused TTX. These findings suggest that the ventral hippocampal formation is the primary site of seizure initiation in this animal model of temporal lobe epilepsy, consistent with findings in many human patients.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Loss of the Schizophrenia-Linked Furin Protein from Drosophila Mushroom Body Neurons Results in Antipsychotic-Reversible Habituation Deficits</a></h4>

              
                <p>Habituation is a conserved adaptive process essential for incoming information assessment, which drives the behavioral response decrement to recurrent inconsequential stimuli and does not involve sensory adaptation or fatigue. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying the process are not well understood, habituation has been reported to be defective in a number of disorders including schizophrenia. We demonstrate that loss of <I>furin1</I>, the <I>Drosophila</I> homolog of a gene whose transcriptional downregulation has been linked to schizophrenia, results in defective habituation to recurrent footshocks in mixed sex populations. The deficit is reversible by transgenic expression of the <I>Drosophila</I> or human Furin in adult &alpha;'/&beta;' mushroom body neurons and by acute oral delivery of the typical antipsychotic haloperidol and the atypical clozapine, which are commonly used to treat schizophrenic patients. The results validate the proposed contribution of Furin downregulation in schizophrenia and suggest that defective footshock habituation is a <I>Drosophila</I> protophenotype of the human disorder.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Genome-wide association studies have revealed a number of loci linked to schizophrenia, but most have not been verified experimentally in a relevant behavioral task. Habituation deficits constitute a schizophrenia endophenotype. <I>Drosophila</I> with attenuated expression of the schizophrenia-linked highly conserved Furin gene present delayed habituation reversible with acute exposure to antipsychotics. This strongly suggests that footshock habituation defects constitute a schizophrenia protophenotype in <I>Drosophila</I>. Furthermore, determination of the neurons whose regulated activity is required for footshock habituation provides a facile metazoan system to expediently validate putative schizophrenia genes and variants in a well understood simple brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The validity and reliability test of the leprosy life quality questionnaire in leprosy patients [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                ackground: Leprosy is a public health problem because it potentially affects social life. In 2018, World Health Organisation (WHO) reported that Indonesia ranks third of new cases leprosy. Leprosy significantly influences patients' quality of life. Until now, there is still no specific questionnaire to assess the quality of life for leprosy patients. Leprosy Quality of Life Questionnaire (KUKUH) is a questionnaire to assess leprosy patients' quality of life, which includes questions about psychology, physical health, social environment, and treatment. The study aimed to assess the validity and reliability of the Leprosy Quality of Life Questionnaire (KUKUH) as a tool to assess the quality of life of leprosy patients in Indonesia.  Methods: The study was conducted at Saiful Anwar General Hospital in Malang, East Java. The validity analysis using construct validity with a minimum correlation coefficient value considered valid by 0.3. Internal consistency assessment for the questionnaire utilized the Cronbach α value where a value greater than or equal to 0.60 is acceptable, and a value greater than or equal to 0.80 is considered good.  Results: Based on the result of variable validity test, all items measuring each aspect have item correlation coefficient values with a total score (riT) > table correlation value (0.361). The results of reliability testing, the items that measure each aspect of the quality-of-life variable for leprosy patients have Cronbach's Alpha values greater than 0.6.   Conclusion: The validity test results of KUKUH Questionnaire are considered quite good, with a total score of 0.361 for the correlation coefficient for each question in KUKUH. The reliability test results were deemed satisfactory, with Cronbach's alpha > 0.6. The KUKUH questionnaire can be used to evaluate the quality of life of leprosy patients in Indonesia.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Therapeutic effect of herbal infusion on abnormal uterine bleeding: interventional non-randomized pilot study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Abnormal uterine bleeding-menometrorrhagia due to uterine myomas is a health problem affecting women’s quality of life and it is considered a frequent cause of emergency visits for women. If first line medication fails to treat symptoms, surgical procedures, such as hysterectomy could be indicated, which could interfere with women's physical, social, emotional, and material quality of life. The purpose of this pilot study was to investigate the effect of a mixture of two medicinal plants, Mentha pulegium L and Artemisia abrotanum L, on 13 women with menometrorrhagia, who were candidates for hysterectomy. Methods: The herbs were taken as a tea infusion by the oral route. A total of 5 g of the dried aerial parts of the mixture were added to 100 ml of boiling water and the tea infusion was taken three times a day starting from the onset of menstruation for three consecutive days, and it was repeated for three consecutive months. Results: The study results showed that 10 out of the 13 women involved avoided the surgical procedures. The mean number of bleeding days declined from 11.50 (±3.77) at baseline to 7.60 (±2.11) (p=0.01). Participants confirmed a change in the bleeding intensity, regularization of their menstrual cycle, and improvement in their quality of life. Conclusions: This preliminary study explores a new approach to treat abnormal uterine bleeding- menometrorrhagia, based on tea infusion consumption of a mixture of two medicinal herbs, and it paves the way for future studies. Trial registration: This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05406960 (07/06/2022).

                Background: Bloodstream infection (BSI) contributes to a substantial proportion of mortality in sub-Saharan Africa and is marked by the presence of bacterial and/or fungal microorganisms in the blood. Because BSI can be life threatening, it requires a timely, reliable and accurate diagnosis. This study retrospectively analyzed data of identified BSI pathogens and compared the performance of the different diagnostic technologies used in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, turnaround time (TAT) and cost. Methods: Currently, culture followed by analytical profile index biochemical strips (API), (BioMerieux) are used as the conventional standard diagnostics in Kenyan public hospitals and labs. We compared the results of this standard to that of the BioFire FilmArray (FA) (BioFire Diagnostics) and MicroScan WalkAway-40 plus System (MS) (Beckman Coulter) used in diagnosis of BSI. The FA technology was able to identify 150/152 bacterial and yeast isolates with an overall accuracy of 99.04% (95% CI: 96.59-99.88%), sensitivity of 98.68% (95% CI: 95.33-99.84%), mean TAT of 8 hours 40 minutes per eight samples and running cost per sample of USD 140.11. The MS identified 150/152 isolates with an overall accuracy of 98.56% (95% CI: 95.86-99.70%), sensitivity of 98.68% (95% CI: 95.30-99.84%), mean TAT per sample was 42 hours and running cost per sample of USD 28.05. API detected 150/152 isolates, with an overall accuracy of 99.04% (95% CI: 96.59-99.88%), sensitivity of 98.68% (95% CI: 95.33-99.84%) and the mean TAT per sample was 53 and 103 hours for bacterial and yeast samples, respectively, with a running cost per sample of USD 28.05.Conclusions: The findings in this paper suggest that the FA and MS platforms should be able to perform adequately in Kenya referral hospitals and medical clinics as a rapid diagnostic tool.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Application of 3D Printing Technology to Produce Hippocampal Customized Guide Cannulas</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Implantation of guide cannulas is a widely used technique to access specific brain areas. Although commercially available, the need to personalize these implants and the high cost prompted us to design open-source customized devices taking advantage of 3D printing technology. Our cannulas consisted in a 3D-printed head mount designed according to the Paxinos coordinates to reach the CA1 area of the hippocampus. To cut guide cannulas to the proper length, we designed and realized an original 3D-printed linear motion apparatus. Polylactic acid thermoplastic polymer was used as printing material. Homemade or commercial cannulas were implanted in 4- to 6-month-old wild-type mice and intrahippocampal injections of amyloid-&beta; peptide at different concentrations were performed. <I>In vivo</I> behavioral studies of novel object recognition indicated that results obtained with homemade versus commercial devices were comparable. Methylene blue injections and Nissl staining confirmed the correct localization of cannulas in the CA1 area of mouse hippocampus. Our method allows a fast manufacturing of hippocampal cannulas preserving the required precision at very low cost. Furthermore, this system can be easily modified to produce cannulas to target other brain areas. In conclusion, 3D printing might be used as a useful and versatile technology to realize open-source customized devices in neuroscience laboratories.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Pregnancy is associated with extraordinary plasticity in the maternal brain. Studies in humans and other mammals suggest extensive structural and functional remodeling of the female brain during and after pregnancy. However, we understand remarkably little about the molecular underpinnings of this natural phenomenon. To gain insight into pregnancy-associated hippocampal plasticity, we performed single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and snATAC-seq from the mouse hippocampus before, during, and after pregnancy. We identified cell type-specific transcriptional and epigenetic signatures associated with pregnancy and postpartum adaptation. In addition, we analyzed receptor-ligand interactions and transcription factor (TF) motifs that inform hippocampal cell type identity and provide evidence of pregnancy-associated adaption. In total, these data provide a unique resource of coupled transcriptional and epigenetic data across a dynamic time period in the mouse hippocampus and suggest opportunities for functional interrogation of hormone-mediated plasticity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Inactivation of the Basolateral Amygdala to Insular Cortex Pathway Makes Sign-Tracking Sensitive to Outcome Devaluation</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Goal-tracking (GT) rats are sensitive to Pavlovian outcome devaluation while sign-tracking (ST) rats are devaluation insensitive. During outcome devaluation, GT rats flexibly modify responding to cues based on the current value of the associated outcome. However, ST rats rigidly respond to cues regardless of the current outcome value. Prior work demonstrated disconnection of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and anterior insular cortex (aIC) decreased both GT and ST behaviors. Given the role of these regions in appetitive motivation and behavioral flexibility, we predicted that disrupting BLA to aIC pathway during outcome devaluation would reduce flexibility in GT rats and reduce rigid appetitive motivation in ST rats. We inhibited the BLA to aIC pathway by infusing inhibitory DREADDs (hM4Di-mcherry) or control (mCherry) virus into the BLA and implanted cannulae into the aIC to inhibit BLA terminals using intracranial injections of clozapine N-oxide (CNO). After training, we used a within<b>-</b>subject satiety-induced outcome devaluation procedure in which we sated rats on training pellets (devalued condition) or homecage chow (valued condition). All rats received bilateral CNO infusions into the aIC before brief nonreinforced test sessions. Contrary to our hypothesis, BLA-IC inhibition did not interfere with devaluation sensitivity in GT rats but did make ST behaviors sensitive to devaluation. Intermediate rats showed the opposite effect, showing rigid responding to cues with BLA-aIC pathway inactivation. Together, these results demonstrate BLA-IC projections mediate tracking-specific Pavlovian devaluation sensitivity and highlights the importance of considering individual differences in Pavlovian approach when evaluating circuitry contributions to behavioral flexibility.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Video recording is essential for behavioral neuroscience research, but the majority of available systems suffer from poor cost-to-functionality ratio. Commercial options frequently come at high financial cost that prohibits scalability and throughput, whereas DIY solutions often require significant expertise and time investment unaffordable to many researchers. To address this, we combined a low-cost Raspberry Pi microcomputer, DIY electronics peripherals, freely available open-source firmware, and custom 3D-printed casings to create Pi USB Cam, a simple yet powerful and highly versatile video recording solution. Pi USB Cam is constructed using affordable and widely available components and requires no expertise to build and implement. The result is a system that functions as a plug-and-play USB camera that can be easily installed in various animal testing and housing sites and is readily compatible with popular behavioral and neural recording software. Here, we provide a comprehensive parts list and step-by-step instructions for users to build and implement their own Pi USB Cam system. In a series of benchmark comparisons, Pi USB Cam was able to capture ultra-wide fields of view of behaving rats given limited object distance and produced high image quality while maintaining consistent frame rates even under low-light and no-light conditions relative to a standard, commercially available USB camera. Video recordings were easily scaled using free, open-source software. Altogether, Pi USB Cam presents an elegant yet simple solution for behavioral neuroscientists seeking an affordable and highly flexible system to enable quality video recordings.</p>

                Mycoses or fungal infections are a general health problem that often occurs in healthy and immunocompromised people in the community. The development of resistant strains in Fungi and the incidence of azole antibiotic resistance in the Asia Pacific which reached 83% become a critical problem nowadays. To control fungal infections, substances and extracts isolated from natural resources, especially in the form of plants as the main sources of drug molecules today, are needed. Especially from Piperaceae, which have long been used in India, China, and Korea to treat human ailments in traditional medicine. The purpose of this review was to describe antifungal activity from Piper crocatum and its phytochemical profiling against lanosterol 14 alpha demethylase CYP51. The methods used search databases from Google Scholar to find the appropriate databases using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram as a clinical information retrieval method. From 1,150,000 results search by database, there were 73 selected articles to review. The review shows that P. crocatum contains flavonoids, tannins, terpenes, saponins, polyphenols, eugenol, alkaloids, quinones, chavibetol acetate, glycosides, triterpenoids or steroids, hydroxychavikol, phenolics, glucosides, isoprenoids, and non-protein amino acids. Its antifungal mechanisms in fungal cells occur due to ergosterol especially lanosterol 14 alpha demethylase CYP51 inhibition as a result of 5,6 desaturase (ERG3) downregulation. P. crocatum has an antifungal activity by its phytochemical profiling that act against fungi by inhibiting the fungal cytochrome P 450 pathway, make damaging cell membranes, fungal growth inhibition, morphological changes, and fungal cell lysis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Investigation of knowledge management and firm competitiveness: core competence as a mediator [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The objective of the current study is to empirically investigate interrelationships among three variables; knowledge management (KM), core competence (CC), and firm competitiveness (FC), and to develop a framework based on empirical evidence for developing countries in South Asia. Methods: This is a cross-sectional quantitative study using the Pakistan stock exchange (PSX) enlisted manufacturing and service organizations having a sample size of 136 companies. A questionnaire was self-administered to the respondents by executing a comprehensive strategy to get a high response rate. A total of 201 valid and complete responses from four manufacturing (automobiles, food & cosmetics, textile, and pharmaceutical) and one service organization (banks) were received using a Likert scale of five points in the questionnaire to examine the subject agreement level against statements. All hypothesized relationships were analyzed by employing SEM using AMOS ver. 20. Results: Results of the study confirmed the positive and significant influence of four constructs of knowledge management processes on four constructs of firm competitiveness (innovation, delivery, quality, and financial performance). Further, knowledge management significantly impacts the firm's competitiveness through the mediation of technology, organization and people (TOP) core competence. The findings also supported that managing the intangible resource of the organization can influence the firm's competitiveness and resource-based TOP competence. Conclusions: The SEM analysis confirmed all hypothetical relationships and supported the knowledge management's direct and indirect effects through core competence on firm competitiveness. The findings showed that the effectiveness of knowledge management will increase the organizations' competitiveness in developing countries' research perspective.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Abnormal CT findings among patients with abdominal pain in the radiology department of a tertiary care center [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Abdominal pain is a common symptom in people of different ages due to various benign and life-threatening causes. Imaging studies, including computerized tomography (CT) scans, explore the clinical reasons behind this pain to prevent delayed diagnosis. Owing to abnormal findings, timely identification of the exact cause of abdominal pain is important in most diseases so treatment can be started earlier, but it has not yet been studied, making this research novel. This study was conducted to identify the prevalence of abnormal CT scan findings among referred patients with abdominal pain and to confirm or determine other diagnoses compared to other imaging modalities in the Emergency Department (ED). Methods: This observational retrospective study was conducted at the King Fahad Hospital, a tertiary hospital in Qassim. We included 2,144 patients who visited the ED and underwent abdominal CT scans between January 2021 and January 2022. Data on age, sex, CT findings, and results from other imaging modalities were collected from the Radiology Department. Results: We found that 2,144 patients referred from the ED to the Radiology Department complained of acute abdominal pain in 2021 for CT diagnosis. Approximately 28.2% of these patients had normal CT diagnoses. The average age at normal CT diagnosis was 38.6 years old. While 52% of CT diagnoses were abnormal, including obstructive ureteric stone (435, 20.3%), appendicitis (205, 9.6%), bowel obstruction (51, 2.4%), renal cancer (27, 1.3%), ovarian cancer (25, 1.2%), and obstructive bladder stone (25, 1.2%), with an average age of 40.4 years old, and 19% with accidental findings. Conclusions: Most of the cases with abdominal pain showed abnormal results in the CT scan. These results demonstrate the sole inefficiency of CT scan for the diagnosis of abdominal pain. So, clinical evaluations should be used together with abdominal ultrasonography to perform a timely and exact diagnosis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Correcting motion induced fluorescence artifacts in two-channel neural imaging</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Matthew S. Creamer, Kevin S. Chen, Andrew M. Leifer, Jonathan W. Pillow</p>

Imaging neural activity in a behaving animal presents unique challenges in part because motion from an animal’s movement creates artifacts in fluorescence intensity time-series that are difficult to distinguish from neural signals of interest. One approach to mitigating these artifacts is to image two channels simultaneously: one that captures an activity-dependent fluorophore, such as GCaMP, and another that captures an activity-independent fluorophore such as RFP. Because the activity-independent channel contains the same motion artifacts as the activity-dependent channel, but no neural signals, the two together can be used to identify and remove the artifacts. However, existing approaches for this correction, such as taking the ratio of the two channels, do not account for channel-independent noise in the measured fluorescence. Here, we present Two-channel Motion Artifact Correction (TMAC), a method which seeks to remove artifacts by specifying a generative model of the two channel fluorescence that incorporates motion artifact, neural activity, and noise. We use Bayesian inference to infer latent neural activity under this model, thus reducing the motion artifact present in the measured fluorescence traces. We further present a novel method for evaluating ground-truth performance of motion correction algorithms by comparing the decodability of behavior from two types of neural recordings; a recording that had both an activity-dependent fluorophore and an activity-independent fluorophore (GCaMP and RFP) and a recording where both fluorophores were activity-independent (GFP and RFP). A successful motion correction method should decode behavior from the first type of recording, but not the second. We use this metric to systematically compare five models for removing motion artifacts from fluorescent time traces. We decode locomotion from a GCaMP expressing animal 20x more accurately on average than from control when using TMAC inferred activity and outperforms all other methods of motion correction tested, the best of which were ~8x more accurate than control.

A few years ago, it was proposed to use the simultaneous quantification of unspliced and spliced messenger RNA (mRNA) to add a temporal dimension to high-throughput snapshots of single cell RNA sequencing data. This concept can yield additional insight into the transcriptional dynamics of the biological systems under study. However, current methods for inferring cell state velocities from such data (known as RNA velocities) are afflicted by several theoretical and computational problems, hindering realistic and reliable velocity estimation. We discuss these issues and propose new solutions for addressing some of the current challenges in consistency of data processing, velocity inference and visualisation. We translate our computational conclusion in two velocity analysis tools: one detailed method <i>κ</i>-velo and one heuristic method eco-velo, each of which uses a different set of assumptions about the data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Low levels of tetracyclines select for a mutation that prevents the evolution of high-level resistance to tigecycline</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jennifer Jagdmann, Dan I. Andersson, Hervé Nicoloff</p>

In a collection of <i>Escherichia coli</i> isolates, we discovered a new mechanism leading to frequent and high-level tigecycline resistance involving tandem gene amplifications of an efflux pump encoded by the <i>tet</i>(A) determinant. Some isolates, despite carrying a functional <i>tet</i>(A), could not evolve high-level tigecycline resistance by amplification due to the presence of a deletion in the TetR(A) repressor. This mutation impaired induction of <i>tetA</i>(A) (encoding the TetA(A) efflux pump) in presence of tetracyclines, with the strongest effect observed for tigecycline, subsequently preventing the development of <i>tet</i>(A) amplification-dependent high-level tigecycline resistance. We found that this mutated <i>tet</i>(A) determinant was common among <i>tet</i>(A)-carrying <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> isolates and analysed possible explanations for this high frequency. First, while the mutated <i>tet</i>(A) was found in several ST-groups, we found evidence of clonal spread among ST131 isolates, which increases its frequency within <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> databases. Second, evolution and competition experiments revealed that the mutation in <i>tetR</i>(A) could be positively selected over the wild-type allele at sub-inhibitory concentrations of tetracyclines. Our work demonstrates how low concentrations of tetracyclines, such as those found in contaminated environments, can enrich and select for a mutation that generates an evolutionary dead-end that precludes the evolution towards high-level, clinically relevant tigecycline resistance.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Delivery of ceramide phosphoethanolamine lipids to the cleavage furrow through the endocytic pathway is essential for male meiotic cytokinesis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Govind Kunduri, Si-Hung Le, Valentina Baena, Nagampalli Vijaykrishna, Adam Harned, Kunio Nagashima, Daniel Blankenberg, Izumi Yoshihiro, Kedar Narayan, Takeshi Bamba, Usha Acharya, Jairaj K. Acharya</p>

Cell division, wherein 1 cell divides into 2 daughter cells, is fundamental to all living organisms. Cytokinesis, the final step in cell division, begins with the formation of an actomyosin contractile ring, positioned midway between the segregated chromosomes. Constriction of the ring with concomitant membrane deposition in a specified spatiotemporal manner generates a cleavage furrow that physically separates the cytoplasm. Unique lipids with specific biophysical properties have been shown to localize to intercellular bridges (also called midbody) connecting the 2 dividing cells; however, their biological roles and delivery mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, we show that ceramide phosphoethanolamine (CPE), the structural analog of sphingomyelin, has unique acyl chain anchors in <i>Drosophila</i> spermatocytes and is essential for meiotic cytokinesis. The head group of CPE is also important for spermatogenesis. We find that aberrant central spindle and contractile ring behavior but not mislocalization of phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs) at the plasma membrane is responsible for the male meiotic cytokinesis defect in CPE-deficient animals. Further, we demonstrate the enrichment of CPE in multivesicular bodies marked by Rab7, which in turn localize to cleavage furrow. Volume electron microscopy analysis using correlative light and focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy shows that CPE-enriched Rab7 positive endosomes are juxtaposed on contractile ring material. Correlative light and transmission electron microscopy reveal Rab7 positive endosomes as a multivesicular body-like organelle that releases its intraluminal vesicles in the vicinity of ingressing furrows. Genetic ablation of Rab7 or Rab35 or expression of dominant negative Rab11 results in significant meiotic cytokinesis defects. Further, we show that Rab11 function is required for localization of CPE positive endosomes to the cleavage furrow. Our results imply that endosomal delivery of CPE to ingressing membranes is crucial for meiotic cytokinesis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Medication-related burden among patients with diabetes mellitus and its relation to diabetic control parameters: an observational study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Diabetes mellitus (DM) refers to a group of metabolic abnormalities that are linked with significant morbidity, death, and health-care costs. Management options for patients with chronic illnesses such as diabetes are growing more complicated, which may result in a therapeutic burden for patients. The purpose of this research was to quantify the forms of concerns diabetic individuals have with medication that influence overall burden, as well as to examine the sociodemographic and clinical factors linked with negative medication use experiences and increased levels of burden. Methods:  The present research was a cross-sectional study of diagnosed diabetes patients who attended the Specialized Center for Endocrinology and Diabetes between 1st of December 2021 and 30th April 2022 in Baghdad, Iraq. The Living with Medicines Questionnaire (LMQ) was used to assess medication-related burden (MRB). Results: The study recruited 193 patients with diabetes mellitus. The participants were adults with an average age of 50±15 years. More than half (52.8%) of the participating patients were women, and more than half (51.3%) also had one or more other chronic diseases. Additionally, 23.3% of patients had polypharmacy (≥ 5 medications). More than one-third had diabetes complications: neuropathy (45.6%) or retinopathy (38.9%). The mean LMQ score was (122.8±15.5). The research revealed that most of the DM patients experienced a moderate degree of medication burden (72.5%), followed by high burden (14.5%), minimum burden (12.4%), and no burden at all (0.5%) with no patient experiencing extremely high burden (0.0 %). Patients with uncontrolled blood glucose (high HbA1c), neuropathy, or retinopathy had a significantly higher medication burden. Conclusions: The MRB among diabetic patients is at a very high level. This information may be helpful to health care professionals and policymakers seeking to understand MRB for patients with diabetes. Future studies should focus on developing interventions that help reduce such burdens.

                Background: In India, the number of patients with type II diabetes mellitus in 2006 was 40.9 million and is expected to increase by 2025 to 69.9 million. Annually 1,00,000 new patients get diagnosed with End-Stage Renal Disease and require maintenance dialysis. Diabetes Mellitus and hypertension were the usual triggers of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). A structured education program helps in the prevention of diabetes and hypertension related complications.  Methods: This quasi-experimental study was conducted among 88 participants who had hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or both for five or more years with an objective to find the effect of a Disease Management Program on delaying progression of CKD in patients with hypertension or diabetes mellitus.   The baseline data were collected on demographic proforma, serum creatinine, blood pressure, and random blood sugar, and the patients were taught the management of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. In the fourth and the eighth month, blood pressure and blood sugar were reassessed. At one-year blood pressure, blood sugar, and serum creatinine were tested. Baseline and one-year follow-up blood pressure, blood sugar, and estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate were compared. Descriptive statistics and "Wilcoxon signed-rank test" were used to analyze the data.    Results: In one year, the mean systolic blood pressure reduced by six mm of Hg and mean blood sugar by 24 mg/dl. The prevalence of CKD stage three and above (< 60 ml/min/m2) was nine (10.22%). The median decline in eGFR was 5 ml/min/m2 (Z= 5.925, P< 0.001).  Conclusion: The Disease Management Program led to improvements in blood pressure and diabetes control and median progression of CKD was estimated at five ml/min/m2/year.

Seven patients were positive and they did not differ from negative cases, except for a more frequent L-dopa responsiveness and gait characterized by a wider base. The two groups did not differ in terms of response rate to tap test or shunt surgery, although step length and gait velocity improved by a lesser extent in positive cases.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Despite the increasing number of genes associated with Charcot–Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, many patients currently still lack appropriate genetic diagnosis for this disease. Autosomal dominant mutations in aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) have been implicated in CMT. Here, we describe causal missense mutations in the gene encoding seryl-tRNA synthetase 1 (<i>SerRS</i>) for 3 families affected with CMT.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Whole-exome sequencing was performed in 16 patients and 14 unaffected members of 3 unrelated families. The functional impact of the genetic variants identified was investigated using bioinformatic prediction tools and confirmed using cellular and biochemical assays.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Combined linkage analysis for the 3 families revealed significant linkage (Zmax LOD = 6.9) between the genomic co-ordinates on chromosome 1: 108681600–110300504. Within the linkage region, heterozygous <i>SerRS</i> missense variants segregated with the clinical phenotype in the 3 families. The mutant SerRS proteins exhibited reduced aminoacylation activity and abnormal SerRS dimerization, which suggests the impairment of total protein synthesis and induction of eIF2α phosphorylation.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings suggest the heterozygous <i>SerRS</i> variants identified represent a novel cause for autosomal dominant CMT. Mutant SerRS proteins are known to impact various molecular and cellular functions. Our findings provide significant advances on the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms associated with ARS-related CMT. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">On climate order: a policy brief [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Climate change, largely triggered by human-induced greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions, seems unstoppable. There was a strong rebound of anthropogenic emissions of CO2, the preponderant GHG in terms of contribution to global warming, around the world after the COVID-19 lockdown. Also, there is still no widely accepted international treaty on curbing the anthropogenic emissions of CH4 and N2O, the second and third predominant GHG, respectively, so far. Thereby, prima facie, in respect to mitigating climate change, currently, humans have no aces up their sleeves. It seems that current temperature rise is not high enough to take alarm until the occurrence of tipping point. Policy: Climate-related international treaties, such as 2016 Paris agreement, are compromises among conflicting geopolitical pressures. However, currently, the climate treaties show little mandatory binding force on the signatories who are able to violate and then get off scot-free, thus may end up like a nostrum. Throughout the European history, I find that the only way, if at all, to achieve the peace or obedience of a treaty is via balancing powers, embodied in Bismarck’s Realpolitik of Germany and Richelieu’s Raison d'état of France. Similarly, the Chinese history in East Asia proved the significance of unadulterated ideological neutrality and Darwinian adaptability in the kaleidoscope of evolving circumstances in maintaining order and enforcement of international treaties through balancing the power of rivalries to constrain ever-recurring challengers for equilibrium. Recommendations: A successful policy needs to make a thorough analysis of all relevant factors to form a long-term strategic notion. Then, statesmen need to distill an array of nebulous, always contradictory options into a tenacious, controllable direction. Thereby, I suggest that, for better curbing global warming, climate agreements or climate club be incorporated into an overall geopolitical framework among the international communities.

                Crude oil pollution is an endemic environmental problem in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria with background pollution levels greater than the regulatory intervention limit of 5000mg/kg of soil as stipulated in the Environmental Guidelines and Standards for Petroleum Industry in Nigeria (EGASPIN) in most polluted sites. Hence, the essence of this study was to evaluate the extent of damage caused by the pollutant (crude oil hydrocarbons) on the soil physicochemical parameters and microbial communities as well as to determine pollution effects on soil microbial ecosystem services. The soil microbial community composition, diversity, functional genes, and metabolic pathways were studied to evaluate the pollutant effect on soil microbiomes and their ability to utilize petroleum hydrocarbons as carbon and energy sources. Two sites Bodo (N4.620134, 7.282998E) and Ngia-Ama Tombia (N4.9816667; 7.0608333E) were chosen for the study. The America standard testing methods (ASTM International) were used in measuring physicochemical parameters of the soil influencing microbial response and pollutant behavior in the soil environment. Soil pH was measured using a pH meter, total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) using gas chromatography with a mass spectrophotometer (GC-MS), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (ASTM D5412-93(2017) e1), Heavy metals analysis (ASTM D8404-21), soil texture (ASTM D6913/D6913M-17). Shotgun metagenomic analysis was used to determine microbial community composition, following “DNA extraction”, library preparation (Nextera® DNA Flex Library Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA), and sequencing using Illuminana NovaSeq® 6000. The results were analyzed using bioinformatics pipelines. The sequences generated were deposited in the European nucleotide Archive (ENA) with project accession number PRJEB53529.

                Chae, Banerjee, et al. identify distinct feedback loops mediated by the mouse olfactory bulb outputs (mitral and tufted cells) and their preferred cortical targets. They suggest that in addition to the mitral-to-piriform cortex pathway, the non-canonical tufted-to-anterior olfactory nucleus pathway is ideally placed for decoding odor identity and intensity.

                Zika virus (ZIKV) infects parallel neural progenitor cell populations in the developing brain and in glioblastoma brain tumors. Bulstrode et al. demonstrate that interferon secretion by human brain myeloid cells can render each neural progenitor population refractory to ZIKV infection, with important implications for neuroprotection and viral oncolysis.

                SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant evades most neutralizing vaccine-induced antibodies and is associated with lower antibody titers upon breakthrough infections than previous variants. Tubiana et al. investigate the underlying mechanism using geometric deep learning, mice immunization experiments and biochemical assays. Mutations reduce antigenicity of the receptor binding site, leading to lower antibody response.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Distinct population and single-neuron selectivity for executive and episodic processing in human dorsal posterior cingulate</a></h4>

              
                Posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) is an enigmatic region implicated in psychiatric and neurological disease, yet its role in cognition remains unclear. Human studies link PCC to episodic memory and default mode network (DMN), while findings from the non-human primate emphasize executive processes more associated with the cognitive control network (CCN) in humans. We hypothesized this difference reflects an important functional division between dorsal (executive) and ventral (episodic) PCC. To test this, we utilized human intracranial recordings of population and single unit activity targeting dorsal PCC during an alternated executive/episodic processing task. Dorsal PCC population responses were significantly enhanced for executive, compared to episodic, task conditions, consistent with the CCN. Single unit recordings, however, revealed four distinct functional types with unique executive (CCN) or episodic (DMN) response profiles. Our findings provide critical electrophysiological data from human PCC, bridging incongruent views within and across species, furthering our understanding of PCC function.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Flexing the principal gradient of the cerebral cortex to suit changing semantic task demands</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how thought emerges from the topographical structure of the cerebral cortex is a primary goal of cognitive neuroscience. Recent work has revealed a principal gradient of intrinsic connectivity capturing the separation of sensory-motor cortex from transmodal regions of the default mode network (DMN); this is thought to facilitate memory-guided cognition. However, studies have not explored how this dimension of connectivity changes when conceptual retrieval is controlled to suit the context. We used gradient decomposition of informational connectivity in a semantic association task to establish how the similarity in connectivity across brain regions changes during familiar and more original patterns of retrieval. Multivoxel activation patterns at opposite ends of the principal gradient were more divergent when participants retrieved stronger associations; therefore, when long-term semantic information is sufficient for ongoing cognition, regions supporting heteromodal memory are functionally separated from sensory-motor experience. In contrast, when less related concepts were linked, this dimension of connectivity was reduced in strength as semantic control regions separated from the DMN to generate more flexible and original responses. We also observed fewer dimensions within the neural response towards the apex of the principal gradient when strong associations were retrieved, reflecting less complex or varied neural coding across trials and participants. In this way, the principal gradient explains how semantic cognition is organised in the human cerebral cortex: the separation of DMN from sensory-motor systems is a hallmark of the retrieval of strong conceptual links that are culturally shared.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">De novo apical domain formation inside the Drosophila adult midgut epithelium</a></h4>

              
                In the adult <i>Drosophila</i> midgut, basal intestinal stem cells give rise to enteroblasts that integrate into the epithelium as they differentiate into enterocytes. Integrating enteroblasts must generate a new apical domain and break through the septate junctions between neighbouring enterocytes, while maintaining barrier function. We observe that enteroblasts form an apical membrane initiation site (AMIS) when they reach the septate junction between the enterocytes. Cadherin clears from the apical surface and an apical space appears between above the enteroblast. New septate junctions then form laterally with the enterocytes and the AMIS develops into an apical domain below the enterocyte septate junction. The enteroblast therefore forms a pre-assembled apical compartment before it has a free apical surface in contact with the gut lumen. Finally, the enterocyte septate junction disassembles and the enteroblast/pre-enterocyte reaches the gut lumen with a fully-formed brush border. The process of enteroblast integration resembles lumen formation in mammalian epithelial cysts, highlighting the similarities between the fly midgut and mammalian epithelia.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Functional gradients in the human lateral prefrontal cortex revealed by a comprehensive coordinate-based meta-analysis</a></h4>

              
                The lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) of humans enables flexible goal-directed behavior. However, its functional organization remains actively debated after decades of research. Moreover, recent efforts aiming to map the LPFC through meta-analysis are limited, either in scope or in the inferred specificity of structure-function associations. These limitations are in part due to the limited expressiveness of commonly-used data analysis tools, which restricts the breadth and complexity of questions that can be expressed in a meta-analysis. Here, we adopt NeuroLang, a novel approach to more expressive meta-analysis based on probabilistic first-order logic programming, to infer the organizing principles of the LPFC from 14,371 neuroimaging studies. Our findings reveal a rostrocaudal and a dorsoventral gradient, respectively explaining the most and second most variance in meta-analytic connectivity across the LPFC. Moreover, we identify a unimodal-to-transmodal spectrum of coactivation patterns along with a concrete-to-abstract axis of structure-function associations extending from caudal to rostral regions of the LPFC. Finally, we infer inter-hemispheric asymmetries along the principal rostrocaudal gradient, identifying hemisphere-specific associations with topics of language, memory, response inhibition, and sensory processing. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive meta-analytic mapping of the LPFC, grounding future hypothesis generation on a quantitative overview of past findings.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Plexins promote hedgehog signaling through their cytoplasmic GAP activity</a></h4>

              
                Hedgehog signaling controls tissue patterning during embryonic and postnatal development and continues to play important roles throughout life. Characterizing the full complement of Hedgehog pathway components is essential to understanding its wide-ranging functions. Previous work has identified Neuropilins, established Semaphorin receptors, as positive regulators of Hedgehog signaling. Neuropilins require Plexin co-receptors to mediate Semaphorin signaling, but a role for Plexins in Hedgehog signaling has not yet been explored. Here, we provide evidence that multiple Plexins promote Hedgehog signaling in NIH/3T3 mouse fibroblasts and that Plexin loss-of-function in these cells results in significantly reduced Hedgehog pathway activity. Catalytic activity of the Plexin GTPase activating protein (GAP) domain is required for Hedgehog signal promotion, and constitutive activation of the GAP domain further amplifies Hedgehog signaling. Additionally, we demonstrate that Plexins promote Hedgehog signaling at the level of GLI transcription factors and that this promotion requires intact primary cilia. Finally, we find that Plexin loss-of-function significantly reduces the response to Hedgehog pathway activation in the mouse dentate gyrus. Together, these data identify Plexins as novel components of the Hedgehog pathway and provide insight into their mechanism of action.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A dynamic and expandable Digital 3D-Atlas MAKER for monitoring the temporal changes in tissue growth during hindbrain morphogenesis</a></h4>

              
                Reconstruction of prototypic three-dimensional (3D) atlases at the scale of whole tissues or organs requires specific methods to be developed. We have established a digital 3D-atlas maker (DAMAKER) and built a digital 3D-atlas to monitor the changes in the growth of the neuronal differentiation domain in the zebrafish hindbrain upon time. DAMAKER integrates spatial and temporal data of cell populations, neuronal differentiation and brain morphogenesis, through <i>in vivo</i> imaging techniques paired with image analyses and segmentation tools. First, we generated a 3D-reference from several imaged hindbrains and segmented them using a trainable tool; these were aligned using rigid registration, revealing distribution of neuronal differentiation growth patterns along the axes. Second, we quantified the dynamic growth of the neuronal differentiation domain by <i>in vivo</i> neuronal birthdating experiments. We generated digital neuronal birthdating 3D-maps and revealed that the temporal order of neuronal differentiation prefigured the spatial distribution of neurons in the tissue, with an inner-outer differentiation gradient. Last, we applied it to specific differentiated neuronal populations such as glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, as proof-of-concept that the digital birthdating 3D-maps could be used as a proxy to infer neuronal birthdate. As this protocol uses open-access tools and algorithms, it can be shared for standardized, accessible, tissue-wide cell population atlas construction.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Ear pinnae in a neotropical katydid (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae) function as ultrasound guides for bat detection</a></h4>

              
                Early predator detection is a key component of the predator-prey arms race and has driven the evolution of multiple animal hearing systems. Katydids (Insecta) have sophisticated ears, each consisting of paired tympana on each foreleg that receive sound both externally, through the air, and internally via a narrowing ear canal running through the leg from an acoustic spiracle on the thorax. These ears are pressure-time difference receivers capable of sensitive and accurate directional hearing across a wide frequency range. Many katydid species have cuticular pinnae which form cavities around the outer tympanal surfaces, but their function is unknown. We investigated pinnal function in the katydid <i>Copiphora gorgonensis</i> by combining experimental biophysics and numerical modelling using 3D ear geometries. We found that the pinnae in <i>C. gorgonensis</i> do not assist in directional hearing for conspecific call frequencies, but instead act as ultrasound detectors. Pinnae induced large sound pressure gains (20–30 dB) that enhanced sound detection at high ultrasonic frequencies (&gt;60 kHz), matching the echolocation range of co-occurring insectivorous gleaning bats. These findings were supported by behavioural and neural audiograms and pinnal cavity resonances from live specimens, and comparisons with the pinnal mechanics of sympatric katydid species, which together suggest that katydid pinnae primarily evolved for the enhanced detection of predatory bats.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Time encoding migrates from prefrontal cortex to dorsal striatum during learning of a self-timed response duration task</a></h4>

              
                Although time is a fundamental dimension of life, we do not know how brain areas cooperate to keep track and process time intervals. Notably, analyses of neural activity during learning are rare, mainly because timing tasks usually require training over many days. We investigated how the time encoding evolves when animals learn to time a 1.5 s interval. We designed a novel training protocol where rats go from naive- to proficient-level timing performance within a single session, allowing us to investigate neuronal activity from very early learning stages. We used pharmacological experiments and machine-learning algorithms to evaluate the level of time encoding in the medial prefrontal cortex and the dorsal striatum. Our results show a double dissociation between the medial prefrontal cortex and the dorsal striatum during temporal learning, where the former commits to early learning stages while the latter engages as animals become proficient in the task.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Phosphoproteomic mapping reveals distinct signaling actions and activation of muscle protein synthesis by Isthmin-1</a></h4>

              
                The secreted protein Isthmin-1 (Ism1) mitigates diabetes by increasing adipocyte and skeletal muscle glucose uptake by activating the PI3K-Akt pathway. However, while both Ism1 and insulin converge on these common targets, Ism1 has distinct cellular actions suggesting divergence in downstream intracellular signaling pathways. To understand the biological complexity of Ism1 signaling, we performed phosphoproteomic analysis after acute exposure, revealing overlapping and distinct pathways of Ism1 and insulin. We identify a 53 % overlap between Ism1 and insulin signaling and Ism1-mediated phosphoproteome-wide alterations in ~ 450 proteins that are not shared with insulin. Interestingly, we find several unknown phosphorylation sites on proteins related to protein translation, mTOR pathway and, unexpectedly, muscle function in the Ism1 signaling network. Physiologically, <i>Ism1</i> ablation in mice results in altered proteostasis, including lower muscle protein levels under fed and fasted conditions, reduced amino acid incorporation into proteins, and reduced phosphorylation of the key protein synthesis effectors Akt and downstream mTORC1 targets. As metabolic disorders such as diabetes are associated with accelerated loss of skeletal muscle protein content, these studies define a non-canonical mechanism by which this anti-diabetic circulating protein controls muscle biology.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The SPARC complex defines RNAPII promoters in Trypanosoma brucei</a></h4>

              
                Kinetoplastids are a highly divergent lineage of eukaryotes with unusual mechanisms for regulating gene expression. We previously surveyed 65 putative chromatin factors in the kinetoplastid <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i>. Our analyses revealed that the predicted histone methyltransferase SET27 and the Chromodomain protein CRD1 are tightly concentrated at RNAPII transcription start regions (TSRs). Here we report that SET27 and CRD1, together with four previously uncharacterized constituents, form the SET27 promoter-associated regulatory complex (SPARC), which is specifically enriched at TSRs. SET27 loss leads to aberrant RNAPII recruitment to promoter sites, accumulation of polyadenylated transcripts upstream of normal transcription start sites, and conversion of some normally unidirectional promoters to bidirectional promoters. Transcriptome analysis in the absence of SET27 revealed upregulated mRNA expression in the vicinity of SPARC peaks within the main body of chromosomes in addition to derepression of genes encoding variant surface glycoproteins (VSGs) located in subtelomeric regions. These analyses uncover a novel chromatin-associated complex required to establish accurate promoter position and directionality.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Twist1 and balanced retinoic acid signaling act to suppress cortical folding in mice</a></h4>

              
                Evolution of cortical folding in gyrencephalic animals enabled higher cognitive functions and complex behaviors. Gene expression patterns and signaling molecules that control cortical folding have only recently been described and thus are still not well understood. In transgenic mouse models with induced cortical folding, amplification of neuroprogenitor cells or loss of their adhesion from the apical ventricular surface leads to gyri formation, whereas decreased cell adhesion in migrating projection neurons causes abnormal neuronal clustering and development of cortical fissures that resemble sulci. We now report that loss of Twist1 expression in the primitive meninx results in cortical folding and sulci formation in the dorsolateral telencephalon. In developing sulcal regions, generation of apical and basal neuroprogenitor cells is normal. Instead, cell proliferation in the developing meninges is reduced, leading to loss of arachnoid fibroblasts that express Raldh2, an enzyme required for retinoic acid synthesis. Maternal retinoic acid supplementation rescues cortical folding and sulci formation. Our results suggest that balanced retinoic acid signaling from the meninges is required to maintain lissencephaly in mice, and in a manner independent from neuroprogenitor cell amplification.

                Aging is associated with stable decline in the brains gray matter. This spatially specific, morphological change in humans has also recently been shown in chimpanzees. The correspondence between species-specific cortical expansion and the degree of brain structure deterioration in aging remains poorly understood. Here, we present a data-driven, cross-species comparative framework and apply it to explore the relationship between gray matter alterations with age and cross-species cerebral expansion in chimpanzees and humans. In humans, we found a positive relationship between cerebral aging and cortical expansion, whereas, in chimpanzees no such relationship was found between aging and cortical expansion. The greater aging and expansion effects in higher-order cognitive regions like the orbito-frontal cortex were observed to be unique to humans. This resembles the last-in, first out hypothesis for neurodevelopment on the evolutionary scale and may suggest a biological cost for recent evolutionary developments of human faculties.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Intrinsic neural timescales in the temporal lobe support an auditory processing hierarchy</a></h4>

              
                During rest, intrinsic neural dynamics manifest at multiple timescales, which progressively increase along visual and somatosensory hierarchies. Theoretically, intrinsic timescales are thought to facilitate processing of external stimuli at multiple stages. However, direct links between timescales at rest and sensory processing, as well as translation to the auditory system are lacking. Here, we used intracranial electroencephalography in humans to show that in the auditory network, intrinsic neural timescales progressively increase, while the spectral slope flattens, from temporal to entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. Within the neocortex, intrinsic timescales exhibit spatial gradients that follow the temporal lobe anatomy. Crucially, intrinsic timescales at rest can explain the latency of auditory responses: as intrinsic timescales increase, so do the single-electrode response onset and peak latencies. Our results suggest that the human auditory network exhibits a repertoire of intrinsic neural dynamics, which manifest in cortical gradients with millimeter resolution and may provide a variety of temporal windows to support auditory processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The development of compulsive coping behaviors depends on the engagement of dorsolateral striatum dopamine-dependent mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                Humans greatly differ in how they cope with stress, a natural behaviour learnt through negative reinforcement. Some individuals engage in displacement activities, others in exercise or comfort eating, and others still in alcohol use. Across species, adjunctive behaviors, such as polydipsic drinking, are used as a form of displacement activity that reduce distress. Some individuals, in particular those that use alcohol to self-medicate, tend to lose control over such coping behaviors, which become excessive and compulsive. However, the psychological and neural mechanisms underlying this individual vulnerability have not been elucidated. Here we tested the hypothesis that the development of compulsive adjunctive behaviors stems from the functional engagement of the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) dopamine-dependent habit system after a prolonged history of adjunctive responding. We measured in longitudinal studies in male Sprague Dawley rats the sensitivity of early established vs compulsive polydipsic water or alcohol drinking to a bilateral infusion of the dopamine receptor antagonist -flupentixol into the anterior DLS (aDLS). While most rats acquired a polydipsic drinking response with water, others only did so with alcohol. Whether reliant on water or alcohol, the acquisition of this coping response was insensitive to aDLS dopamine receptor blockade. In contrast, after prolonged experience, adjunctive drinking became dependent on the aDLS dopamine-dependent habit system at a time it was compulsive in vulnerable individuals. These data suggest that habits may develop out of negative reinforcement and that the engagement of their underlying striatal system is necessary for the manifestation of adjunctive behaviors.

                SYNGAP1 haploinsufficiency in humans results in severe neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by intellectual disability, autism, epilepsy, and sensory processing deficits. However, circuit mechanisms that underlie SYNGAP1-related neurodevelopmental disorders are poorly understood. A decrease of SynGAP in mice causes cognitive and behavioral deficits in part by disrupting the development of excitatory glutamatergic connections. Whether and to what extent SynGAP functions in inhibitory circuits remain unclear. We show that interneuron-specific SYNGAP1 heterozygous mice display learning deficits characterized by elevated behavioral responses in the absence of relevant sensory input and premature responses to a sensory input unrelated to reward acquisition. These behavioral deficits are associated with specific circuit abnormalities within primary somatosensory cortex, characterized by increased detrimental correlations and elevated responses to irrelevant sensory stimuli. Collectively, we show that a decrease of SynGAP in inhibitory interneurons disrupts sensory representation in the primary sensory cortex, which likely contributes to behavioral deficits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Resolving inter-regional communication capacity in the human connectome</a></h4>

              
                Applications of graph theory to the human brain network have led to the development of several models of how neural signaling unfolds atop its structure. Analytic measures derived from these communication models have mainly been used to extract global characteristics of brain networks, obscuring potentially informative inter-regional relationships. Here we develop a simple standardization method to investigate polysynaptic communication pathways between pairs of cortical regions. This procedure allows us to determine which pairs of nodes are topologically closer and which are topologically further than expected on the basis of their degree. We find that communication pathways delineate canonical intrinsic functional systems. By relating nodal communication capacity to meta-analytic probabilistic patterns of functional specialization, we also show that areas that are most closely integrated within the network are associated with higher-order cognitive functions. We find that these regions' proclivity towards functional integration could naturally arise from the brain's anatomical configuration through evenly distributed connections among multiple specialized communities. Throughout, we consider the effect of the network's spatial embedding on inter-regional communication capacity. Altogether, the present findings uncover a relationship between polysynaptic communication pathways and the brain's intrinsic functional organization and demonstrate that network integration facilitates cognitive integration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Important anatomical, age-related, and species considerations regarding ocular fibulin-3 (EFEMP1) analysis</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: Fibulin-3 (F3) or EFEMP1 is a secreted extracellular matrix glycoprotein implicated in several ocular diseases. Little is known about the native biology of this protein. Thus, our study aims to determine expression and localization characteristics of F3 utilizing a range of mammalian species as well as F3-associated changes with age. Methods: Gene expression analyses for fibulins as well as immunohistochemistry for F3 were conducted in ocular tissue from mice, pigs, non-human primates (NHPs), and humans (n = 3-5). Age-based F3 expression study along with changes in ECM remodeling enzymes was also evaluated in mice. Results: Within the mouse retina, F3 staining was consistent throughout the entirety of the retina (far-periphery, mid-periphery, and central), being enriched in the ganglion cell layer and inner nuclear layer (INL). However, in humans, the F3 staining pattern was quite unique; enriched in the RPE, INL, and outer nuclear layer (ONL) in the peripheral retina, but then shifting to predominantly outer plexiform layer (OPL) staining in the central retina and macula with waning RPE immunoreactivity approaching the fovea. We demonstrate that F3 expression in the mouse retina significantly increases with age, and the levels of extracellular F3 degrading enzymes produced by the RPE and retina (e.g., Mmp2 and Htra1) decrease with age. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that F3 has distinct species-dependent as well as ocular region-specific expression and localization patterns. We also show that F3 and ECM enzyme dynamics favor F3 accumulation in the retina and RPE with increasing age.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Treatment of Hydrocephalus by Decreasing Inflammatory Cytokine Response Using GIT 27</a></h4>

              
                Background Surgical insertion of a ventricular shunt initiates a cytokine response shown to play a role in shunt failure caused by obstruction. These pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines cause astrocytes, amongst others, to enter an activated state which causes an increase in attachment. 4,5-Dihydro-3-phenyl-5-isoxazoleacetic acid (GIT 27) is a reagent with immunomodulatory properties which acts by blocking the main signaling protein on astrocytes and microglia called toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4). Methods In this experiment, we tested the effect of GIT 27 on astrocytes when used as a pre-treatment, simultaneous treatment, and post-treatment relative to shunt insertion represented by the introduction of IL-1{beta} or IL-10. Control, DMSO vehicle control, and GIT 27 treated sample groups were assayed for cell counts and cytokine concentration data. Results Exposure of astrocytes to suspended GIT 27 in a DMSO vehicle caused a decrease in cell attachment and a significant decrease in the concentration of the majority of cytokines. Comparisons of GIT 27 exposure times, represented by pre-, simultaneous, and post-treatment groups, showed that pre-treatment with GIT 27 is most effective at decreasing cellular attachment where post-treatment was generally the most effective at decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations. In future practice, this could be embodied by pharmacologic dosing prior to shunting and/or slow release from the shunt surface. Conclusions GIT 27 is most effective at decreasing cell counts and cytokines when in-suspension compared to when attached to the shunt surface. Our data show that GIT 27 has the potential to be used as an effective way to modulate the cytokine response associated with shunt insertion.

                The mRNA cap-binding protein, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), is crucial for translation and regulated by Ser209 phosphorylation. However, the biochemical and physiological role of eIF4E phosphorylation in translational control of long-term synaptic plasticity is unknown. We demonstrate that phospho-ablated Eif4eS209A knockin mice are profoundly impaired in dentate gyrus LTP maintenance in vivo, while basal perforant path-evoked transmission and LTP induction are intact. mRNA cap-pulldown assays show that phosphorylation is required for synaptic activity-induced removal of translational repressors from eIF4E, allowing initiation complex formation. Using ribosome profiling, we identified selective, phospho-eIF4E-dependent translation of the Wnt signaling pathway in in vivo LTP. Surprisingly, the canonical Wnt effector, {beta}-catenin, was massively recruited to the eIF4E cap complex following LTP induction in wild-type, but not Eif4eS209A, mice. These results demonstrate a critical role for activity-evoked eIF4E phosphorylation in dentate gyrus LTP maintenance, bidirectional remodeling of the mRNA cap-binding complex, and mRNA-specific translational control linked to Wnt pathway.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Simple Neurofeedback via Machine Learning: Challenges in real time multivariate assessment of meditation state</a></h4>

              
                Attaining proficiency in meditation is difficult, especially without feedback since the mind may be easily distracted with thoughts and only long term efforts see any impact. Self-regulation would be much more effective if provided real time assessment and this can be achieved through EEG neurofeedback. Therefore, this work proposes a scheme for assessing meditation-like state in real time from short EEG segments, using low computational settings. Signal processing techniques are used to extract features from long term meditation practitioners' multichannel EEG data. An autoencoder model is then trained on these features such that the model can be run in real time. Its reconstruction errors or its latent variables are used to provide non typical feedback parameters which are used to establish an objective measure of meditation ability. Our approach is optimised to have lightweight architectures handling small blocks of data and can be conveniently used on low density EEG acquisition systems as it requires only a few channels. However, our experimental results suggest that the meditation state has substantial overlap even in terms of multivariate EEG features and show prominent temporal dynamics, both of which are not captured using simple one class algorithms. Being an extremely flexible one-class model, we have described multiple improvements to the proposed autoencoder model to address the above issues and develop simple yet high precision neurofeedback protocols.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cellular proteomic profiling using proximity labelling by TurboID-NES in microglial and neuronal cell lines.</a></h4>

              
                Different brain cell types play distinct roles in brain development and disease. Molecular characterization of cell-specific mechanisms using cell type-specific approaches at the protein (proteomic) level, can provide biological and therapeutic insights. Conventional approaches to investigate cell type-specific proteomes from brain are incompatible with the survival of adult murine neurons and contamination from non-target cell-types and experimental artifacts confound the data. To overcome these barriers, in vivo proteomic labeling with proximity dependent biotinylation of cytosolic proteins using TurboID with a Nuclear Export Sequence (TurboID-NES), coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) of labeled proteins, emerged as a powerful strategy to sample cell type-specific proteomes in the native state of cells without need for cellular isolation. To complement in vivo proximity labeling approaches, in vitro studies are needed to ensure that cellular proteomes using the TurboID-NES approach are representative of the whole cell proteome, and capture cellular responses to stimuli without disruption of cellular processes. To address this, we generated murine neuroblastoma (N2A) and microglial (BV2) lines stably expressing TurboID-NES to biotinylate the cellular proteome for downstream purification and analysis using MS. TurboID-NES expression and biotinylation did not significantly impact homeostatic cellular proteomes of BV2 and N2A cells, and did not affect cytokine production or mitochondrial respiration of BV2 cells under resting or lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated conditions. TurboID-NES mediated biotinylation captured 59% of BV2 and 65% of N2A proteomes under homeostatic conditions. Acute LPS treatment significantly altered microglial proteomes, but not N2A proteomes. LPS treatment induced >500 differentially expressed proteins in transduced BV2 proteomes, including an increase in canonical M1 proteins (IL1a, Irg1, Oasl1) and a decrease in canonical M2 proteins (Arg1, MGl2).

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Characterising modulatory effects of transcranial random noise stimulation using the perceptual template model.</a></h4>

              
                Neural noise is an inherent property of all nervous systems. However, the mechanisms by which such random and fluctuating neural activity influences perception are still unclear. To elucidate the relationship between neural noise and perceptual performance we require techniques that can safely manipulate neural noise in humans. Transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS), a form of electrical brain stimulation, has been proposed to increase neural noise according to principles of stochastic resonance (SR); where small to moderate intensities of tRNS improve performance, while higher intensities are detrimental. To date, high intensity (i.e., >2mA) tRNS effects on neural noise levels have not been directly quantified, nor have the detrimental effects proposed by SR been demonstrated in early visual processing. For this purpose, we applied a maximum current intensity of 3mA high-frequency tRNS to the visual cortex (V1) during an orientation discrimination task across increasing external visual noise levels, and fit the perceptual template model to contrast thresholds to quantify intrinsic mechanisms related to noise underlying changes in perceptual performance. We found that tRNS generally worsened perceptual performance by increasing observers internal noise and reducing the ability to filter external noise compared to sham. While most observers experienced detrimental effects, others demonstrated improved perceptual performance (i.e., reduced internal noise and better noise filtering). Preliminary evidence suggests that individual baseline internal noise levels may drive the observed beneficial or detrimental observer responses to tRNS. These findings have important implications for the application of tRNS to investigate the impact of internal noise and noise filtering processes on perception.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Characterising stationary and dynamic effective connectivity changes in the motor network during and after tDCS</a></h4>

              
                The exact mechanisms behind the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) at a network level are still poorly understood, with most studies to date focusing on local (cortical) effects and changes in motor-evoked potentials or BOLD signal. Here, we explored stationary and dynamic effective connectivity across the motor network at rest in two experiments where we applied tDCS over the primary motor cortex (M1-tDCS) or the cerebellum (cb-tDCS) respectively. Two cohorts of healthy volunteers (n = 21 and n = 22) received anodal, cathodal, and sham tDCS sessions (counterbalanced) during 20 minutes of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We used spectral Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) and hierarchical Parametrical Empirical Bayes (PEB) to analyse data after (compared to a pre-tDCS baseline) and during stimulation. We also implemented a novel dynamic (sliding windows) DCM/PEB approach to model the nature of network reorganisation across time. In both experiments we found widespread effects of tDCS that extended beyond the targeted area and modulated effective connectivity between cortex, thalamus, and cerebellum. These changes were characterised by unique nonlinear temporal fingerprints across connections and polarities. Our results challenged the classic notion of anodal and cathodal tDCS as excitatory and inhibitory respectively, as well as the idea of a cumulative effect of tDCS over time. Instead, they described a rich set of changes with specific spatial and temporal patterns. Our work provides a starting point for advancing our understanding of network-level tDCS effects and optimise its cognitive and clinical applications.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Disruption of Tonic Endocannabinoid Signaling Triggers the Generation of a Stress Response</a></h4>

              
                Endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling gates many aspects of the stress response, including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The HPA axis is controlled by corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) producing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN). Disruption of eCB signaling increases drive to the HPA axis, but the mechanisms subserving this process are poorly understood. Using an array of cellular, endocrine, and behavioral readouts associated with the activation of CRH neurons in the PVN, we evaluated the contributions of tonic eCB signaling to the generation of a stress response. The CB1 receptor antagonist/inverse agonist AM251, neutral antagonist NESS243, and NAPE PLD inhibitor LEI401 all uniformly increased c-fos in the PVN, unmasked stress-linked behaviors, such as grooming, and increased circulating CORT, recapitulating the effects of stress. Similar effects were also seen after direct administration of AM251 into the PVN, while optogenetic inhibition of PVN CRH neurons ameliorated stress-like behavioral changes produced by disruption of eCB signaling. These data indicate that under resting conditions, constitutive eCB signaling restricts activation of the HPA axis through local regulation of CRH neurons in the PVN.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Travelling waves observed in MEG data can be explained by two discrete sources</a></h4>

              
                Growing evidence suggests that travelling waves are functionally relevant for cognitive operations in the brain. Several electroencephalography (EEG) studies report on a perceptual alpha-echo, representing the brain response to a random visual flicker, propagating as a travelling wave across the cortical surface. In this study, we ask if the propagating activity of the alpha-echo is best explained by a set of discrete sources mixing at the sensor level rather than a cortical travelling wave. To this end, we presented participants with gratings modulated by random noise and simultaneously acquired the ongoing MEG. The perceptual alpha-echo was estimated using the temporal response function linking the visual input to the brain response. At the group level, we observed a spatial decay of the amplitude of the alpha-echo with respect to the sensor where the alpha-echo was the largest. Importantly, the propagation latencies consistently increased with the distance. Interestingly, the propagation of the alpha-echoes was predominantly centro-lateral, while EEG studies reported mainly posterior-frontal propagation. Moreover, the propagation speed of the alpha-echoes derived from the MEG data was around 10 m/s, which is higher compared to the 2 m/s reported in EEG studies. Using source modelling, we found an early component in the primary visual cortex and a phase-lagged late component in the parietal cortex, which may underlie the travelling alpha-echoes at the sensor level. We then simulated the alpha-echoes using realistic EEG and MEG forward models by placing two sources in the parietal and occipital cortices in accordance with our empirical findings. The two-source model could account for both the direction and speed of the observed alpha-echoes in the EEG and MEG data. Our results demonstrate that the propagation of the perceptual echoes observed in EEG and MEG data can be explained by two sources mixing at the scalp level equally well as by a cortical travelling wave. This conclusion however does not put into question continuous travelling waves reported in intracranial recordings.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cones and Cone Pathways Remain Functional in Advanced Retinal Degeneration</a></h4>

              
                Most defects causing retinal degeneration in retinitis pigmentosa (RP) are rod-specific mutations, but the subsequent degeneration of cones, which produces loss of daylight vision and high-acuity perception, is the most debilitating feature of the disease. To understand better why cones degenerate and how cone vi-sion might be restored, we have made the first single-cell recordings of light responses from degenerating cones and retinal interneurons after most rods have died and cones have lost their outer-segment disk membranes and synaptic pedicles. We show that degenerating cones have functional cyclic-nucleotide-gated channels and can continue to give light responses, apparently produced by opsin localized either to small areas of organized membrane near the ciliary axoneme or distributed throughout the inner segment. Light responses of second-order horizontal and bipolar cells are smaller and less sensitive but surprisingly similar to those of normal retina. Furthermore, retinal output as reflected in responses of ganglion cells is largely intact at cone-mediated light levels. Together, these findings show that cones and their retinal path-ways can remain functional even as degeneration is progressing, an encouraging result for future research aimed at enhancing the light sensitivity of residual cones to restore vision in patients with genetically inherited retinal degeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">High-resolution analysis of individual Drosophila melanogaster larvae within groups uncovers inter- and intra-individual variability in locomotion and its neurogenetic modulation</a></h4>

              
                Neuronally orchestrated muscular movement and locomotion are defining faculties of multicellular animals. Due to its numerically simple brain and neuromuscular system and its genetic accessibility, the larva of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is an established model to study these processes at tractable levels of complexity. However, although the faculty of locomotion clearly pertains to the individual animal, present studies of locomotion in larval Drosophila mostly use group assays and measurements aggregated across individual animals. The alternative is to measure animals one at a time, an extravagance for larger-scale analyses. In principle or in practice, this in particular rules out grasping the inter- and intra-individual variability in locomotion and its genetic and neuronal determinants. Here we present the IMBA (Individual Maggot Behaviour Analyser) for tracking and analysing the behaviour of individual larvae within groups. Using a combination of computational modelling and statistical approaches, the IMBA reliably resolves individual identity across collisions. It does not require specific hardware and can therefore be used in non-expert labs. We take advantage of the IMBA first to systematically describe the inter- and intra-individual variability in free, unconstrained locomotion in wild-type animals. We then report the discovery of a novel, complex locomotion phenotype of a mutant lacking an adhesion-type GPCR. The IMBA further allows us to determine, at the level of individual animals, the modulation of locomotion across repeated activations of dopamine neurons. Strikingly, IMBA can also be used to analyse 'silly walks', that is patterns of locomotion it was not originally designed to investigate. This is shown for the transient backward locomotion induced by brief optogenetic activation of the brain-descending 'mooncrawler' neurons, and the variability in this behaviour. Thus, the IMBA is an easy-to-use toolbox allowing an unprecedentedly rich view of the behaviour and behavioural variability of individual Drosophila larvae, with utility in multiple biomedical research contexts.

                Visual processing in the retina depends on the collective activity of large ensembles of neurons organized in different layers. Current techniques for measuring activity of layer-specific neural ensembles rely on expensive pulsed infrared lasers to drive 2-photon activation of calcium-dependent fluorescent reporters. Here, we present a 1-photon light-sheet imaging system that can measure the activity in hundreds of ex vivo retinal neurons over a large field of view while simultaneously presenting visual stimuli. This allowed for a reliable functional classification of different retinal ganglion cell types. We also demonstrate that the system has sufficient resolution to image calcium entry at individual synaptic release sites across the axon terminals of dozens of simultaneously imaged bipolar cells. The simple design, a large field of view, and fast image acquisition, make this a powerful system for high-throughput and high-resolution measurements of retinal processing at a fraction of the cost of alternative approaches.

                A bidirectional communication exists between the brain and the gut, in which the gut microbiota influences cognitive function and vice-versa. Gut dysbiosis has been linked to several diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). However, the relationship between gut dysbiosis and markers of cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD), a major contributor to ADRD, is unknown. In this cross-sectional study, we examined the connection between the gut microbiome, cognitive, and neuroimaging markers of cSVD in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS). Markers of cSVD included white matter hyperintensities (WMH), peak width of skeletonized mean diffusivity (PSMD), and executive function (EF), estimated as the difference between the trail-making tests B and A. We included 972 FHS participants with MRI scans, neurocognitive measures, and stool samples and quantified the gut microbiota composition using 16S rRNA sequencing. We used multivariable association and differential abundance analyses adjusting for age, sex, BMI, and education level to estimate the association between gut microbiota and WMH, PSMD, and EF measures. Our results suggest an increased abundance of Pseudobutyrivibrio and Ruminococcus genera was associated with lower WMH and PSMD (p-values < 0.001), as well as better executive function (p-values < 0.01). In addition, in both differential and multivariable analyses, we found that the gram-negative bacterium Barnesiella intestinihominis was strongly associated with markers indicating a higher cSVD burden. Finally, functional analyses using PICRUSt implicated various KEGG pathways, including microbial quorum sensing, AMP/GMP-activated protein kinase, phenylpyruvate, and {beta}-hydroxybutyrate production previously associated with cognitive performance and dementia. Our study provides important insights into the association between the gut microbiome and cSVD, but further studies are needed to replicate the findings.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Common population codes produce extremely nonlinear neural manifolds</a></h4>

              
                Populations of neurons represent sensory, motor and cognitive variables via patterns of activity distributed across the population. The size of the population used to encode a variable is typically much greater than the dimension of the variable itself, and thus the corresponding neural population activity occupies lower-dimensional subsets of the full set of possible activity states. Given population activity data with such lower-dimensional structure, a fundamental question asks how close the low-dimensional data lies to a linear subspace. The linearity or non-linearity of the low-dimensional structure reflects important computational features of the encoding, such as robustness and generalizability. Moreover, identifying such linear structure underlies common data analysis methods such as Principal Component Analysis. Here we show that for data drawn from many common population codes the resulting point clouds and manifolds are exceedingly nonlinear, with the dimension of the best-fitting linear subspace growing at least exponentially with the true dimension of the data. Consequently, linear methods like Principal Component Analysis fail dramatically at identifying the true underlying structure, even in the limit of arbitrarily many data points and no noise.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Developmental Profile of Visual Cortex Astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                Though once thought of as passive support cells for neurons, it is now clear that astrocytes signal via calcium (Ca2+) to trigger gliotransmission that impacts surrounding neurons and synapses. We therefore investigated how astrocytes in layer-5 (L5) mouse visual cortex mature electrophysiologically and morphologically over postnatal days (P) 3 - 30 and how these relate to changes in spontaneous Ca2+ events. Across this age range, resting membrane potential increased, and input resistance decreased. Astrocytes also revealed different membrane responses to voltage steps: notably, membrane responses became more passive with age. Two-photon (2p) imaging of dye-loaded patched cells and confocal imaging revealed that gap-junction coupling increased starting around P7. Morphological reconstructions revealed increased branch density but also shorter branches after P20, suggesting that astrocyte branches may get pruned as dense tiling is established. Finally, we visualized spontaneous Ca2+ transients with 2p microscopy and found that Ca2+ events decorrelated, became more frequent as well as briefer with age. As astrocytes mature, spontaneous Ca2+ activity thus changes from relatively cell-wide, synchronous waves to local transients. Several astrocyte properties were stably mature from ~P15 onwards, although morphology continued to develop further. Our findings provide a descriptive foundation of astrocyte maturation, useful for the study of astrocytic impact on visual cortex critical period plasticity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Decoding Age-specific Changes in Brain Functional Connectivity Using a Sliding-window Based Clustering Method</a></h4>

              
                Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) permits detailed study of human brain function. Understanding the age-specific development of neural circuits in the typically developing brain may help us generate new hypotheses for developmental psychopathologies. Functional connectivity (FC), defined as the statistical associations between two brain regions, has been widely used in estimating functional networks from fMRI data. Previous research has shown that the evolution of FC does not follow a linear trend, particularly from childhood to young adulthood. Thus, this work aims to detect the nuanced FC changes with age from the non-linear curves and identify age-period-specific FC development patterns. We proposed a sliding-window based clustering approach to identify refined age interval of FC development. We used resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data from the human connectome project-development (HCP-D), which recruited children, adolescents, and young adults aged from 5 to 21 years. Our analyses revealed different developmental patterns of resting-state FC by sex. In general, females matured earlier than males, but males had a faster development rate during age 100-120 months. We identified four developmental phases: network construction in late childhood, segregation and integration construction in adolescence, network pruning in young adulthood, and a unique phase in males -- U-shape development. In addition, we investigated the sex effect on the slopes of FC-age correlation. Males had higher slopes during late childhood and young adulthood. These results inform trajectories of normal FC development, information that can in the future be used to pinpoint when development might go awry in neurodevelopmental disorders.

                Citation metrics influence academic reputation and career trajectories. Recent works have highlighted flaws in citation practices in the neurosciences, such as the under-citation of women. However, self-citation rates--or how much authors cite themselves--have not yet been comprehensively investigated in the neurosciences. This work characterizes self-citation rates in basic, translational, and clinical neuroscience literature by collating 157,001 articles from 63 journals between the years 2000-2020. In analyzing over eight million citations, we demonstrate four key findings: 1) self-citation rates over the years are constant for the Last Authors but decreasing for the First Authors, 2) self-citation rate is strongly correlated with years of academic experience, 3) authors from particular countries cite themselves much more than other countries, and 4) early-career men cite themselves 41% more than early-career women. As it is essential for authors to be aware of their self-citation practices, we developed a tool to calculate self-citation rates: https://github.com/mattrosenblatt7/self_citation. Our characterization of self-citation practices represents an initial step towards improving equity in citations and, ultimately, neuroscience research.

                The inner ear has a rich population of pericytes, a multi-functional mural cell essential for sensory hair cell heath and normal hearing. However, the mechanics of how pericytes contribute to the homeostasis of the auditory vascular-neuronal complex in the spiral ganglion is not yet known. In this study, using an inducible and conditional pericyte depletion mouse (PdgfrbCreERT2+/-;ROSA26iDTR+/-) model, we demonstrate, for the first time, that pericyte depletion causes loss of vascular volume and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) and adversely affects hearing sensitivity. Using an in vitro trans-well co-culture system, we show pericytes markedly promote neurite and vascular branch growth in neonatal SGN explants and adult SGNs. The pericyte-controlled neural growth is strongly mediated by pericyte-released exosomes containing vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A). Treatment of neonatal SGN explants or adult SGNs with pericyte-derived exosomes significantly enhances angiogenesis, SGN survival, and neurite growth, all of which were inhibited by a selective blocker of the VEGF receptor 2 (Flk1). Our study demonstrates that pericytes in the adult ear are critical for vascular stability and SGN health. Cross-talk between pericytes and SGNs via exosomes is essential for neuronal and vascular health and normal hearing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Classic and dissociative psychedelics induce similar hyper-synchronous states in the cognitive-limbic cortex-basal ganglia system</a></h4>

              
                The neurophysiological mechanisms behind the profound changes in perception and cognition induced by psychedelic drugs are not well understood. To identify neuronal activity specific to the psychedelic state, we here investigated the effects of classic psychedelics (LSD, DOI) and dissociative psychedelics (ketamine, PCP) on neuronal firing rates and local field potentials in several brain structures involved in cognitive processing in freely moving rats. The classic psychedelics had a net inhibitory effect on firing rates of putative interneurons and principal cells in all recorded regions. The dissociative psychedelics had a similar inhibitory effect on principal cells, but an opposite excitatory effect on interneurons in most regions. However, the inhibitory effect on principal cells was not specific to the psychedelic state, as similar inhibition occurred with a non-psychedelic psychotropic control (amphetamine). In contrast, both types of psychedelics dramatically increased the prevalence of high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in local field potentials, while the non-psychedelic control did not. Further analysis revealed strong HFO phase locking between structures and very small phase differences corresponding to <1 ms delays. Such standing-wave behavior suggests local generation of HFOs in multiple regions and weak, fast coupling between structures. The observed HFO hypersynchrony is likely to have major effects on processes that rely on integration of information across neuronal systems, and it might be an important mechanism behind the changes in perception and cognition during psychedelic drug use. Potentially, similar mechanisms could induce hallucinations and delusions in psychotic disorders and would constitute promising targets for new antipsychotic treatments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Neurotoxin DSP-4 Dysregulates the Locus Coeruleus-Norepinephrine System and Recapitulates Molecular and Behavioral Aspects of Prodromal Neurodegenerative Disease</a></h4>

              
                The noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) is among the earliest sites of tau and alpha-synuclein pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), respectively. The onset of these pathologies coincides with loss of noradrenergic fibers in LC target regions and the emergence of prodromal symptoms including sleep disturbances and anxiety. Paradoxically, these prodromal symptoms are indicative of a noradrenergic hyperactivity phenotype, rather than the predicted loss of norepinephrine (NE) transmission following LC damage, suggesting the engagement of complex compensatory mechanisms. Because current therapeutic efforts are targeting early disease, interest in the LC has grown, and it is critical to identify the links between pathology and dysfunction. We employed the LC-specific neurotoxin DSP-4, which preferentially damages LC axons, to model early changes in the LC-NE system pertinent to AD and PD in male and female mice. DSP-4 (2 doses of 50 mg/kg, 1 week apart) induced LC axon degeneration, triggered neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, and reduced tissue NE levels. There was no LC cell death or changes to LC firing, but transcriptomics revealed reduced expression of genes that define noradrenergic identity and other changes relevant to neurodegenerative disease. Despite the dramatic loss of LC fibers, NE turnover and signaling were elevated in terminal regions and were associated with anxiogenic phenotypes in multiple behavioral tests. These results represent a comprehensive analysis of how the LC-NE system responds to axon/terminal damage reminiscent of early AD and PD at the molecular, cellular, systems, and behavioral levels, and provides potential mechanisms underlying prodromal neuropsychiatric symptoms.

                Cortico-thalamo-cortical loops have a central role in cognition and motor control, but precisely how thalamus contributes to these processes is unclear. Recent studies showing evidence of plasticity in thalamocortical synapses indicate a role for thalamus in shaping cortical dynamics -- and thus behavior -- through learning. Since corticothalamic projections compress cortical activity into a lower-dimensional thalamic activity space, we hypothesized that the computational role of thalamus would depend critically on the structure of corticothalamic connectivity. To test this, we identified the optimal corticothalamic structure that promotes biologically plausible learning in thalamocortical synapses. We found that corticothalamic structures specialized to carry an efference copy of the cortical output benefit motor control, while corticothalamic connections that communicate the directions of highest variance in cortical activity are optimal for working memory tasks. We analyzed neural recordings from mice performing grasping and delayed discrimination, and found corticothalamic interactions consistent with these predictions. These results suggest that thalamus orchestrates cortical dynamics in a functionally precise manner through structured connectivity.

                In the olfactory bulb (OB), a large population of axon-less inhibitory interneurons, the granule cells (GCs), coordinate network activity and tune the output of principal neurons, the mitral and tufted cells (MCs), through dendrodendritic interactions. Furthermore, GCs undergo neurogenesis throughout life, providing a source of plasticity to the neural network of the OB. The function and integration of GCs in the OB is regulated by several afferent neuromodulatory signals, including noradrenaline (NA), a state-dependent neuromodulator that plays a crucial role regulating cortical function and task-specific decision processes. However, the mechanisms by which NA regulates GC function are not fully understood. Here, we show that NA modulates hyperpolarization-activated currents (Ih) via the activation of 2-adrenergic receptors in adult-born GCs (abGCs), thus directly acting on channels that play essential roles in regulating neuronal excitability and network oscillations in the brain. This modulation affects the dendrodendritic output of GCs leading to an enhancement of lateral inhibition onto the MCs. Furthermore, we show that NA modulates subthreshold resonance in GCs, which could affect the temporal integration of abGCs. Together, these results provide a novel mechanism by which a state-dependent neuromodulator acting on Ih can regulate GC function in the bulb.

                Brookshire (2022) claims that previous analyses of periodicity in detection performance after a reset event suffer from extreme false-positive rates. Here we show that this conclusion is based on an incorrect implemention of a null-hypothesis of aperiodicity, and that a correct implementation confirms low false-positive rates. Furthermore, we clarify that the previously used method of shuffling-in-time, and thereby shuffling-in-phase, cleanly implements the null hypothesis of no temporal structure after the reset, and thereby of no phase locking to the reset. Moving from a corresponding phase-locking spectrum to an inference on the periodicity of the underlying process can be accomplished by parameterizing the spectrum. This can separate periodic from non-periodic components, and quantify the strength of periodicity.

                Blood-brain barrier (BBB) impairment is an important pathophysiological process in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and a potential biomarker for early diagnosis of AD. However, most current neuroimaging methods assessing BBB function need the injection of exogenous contrast agents (or tracers), which limits the application of these methods in a large population. In this study, we aim to explore the feasibility of vascular water exchange MRI (VEXI), a diffusion-MRI-based method to assess the BBB permeability to water molecules without using a contrast agent, in the detection of the BBB breakdown in AD. We tested VEXI on a 3T MRI scanner on three groups: AD patients (AD group), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients due to AD (MCI group), and the age-matched normal cognition subjects (NC group). Interestingly, we find that VEXI can detect the BBB permeability to water molecules increase in MCI and this BBB breakdown happens specifically in the hippocampus. This BBB breakdown gets worse and extends to more brain regions (orbital frontal cortex and thalamus) from MCI group to the AD group. Furthermore, we find that the BBB breakdown of these three regions detected by VEXI is correlated significantly with impairment of respective cognitive domains independent of age, sex and education. These results suggest VEXI is a promising method to assess the BBB breakdown in AD.

                Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-euphoric component of cannabis, reduces seizures in multiple forms of pediatric epilepsy, but the mechanism(s) of anti-seizure action remain unclear. In one leading model, CBD acts at glutamatergic axon terminals, blocking pro-excitatory actions of an endogenous membrane phospholipid, lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI), at the G protein-coupled receptor GPR55. However, the impact of LPI-GPR55 signaling at inhibitory synapses and in epileptogenesis remains underexplored. We found that LPI transiently increased hippocampal CA3 to CA1 excitatory presynaptic release probability and evoked synaptic strength in WT mice, while attenuating inhibitory postsynaptic strength by decreasing GABAAR gamma 2 and gephyrin puncta. Effects of LPI at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses were eliminated by CBD pretreatment and absent after GPR55 deletion. Acute pentylenetrazole-induced seizures elevated levels of GPR55 and LPI, and chronic lithium pilocarpine-induced epileptogenesis potentiated the pro-excitatory effects of LPI. We propose that CBD exerts potential therapeutic effect both by blocking synaptic effects of LPI and dampening hyperexcitability.

                The treatment of neurodegenerative diseases is hindered by lack of interventions capable of steering multimodal whole-brain dynamics towards patterns indicative of preserved brain health. To address this problem, we combined deep learning with a model capable of reproducing whole-brain functional connectivity in patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). These models included disease-specific atrophy maps as priors to modulate local parameters, revealing increased stability of hippocampal and insular dynamics as signatures of brain atrophy in AD and bvFTD, respectively. Using variational autoencoders, we visualized different pathologies and their severity as the evolution of trajectories in a low-dimensional latent space. Finally, we perturbed the model to reveal key AD- and bvFTD-specific regions to induce transitions from pathological to healthy brain states. Overall, we obtained novel insights on disease progression and control by means of external stimulation, while identifying dynamical mechanisms that underlie functional alterations in neurodegeneration.

                The human brain has a highly complex structure both on the microscopic and macroscopic scales. Increasing evidence has emphasized the role of mechanical forces for cortical folding - a classical hallmark of the human brain. However, the link between cellular processes at the microscale and mechanical forces at the macroscale remains insufficiently understood. Recent findings suggest that an additional proliferating zone, the outer subventricular zone (OSVZ), is decisive for the particular size and complexity of the human cortex. To better understand how the OSVZ affects cortical folding, we establish a multifield computational model that couples cell proliferation and migration at the cell scale with growth and cortical folding at the organ scale by combining an advection-diffusion model with the theory of finite growth. We validate our model based on data from histologically stained sections of the human fetal brain. Finally, we address open questions regarding the role of the OSVZ for the formation of cortical folds. The presented framework not only improves our understanding of human brain development, but could eventually help diagnose and treat neuronal disorders arising from disruptions in cellular development and associated malformations of cortical development.

                Neurexins are highly-spliced transmembrane cell adhesion molecules that bind an array of partners via their extracellular domains. However, much less is known about the signaling pathways downstream of neurexin's largely-invariant intracellular domain. C. elegans contains a single neurexin gene that we have previously shown is required for presynaptic assembly and stabilization. To gain insight into the signaling pathways mediating neurexin's presynaptic functions, we endogenously tagged neurexin's intracellular domain with TurboID, a proximity ligation method, allowing us to isolate adjacent biotinylated proteins by streptavidin pull-down and mass spectrometry. We compared our experimental strain to a control strain containing neurexin still tagged with TurboID but in which neurexin's PDZ-binding motif was endogenously deleted, leading to its dissociation from presynaptic active zones. Using this approach we identified both known and novel intracellular interactors of neurexin, including active zone scaffolds, actin-binding proteins, signaling molecules, and mediators of RNA trafficking, protein synthesis and degradation, among others. Characterization of mutants for candidate neurexin interactors revealed that they recapitulate aspects of the nrx-1 mutant phenotype, suggesting they may be involved in neurexin signaling.

	<p>Dementia is a major health concern globally and cross-culturally with progressive decline in cognition, mobility and communication. There are few interventions for end-stage dementia (ESD) although music interventions have been observed to be accessible for people with mid to late-stage dementia. The lack of protocols and measures suited to ESD has limited research into the effects of music therapy. Measure sensitivity to minimal responsiveness is one limitation to the use of existing music intervention measures with ESD. This exploratory study examined the clinical utility of the Music Therapy Assessment Tool for Awareness in Disorders of Consciousness (MATADOC) for use with people with end-stage dementia, including preliminary reliability and validity. The MATADOC is a standardized assessment for minimally responsive patients with disorders of consciousness and may be useful for ESD. Using repeated measures with blinded MATADOC-trained raters, MATADOC data were collected with a small convenience sample of people with ESD in a residential care setting. Clinical utility data were collected from the raters and evaluated using a multidimensional model. To explore its functionality, MATADOC outcomes were compared to another measure for music interventions in dementia. The MATADOC may be useful for assessing functioning and responsiveness to music interventions for people with ESD without the risk of floor effects. Modifying the MATADOC protocol and assessment documentation prior to testing with a larger sample will enhance its sensitivity specific to ESD and age-related needs, providing a new music-based ESD assessment.</p>

	<p>The attachment representation (AR) of individuals affects emotional and cognitive information processes and is considered an important modulating factor of neuroendocrine stress responses. The neuropeptide oxytocin is studied as one biomolecular component underpinning this modulation. A validated procedure used in attachment-related research is the Adult Attachment Projective Picture System (AAP). To date, only a limited number of studies investigated oxytocin and neuroendocrine reactivity in the context of an attachment-related stimulus similar to the APP. In this pilot study, N = 26 men of recent fatherhood were exposed to the AAP to classify AR and to investigate salivary changes in oxytocin, cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) after AAP stimulation. We observed increased oxytocin levels in response to AAP exposure, and this increase was more pronounced in fathers with unresolved/disorganized AR. No significant changes in cortisol and DHEA concentrations were observed in response to AAP administration. Interestingly, differences in basal cortisol levels (before the AAP) also depended on AR classification. Here, the group of men with unresolved/disorganized AR showed higher levels of cortisol compared to fathers with organized AR. To conclude, the finding of increased salivary oxytocin levels in response to the AAP further indicates its validity as an instrument to stimulate the attachment system.</p>

	<p>Linguistic relativism is the idea that the structure of language influences thought. The present study investigates linguistic relativism by asking whether people who speak a gendered language think of objects in a way that is consistent with the grammatical gender (more masculine or feminine) more than people who speak a language without that linguistic feature. Odorants are unique stimuli for examining this question, because they carry a semantic gender without a biological one, yet gender is thought to be a central dimension of their perception. Canadian participants in the present study (native French or native English speakers) described a set of labeled odorants that varied systematically in grammatical and semantic gender to produce an implicit gender measure and also explicitly rated them for gender. Analysis of the implicit femininity contained in participants&amp;amp;rsquo; descriptions showed a tendency for both native French and native English speakers to produce descriptions that were consistent with semantic gender; moreover, there were no effects of grammatical gender on implicit or explicit ratings. These results suggest that in a bilingual culture, French speakers may have been influenced by the anthropomorphism associated with odorants rather than grammatical gender.</p>

	<p>The link between Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and steeper delay discounting has been established and incorporated into theories of ADHD. This study examines a novel interpretation according to which ADHD is linked to sub-optimal temporal decision-making and suggests inconsistency as a potential underlying mechanism. In two experiments, MTurk workers completed a self-report questionnaire on symptoms of ADHD and a temporal decision making task consisting of choices between smaller&amp;amp;ndash;immediate and larger&amp;amp;ndash;delayed options. The delayed option was better in some items, whereas the immediate option was better in others. The rate of choices of the delayed option and the consistency of choices were measured. The results of both studies show that high symptoms of ADHD were linked to fewer choices of the delayed option when it was better, but also to more choices of the delayed option when it was not better. In addition, ADHD was linked to higher inconsistency in both conditions. The findings suggest that ADHD is linked to sub-optimal temporal decision-making rather than steeper delay discounting, and provide further support to the phenomenon of inconsistency in ADHD.</p>

	<p>Rehabilitation of severe impairment in motor function following stroke is very challenging. This is because one of the driving forces for recovery of motor function is tasks practice, something this category of patients cannot voluntarily perform. However, it has now been shown that tasks practice can equally be carried out cognitively and through observation of another person&amp;amp;rsquo;s practice, using techniques known as mental practice and tasks observation, respectively. Mental practice and tasks observation are believed to activate networks of neurons in the brain known as mirror neurons and mentalizing systems to induce recovery. The effectiveness of these techniques has, however, limited evidence at the moment. One possible explanation for this could be the nature of the protocols of these techniques, especially as regards to the intensity of practice. This article proposes ways the potentials of the mirror neurons and mentalizing systems can be harnessed to optimize recovery of severe impairment in motor function using mental practice and tasks observation. The article suggests, among other ways, protocols where tasks observation or mirror therapy are carried out first, and are then followed by mental practice, increasing the number of times the tasks are observed or mentalized, observation of significant others performing the tasks and mental practice of very familiar tasks.</p>

	<p>Background: Fenestrations are rare, but well-known, vascular variations of the cerebral arteries. They are mostly incidental, asymptomatic angiographic findings and might precipitate vascular lesions such as AVM, aneurysmal dilatation, or even ischemic symptoms. However, association between arterial fenestration and brain aneurysms has not been clearly established. Objective: To evaluate whether incidence of arterial fenestrations are associated with brain aneurysm development and investigate the prevalence and most-common localizations of arterial fenestrations of the human brain. Design: Case&amp;amp;ndash;control study. Setting: All patients examined by CT angiography in University Hospital No. 4 in Lublin from 2009 to 2019. Patients: Each patient showing at least one cerebral aneurysm was included in the case group and each patient without cerebral aneurysm on CT angiography was included in the control group. Measurements: CT angiography examinations were conducted using the standard protocol used in the 1st Department of Radiology, Medical University of Lublin, Poland. The database and statistical research were conducted by use of the Statistica software (ver. 13.3, Tibco Software Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA). Results: A total of 6545 CTA examinations were included in the study. Most of the aneurysms were located on the MCA: 629 (38.59%), ICA: 466 (28.59%) and AComA: 192 (11.78%). Cerebral arterial fenestration showed a non-statistically significant elevated risk for brain aneurysms in the entire study population (OR: 1.157; 95% CI: 0.826&amp;amp;ndash;1.621; p = 0.39). Among 6545 cranial CTA examinations, cerebral vessel fenestration was found in 49 of them, which constituted 0.75%. The most common vascular fenestrations were those located in the ACA (30.61%), BA (30.61%) and AComA (22.45%), while other fenestrations occurred infrequently. There were no significant differences in the age of patients in the individuals with vascular fenestration (p &amp;amp;gt; 0.05). VA fenestration was slightly more common in men (16.67%) than in women (5.41%). However, these differences were not statistically significant (p = 0.216). Limitations: Our study has several limitations, including selection bias regarding examined population. Second, we assume that the total number of fenestrations detected in our study was underestimated due to the limitations of the CT method in comparison to other radiologic modalities. Conclusions: Cerebral arterial fenestrations are rare vascular malformations. The ACA is the most common localization of fenestrations, followed by BA and AComA. Fenestrations of cerebral arteries insignificantly increase the risk of cerebral aneurysm formation. Further prospective studies are necessary to make this association more precise.</p>

	<p>Objective: To explore whether a systematic combined therapeutic modality (CTM) could quickly and effectively improve the severity of obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;compulsive disorder (OCD) and the insight of OCD patients. Methods: Included in this study were 100 patients with OCD according to the 5th Edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), for a 2-week short-term treatment. They were assigned to a drug-alone group (n = 57), and a CTM group (n = 43) using drug treatment in combination with cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). The therapeutic outcome was assessed by the Yale&amp;amp;ndash;Brown Obsessive&amp;amp;ndash;Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), Brown Assessment of Beliefs Scale (BABS), 24-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD-24) and Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) before and after treatment. All data were treated with SPSS25.0 Software. Results: After the 2-week treatment, the success rate in the CTM group was significantly higher than that in the drug-alone group. Y-BOCS overall and factor scores were decreased as compared with those before treatment in both groups. HAMD, HAMA and BABS overall scores were all decreased after treatment in the CTM group. In addition, compared with the drug-alone group, the Y-BOCS overall score and factor score, HAMD overall score and HAMA overall score were all decreased significantly in CTM group, while the Y-BOCS score reduction rate was increased significantly. Insight was improved in eight cases (57.14%) in the CTM group containing 14 cases with poor insight. Multinomial logistic regression analysis showed that CTM was beneficial for the insight improvement of OCD patients (OR = 91.04&amp;amp;ndash;139.68); this improvement was more pronounced in patients with low baseline BABS overall scores (OR = 0.07). Conclusion: CTM may be an effective short-term strategy to improve the severity of OCD and insight of OCD patients and, therefore, is worthy of clinical promotion and application.</p>

	<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a diagnosis based on social communication deficits and prevalence of repetitive stereotyped behaviors, but sensorimotor disturbances are commonly exhibited. This longitudinal study aimed at exploring the development of the ability to form mental motor representations (motor imagery; MI) in 14 children with ASD and 17 typically developing (TD) children at 7, 8 and 9 years of age. MI was investigated using a hand laterality paradigm from which response times (RT) and error rates were extracted and compared with performance on a visually based mental rotation task (VI). A criterion task was used to ensure that the children could perform the task. The results showed wide performance variability in the ASD group with more failures than TD in the MI criterion task, especially at 7 years. For all age levels and both the MI and VI tasks, the error rates were significantly higher and RTs longer for the ASD group compared with TD. Signs of MI strategies were however noted in the ASD group as biomechanically constrained orientations had longer RTs than less constrained orientations, a RT pattern that differed from the VI task. The presence of MI in the ASD group was most evident at 9 years, but the error rates remained high at all ages, both in the MI and VI task. In comparison, the TD group showed stable MI strategies at all ages. These findings indicate that MI ability is delayed and/or impaired in children with ASD which may be related to difficulties performing required mental rotations.</p>

	<p>Understanding the pathophysiology and genetic background of Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) increases the likelihood of developing effective disease-modifying therapeutic strategies. In particular, the discovery of genetic variants causing or increasing the risk for PD has contributed to refining the clinical, biological, and molecular classification of the disease and has offered new insights into sporadic forms. It is even more evident that specific genetic mutations can show different responses to pharmacological and device-aided therapies. To date, several agents acting on multiple PD-causing pathogenic pathways have been tested as disease-modifying strategies, with disappointing results. This may be caused by the recruitment of PD populations whose underlying molecular pathophysiology is heterogeneous. We believe that an effective model of personalized medicine must be prioritized in the near future. Here, we review the current therapeutic options under clinical and preclinical development for PD and discuss the key pending questions and challenges to face for successful clinical trials. Furthermore, we provide some insights into the role of genetics in guiding the decision-making process on symptomatic and device-aided therapies for PD in daily clinical practice.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Investigation of MicroRNA-134 as a Target against Seizures and SUDEP in a Mouse Model of Dravet Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                <p>Dravet syndrome (DS) is a catastrophic form of pediatric epilepsy mainly caused by noninherited mutations in the <I>SCN1A</I> gene. DS patients suffer severe and life-threatening focal and generalized seizures which are often refractory to available anti-seizure medication. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) based approaches may offer treatment opportunities in DS. MicroRNAs are short noncoding RNAs that play a key role in brain structure and function by post-transcriptionally regulating gene expression, including ion channels. Inhibiting miRNA-134 (miR-134) using an antimiR ASO (Ant-134) has been shown to reduce evoked seizures in juvenile and adult mice and reduce epilepsy development in models of focal epilepsy. The present study investigated the levels of miR-134 and whether Ant-134 could protect against hyperthermia-induced seizures, spontaneous seizures and mortality (SUDEP) in F1.<I>Scn1a(</I>+/&ndash;<I>)<sup>tm1kea</sup></I> mice. At P17, animals were intracerebroventricular injected with 0.1&ndash;1 nmol of Ant-134 and subject to a hyperthermia challenge at postnatal day (P)18. A second cohort of P21 F1.<I>Scn1a(</I>+/&ndash;<I>)<sup>tm1kea</sup></I> mice received Ant-134 and were followed by video and EEG monitoring until P28 to track the incidence of spontaneous seizures and SUDEP. Hippocampal and cortical levels of miR-134 were similar between wild-type (WT) and F1.<I>Scn1a(</I>+/&ndash;<I>)<sup>tm1kea</sup></I> mice. Moreover, Ant-134 had no effect on hyperthermia-induced seizures, spontaneous seizures and SUDEP incidence were unchanged in Ant-134-treated DS mice. These findings suggest that targeting miR-134 does not have therapeutic applications in DS.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prevalence of common mental health problems and associated factors among university students visiting Supara mental health service: A cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Early studies found that the mental health problems rate was relatively high in university students. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of mental problems and associated factors in university students. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional descriptive study at Supara mental health service in the Faculty of Medicine Vajira Hospital between February 2020 to June 2021. The primary outcome was the prevalence of psychiatric diagnosis according to the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10). The secondary assessments included the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), 8 items from the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) to assess suicidal risk (8Q), and the Thai Mental Health Indicator (TMHI-15). The prevalence of mental health problems was presented by frequency and percentage. In addition, multivariable regression analysis was used to identify potential predictors of mental health problems.   Results: A total of 184 participants (62% female; mean age = 22.49 years (SD 3.93) were recruited. The depressive disorders, adjustment disorders, and anxiety disorders rates were 57.1%, 15.2% and 13.6%, respectively. Grade point averages (GPAs) below 3.0 (OR=3.09, 95%CI: 1.17-8.14) and a family history of mental disorder (OR=3.40, 95%CI: 1.10-10.48) were significant associated factors of moderate to severe mental health problems. Detecting and screening these factors may help the university to provide early detection and treatment for students. Conclusions: Depressive disorders were the most common mental health disorders. Females, low GPAs and a family history of mental disorder were predictors of moderate to severe mental health problems.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Design And Development of a Remote Monitoring Agent For Energy Service Companies In The Telecommunication Industry [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) for telecommunication sites operate by providing reliable power supply at 100% uptime and billing the mobile operators accommodated on their sites for power usage. To achieve this, there is a need for them to accurately meter the power consumed by connected telecommunication equipment. Method: This work focused on the design and implementation of a remote monitoring agent (RMA) that will pool both power and environmental data from a telecommunication site. The data pool can be presented as real-time data on the RMA’s webpage, it can be downloaded as historical data, and it can be sent to a remote cloud server at regular intervals. The RMA collects both power and environmental data over an RS485 Modbus network and I2C bus respectively. An alternating current (AC) energy meter and a direct current (DC) energy meter were used to harvest the energy data while the environmental data were harvested using a developed Input/Output controller board based on an Atmega328P microcontroller. Raspberry pi was used as the master controller and Node.js was used to build the application running on the master controller.  Result: The result showed how both power and environmental data can be harvested from a telecommunication site and locally presented on the web dashboard for real-time monitoring of the site power system. The data could be saved locally on the RMA and downloaded for future use. Conclusion: The implementation of this work provided a prototype of the remote monitoring agent (RMA) that can be deployed by Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) in the telecommunication industry to monitor the usage of the power systems on a cell site.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Primary graft failure due to a reversed lenticule in Descemet Stripping Automated Endothelial Keratoplasty [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction and importance: This report details the clinical features and management in a case of Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) which had primary graft failure (PGF) due to an inverted yet attached lenticule. Presentation of case: A 66-year-old gentleman had poor visual recovery in the right eye after undergoing cataract surgery 12 years prior to presentation. The visual acuity was counting fingers and examination revealed endothelial decompensation. The patient underwent a DSAEK and postoperatively had a well attached lenticule. However, the cornea was edematous three weeks after the surgery and optical coherence tomography (OCT) revealed a reversed lenticule. The patient underwent a repeat DSAEK and had an uneventful postoperative course. The visual acuity was 20/40 after 7 months with a clear cornea and a well attached graft. Discussion: PGF is a rare complication following DSAEK which occurs due to poor endothelial function of the donor graft. Insertion of a reversed lenticule may get overlooked as a cause of PGF unless the graft edge profile is examined on an OCT scan. The graft in the current case was well attached despite its inverted position suggesting that graft adherence is perhaps not a function of the corneal endothelial pumps in isolation and may be driven by factors such as the intraocular pressure. Conclusion: A reversed DSAEK lenticule may have normal adherence to the host stroma and must be considered in cases with PGF. OCT of the graft edge is required for diagnosis before performing a repeat keratoplasty.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Factors predicting complications, neurologic deterioration and mortality for patients with meningioma surgery: An observational study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Meningiomas are the second most common intracranial neoplasm, contributing to 30% of all intracranial tumors. Clinical examination, anatomical pathology testing, CT, and MRI are required to confirm the meningioma diagnosis. Surgery is the therapy of choice for meningiomas. Understanding factors affecting the outcome of meningioma surgery is critical to predicting the outcome of meningioma surgery. Methods: A retrospective analytic method was conducted in this study, which included meningioma patients who underwent surgery at Dr. Soetomo General Academic Hospital between January 2014 and December 2020. The study incorporated secondary data in the form of medical records. Data collection was followed by binomial logistic regression analysis using SPSS IBM 25. Results:  A total of 440 samples of patients with meningiomas were obtained through medical records. Post-operative hematoma (2.5%), postoperative infection (3.0%), neurologic deterioration (3.9%), and 30-day mortality (2.3%) were the postoperative complications reported. Emergency surgery was found to be a significant predictor of postoperative hematoma (p=0.025; OR=4.539; 95% CI: 1.211-17.006), postoperative infection (p=0.015; OR=4.777; 95% CI: 1.362-16.751), neurologic deterioration (p=0.022; OR=5,151; 95% CI: 1,271-20,882), and 30-day mortality (p=0.002; OR=17,874; 95% CI: 2,933-108,915). Simpson Grade IV (p=0.016; OR=33,524; 95% CI: 1.905-590.056) was a significant predictive factor for postoperative hematomas. Post-operative hematoma was a significant predictive factor for neurologic deterioration (p=0.000; OR=235,807; 95% CI: 38,058-1461,069) and 30-day mortality (p=0.001; OR=40,047; 95% CI: 4,985-321,699). Conclusions: Post-operative complications following meningioma surgery may result in high morbidity and mortality. The predictive factors for meningioma surgery complications were identified in this study. Knowledge of these factors may aid in preventing or predicting meningioma surgery complications.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Optimizing laboratory-based surveillance networks for monitoring multi-genotype or multi-serotype infections</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Qu Cheng, Philip A. Collender, Alexandra K. Heaney, Aidan McLoughlin, Yang Yang, Yuzi Zhang, Jennifer R. Head, Rohini Dasan, Song Liang, Qiang Lv, Yaqiong Liu, Changhong Yang, Howard H. Chang, Lance A. Waller, Jon Zelner, Joseph A. Lewnard, Justin V. Remais</p>

With the aid of laboratory typing techniques, infectious disease surveillance networks have the opportunity to obtain powerful information on the emergence, circulation, and evolution of multiple genotypes, serotypes or other subtypes of pathogens, informing understanding of transmission dynamics and strategies for prevention and control. The volume of typing performed on clinical isolates is typically limited by its ability to inform clinical care, cost and logistical constraints, especially in comparison with the capacity to monitor clinical reports of disease occurrence, which remains the most widespread form of public health surveillance. Viewing clinical disease reports as arising from a latent mixture of pathogen subtypes, laboratory typing of a subset of clinical cases can provide inference on the proportion of clinical cases attributable to each subtype (i.e., the mixture components). Optimizing protocols for the selection of isolates for typing by weighting specific subpopulations, locations, time periods, or case characteristics (e.g., disease severity), may improve inference of the frequency and distribution of pathogen subtypes within and between populations. Here, we apply the Disease Surveillance Informatics Optimization and Simulation (DIOS) framework to simulate and optimize hand foot and mouth disease (HFMD) surveillance in a high-burden region of western China. We identify laboratory surveillance designs that significantly outperform the existing network: the optimal network reduced mean absolute error in estimated serotype-specific incidence rates by 14.1%; similarly, the optimal network for monitoring <i>severe</i> cases reduced mean absolute error in serotype-specific incidence rates by 13.3%. In both cases, the optimal network designs achieved improved inference without increasing subtyping effort. We demonstrate how the DIOS framework can be used to optimize surveillance networks by augmenting clinical diagnostic data with limited laboratory typing resources, while adapting to specific, local surveillance objectives and constraints.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Pruning deep neural networks generates a sparse, bio-inspired nonlinear controller for insect flight</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Olivia Zahn, Jorge Bustamante Jr., Callin Switzer, Thomas L. Daniel, J. Nathan Kutz</p>

Insect flight is a strongly nonlinear and actuated dynamical system. As such, strategies for understanding its control have typically relied on either model-based methods or linearizations thereof. Here we develop a framework that combines model predictive control on an established flight dynamics model and <i>deep neural networks</i> (DNN) to create an efficient method for solving the inverse problem of flight control. We turn to natural systems for inspiration since they inherently demonstrate network pruning with the consequence of yielding more efficient networks for a specific set of tasks. This bio-inspired approach allows us to leverage network pruning to optimally sparsify a DNN architecture in order to perform flight tasks with as few neural connections as possible, however, there are limits to sparsification. Specifically, as the number of connections falls below a critical threshold, flight performance drops considerably. We develop sparsification paradigms and explore their limits for control tasks. Monte Carlo simulations also quantify the statistical distribution of network weights during pruning given initial random weights of the DNNs. We demonstrate that on average, the network can be pruned to retain a small amount of original network weights and still perform comparably to its fully-connected counterpart. The relative number of remaining weights, however, is highly dependent on the initial architecture and size of the network. Overall, this work shows that sparsely connected DNNs are capable of predicting the forces required to follow flight trajectories. Additionally, sparsification has sharp performance limits.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Leaf vein patterning is regulated by the aperture of plasmodesmata intercellular channels</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nguyen Manh Linh, Enrico Scarpella</p>

To form tissue networks, animal cells migrate and interact through proteins protruding from their plasma membranes. Plant cells can do neither, yet plants form vein networks. How plants do so is unclear, but veins are thought to form by the coordinated action of the polar transport and signal transduction of the plant hormone auxin. However, plants inhibited in both pathways still form veins. Patterning of vascular cells into veins is instead prevented in mutants lacking the function of the <i>GNOM</i> (<i>GN</i>) regulator of auxin transport and signaling, suggesting the existence of at least one more <i>GN</i>-dependent vein-patterning pathway. Here we show that in Arabidopsis such a pathway depends on the movement of auxin or an auxin-dependent signal through plasmodesmata (PDs) intercellular channels. PD permeability is high where veins are forming, lowers between veins and nonvascular tissues, but remains high between vein cells. Impaired ability to regulate PD aperture leads to defects in auxin transport and signaling, ultimately leading to vein patterning defects that are enhanced by inhibition of auxin transport or signaling. <i>GN</i> controls PD aperture regulation, and simultaneous inhibition of auxin signaling, auxin transport, and regulated PD aperture phenocopies null <i>gn</i> mutants. Therefore, veins are patterned by the coordinated action of three <i>GN</i>-dependent pathways: auxin signaling, polar auxin transport, and movement of auxin or an auxin-dependent signal through PDs. Such a mechanism of tissue network formation is unprecedented in multicellular organisms.
