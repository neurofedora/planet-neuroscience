     alt="Neural alterations in working memory of mild-moderate TBI: An fMRI study in Malaysia"/>
<p>The conventional letter n-back task elicited stronger activation in the mild–moderate TBI participants than the guided letter n-back. In TBI, there was a right dominance for working memory (WM) in the prefrontal cortex and precentral gyrus. Meanwhile, the load-dependent processing of WM was localized to the left middle frontal gyrus.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Working memory (WM) encompasses crucial cognitive processes or abilities to retain and manipulate temporary information for immediate execution of complex cognitive tasks in daily functioning such as reasoning and decision-making. The WM of individuals sustaining traumatic brain injury (TBI) was commonly compromised, especially in the domain of WM. The current study investigated the brain responses of WM in a group of participants with mild–moderate TBI compared to their healthy counterparts employing functional magnetic resonance imaging. All consented participants (healthy: <i>n</i> = 26 and TBI: <i>n</i> = 15) performed two variations of the n-back WM task with four load conditions (0-, 1-, 2-, and 3-back). The respective within-group effects showed a right hemisphere-dominance activation and slower reaction in performance for the TBI group. Random-effects analysis revealed activation difference between the two groups in the right occipital lobe in the guided n-back with cues, and in the bilateral occipital lobe, superior parietal region, and cingulate cortices in the n-back without cues. The left middle frontal gyrus was implicated in the load-dependent processing of WM in both groups. Further group analysis identified that the notable activation changes in the frontal gyri and anterior cingulate cortex are according to low and high loads. Though relatively smaller in scale, this study was eminent as it clarified the neural alterations in WM in the mild–moderate TBI group compared to healthy controls. It confirmed the robustness of the phenomenon in TBI with the reproducibility of the results in a heterogeneous non-Western sample.</p>

These stereotypes are expressed and perpetuated in language, with women being described in less agentic terms than men....

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">{alpha} Phase-Amplitude Tradeoffs Predict Visual Perception</a></h4>

              
                <p>Spontaneous &alpha; oscillations (~10 Hz) have been associated with various cognitive functions, including perception. Their phase and amplitude independently predict cortical excitability and subsequent perceptual performance. However, the causal role of &alpha; phase-amplitude tradeoffs on visual perception remains ill-defined. We aimed to fill this gap and tested two clear predictions from the pulsed inhibition theory according to which &alpha; oscillations are associated with periodic functional inhibition. (1) High-&alpha; amplitude induces cortical inhibition at specific phases, associated with low perceptual performance, while at opposite phases, inhibition decreases (potentially increasing excitation) and perceptual performance increases. (2) Low-&alpha; amplitude is less susceptible to these phasic (periodic) pulses of inhibition, leading to overall higher perceptual performance. Here, cortical excitability was assessed in humans using phosphene (illusory) perception induced by single pulses of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied over visual cortex at perceptual threshold, and its postpulse evoked activity recorded with simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG). We observed that prepulse &alpha; phase modulates the probability to perceive a phosphene, predominantly for high-&alpha; amplitude, with a nonoptimal phase for phosphene perception between &ndash;/2 and &ndash;/4. The prepulse nonoptimal phase further leads to an increase in postpulse-evoked activity [event-related potential (ERP)], in phosphene-perceived trials specifically. Together, these results show that &alpha; oscillations create periodic inhibitory moments when &alpha; amplitude is high, leading to periodic decrease of perceptual performance. This study provides strong causal evidence in favor of the pulsed inhibition theory.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Postnatal CNS development is fine-tuned to drive the functional needs of succeeding life stages; accordingly, the emergence of sensory and motor functions, behavioral patterns and cognitive abilities relies on a complex interplay of signaling pathways. Strictly regulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling mediated by L-type channels (LTCCs) is crucial in neural circuit development and aberrant increases in neuronal LTCC activity are linked to neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. In the amygdala, a brain region that integrates signals associated with aversive and rewarding stimuli, LTCCs contribute to NMDA-independent long-term potentiation (LTP) and are required for the consolidation and extinction of fear memory. <I>In vitro</I> studies have elucidated distinct electrophysiological and synaptic properties characterizing the transition from immature to functionally mature basolateral subdivision of the amygdala (BLA) principal neurons. Further, acute increase of LTCC activity selectively regulates excitability and spontaneous synaptic activity in immature BLA neurons, suggesting an age-dependent regulation of BLA circuitry by LTCCs. This study aimed to elucidate whether early life alterations in LTCC activity subsequently affect synaptic strength and amygdala-dependent behaviors in early adulthood. <I>In vivo</I> intra-amygdala injection of an LTCC agonist at a critical period of postnatal neurodevelopment in male rat pups was used to examine synaptic plasticity of BLA excitatory inputs, expression of immediate early genes (IEGs) and glutamate receptors, as well as anxiety and social affiliation behaviors at a juvenile age. Results indicate that enhanced LTCC activity in immature BLA principal neurons trigger persistent changes in the developmental trajectory to modify membrane properties and synaptic LTP at later stages, concomitant with alterations in amygdala-related behavioral patterns.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Oxytocin (Oxt) controls reproductive physiology and various kinds of social behaviors, but the exact contribution of Oxt to different components of parental care still needs to be determined. Here, we illustrate the neuroanatomical relations of the parental nurturing-induced neuronal activation with magnocellular Oxt neurons and fibers in the medial preoptic area (MPOA), the brain region critical for parental and alloparental behaviors. We used genetically-targeted mouse lines for <I>Oxt</I>, <I>Oxt receptor</I> (<I>Oxtr</I>), <I>vasopressin receptor 1a</I> (<I>Avpr1a</I>), <I>vasopressin receptor 1b</I> (<I>Avpr1b</I>), and <I>thyrotropin-releasing hormone</I> (<I>Trh</I>) to systematically examine the role of Oxt-related signaling in pup-directed behaviors. The <I>Oxtr</I>-<I>Avpr1a</I>-<I>Avpr1b</I> triple knock-out (TKO), and <I>Oxt</I>-<I>Trh</I>-<I>Avpr1a</I>-<I>Avpr1b</I> quadruple KO (QKO) mice were grossly healthy and fertile, except for their complete deficiency in milk ejection and modest deficiency in parturition secondary to maternal loss of the <I>Oxt</I> or <I>Oxtr</I> gene. In our minimal stress conditions, pup-directed behaviors in TKO and QKO mothers and fathers, virgin females and males were essentially indistinguishable from those of their littermates with other genotypes. However, <I>Oxtr</I> KO virgin females did show decreased pup retrieval in the pup-exposure assay performed right after restraint stress. This stress vulnerability in the <I>Oxtr</I> KO was abolished by the additional <I>Avpr1b</I> KO. The general stress sensitivity, as measured by plasma cortisol elevation after restraint stress or by the behavioral performance in the open field (OF) and elevated plus maze (EPM), were not altered in the <I>Oxtr</I> KO but were reduced in the <I>Avpr1b</I> KO females, indicating that the balance of neurohypophysial hormones affects the outcome of pup-directed behaviors.</p>

                Background: Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a form of autonomic dysregulation. There is increasing evidence that the etiology may be immune-mediated in a subgroup of patients. Patients with POTS often experience an exacerbation of their symptoms associated with (viral) infections and often fear the same symptom aggravation after vaccination. In this report we describe the tolerability of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines against coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) and the consequences of a COVID-19 infection on POTS symptoms in our cohort of patients with neuropathic POTS. Methods: We conducted a standardized, checklist-based interview with 23 patients and recorded the acute side effects of mRNA vaccination, acute symptoms of COVID-19 infection as well as the effects of vaccination and COVID-19 infection on POTS symptoms. Results: Of all included patients, 20 patients received two mRNA vaccines without having had a previous COVID-19 infection, and five patients in total had suffered a COVID-19 infection. Of these, three had COVID-19 without and two after being vaccinated. No increased frequency of side effects after both doses of mRNA vaccines was observed. Six patients reported a mild and short-term aggravation of their POTS symptoms beyond the duration of acute vaccine side effects. All five patients who suffered a COVID-19 infection subsequently reported a pronounced and persistent exacerbation of POTS symptoms. Conclusions: Our observations suggest that mRNA vaccines are not associated with a higher frequency of acute side effects in patients with POTS. Symptom exacerbation as a consequence of mRNA vaccination seems to be less frequent and of shorter duration compared to patients who suffered a COVID-19 infection.

                Background: High anthropometric indexes before sleeve gastrectomy (SG) are associated with an increased risk of erosive esophagitis (EE) in bariatric surgery candidates. Reasons that explain how these indexes influence the development of esophageal pathology after surgery remains unclear. Objectives: To assess the association between the body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and body fat percentage (BFP) with the development of EE in adults with obesity three months after SG. Setting: Clínica Avendaño, Lima, Peru. Methods: Retrospective cohort using a database including adults with obesity who underwent SG during 2017-2020. All the patients included had an endoscopy before and after the surgery. Sociodemographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics were compared according to BMI, WC and BFP, as well as by the development of de novo esophagitis. The association was evaluated by crude and adjusted generalized linear models with the log-Poisson family. Results: From a total of 106 patients, 23 (21.7%) developed EE. We did not find significant differences in sociodemographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics between patients with de novo EE compared to those who did not develop EE. After adjustment, BMI (aRR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.18-1.40), BFP (aRR = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.15-1.19) and WC (aRR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.69-1.16) were not associated with the development of EE three months post SG. Conclusions: We found no association between preoperative anthropometric indexes and the development of de novo EE; therefore, morbid obesity should not be a criterion to exclude the patients to undergo SG as primary surgery because of the risk of developing EE.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">RecPD: A Recombination-aware measure of phylogenetic diversity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Cedoljub Bundalovic-Torma, Darrell Desveaux, David S. Guttman</p>

A critical step in studying biological features (e.g., genetic variants, gene families, metabolic capabilities, or taxa) is assessing their diversity and distribution among a sample of individuals. Accurate assessments of these patterns are essential for linking features to traits or outcomes of interest and understanding their functional impact. Consequently, it is of crucial importance that the measures employed for quantifying feature diversity can perform robustly under any evolutionary scenario. However, the standard measures used for quantifying and comparing the distribution of features, such as prevalence, phylogenetic diversity, and related approaches, either do not take into consideration evolutionary history, or assume strictly vertical patterns of inheritance. Consequently, these approaches cannot accurately assess diversity for features that have undergone recombination or horizontal transfer. To address this issue, we have devised RecPD, a novel recombination-aware phylogenetic-diversity statistic for measuring the distribution and diversity of features under all evolutionary scenarios. RecPD utilizes ancestral-state reconstruction to map the presence / absence of features onto ancestral nodes in a species tree, and then identifies potential recombination events in the evolutionary history of the feature. We also derive several related measures from RecPD that can be used to assess and quantify evolutionary dynamics and correlation of feature evolutionary histories. We used simulation studies to show that RecPD reliably reconstructs feature evolutionary histories under diverse recombination and loss scenarios. We then applied RecPD in two diverse real-world scenarios including a preliminary study type III effector protein families secreted by the plant pathogenic bacterium <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> and growth phenotypes of the <i>Pseudomonas</i> genus and demonstrate that prevalence is an inadequate measure that obscures the potential impact of recombination. We believe RecPD will have broad utility for revealing and quantifying complex evolutionary processes for features at any biological level.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Retinal optic flow during natural locomotion</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jonathan Samir Matthis, Karl S. Muller, Kathryn L. Bonnen, Mary M. Hayhoe</p>

We examine the structure of the visual motion projected on the retina during natural locomotion in real world environments. Bipedal gait generates a complex, rhythmic pattern of head translation and rotation in space, so without gaze stabilization mechanisms such as the vestibular-ocular-reflex (VOR) a walker’s visually specified heading would vary dramatically throughout the gait cycle. The act of fixation on stable points in the environment nulls image motion at the fovea, resulting in stable patterns of outflow on the retinae centered on the point of fixation. These outflowing patterns retain a higher order structure that is informative about the stabilized trajectory of the eye through space. We measure this structure by applying the curl and divergence operations on the retinal flow velocity vector fields and found features that may be valuable for the control of locomotion. In particular, the sign and magnitude of foveal curl in retinal flow specifies the body’s trajectory relative to the gaze point, while the point of maximum divergence in the retinal flow field specifies the walker’s instantaneous overground velocity/momentum vector in retinotopic coordinates. Assuming that walkers can determine the body position relative to gaze direction, these time-varying retinotopic cues for the body’s momentum could provide a visual control signal for locomotion over complex terrain. In contrast, the temporal variation of the eye-movement-free, head-centered flow fields is large enough to be problematic for use in steering towards a goal. Consideration of optic flow in the context of real-world locomotion therefore suggests a re-evaluation of the role of optic flow in the control of action during natural behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Allele imputation for the killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor KIR3DL1/S1</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Genelle F. Harrison, Laura Ann Leaton, Erica A. Harrison, Katherine M. Kichula, Marte K. Viken, Jonathan Shortt, Christopher R. Gignoux, Benedicte A. Lie, Damjan Vukcevic, Stephen Leslie, Paul J. Norman</p>

Highly polymorphic interaction of KIR3DL1 and KIR3DS1 with HLA class I ligands modulates the effector functions of natural killer (NK) cells and some T cells. This genetically determined diversity affects severity of infections, immune-mediated diseases, and some cancers, and impacts the course of immunotherapies, including transplantation. KIR3DL1 is an inhibitory receptor, and KIR3DS1 is an activating receptor encoded by the <i>KIR3DL1/S1</i> gene that has more than 200 diverse and divergent alleles. Determination of <i>KIR3DL1/S1</i> genotypes for medical application is hampered by complex sequence and structural variation, requiring targeted approaches to generate and analyze high-resolution allele data. To overcome these obstacles, we developed and optimized a model for imputing <i>KIR3DL1/S1</i> alleles at high-resolution from whole-genome SNP data. We designed the model to represent a substantial component of human genetic diversity. Our Global imputation model is effective at genotyping <i>KIR3DL1/S1</i> alleles with an accuracy ranging from 88% in Africans to 97% in East Asians, with mean specificity of 99% and sensitivity of 95% for alleles >1% frequency. We used the established algorithm of the HIBAG program, in a modification named Pulling Out Natural killer cell Genomics (PONG). Because HIBAG was designed to impute <i>HLA</i> alleles also from whole-genome SNP data, PONG allows combinatorial diversity of <i>KIR3DL1/S1</i> with <i>HLA-A</i> and <i>-B</i> to be analyzed using complementary techniques on a single data source. The use of PONG thus negates the need for targeted sequencing data in very large-scale association studies where such methods might not be tractable.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Insights into the role of noradrenaline in effortful decisions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kristin Kaduk, Fadila Hadj-Bouziane</p>

To maintain homeostasis, our brain tracks the effort exerted during decision-making. A new study in PLOS Biology shows that the activity of noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) reflects the effort exerted to face cognitive or physical challenges.
Every decision we make involves costs and benefits that we implicitly weigh. As our energetic resources are finite, the general consensus is that we naturally tend to minimize the costs while maximizing benefits (reward). Reward value is discounted by the effort invested and/or its perception, and so there is a natural tendency for animals and humans alike to avoid pursuing rewarding options that require effort.

Because our energetic resources are limited, our brain needs to monitor effort to optimise behavioral choices and avoid fatigue. This Primer explores the implications of a recent PLOS Biology study showing that the activity of noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus reflects the amount of effort exerted to face costly cognitive or physical challenges, a signal that might help promote behavioral adaptation depending on context and our needs.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The noncoding RNA CcnA modulates the master cell cycle regulators CtrA and GcrA in Caulobacter crescentus</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Wanassa Beroual, Karine Prévost, David Lalaouna, Nadia Ben Zaina, Odile Valette, Yann Denis, Meriem Djendli, Gaël Brasseur, Matteo Brilli, Marta Robledo Garrido, Jose-Ignacio Jimenez-Zurdo, Eric Massé, Emanuele G. Biondi</p>

Bacteria are powerful models for understanding how cells divide and accomplish global regulatory programs. In <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i>, a cascade of essential master regulators supervises the correct and sequential activation of DNA replication, cell division, and development of different cell types. Among them, the response regulator CtrA plays a crucial role coordinating all those functions. Here, for the first time, we describe the role of a novel factor named CcnA (cell cycle noncoding RNA A), a cell cycle–regulated noncoding RNA (ncRNA) located at the origin of replication, presumably activated by CtrA, and responsible for the accumulation of CtrA itself. In addition, CcnA may be also involved in the inhibition of translation of the S-phase regulator, GcrA, by interacting with its 5′ untranslated region (5′ UTR). Performing in vitro experiments and mutagenesis, we propose a mechanism of action of CcnA based on liberation (<i>ctrA</i>) or sequestration (<i>gcrA</i>) of their ribosome-binding site (RBS). Finally, its role may be conserved in other alphaproteobacterial species, such as <i>Sinorhizobium meliloti</i>, representing indeed a potentially conserved process modulating cell cycle in <i>Caulobacterales</i> and <i>Rhizobiales</i>.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">LRRK2 dynamics analysis identifies allosteric control of the crosstalk between its catalytic domains</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jui-Hung Weng, Phillip C. Aoto, Robin Lorenz, Jian Wu, Sven H. Schmidt, Jascha T. Manschwetus, Pallavi Kaila-Sharma, Steve Silletti, Sebastian Mathea, Deep Chatterjee, Stefan Knapp, Friedrich W. Herberg, Susan S. Taylor</p>

The 2 major molecular switches in biology, kinases and GTPases, are both contained in the Parkinson disease–related leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2). Using hydrogen–deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we generated a comprehensive dynamic allosteric portrait of the C-terminal domains of LRRK2 (LRRK2<sub>RCKW</sub>). We identified 2 helices that shield the kinase domain and regulate LRRK2 conformation and function. One helix in COR-B (COR-B Helix) tethers the COR-B domain to the αC helix of the kinase domain and faces its activation loop, while the C-terminal helix (Ct-Helix) extends from the WD40 domain and interacts with both kinase lobes. The Ct-Helix and the N-terminus of the COR-B Helix create a “cap” that regulates the N-lobe of the kinase domain. Our analyses reveal allosteric sites for pharmacological intervention and confirm the kinase domain as the central hub for conformational control.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">A DNA replication-independent function of pre-replication complex genes during cell invasion in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Evelyn Lattmann, Ting Deng, Michael Walser, Patrizia Widmer, Charlotte Rexha-Lambert, Vibhu Prasad, Ossia Eichhoff, Michael Daube, Reinhard Dummer, Mitchell P. Levesque, Alex Hajnal</p>

Cell invasion is an initiating event during tumor cell metastasis and an essential process during development. A screen of <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i> orthologs of genes overexpressed in invasive human melanoma cells has identified several components of the conserved DNA pre-replication complex (pre-RC) as positive regulators of anchor cell (AC) invasion. The pre-RC genes function cell-autonomously in the G1-arrested AC to promote invasion, independently of their role in licensing DNA replication origins in proliferating cells. While the helicase activity of the pre-RC is necessary for AC invasion, the downstream acting DNA replication initiation factors are not required. The pre-RC promotes the invasive fate by regulating the expression of extracellular matrix genes and components of the PI3K signaling pathway. Increasing PI3K pathway activity partially suppressed the AC invasion defects caused by pre-RC depletion, suggesting that the PI3K pathway is one critical pre-RC target. We propose that the pre-RC, or a part of it, acts in the postmitotic AC as a transcriptional regulator that facilitates the switch to an invasive phenotype.

                Background: The COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia has been ongoing for a year as at time of writing, since March 2020. Vaccination interventions are public health efforts that are arguably the most effective in the current pandemic situation, in addition to routine health protocols. Until now, there have been few reports of the effectiveness of vaccination and antibody titers formed after vaccination is carried out. This study aims to find out the difference in antibody titers after vaccination in confirmed COVID-19 cases. Methods: This observational study investigated the difference in SARS-Cov-2 quantitative antibody titers between two cohorts: unvaccinated COVID patients who were confirmed -with COVID-19 and individuals undergoing vaccination at the hospital Prof. dr. R. D. Kandou Manado. Inclusion and exclusion criteria, statistical analysis, and research ethics were applied in the study. Results: Antibody titers in survivor groups were relatively lower at 56 days and 84 days after COVID-19 diagnosis, while the antibody titer in the elderly group undergoing vaccination relatively increased at 56 days and 84 days after the first vaccination. There was a significant difference in antibody titers between a group of survivors and those who underwent vaccination on the first (28 days) and third (84 days). Conclusions: From this study, it was found that in the naturally COVID-19-infected group, antibody titers were still found for 84 days after COVID-19 diagnosis. In the group undergoing vaccination, it was found that antibody titers increased significantly at 56 days after vaccination.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">From mechanisms to functions: The role of theta and gamma coherence in the intrahippocampal circuits</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Brain rhythms are essential for information processing in neuronal networks. Oscillations recorded in different brain regions can be synchronized and have a constant phase difference, that is, they can be coherent. Coherence between local field potential (LFP) signals from different brain regions may be correlated with the performance of cognitive tasks, indicating that these regions of the brain are jointly involved in the information processing. Why does coherence occur and how is it related to the information transfer between different regions of the hippocampal formation? In this article, we discuss possible mechanisms of theta and gamma coherence and its role in the hippocampus-dependent attention and memory processes, since theta and gamma rhythms are most pronounced in these processes. We review in vivo studies of interactions between different regions of the hippocampal formation in theta and gamma frequency bands. The key propositions of the review are as follows: (1) coherence emerges from synchronous postsynaptic currents in principal neurons as a result of synchronization of neuronal spike activity; (2) the synchronization of neuronal spike patterns in two regions of the hippocampal formation can be realized through induction or resonance; (3) coherence at a specific time point reflects the transfer of information between the regions of the hippocampal formation; (4) the physiological roles of theta and gamma coherence are different due to their different functions and mechanisms of generation. All hippocampal neurons are involved in theta activity, and theta coherence arranges the firing order of principal neurons throughout the hippocampal formation. In contrast, gamma coherence reflects the coupling of active neuronal ensembles. Overall, the coherence of LFPs between different areas of the brain is an important physiological process based on the synchronized neuronal firing, and it is essential for cooperative information processing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Nucleoporin-93 reveals a common feature of aggressive breast cancers: robust nucleocytoplasmic transport of transcription factors</a></h4>

              
                Nataraj et al. develop multi-omics pipelines, which uncover critical roles of nucleoporin-93 (NUP93), a component of the nuclear pore complex, in metastasis of breast cancer. NUP93 overexpression in aggressive tumors unblocks nucleocytoplasmic transport of several transcription mediators, including β-catenin. Accordingly, specific inhibitors of NUP93-assisted transport can reduce metastasis.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Gain control by sparse, ultra-slow glycinergic synapses</a></h4>

              
                The role of glycine inhibition in controlling starburst function has often been overlooked, owing to the weak anatomical representation of glycinergic synapses in the circuit. Jain et al. demonstrate that the sparse population of glycinergic synapses uses specialized Glyα4 receptors to mediate a slow inhibition, which powerfully controls starburst output gain and direction selectivity.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Parallel processing in active dendrites during periods of intense spiking activity</a></h4>

              
                It has been difficult to experimentally test whether single neurons can process information in parallel across their active dendritic arbors. Murphy-Baum and Awatramani demonstrate that some retinal ganglion cells can accurately compute the direction of moving objects simultaneously within dendritic sub-fields despite the spread of excitatory activity across their dendrites.

                Morabito et al. show that vesicular zinc selectively inhibits synaptic NMDARs in an activity-dependent manner in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons. Removing zinc modulation of NMDARs alters dendritic computations as well as LTP induction. Modeling suggests that such a mechanism can maintain dendritic integration constant across different regimes of neuronal activity.

                Cui et al. demonstrate that CaMKIIβ-associated long non-coding RNA Carip affects the phosphorylation of AMPA receptor and NMDA receptor subunits. Carip deficiency significantly attenuates the excitatory synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation of the CA3-CA1 synapses in the mouse hippocampus, leading to spatial learning and memory deficits.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Using aquatic animals as partners to increase yield and maintain soil nitrogen in the paddy ecosystems</a></h4>

              
                Whether species coculture can overcome the shortcomings of crop monoculture requires additional study. Here, we show how aquatic animals (i.e. carp, crabs, and softshell turtles) benefit paddy ecosystems when cocultured with rice. Three separate field experiments and three separate mesocosm experiments were conducted. Each experiment included a rice monoculture (RM) treatment and a rice-aquatic animal (RA) coculture treatment; RA included feed addition for aquatic animals. In the field experiments, rice yield was higher with RA than with RM, and RA also produced aquatic animal yields that averaged 0.52–2.57 t ha<sup>-1</sup>. Compared to their corresponding RMs, the three RAs had significantly higher apparent nitrogen (N)-use efficiency and lower weed infestation, while soil N contents were stable over time. Dietary reconstruction analysis based on <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>15</sup>N showed that 16.0–50.2% of aquatic animal foods were from naturally occurring organisms in the rice fields. Stable-isotope-labeling (<sup>13</sup>C) in the field experiments indicated that the organic matter decomposition rate was greater with RA than with RM. Isotope <sup>15</sup>N labeling in the mesocosm experiments indicated that rice used 13.0–35.1% of the aquatic animal feed-N. All these results suggest that rice-aquatic animal coculture increases food production, increases N-use efficiency, and maintains soil N content by reducing weeds and promoting decomposition and complementary N use. Our study supports the view that adding species to monocultures may enhance agroecosystem functions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">An estimate of the deepest branches of the tree of life from ancient vertically-evolving genes</a></h4>

              
                Core gene phylogenies provide a window into early evolution, but different gene sets and analytical methods have yielded substantially different views of the tree of life. Trees inferred from a small set of universal core genes have typically supported a long branch separating the archaeal and bacterial domains. By contrast, recent analyses of a broader set of non-ribosomal genes have suggested that Archaea may be less divergent from Bacteria, and that estimates of inter-domain distance are inflated due to accelerated evolution of ribosomal proteins along the inter-domain branch. Resolving this debate is key to determining the diversity of the archaeal and bacterial domains, the shape of the tree of life, and our understanding of the early course of cellular evolution. Here, we investigate the evolutionary history of the marker genes key to the debate. We show that estimates of a reduced Archaea-Bacteria (AB) branch length result from inter-domain gene transfers and hidden paralogy in the expanded marker gene set. By contrast, analysis of a broad range of manually curated marker gene datasets from an evenly sampled set of 700 Archaea and Bacteria reveal that current methods likely underestimate the AB branch length due to substitutional saturation and poor model fit; that the best-performing phylogenetic markers tend to support longer inter-domain branch lengths; and that the AB branch lengths of ribosomal and non-ribosomal marker genes are statistically indistinguishable. Furthermore, our phylogeny inferred from the 27 highest-ranked marker genes recovers a clade of DPANN at the base of the Archaea, and places CPR within Bacteria as the sister group to the Chloroflexota.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Low doses of the organic insecticide spinosad trigger lysosomal defects, elevated ROS, lipid dysregulation, and neurodegeneration in flies</a></h4>

              
                Large-scale insecticide application is a primary weapon in the control of insect pests in agriculture. However, a growing body of evidence indicates that it is contributing to the global decline in population sizes of many beneficial insect species. Spinosad emerged as an organic alternative to synthetic insecticides and is considered less harmful to beneficial insects, yet its mode of action remains unclear. Using <i>Drosophila</i>, we show that low doses of spinosad antagonize its neuronal target, the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha 6 (nAChRα6), reducing the cholinergic response. We show that the nAChRα6 receptors are transported to lysosomes that become enlarged and increase in number upon low doses of spinosad treatment. Lysosomal dysfunction is associated with mitochondrial stress and elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the central nervous system where nAChRα6 is broadly expressed. ROS disturb lipid storage in metabolic tissues in an nAChRα6-dependent manner. Spinosad toxicity is ameliorated with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine amide. Chronic exposure of adult virgin females to low doses of spinosad leads to mitochondrial defects, severe neurodegeneration, and blindness. These deleterious effects of low-dose exposures warrant rigorous investigation of its impacts on beneficial insects.

                Despite mass public health efforts, the SARS-CoV2 pandemic continues as of late-2021 with resurgent case numbers in many parts of the world. The emergence of SARS-CoV2 variants of concern (VoC) and evidence that existing vaccines that were designed to protect from the original strains of SARS-CoV-2 may have reduced potency for protection from infection against these VoC is driving continued development of second generation vaccines that can protect against multiple VoC. In this report, we evaluated an alphavirus-based replicating RNA vaccine expressing Spike proteins from the original SARS-CoV-2 Alpha strain and recent VoCs delivered <i>in vivo</i> via a lipid inorganic nanoparticle. Vaccination of both mice and Syrian Golden hamsters showed that vaccination induced potent neutralizing titers against each homologous VoC but reduced neutralization against heterologous challenges. Vaccinated hamsters challenged with homologous SARS-CoV2 variants exhibited complete protection from infection. In addition, vaccinated hamsters challenged with heterologous SARS-CoV-2 variants exhibited significantly reduced shedding of infectious virus. Our data demonstrate that this vaccine platform can be updated to target emergent VoCs, elicits significant protective immunity against SARS-CoV2 variants and supports continued development of this platform.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">In vivo intraoral waterflow quantification reveals hidden mechanisms of suction feeding in fish</a></h4>

              
                Virtually all fishes rely on flows of water to transport food to the back of their pharynx. While external flows that draw food into the mouth are well described, how intra-oral water flows manage to deposit food at the esophagus entrance remains unknown. In theory, the posteriorly moving water must, at some point, curve laterally and/or ventrally to exit through the gill slits. Such flows would eventually carry food away from the esophagus instead of toward it. This apparent paradox calls for a filtration mechanism to deviate food from the suction-feeding streamlines. To study this gap in our fundamental understanding of how fishes feed, we developed and applied a new technique to quantify three-dimensional patterns of intra-oral water flows <i>in vivo</i>. We combined stereoscopic high-speed x-ray videos to quantify skeletal motion (XROMM) with 3D x-ray particle tracking (XPT) of neutrally buoyant spheres of 1.4 mm in diameter. We show, for carp (<i>Cyprinus carpio</i>) and tilapia (<i>Oreochromis niloticus</i>), that water tracers displayed higher curvatures than food tracers, indicating an inertia-driven filtration. In addition, tilapia also exhibited a 'central jet' flow pattern, which aids in quickly carrying food to the pharyngeal jaw region. When the food was trapped at the branchial basket, it was resuspended and carried more centrally by periodical bidirectional waterflows, synchronized with head-bone motions. By providing a complete picture of the suction-feeding process and revealing fundamental differences in food transport mechanisms among species, this novel technique opens a new area of investigation to fully understand how most aquatic vertebrates feed.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Diversification of multipotential postmitotic mouse retinal ganglion cell precursors into discrete types</a></h4>

              
                The genesis of broad neuronal classes from multipotential neural progenitor cells has been extensively studied, but less is known about the diversification of a single neuronal class into multiple types. We used single-cell RNA-seq to study how newly-born (postmitotic) mouse retinal ganglion cell (RGC) precursors diversify into ~45 discrete types. Computational analysis provides evidence that RGC transcriptomic type identity is not specified at mitotic exit, but acquired by gradual, asynchronous restriction of postmitotic multipotential precursors. Some types are not identifiable until a week after they are generated. Immature RGCs may be specified to project ipsilaterally or contralaterally to the rest of the brain before their type identity emerges. Optimal transport inference identifies groups of RGC precursors with largely non-overlapping fates, distinguished by selectively expressed transcription factors that could act as fate determinants. Our study provides a framework for investigating the molecular diversification of discrete types within a neuronal class.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A survey of optimal strategy for signature-based drug repositioning and an application to liver cancer</a></h4>

              
                Pharmacologic perturbation projects, such as Connectivity Map (CMap) and Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS), have produced many perturbed expression data, providing enormous opportunities for computational therapeutic discovery. However, there is no consensus on which methodologies and parameters are the most optimal to conduct such analysis. Aiming to fill this gap, new benchmarking standards were developed to quantitatively evaluate drug retrieval performance. Investigations of potential factors influencing drug retrieval were conducted based on these standards. As a result, we determined an optimal approach for LINCS data-based therapeutic discovery. With this approach, homoharringtonine (HHT) was identified to be a candidate agent with potential therapeutic and preventive effects on liver cancer. The antitumor and antifibrotic activity of HHT was validated experimentally using subcutaneous xenograft tumor model and carbon tetrachloride (CCL<sub>4</sub>)-induced liver fibrosis model, demonstrating the reliability of the prediction results. In summary, our findings will not only impact the future applications of LINCS data but also offer new opportunities for therapeutic intervention of liver cancer.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The oxygen sensor Prolyl hydroxylase domain 2 regulates the in vivo suppressive capacity of regulatory T cells</a></h4>

              
                The oxygen sensor PHD2 (prolyl hydroxylase domain 2) plays an important role in cell hypoxia adaptation by regulating the stability of HIF proteins (HIF1α and HIF2α) in numerous cell types including T lymphocytes. The role of oxygen sensor on immune cells, in particular on regulatory T cell (Treg) function, has not been fully elucidated. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the role of PHD2 in the regulation of Treg phenotype and function. We demonstrate herein that selective ablation of PHD2 expression in Treg (PHD2<sup>Δ</sup><sup>Treg</sup> mice) leads to a spontaneous systemic inflammatory syndrome, as evidenced by weight loss, development of a rectal prolapse, splenomegaly, shortening of the colon and elevated expression of IFN-γ in the mesenteric lymph nodes, intestine and spleen. PHD2 deficiency in Tregs led to an increased number of activated CD4 conventional T cells expressing a Th1-like effector phenotype. Concomitantly, the expression of innate-type cytokines such as <i>Il1b</i>, <i>Il12a</i>, <i>Il12b</i> and <i>T</i><i>nfa</i> was found to be elevated in peripheral (gut) tissues and spleen. PHD2<sup>Δ</sup><sup>Treg</sup> mice also displayed an enhanced sensitivity to DSS-induced colitis and to toxoplasmosis, suggesting that PHD2-deficient Tregs did not efficiently control inflammatory response in vivo, in particular those characterized by IFN-γ production. Further analysis revealed that Treg dysregulation was largely prevented in PHD2-HIF2α (PHD2-HIF2α<sup>Δ</sup><sup>Treg</sup> mice), but not in PHD2-HIF1α (PHD2-HIF1α<sup>Δ</sup><sup>Treg</sup> mice) double KOs, suggesting an important and possibly selective role of the PHD2-HIF2α axis in the control of Treg function. Finally, the transcriptomic analysis of PHD2-deficient Tregs identified the STAT1 pathway as a target of the PHD2-HIF2α axis in regulatory T cell phenotype and in vivo function.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Frequency-and spike-timing-dependent mitochondrial Ca2+ signaling regulates the metabolic rate and synaptic efficacy in cortical neurons</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondrial activity is crucial for the plasticity of central synapses, but how the firing pattern of pre- and postsynaptic neurons affects the mitochondria remains elusive. We recorded changes in the fluorescence of cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators in cell bodies, axons, and dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons in mouse brain slices while evoking pre- and postsynaptic spikes. Postsynaptic spike firing elicited fast mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses that were about threefold larger in the somas and apical dendrites than in basal dendrites and axons. The amplitude of these responses and metabolic activity were extremely sensitive to the firing frequency. Furthermore, while an EPSP alone caused no detectable Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation in the dendritic mitochondria, the coincidence of EPSP with a backpropagating spike produced prominent, highly localized mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> hotspots. Our results indicate that mitochondria decode the spike firing frequency and the Hebbian temporal coincidences into the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, which are further translated into the metabolic output and most probably lead to long-term changes in synaptic efficacy.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A dentate gyrus- CA3 inhibitory circuit promotes evolution of hippocampal-cortical ensembles during memory consolidation</a></h4>

              
                Memories encoded in the dentate gyrus (DG) - CA3 circuit of the hippocampus are routed from CA1 to anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) for consolidation. Although CA1 parvalbumin inhibitory neurons (PV INs) orchestrate hippocampal-cortical communication, we know less about CA3 PV INs or DG - CA3 principal neuron - IN circuit mechanisms that contribute to evolution of hippocampal-cortical ensembles during memory consolidation. Using viral genetics to selectively mimic and boost an endogenous learning-dependent circuit mechanism, DG cell recruitment of CA3 PV INs and feed-forward inhibition (FFI) in CA3, in combination with longitudinal <i>in vivo</i> calcium imaging, we demonstrate that FFI facilitates formation and maintenance of context-associated neuronal ensembles in CA1. Increasing FFI in DG - CA3 promoted context specificity of neuronal ensembles in ACC over time and enhanced long-term contextual fear memory. <i>In vivo</i> LFP recordings in mice with increased FFI in DG - CA3 identified enhanced CA1 sharp-wave ripple - ACC spindle coupling as a potential network mechanism facilitating memory consolidation. Our findings illuminate how FFI in DG - CA3 dictates evolution of ensemble properties in CA1 and ACC during memory consolidation and suggest a teacher-like function for hippocampal CA1 in stabilization and re-organization of cortical representations.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">MicroRNA 3′-compensatory pairing occurs through two binding modes, with affinity shaped by nucleotide identity and position</a></h4>

              
                MicroRNAs (miRNAs), in association with Argonaute (AGO) proteins, direct repression by pairing to sites within mRNAs. Compared to pairing preferences of the miRNA seed region (nucleotides 2-8), preferences of the miRNA 3′ region are poorly understood, due to the sparsity of measured affinities for the many pairing possibilities. We used RNA bind-n-seq with purified AGO2-miRNA complexes to measure relative affinities of &gt;1,000 3′-pairing architectures for each miRNA. In some cases, optimal 3′ pairing increased affinity by &gt;500-fold. Some miRNAs had two high-affinity 3′-pairing modes-one of which included additional nucleotides bridging seed and 3′ pairing to enable high-affinity pairing to miRNA nucleotide 11. The affinity of binding and the position of optimal pairing both tracked with the occurrence of G or oligo(G/C) nucleotides within the miRNA. These and other results advance understanding of miRNA targeting, providing insight into how optimal 3′ pairing is determined for each miRNA.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Host casein kinase 1-mediated phosphorylation modulates phase separation of a rhabdovirus phosphoprotein and virus infection</a></h4>

              
                Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) plays important roles in forming cellular membraneless organelles. However, how host factors regulate LLPS of viral proteins during negative-sense RNA (NSR) virus infection is largely unknown. Here, we used <i>Barley yellow striate mosaic virus</i> (BYSMV) as a model to demonstrate regulation of host casein kinase 1 in phase separation and infection of NSR viruses. We first found that the BYSMV phosphoprotein (P) formed spherical granules with liquid properties and recruited viral nucleotide (N) and polymerase (L) proteins <i>in vivo</i>. Moreover, the P-formed granules were tethered to the ER/actin network for trafficking and fusion. BYSMV P alone formed droplets and incorporated the N protein and the 5′ trailer of genomic RNA <i>in vitro</i>. Interestingly, phase separation of BYSMV P was inhibited by host casein kinase 1 (CK1)-dependent phosphorylation of an intrinsically disordered P protein region. Genetic assays demonstrated that the unphosphorylated mutant of BYSMV P exhibited condensed phase, which promoted viroplasm formation and virus replication. Whereas, the phosphorylation-mimic mutant existed in diffuse phase state for virus transcription. Collectively, our results demonstrate that host CK1 modulates phase separation of the viral P protein and virus infection.

The conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) initiates developmental and cell-type-specific transcriptional programs through mechanisms that include changes in the chromatin structure. Here, we show that the presence of 5hmC in the transcribed gene promotes the annealing of the nascent RNA to the template DNA strand, leading to the formation of an R-loop. Depletion of TET enzymes reduced global R-loops in absence of gene expression changes, whereas CRISPR-mediated tethering of TET to an active gene promoted the formation of R-loops. The genome-wide distribution of 5hmC and R-loops show a positive correlation in mouse and human stem cells and overlap in half of all active genes. Moreover, R-loop resolution leads to differential expression of a subset of genes that are involved in crucial events during stem cell proliferation. Altogether, our data reveal that epigenetic reprogramming via TET activity promotes co-transcriptional R-loop formation, disclosing new mechanisms of gene expression regulation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Host ecology regulates interspecies recombination in bacteria of the genus Campylobacter</a></h4>

              
                Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) can allow traits that have evolved in one bacterial species to transfer to another. This has potential to rapidly promote new adaptive trajectories such as zoonotic transfer or antimicrobial resistance. However, for this to occur requires gaps to align in barriers to recombination within a given time frame. Chief among these barriers is the physical separation of species with distinct ecologies in separate niches. Within the genus <i>Campylobacter </i>there are species with divergent ecologies, from rarely isolated single host specialists to multi-host generalist species that are among the most common global causes of human bacterial gastroenteritis. Here, by characterising these contrasting ecologies, we can quantify HGT among sympatric and allopatric species in natural populations. Analysing recipient and donor population ancestry among genomes from 30 <i>Campylobacter </i>species we show that cohabitation in the same host can lead to a 6-fold increase in HGT between species. This accounts for up to 30% of all SNPs within a given species and identifies highly recombinogenic genes with functions including host adaptation and antimicrobial resistance. As described in some animal and plant species, ecological factors are a major evolutionary force for speciation in bacteria and changes to the host landscape can promote partial convergence of distinct species through HGT.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">TREM2 regulates purinergic receptor-mediated calcium signaling and motility in human iPSC-derived microglia</a></h4>

              
                The membrane protein TREM2 (Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells 2) regulates key microglial functions including phagocytosis and chemotaxis. Loss-of-function variants of TREM2 are associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Because abnormalities in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling have been observed in several AD models, we investigated TREM2 regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia (iPSC-microglia) with genetic deletion of TREM2. We found that iPSC-microglia lacking TREM2 (TREM2 KO) show exaggerated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in response to purinergic agonists, such as ADP, that shape microglial injury responses. This ADP hypersensitivity, driven by increased expression of P2Y<sub>12</sub> and P2Y<sub>13</sub> receptors, results in greater release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores, which triggers sustained Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through Orai channels and alters cell motility in TREM2 KO microglia. Using iPSC-microglia expressing the genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> probe, Salsa6f, we found that cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> tunes motility to a greater extent in TREM2 KO microglia. Despite showing greater overall displacement, TREM2 KO microglia exhibit reduced directional chemotaxis along ADP gradients. Accordingly, the chemotactic defect in TREM2 KO microglia was rescued by reducing cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> using a P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor antagonist. Our results show that loss of TREM2 confers a defect in microglial Ca<sup>2+</sup> response to purinergic signals, suggesting a window of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling for optimal microglial motility.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modeling the tonotopic map using a two-dimensional array of neural oscillators</a></h4>

              
                We present a model of a tonotopic map known as the Oscillatory Tonotopic Self-Organizing Map (OTSOM). It is a 2-dimensional, self-organizing array of Hopf oscillators, capable of performing a Fourier-like decomposition of the input signal. While the rows in the map encode the input phase, the columns encode frequency. Although Hopf oscillators exhibit resonance to a sinusoidal signal when there is a frequency match, there is no obvious way to also achieve phase tuning. We propose a simple method by which a pair of Hopf oscillators, unilaterally coupled through a coupling scheme termed as modified power coupling, can exhibit tuning to the phase offset of sinusoidal forcing input. The training of OTSOM is performed in 2 stages: while the frequency tuning is adapted in stage 1, phase tuning is adapted in stage 2. Earlier tonotopic map models have modeled frequency as an abstract parameter unconnected to any oscillation. By contrast, in OTSOM, frequency tuning emerges as a natural outcome of an underlying resonant process. The OTSOM model can be regarded as an approximation of the tonotopic map found in the primary auditory cortices of mammals, particularly exemplified in the studies of echolocating bats.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Activity of the manganese efflux transporter SLC30A10 in dopaminergic but not GABAergic neurons protects against neurotoxicity</a></h4>

              
                Metals such as copper, iron, and manganese (Mn) are essential for life, but induce neurotoxicity at elevated levels. Yet, the neuronal mechanisms of metal-induced neurological disease are largely unclear. A primary limitation has been an inability to selectively alter metal levels in specific neurons, so that the role of the targeted neurons in disease biology can be isolated. Here, we show that neuron-specific depletion of metal efflux transporters provides the feasibility to overcome this limitation by focusing on Mn, which accumulates in the basal ganglia and induces motor disease, and the Mn-specific efflux transporter SLC30A10. Pan-neuronal/glial Slc30a10 knockout mice exhibited increased basal ganglia Mn levels and hypolocomotor deficits in early-life (pre-adulthood), which were exacerbated by Mn exposure. The locomotor deficits of the pan-neuronal/glial strain was associated with a reduction in evoked striatal dopamine release without dopaminergic (DAergic) neurodegeneration or changes in striatal tissue dopamine levels. Furthermore, DAergic-specific, but not GABAergic-specific, Slc30a10 knockout mice recapitulated the hypolocomotor phenotype of the pan-neuronal/glial knockouts in early-life although Mn levels were elevated in the targeted basal ganglia regions of both the neuron-specific strains. Put together, our results imply that (1) activity of SLC30A10 in DAergic neurons is necessary to protect against early-life Mn neurotoxicity; (2) increasing Mn levels in DAergic neurons is sufficient to induce early-life motor disease, suggesting that Mn targets DAergic neurons in the early-life period to induce motor deficits; and (3) neuron-specific knockout of metal efflux transporters may be a widely applicable strategy to elucidate mechanisms of metal-induced neurotoxicity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Prepronociceptin-expressing neurons in the extended amygdala signal darting away from an aversive odor</a></h4>

              
                Dysregulation in the neural circuitry that encodes physiological arousal responses is thought to contribute to the manifestation of the maladaptive behaviors observed in neuropsychiatric disorders. We previously found that prepronociceptin-expressing neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (PnocBNST neurons) modulate rapid changes in physiological arousal upon presentation of motivationally salient stimuli (Rodriguez-Romaguera et al., 2020). However, whether PnocBNST neurons are necessary to regulate behavioral actions to motivationally salient stimuli is still unknown. Here, we investigated the role of PnocBNST neurons in encoding behavioral responses to motivationally salient stimuli using in vivo calcium imaging and optogenetic approaches in freely behaving mice. We find that the bulk activity of PnocBNST neurons increases when mice are near an aversive odor in comparison to a rewarding odor. However, optogenetic inhibition of PnocBNST neurons does not affect the amount of time mice spend near an aversive odor. Further analysis revealed that a subgroup of PnocBNST neurons that correlate with proximity to the aversive odor also correlate to darting away from the same aversive odor. Since these two behaviors are opposite to each other and since we previously found PnocBNST neurons correlate with arousal responses, we believe these results may be due in part to the encoding of arousal responses that occur when mice approach and dart away from aversive stimuli.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sonic hedgehog-dependent recruitment of GABAergic interneurons into the developing visual thalamus</a></h4>

              
                Axons of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) play critical roles in the development of inhibitory circuits in visual thalamus. We previously reported that RGC axons signal astrocytes to induce the expression of fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15), a motogen required for GABAergic interneuron migration into visual thalamus. However, how retinal axons induce thalamic astrocytes to generate Fgf15 and influence interneuron migration remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that impairing RGC activity had no impact on interneuron recruitment into mouse visual thalamus. Instead, our data show that retinal-derived sonic hedgehog (SHH) is essential for interneuron recruitment. Specifically, we show that thalamus-projecting RGCs express SHH and thalamic astrocytes generate downstream components of SHH signaling. Deletion of RGC-derived SHH leads to a significant decrease in Fgf15 expression, as well as in the percentage of interneurons recruited into visual thalamus. Thus, our findings identify a morphogen-dependent neuron-astrocyte signaling mechanism essential for the migration of thalamic interneurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Estimation of the firing behaviour of a complete motoneuron pool by combining EMG signal decomposition and realistic motoneuron modelling</a></h4>

              
                Our understanding of the firing behaviour of motoneuron (MN) pools during human voluntary muscle contractions is currently limited to electrophysiological findings from animal experiments extrapolated to humans, mathematical models of MN pools not validated for human data, and experimental results obtained from EMG decomposition. These approaches are limited in accuracy or provide information on only small partitions of the MN population. Here, we propose a method based on the combination of high-density EMG (HDEMG) data and realistic modelling for predicting the behaviour of entire pools of motoneurons in humans. The method builds on a physiologically realistic model of a MN pool which predicts, from the experimental spike trains of a smaller number of individual MNs identified from decomposed HDEMG signals, the unknown recruitment and firing activity of the remaining unidentified MNs in the complete MN pool. The MN pool model is described as a cohort of leaky fire-and-integrate (LIF) models of MNs scaled by a physiologically realistic distribution of MN electrophysiological properties and driven by a spinal synaptic input, both derived from decomposed HDEMG data. The MN spike trains and effective neural drive to muscle, predicted with this method, have been successfully validated experimentally. Representative applications of the method are also presented for the prediction of activity-dependant changes in MN intrinsic properties and in MN-driven neuromuscular modelling. The proposed approach provides a validated tool for neuroscientists, experimentalists, and modelers to infer the firing activity of MNs that cannot be observed experimentally, investigate the neurophysiology of human MN pools, support future experimental investigations, and advance neuromuscular modelling for investigating the neural strategies controlling human voluntary contractions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Age-related differences in GABA: Impact of analysis technique</a></h4>

              
                Previous research using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) has indicated that GABA levels decline in multiple brain regions over the course of healthy aging. However, brain atrophy also occurs during healthy aging, and as a result the tissue composition of MRS voxels (i.e., the percentage of grey matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid in the voxel) may also differ between age groups. Many authors therefore argue for applying a correction to GABA estimates in order to control for differences in tissue composition. Here, we use data from a large healthy aging study to investigate the influence of three tissue correction strategies on age-group differences in GABA. We also evaluate the use of different analysis packages and reference metabolites on group differences. A 3T MEGA-PRESS sequence was used to obtain spectra from seven voxels placed in the visual, auditory, and sensorimotor cortex of 58 young adults (aged 18-29 years) and 85 older adults. We obtained several different estimates of GABA concentrations from the spectra using two analysis software packages (Gannet 3.1 and LCModel), three reference metabolites (water, creatine and N-acetylaspartate) and four tissue correction strategies. Young adults consistently demonstrated significantly higher GABA concentrations in the visual, auditory, and sensorimotor cortex when we used an uncorrected GABA estimate referenced either to water or creatine. When uncorrected GABA was referenced to N-acetylaspartate, age-related differences were observed only in the right ventral visual cortex. Similarly, when any of the four tissue corrections were applied to the data, only age-related differences in the left and right ventral visual cortex voxels remained. Correlations between GABA concentration estimates obtained from different software packages were moderate, as were correlations between uncorrected GABA estimates when different baseline metabolites were used. Correlations between all tissue corrections we explored were extremely high. These results confirm that reports of age-related differences in GABA concentrations are driven, at least in part, by changes in tissue composition.

                Colony stimulating factor (CSF) receptor-1 (CSF-1R)-related leukoencephalopathy (CRL) is an adult-onset, demyelinating neurodegenerative disease caused by autosomal dominant mutations in CSF1R, modeled by the Csf1r+/- mouse. The expression of Csf2, encoding granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) and of Csf3, encoding granulocyte CSF (G-CSF), are elevated in both mouse and human CRL brains. While monoallelic targeting of Csf2 has been shown to attenuate many behavioral and histological deficits of mouse CRL, including cognitive dysfunction and demyelination, the contribution of Csf3 has not been explored. In this manuscript, we investigate the behavioral, electrophysiological and histopathological phenotypes of CRL mice following monoallelic targeting of Csf3. We show that Csf3 heterozygosity normalized the Csf3 levels in Csf1r+/- mouse brains and ameliorated anxiety-like behavior, motor coordination and social interaction deficits, but not their cognitive impairment. Consistent with this, Csf3 heterozygosity attenuated microglial activation in the cerebellum and in the ventral but not in the dorsal hippocampus. Csf3 heterozygosity also failed to prevent demyelination. Csf1r+/- mice exhibited altered synaptic activity in the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) associated with increased deposition of the complement factor C1q on glutamatergic synapses and with increased engulfment of glutamatergic synapses by DCN microglia. These phenotypes were significantly ameliorated by monoallelic deletion of Csf3. Our findings indicate that G-CSF and GM-CSF play non-overlapping roles in mouse CRL development and suggest that G-CSF could be an additional therapeutic target in CRL.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Response dynamics of spiking network models to incoming seizure-like perturbation.</a></h4>

              
                Epilepsies are characterized by electrophysiological crises in the brain, which were first observed thanks to electroencephalograms. However, it is known that seizures originating from one or more specific regions may or may not spread to the rest of the brain, while the exact mechanisms are unclear. We propose three computational models at the neural network scale to study the underlying dynamics of seizure propagation, understand which specific features play a role, and relate them to clinical or experimental observations. We consider both network features, such as the internal connectivity structure and single neuron model, and input properties in our characterization. We show that a paroxysmal input leads to a dynamical heterogeneity inside the network, non-trivially related with its architecture, which may or may not entrain it into a seizure. Although hard to anticipate because of the intricate nature of the instability involved, the seizure propagation might be circumvented upon acting on the network during a specific time window. As we deal with a complex system, which seems to depend non trivially on various parameters, we propose a probabilistic approach to the propagative/non-propagative scenarios, which may serve as a guide to control the seizure by using appropriate stimuli.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transcriptional profiling of transport mechanisms and regulatory pathways in rat choroid plexus</a></h4>

              
                Background: Dysregulation of brain fluid homeostasis associates with brain pathologies in which fluid accumulation leads to elevated intracranial pressure. Surgical intervention remains standard care, since specific and efficient pharmacological treatment options are limited for pathologies with disturbed brain fluid homeostasis. Such lack of therapeutic targets originates, in part, from the incomplete map of the molecular mechanisms underlying cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) secretion by the choroid plexus. Methods: The transcriptomic profile of rat choroid plexus was generated by RNA Sequencing (RNAseq) of whole tissue and epithelial cells captured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), and compared to proximal tubules. The bioinformatic analysis comprised mapping to reference genome followed by filtering for type, location, and association with alias and protein function. The transporters and associated regulatory modules were arranged in discovery tables according to their transcriptional abundance and tied together in association network analysis. Results: The transcriptomic profile of choroid plexus displays high similarity between sex and species (human, rat, and mouse) and lesser similarity to another secretory epithelium, the proximal tubules. The discovery tables provide lists of transport mechanisms that could participate in CSF secretion and suggest regulatory candidates. Conclusions: With quantification of the transport protein abundance in choroid plexus and their potentially linked regulatory modules, we envision a molecular tool to devise rational hypotheses regarding future delineation of choroidal transport proteins involved in CSF secretion and their regulation. Our vision is to obtain pharmaceutical targets towards modulation of CSF production in pathologies involving disturbed brain water dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Visual and auditory cortices represent acoustic speech-related information during silent lip reading</a></h4>

              
                Speech is an intrinsically multisensory signal and seeing the speaker's lips forms a cornerstone of communication in acoustically impoverished environments. Still, it remains unclear how the brain exploits visual speech for comprehension and previous work debated whether lip signals are mainly processed along the auditory pathways or whether the visual system directly implements speech-related processes. To probe this question, we systematically characterized dynamic representations of multiple acoustic and visual speech-derived features in source localized MEG recordings that were obtained while participants listened to speech or viewed silent speech. Using a mutual-information framework we provide a comprehensive assessment of how well temporal and occipital cortices reflect the physically presented signals and speech-related features that were physically absent but may still be critical for comprehension. Our results demonstrate that both cortices are capable of a functionally specific form of multisensory restoration: during lip reading both reflect unheard acoustic features, with occipital regions emphasizing spectral information and temporal regions emphasizing the speech envelope. Importantly, the degree of envelope restoration was predictive of lip reading performance. These findings suggest that when seeing the speaker's lips the brain engages both visual and auditory pathways to support comprehension by exploiting multisensory correspondences between lip movements and spectro-temporal acoustic cues.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Do we parse the background into separate streams in the cocktail party?</a></h4>

              
                In the cocktail party situation, people with normal hearing usually follow a single speaker among multiple concurrent ones. However, there is no agreement in the literature as to whether the background is segregated into multiple streams/speakers. The current study varied the number of concurrent speech streams and investigated target detection and memory for the contents of a target stream as well as the processing of distractors. A male-spoken target stream was either presented alone (single-speech), together with one male-spoken (one-distractor), or a male- and a female-spoken distractor (two-distractor). Behavioral measures of target detection and content tracking performance as well as target- and distractor detection related ERPs were assessed. We found that the detection sensitivity and the target N2b amplitude decreased whereas the P3b amplitude increased from the single-speech to the concurrent speech streams conditions. Importantly, the behavioral distractor effect differed between the conditions with one- vs. two-distractor (distraction by the female speaker was lower than that of the male speaker in either condition) and the target N2b elicited in the presence of two distractors was significantly smaller than that elicited in the presence of one distractor. Further, the voltage in the N2b time window significantly differed between the one- and two-distractor conditions for the same (M2) speaker. These results show that speech processing was different in the presence of one vs. two distractors, and thus, the current data suggest that the two background speech streams were segregated from each other.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cochlear theta activity oscillates in phase opposition during interaural attention</a></h4>

              
                It is widely established that sensory perception is a rhythmic process as opposed to a continuous one. In the context of auditory perception this effect is only established on a cortical and behavioral level. Yet, the unique architecture of the auditory sensory system allows its primary sensory cortex to modulate the processes of its sensory receptors at the cochlear level. Previously, we could demonstrate the existence of a genuine cochlear theta (~6 Hz) rhythm that is modulated in amplitude by intermodal selective attention. As the study's paradigm was not suited to assess attentional effects on the oscillatory phase of cochlear activity the question whether attention can also affect the temporal organization of the cochlea's ongoing activity remained open. The present study utilizes an interaural attention paradigm to investigate ongoing otoacoustic activity during a stimulus-free cue-target interval and an omission period of the auditory target. We were able to replicate the existence of the cochlear theta rhythm. Importantly, we found significant phase opposition between the two ears and attention conditions of anticipatory as well as cochlear oscillatory activity during target presentation. Yet, the amplitude was unaffected by interaural attention. These results are the first to demonstrate that intermodal and interaural attention deploy different aspects of excitation and inhibition at the first level of auditory processing. While intermodal attention modulates the level of cochlear activity, interaural attention modulates the timing.

                While the neural circuits underlying memory encoding, storage, and retrieval are well characterized, the circuits that act to disrupt memory are enigmatic. Here we find that silencing a projection from the prefrontal cortex to the lateral entorhinal cortex surprisingly improves spatial working memory and contextual memory. We then found that the same cell type shows increased activity during errors in a spatial working memory test. Finally we found that optogenetic activation of the same activity patterns can disrupt working memory performance. By using a combination of intersectional genetic and in vivo imaging techniques we advance evidence that a novel prefrontal-entorhinal pathway critically participates in memory disruption.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The psychotomimetic ketamine disrupts the transfer of late sensory information in the corticothalamic network</a></h4>

              
                In prodromal and early schizophrenia, disorders of attention and perception are associated with structural and chemical brain abnormalities, and with dysfunctional, highly distributed corticothalamic networks exhibiting disturbed brain rhythms. The underlying mechanisms are elusive. The non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine simulates the symptoms of prodromal and early schizophrenia, including the disturbances in ongoing and task/sensory-related broadband gamma frequency (30-80 Hz) oscillations in corticothalamic networks. In normal healthy subjects and rodents, complex integration processes, like sensory perception, induce transient, large-scale synchronized gamma oscillations in a time window of a few hundreds of ms (200-700 ms) after the presentation of the object of attention (e.g., sensory stimulation). Our goal was to use an electrophysiological multisite network approach to investigate, in lightly anesthetized rats, the effects of a single psychotomimetic low-dose (2.5 mg/kg, subcutaneous) of ketamine on sensory stimulus-induced gamma oscillations. Ketamine transiently increased the power of baseline gamma oscillations and decreased sensory-induced gamma oscillations. In addition, it disrupted information transferability in both the somatosensory thalamus and the related cortex and decreased the stimulus-induced gamma-frequency band thalamocortical connectivity. In conclusion, the present findings support the hypothesis that NMDA receptor antagonism disrupts the transfer of perceptual information in the somatosensory cortico-thalamo-cortical system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multi-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation of human motor cortex produces short-latency corticomotor facilitation via two distinct mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                Background: Single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation of the precentral hand representation (M1HAND) can elicit indirect waves in the corticospinal tract at a periodicity of ~660 Hz, called indirect or I- waves. These synchronized descending volleys are produced by transsynaptic excitation of fast- conducting monosynaptic corticospinal axons in M1-HAND. Paired-pulse TMS can induce short-interval intracortical facilitation (SICF) of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) at inter-pulse intervals that match I-wave periodicity. Objective: To examine whether short-latency corticospinal facilitation engages additional mechanisms independently of I-wave periodicity. Methods: In 19 volunteers, one to four biphasic TMS pulses were applied to left M1-HAND with inter- pulse interval was adjusted to the first peak or first trough of the individual SICF curve. TMS was applied at different intensities to probe the intensity-response relationship. Results: Pairs, triplets, or quadruplets at individual peak-latency facilitated MEP amplitudes across a wide range of TMS intensities compared to single pulses. Multi-pulse TMSHAND at individual trough- latency also produced a consistent facilitation of MEP amplitude. Short-latency facilitation at trough-latency was less pronounced than short-latency facilitation at peak-latency, but the relative difference in facilitation decreased with increasing stimulus intensity. Increasing the number of pulses from two to four pulses had only a modest effect on MEP facilitation. Conclusion: Two mechanisms underly short-latency corticomotor facilitation caused by biphasic multi-pulse TMS. An intracortical mechanism is related to I-wave periodicity and engages fast-conducting direct projections to spinal motoneurons. A second corticospinal mechanism does not rely on I- wave rhythmicity and may be mediated by slower conducting indirect pyramidal tract projections from M1-HAND to spinal interneurons. The latter mechanism deserves more attention in TMS studies of the corticomotor system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Public volume electron microscopy data: An essential resource to study the brain microvasculature</a></h4>

              
                Electron microscopy is the primary approach to study ultrastructural features of the cerebrovasculature. However, 2D snapshots of a vascular bed capture only a small fraction of its complexity. Recent efforts to synaptically map neuronal circuitry using volume electron microscopy have also sampled the brain microvasculature in 3D. Here, we perform a meta-analysis of 6 data sets spanning different species and brain regions, including 2 data sets from the MICrONS consortium that have made efforts to segment vasculature in addition to all parenchymal cell types in mouse visual cortex. Exploration of these data have revealed rich information for detailed investigation of the cerebrovasculature. Neurovascular unit cell types (including, but not limited to, endothelial cells, mural cells, perivascular fibroblasts, microglia, and astrocytes) could be discerned across broad microvascular zones. Image contrast was sufficient to identify subcellular details, including endothelial junctions, caveolae, peg-and-socket interactions, mitochondria, Golgi cisternae, microvilli and other cellular protrusions of potential significance to vascular signaling. Additionally, noncellular structures including the basement membrane and perivascular spaces were visible and could be traced between arterio-venous zones along the vascular wall. These explorations revealed structural features that may be important for vascular functions, such as blood-brain barrier integrity, blood flow control, brain clearance, and bioenergetics. They also identified limitations where accuracy and consistency of segmentation could be further honed by future efforts. The purpose of this article is to introduce these valuable community resources within the framework of cerebrovascular research by providing an assessment of their vascular contents, identifying features of significance for further study, and discussing next step ideas for refining vascular segmentation and analysis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A connectome-based model of conscious access in monkey cortex</a></h4>

              
                A growing body of evidence suggests that conscious perception of a sensory stimulus triggers an all-or-none activity across multiple cortical areas, a phenomenon called 'ignition'. In contrast, the same stimulus, when undetected, induces only transient activity. In this work, we report a large-scale model of the macaque cortex based on recently quantified structural connectome data. We use this model to simulate a detection task, and demonstrate how a dynamical bifurcation mechanism produces ignition-like events in the model network. Within this framework, the model predicts that feedforward excitatory transmission is primarily mediated by the fast AMPA receptors to ensure rapid signal propagation from sensory to associative areas. In contrast, a large fraction of the inter-areal feedback projections and local recurrent excitation depend on the slow NMDA receptors, to ensure ignition of distributed frontoparietal activity. Our model predicts, counterintuitively, that fast-responding sensory areas contain a higher ratio of NMDA to AMPA receptors compared to association cortical areas that show slow, sustained activity. We validate this prediction using in-vitro receptor autoradiography data. Finally, we show how this model can account for various behavioral and physiological effects linked to consciousness. Together, these findings clarify the neurophysiological mechanisms of conscious access in the primate cortex and support the concept that gradients of receptor densities along the cortical hierarchy contribute to distributed cognitive functions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Vigilance, arousal, and acetylcholine: Optimal control of attention in a simple detection task</a></h4>

              
                Paying attention to particular aspects of the world or being more vigilant in general can be interpreted as forms of 'internal' action. Such arousal-related choices come with the benefit of increasing the quality and situational appropriateness of information acquisition and processing, but incur potentially expensive energetic and opportunity costs. The choices are likely implemented by widespread ascending neuromodulatory systems, including acetylcholine (ACh) and norepinephrine (NE). The key computational question that elective attention poses for sensory processing is when it is worthwhile paying these costs, and this includes consideration of whether sufficient information has yet been collected to justify the higher signal-to-noise ratio afforded by greater attention and, particularly if a change in attentional state is more expensive than its maintenance, when states of heightened attention ought to persist. We offer a partially observable Markov decision-process treatment of optional attention in a signal detection task, and use it to provide a qualitative model of the results of studies using modern techniques to measure and manipulate ACh in rodents performing a similar task.

                Dendritic spines are the central postsynaptic machinery that determines synaptic function. The F-actin within dendritic spines regulates their dynamic formation and elimination. Rai14 is an F-actin-regulating protein with a membrane-shaping function. Here, we identified the roles of Rai14 for the regulation of dendritic spine dynamics associated with stress-induced depressive-like behaviors. Rai14-deficient neurons failed to maintain a proper dendritic spine density in the Rai14+/- mouse brain, resulting in impaired functional synaptic activity. Rai14 was protected from degradation by complex formation with Tara, and accumulated in the dendritic spine neck, thereby enhancing spine maintenance. Concurrently, Rai14 deficiency in mice altered gene expression profile relevant to depressive conditions and increased depressive-like behaviors. Moreover, Rai14 expression was reduced in the prefrontal cortex of the mouse stress model, which was blocked by antidepressant treatment. Thus, we propose that Rai14-dependent regulation of dendritic spines may underlie the plastic changes of neuronal connections relevant to depressive-like behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distributed network processes account for the majority of variance in localized visual category selectivity</a></h4>

              
                In seeking to understand processes fundamental to brain function, the debate between localized versus distributed processing has persisted for over a century. High category selectivity of some visual regions has provided evidence for localized (within-region) processing. However, given recent evidence that distributed connectivity patterns are predictive of localized task-evoked activations, we hypothesized that even highly localized category-selective brain activations are primarily determined by the connectivity-specified convergence of distributed brain processes. Consistent with this, we utilized fMRI data from N=352 human participants to find that distributed activity flow processes (specified by each region's unique "connectivity fingerprint") locally converge on visual cortex regions to confer the majority contribution to visual category selective responses to bodies, faces, places, and tools. This highlights a prominent role for functional network organization in the generation of localized visual category selectivity and provides evidence for a distributed convergence account of localized functionality in the human brain.

                Microglia sense the changes in their environment. How microglia actively translate these changes into suitable cues to adapt brain physiology is unknown. We reveal an activity-dependent regulation of cortical inhibitory synapses plasticity by microglia, driven by purinergic signaling acting on P2RX7 and mediated by microglia-derived TNF. We demonstrate that sleep induces this microglia-dependent inhibitory plasticity by promoting synaptic enrichment of GABAARs. We further show that in turn, microglia-specific depletion of TNF alters slow waves during NREM sleep and blunts sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Together, our results reveal that microglia orchestrate sleep-intrinsic plasticity of inhibitory synapses, ultimately sculpting sleep slow waves and memory.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The cellular coding of temperature in the mammalian cortex</a></h4>

              
                Temperature is a fundamental sensory modality separate from touch, with dedicated receptor channels and primary afferent neurons for cool and warm (Blix, 1882; Filingeri, 2016; Vriens et al., 2014). Unlike other modalities, however, the cortical encoding of temperature remains mysterious, with very few cortical neurons reported that respond to non-painful temperature and the presence of a thermal cortex is debated (Bokiniec et al., 2018; Craig et al., 2000; Hellon et al., 1973; Milenkovic et al., 2014; Tsuboi et al., 1993). Using widefield and two-photon calcium imaging in the mouse forepaw system, here we identify cortical neurons that respond to cooling and/or warming with distinct spatial and temporal response properties. Surprisingly, we observed a representation of cool, but not warm, in the primary somatosensory cortex, but cool and warm in the posterior insular cortex (pIC). The representation of thermal information in pIC is robust, somatotopically-arranged and reversible manipulations show a profound impact on thermal perception. Intriguingly, despite being positioned along the same one-dimensional sensory axis, the encoding of cool and warm is distinct, both in highly- and broadly- tuned neurons. Together, our results show that pIC contains the primary cortical representation of skin temperature and may help explain how the thermal system generates sensations of cool and warm.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Novel Mathematical Model Based on Cellular Automata for Study of Alzheimer's Disease Progress</a></h4>

              
                In recent years, extensive research has been done for the prediction, treatment, and recognition of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Among these scientific works, mathematical modelling of AD is an efficient way to study the influence of various parameters such as drugs on AD progression. This paper proposes a novel model based on Cellular Automata (CA), a powerful collection of coloured cells, for the investigation of AD progress. In our model, the synapses of each neuron have been considered as square cells located around the central cell. The key parameter for the progression of AD in our model is the amount of amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}), which is calculated by differential rate equations of the Puri-Li model. Based on the proposed model in this article, we introduce a new definition of AD Rate for a MxL-neuron network, which can be expanded for the whole space of the hippocampus. To better illustrate the mechanism of this model, we simulate a 3x3 neuron network and discuss the obtained results. Our numerical results show that the variations of some parameters have a great effect on AD progress. For instance, it is obtained that AD Rate is more sensitive to astroglia variations, in comparison to microglia variations. The presented model can improve the scientist's insight into the progress of AD, which will assist them to effectively consider the influence of various parameters on AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pattern reinstatement and attentional control: overlapping processes during episodic long-term memory retrieval</a></h4>

              
                Episodic long-term memory (eLTM) retrieval involves the reinstatement of neural patterns from the encoding phase. However, recent evidence suggests that comparable effects on cortical activity patterns can also be linked to attentional control processes on the level of memory representations. The current investigation assesses these two processes independently based on alpha-beta-band activity in the electroencephalogram (EEG). During encoding, subjects were presented with an object on a certain position on the screen and had to imagine it on a new position. In each trial, either the task-irrelevant presentation position or the task-relevant imagination position was lateralized. In the retrieval phase, subjects first made an old/new judgement based on centrally presented objects and then reported the imagination position. Pattern reinstatement should be reflected in similar lateralized alpha-beta activity during encoding and retrieval. Conversely, the influence of attentional control processes during retrieval would be associated with the suppression of alpha-beta power contralateral to the to-be-reported imagination position and with the increase of activity contralateral to the irrelevant presentation position. Our results support this latter pattern. This shows that an experimental differentiation between selective attention and pattern reinstatement processes is necessary when studying the neural basis of eLTM retrieval on cortical level.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Identifying the midline thalamus in humans in vivo</a></h4>

              
                The midline thalamus is essential to flexible cognition, memory, and stress regulation and its dysfunction is associated with several neurological and mental health disorders including Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and depression. Despite the pervasive role of the midline thalamus in cognition and disease, almost nothing is known about it in humans due to the lack of a rigorous methodology for finding this brain region using noninvasive imaging technologies. Here, we introduce a new method for identifying the midline thalamus in vivo using probabilistic tractography and k-means clustering with diffusion weighted imaging data. This method clusters thalamic voxels based on data-driven cortical and subcortical connectivity profiles, and then segments midline thalamic nuclei based on connectivity profiles established in rodent and macaque tracer studies. Results from two different diffusion weighted imaging sets, including adult data (22-35yrs) from the Human Connectome Project (n=127) and adolescent data (9-14yrs) collected at Florida International University (n=34) showed that this approach reliably classifies midline thalamic clusters. As expected, these clusters were most evident along the dorsal/ventral extent of the third ventricle and primarily connected to the agranular medial prefrontal cortex (e.g., anterior cingulate cortex), nucleus accumbens, and medial temporal lobe regions. The midline thalamic clusters were then bisected based on a human brain atlas (Ding et al., 2016) into a dorsal midline thalamic cluster (paraventricular and paratenial nuclei) and a ventral midline thalamic cluster (rhomboid and reuniens nuclei). This anatomical connectivity-based identification procedure for the midline thalamus offers new opportunities to study this region in vivo in healthy populations and in those with psychiatric and neurological disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Voxel-wise Intermodal Coupling Analysis of Two or More Modalities using Local Covariance Decomposition</a></h4>

              
                When individual subjects are imaged with multiple modalities, biological information is present not only within each modality, but also between modalities - that is, in how modalities covary at the voxel level. Previous studies have shown that local covariance structures between modalities, or intermodal coupling (IMCo), can be summarized for two modalities, and that two-modality IMCo reveals otherwise undiscovered patterns in neurodevelopment and certain diseases. However, previous IMCo methods are based on the slopes of local weighted linear regression lines, which are inherently asymmetric and limited to the two-modality setting. Here, we present a generalization of IMCo estimation which uses local covariance decompositions to define a symmetric, voxel-wise coupling coefficient that is valid for two or more modalities. We use this method to study coupling between cerebral blood flow, amplitude of low frequency fluctuations, and local connectivity in 803 subjects ages 8 through 22. We demonstrate that coupling is spatially heterogeneous, varies with respect to age and sex in neurodevelopment, and reveals patterns that are not present in individual modalities. As availability of multi-modal data continues to increase, principal-component-based IMCo (pIMCo) offers a powerful approach for summarizing relationships between multiple aspects of brain structure and function. An R package for estimating pIMCo is available at: https://github.com/hufengling/pIMCo.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reactive astrocytes transduce blood-brain barrier dysfunction through a TNFα-STAT3 signaling axis and secretion of alpha 1-antichymotrypsin</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes are critical components of the neurovascular unit that support blood-brain barrier (BBB) function in brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs). Transformation of astrocytes to a reactive state in response to injury and disease can be protective or harmful to BBB function, but the underlying mechanisms for these effects remain mostly unclear. Using a human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived coculture model of BMEC-like cells and astrocytes, we found that tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) transitions astrocytes to an inflammatory reactive state through activated STAT3 signaling, whereby the resultant astrocytes disrupt passive BBB function and induce vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) expression in the BMEC-like cells. These associations between inflammatory reactive astrocytes, STAT3 activation, and vascular VCAM-1 expression were corroborated in human postmortem tissue. Bioinformatic analyses coupled with CRISPR interference techniques in the iPSC model revealed that inflammatory reactive astrocytes transduce BBB disruption in part through SERPINA3, which encodes alpha 1-antichymotrypsin (1ACT), a secreted serine protease inhibitor associated with aging, neuroinflammation, and Alzheimer's disease. In murine ex vivo cortical explant cultures, shRNA-mediated silencing of Serpina3n in astrocytes reduced vascular VCAM-1 expression after TNF challenge. Further, direct treatment with recombinant Serpina3n in both ex vivo explant cultures and the brain in vivo (via intracerebroventricular injection into wild-type mice) was sufficient to induce vascular VCAM-1 expression and reduce tight junction integrity. Overall, our results define the TNF-STAT3 signaling axis as a driver of an inflammatory reactive astrocyte subtype responsible for BBB dysfunction. Our results also identify 1ACT as an explicit mediator of BBB damage and suggest that inhibition of 1ACT expression or activity could represent a therapeutic avenue for reversing BBB deficits in aging and neurodegenerative disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Noncontact and high-precision sensing system for piano keys identified fingerprints of virtuosity</a></h4>

              
                Dexterous tool use is typically characterized by fast and precise motions performed by multiple fingers. One representative task is piano playing, which involves fast performance of a sequence of complex motions with high spatiotemporal precision. However, for several decades, a lack of contactless sensing technologies that are capable of precision measurement of piano key motions has been a bottleneck for unveiling how such an outstanding skill is cultivated. Here, we developed a novel sensing system that can record the vertical position of all piano keys with a time resolution of 1 ms and a spatial resolution of 0.01 mm in a noncontact manner. Using this system, we recoded the piano key motions while 49 pianists played a complex sequence of tones that required both individuated and coordinated finger movements to be performed as fast and accurately as possible. Penalized regression using various feature variables of the key motions identified distinct characteristics of the key-depressing and key-releasing motions in relation to the speed and accuracy of the performance. For the maximum rate of the keystrokes, individual differences across the pianists were associated with the peak key descending velocity, the key depression duration, and key-lift timing. For the timing error of the keystrokes, the interindividual differences were associated with the peak ascending velocity of the key and the interstrike variability of both the peak key descending velocity and the key depression duration. These results highlight the importance of dexterous control of the vertical motions of the keys for fast and accurate piano performance.

	<p>Stroke is a major cause of disability and an evident rehabilitation strategy is crucial. Mirror therapy (MT) is one of the popular rehabilitation methods that is known to be effective as the patients benefit from the mirror illusion. However, the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s attention to the mirror illusion during treatment is unclear. Therefore, the present study assesses the duration and frequency of the mirror gaze, distraction, and preparation of sixteen stroke patients during two MT methods using a behavioral coding software. During the 30 min treatment, the total mirror gaze duration during conventional bilateral MT (BMT) was 564.04 s, while it was 1482.45 s in unilateral MT using a screen (UMT). The total distracted time was 945.61 s in BMT, while it was only 162.03 s in UMT. The total preparatory duration was 290.35 s in BMT and 155.53 s in UMT. The total number of distracted bouts were 136.45 in BMT, while it was 73.38 in UMT. The total number of preparatory bouts were 18.42 in BMT and 9.56 in UMT. The average times of gaze duration per bout were 5.52 s in BMT and 21.81 s in UMT. The average times of distraction per bout were 9.22 s in BMT and 3.00 s in UMT. The total number of mirror gaze bouts and average time of preparation per bout did not present a statistical significance in the comparisons of the two methods. This study assesses two methods of MT using observational coding software to evaluate the duration and frequency of the mirror gaze during treatment. The results suggest that UMT may be an alternative option to provide MT for stroke patients to increase their attention towards the mirror.</p>

                Genomic epidemiology has proven successful for real-time and retrospective monitoring of small and large-scale outbreaks. Here, we report two genomic sequencing and analysis strategies for rapid-turnaround or high-throughput processing of metagenomic samples. The rapid-turnaround method was designed to provide a quick phylogenetic snapshot of samples at the heart of active outbreaks, and has a total turnaround time of <48 hours from raw sample to analyzed data. The high-throughput method, first reported here for SARS-CoV2, was designed for semi-retrospective data analysis, and is both cost effective and highly scalable. Though these methods were developed and utilized for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic response in Arizona, U.S, we envision their use for infectious disease epidemiology in the 21st Century.

     alt="Molecular ontology of the parabrachial nucleus"/>
<p>The parabrachial nucleus (PB) contains diverse, intermingled neurons regulating various homeostatic functions. Their neuronal distributions often do not align with cytoarchitectural subdivisions. Here, we show that the PB is a blend of two, developmentally distinct glutamatergic populations identified by the embryonic transcription factors <i>Atoh1</i> and <i>Lmx1a</i>/<i>Lmx1b</i>. We show that macropopulation identity predicts output connectivity and other gene expression patterns in this region. Our findings lay the foundation for a molecular ontology that will be useful for interpreting transcriptomic, connectomic, and other experimental data involving PB neurons.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Diverse neurons in the parabrachial nucleus (PB) communicate with widespread brain regions. Despite evidence linking them to a variety of homeostatic functions, it remains difficult to determine which PB neurons influence which functions because their subpopulations intermingle extensively. An improved framework for identifying these intermingled subpopulations would help advance our understanding of neural circuit functions linked to this region. Here, we present the foundation of a developmental-genetic ontology that classifies PB neurons based on their intrinsic, molecular features. By combining transcription factor labeling with Cre fate-mapping, we find that the PB is a blend of two, developmentally distinct macropopulations of glutamatergic neurons. Neurons in the first macropopulation express <i>Lmx1b</i> (and, to a lesser extent, <i>Lmx1a</i>) and are mutually exclusive with those in a second macropopulation, which derive from precursors expressing <i>Atoh1</i>. This second, <i>Atoh1</i>-derived macropopulation includes many <i>Foxp2</i>-expressing neurons, but <i>Foxp2</i> also identifies a subset of <i>Lmx1b</i>-expressing neurons in the Kölliker–Fuse nucleus (KF) and a population of GABAergic neurons ventrolateral to the PB (“caudal KF”). Immediately ventral to the PB, <i>Phox2b</i>-expressing glutamatergic neurons (some coexpressing <i>Lmx1b</i>) occupy the KF, supratrigeminal nucleus, and reticular formation. We show that this molecular framework organizes subsidiary patterns of adult gene expression (including <i>Satb2</i>, <i>Calca</i>, <i>Grp</i>, and <i>Pdyn</i>) and predicts output projections to the amygdala (<i>Lmx1b</i>), hypothalamus (<i>Atoh1</i>), and hindbrain (<i>Phox2b</i>/<i>Lmx1b</i>). Using this molecular ontology to organize, interpret, and communicate PB-related information could accelerate the translation of experimental findings from animal models to human patients.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study aimed to validate the Erasmus Guillain–Barré Syndrome Respiratory Insufficiency Score in the International Guillain–Barré Syndrome Outcome Study cohort, and to improve its performance and region-specificity.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We examined data from the first 1,500 included patients, aged ≥6 years and not ventilated prior to study entry. Patients with a clinical variant or mild symptoms were also included. Outcome was mechanical ventilation within the first week from study entry. Model performance was assessed regarding the discriminative ability (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) and the calibration (observed vs predicted probability of mechanical ventilation), in the full cohort and in Europe/North America and Asia separately. We recalibrated the model to improve its performance and region-specificity.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the group of 1,023 eligible patients (Europe/North America n = 842, Asia n = 104, other n = 77), 104 (10%) required mechanical ventilation within the first week from study entry. Area under the curve values were ≥0.80 for all validation subgroups. Mean observed proportions of mechanical ventilation were lower than predicted risks: full cohort 10% versus 21%, Europe/North America 9% versus 21%, and Asia 17% versus 23%. After recalibration, predicted risks for the full cohort and Europe/North America corresponded to observed proportions.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This prospective, international cohort study validated the Erasmus Guillain–Barré Syndrome Respiratory Insufficiency Score, and showed that the model can be used in the full spectrum of Guillain–Barré syndrome patients. In addition, a more accurate, region-specific version of the model was developed for patients from Europe/North America. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

<p>Ethnicity/race moderated the relationships between knee pain, pain catastrophizing, and resting-state functional connectivity in non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White participants. Further investigations of the factors influencing sociodemographic differences are needed.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Chronic pain is a significant public health problem, and the prevalence and societal impact continues to worsen annually. Multiple cognitive and emotional factors are known to modulate pain, including pain catastrophizing, which contributes to pain facilitation and is associated with altered resting-state functional connectivity in pain-related cortical and subcortical circuitry. Pain and catastrophizing levels are reported to be higher in non-Hispanic black (NHB) compared with non-Hispanic White (NHW) individuals. The current study, a substudy of a larger ongoing observational cohort investigation, investigated the pathways by which ethnicity/race influences the relationship between pain catastrophizing, clinical pain, and resting-state functional connectivity between anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), insula, and primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Participants included 136 (66 NHBs and 70 NHWs) community-dwelling adults with knee osteoarthritis. Participants completed the Coping Strategies Questionnaire-Revised Pain Catastrophizing subscale and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index. Magnetic resonance imaging data were obtained, and resting-state functional connectivity was analyzed. Relative to NHW, the NHB participants were younger, reported lower income, were less likely to be married, and self-reported greater clinical pain and pain catastrophizing (<i>p</i>s &lt; 0.05). Ethnicity/race moderated the mediation effects of catastrophizing on the relationship between clinical pain and resting-state functional connectivity between the ACC, dlPFC, insula, and S1. These results indicate the NHB and NHW groups demonstrated different relationships between pain, catastrophizing, and functional connectivity. These results provide evidence for a potentially important role of ethnicity/race in the interrelationships among pain, catastrophizing, and resting-state functional connectivity.</p>

     alt="Lateral entorhinal cortex lesions impair odor-context associative memory in male rats"/>
<p>Rats with lesions of lateral entorhinal cortex have impaired memory for associations of odors and contexts while their memory for individual items is unaffected. This suggests that integration of associative information occurs at the level of lateral entorhinal cortex as well as the hippocampus.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) has been hypothesized to process nonspatial, item information that is combined with spatial information from medial entorhinal cortex to form episodic memories within the hippocampus. Recent studies, however, have demonstrated that LEC has a role in integrating features of episodic memory prior to the hippocampus. While the precise role of LEC is still unclear, anatomical studies show that LEC is ideally placed to be a hub integrating multisensory information. The current study tests whether the role of LEC in integrating information extends to long-term multimodal item-context associations. In Experiment 1, male rats were trained on a context-dependent odor discrimination task, where two different contexts served as the cue to the correct odor. Rats were pretrained on the task and then received either bilateral excitotoxic LEC or sham lesions. Following surgery, rats were tested on the previously learned odor-context associations. Control rats showed good memory for the previously learned association but rats with LEC lesions showed significantly impaired performance relative to both their own presurgery performance and to control rats. Experiment 2 went on to test whether impairments in Experiment 1 were the result of LEC lesions impairing either odor or context memory retention alone. Male rats were trained on simple odor and context discrimination tasks that did not require integration of features to solve. Following surgery, both LEC and control rats showed good memory for previously learned odors and contexts. These data show that LEC is critical for long-term odor-context associative memory.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Sleep is a universal and evolutionarily conserved behavior among many animal species, yet we do not have a fundamental understanding of why animals need to sleep. What we do know, however, is that sleep is critical for behavioral performance during the waking period and for long-term brain health. Here we provide an overview of some putative mechanisms that mediate the restorative effects of sleep, namely metabolic biosynthesis, fluid perfusion, and synaptic homeostasis. We then review recent experimental findings that advance the possibility of inducing sleep-like slow-wave activity (SWA) during wakefulness or enhance SWA during sleep in a top-down manner using noninvasive brain stimulation. SWA induction and SWA enhancement are believed to recapitulate the beneficial effects of sleep independent of the actual state of the subjects. If confirmed, these observations will change the way in which we investigate the neural correlates of sleep, thus paving the way for comprehending and actively controlling its restorative function.</p>

<p>By quantitatively measuring the brain coupling signature between functional activity and structural connectome using graph frequency analysis, we found a unique signature of brain structural-functional reorganization in multiple sclerosis.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The brain activities and the underlying wiring diagrams are vulnerable in multiple sclerosis (MS). Also, it remains unknown whether the complex coupling between these functional and structural brain properties would be affected. To address this issue, we adopted graph frequency analysis to quantify the high-order structural-functional interactions based on a combination of brain diffusion and functional MRI data. The structural-functional decoupling index was proposed to measure how much brain regional functional activity with different graph frequency was organized atop the underlying wiring diagram in MS. The identified patterns in MS included (1) disruption of inherent structural-functional coupling in the somatomotor network (<i>β</i> = 0.05, <i>p</i> = 0.03), and (2) excessive decrease of decoupling in the subcortical (<i>β</i> = −0.10, <i>p</i> = 0.02), visual (<i>β</i> = −0.04, <i>p</i> = 0.01), and dorsal attention networks (<i>β</i> = −0.12, <i>p</i> = 0.03). Besides, this structural-functional coupling signature in the somatomotor network was associated with cognitive worsening of MS patients (<i>β</i> = −24.31, <i>p</i> = 0.006). Overall, our study unveiled a unique signature of brain structural-functional reorganization in MS.</p>

<p>Very low (≤0.5 Gy) radiation doses twice per week (ultra-hyper fractionated radiotherapy) started soon after the last standard 2.0 Gy radiotherapeutic fraction may help to control high-grade glioma progression (image credits: University of Utah).</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Ionizing radiation is a mainstay of high-grade glioma therapy. The current standard radiotherapeutic schedule involves a total 60 Gy split in 2.0 Gy fractions delivered on weekdays for six weeks. Thereafter, almost invariably the tumor relapses and progresses. <i>In vitro</i> studies have demonstrated that the therapeutic effectiveness of ionizing radiation towards high-grade glioma cells is greatly increased by splitting the total dose in fractions ten times smaller [0.1–0.5 Gy instead of standard 2.0 Gy—ultra-hyper-fractionated radiotherapy (ultra-hyper-FRT)]. Recently, it became possible to consistently translate this therapeutic effect to the animal setting, by using glioma-initiating cell-driven faithful animal modeling. A re-analysis of the literature reporting radiotherapeutic clinical trials also suggests that the lower the average fraction size, the higher is the achievable overall survival of patients. However, average fraction sizes ≤ 0.5 Gy have never been thoroughly investigated in the clinics. We propose to study in the clinical setting the therapeutic effect of an ultra-hyper-FRT schedule promptly extending the conventional radiation component of the current guidelines (“Stupp”) therapeutic protocol.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Adolescent stress predisposes individuals to increased risk for anxiety and depression in adulthood. The stress response is mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) via regulation of GR-responsive genes involved in brain reaction to stress. Although dysregulation of GR in depression is well documented, this is the first study investigating the role of GRα isoforms in pathogenesis of depression. We exposed adolescent male and female C57BL/6J mice to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) for 12 days starting at postnatal day 28 (PND28). Tests evaluating anxiety and depressive-like behaviors were performed at PND70. We analyzed corticosterone concentrations in serum, levels of GRα isoforms (95, 67, 50, 40, and 25 kDa), and mRNA levels of GR-responsive genes (GR, FKBP5, BDNF, and IL-1β) in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex (PFC). CUS increased anxiety and depressive-like behavior in adult animals of both sexes, but did not affect corticosterone serum levels, 95 and 67 kDa GR isoforms. However, the levels of shorter GRα isoforms (50, 40, and 25 kDa) were altered in adult mice underwent CUS, in sex- and brain structure–specific way. Changes in gene expression revealed that female depressive-like behavior could be related to increased levels of IL-1β in hippocampus and reduced BDNF levels in both hippocampus and PFC. However, in males, adolescent CUS increased expression of GR in adult hippocampus and BDNF in PFC. These findings suggest that adolescent stress altered levels of GRα isoforms, especially those with lower molecular weight, in sex- and tissue-specific ways, contributing to anxiety and depression in adult mice.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">How do protein aggregates escape quality control in neurodegeneration?</a></h4>

              
                Protein aggregates are hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases. The protein quality control (PQC) system normally prevents proteins from misfolding and accumulation; however, proteins somehow escape this control on disease. Here we review advances in the role of PQC in protein aggregation and neurodegeneration. We focus primarily on the protein Tau, which aggregates in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other tauopathies. We also examine recent advances in amyloid fibril structures and the process of fibril formation via phase separation, which are shedding new light on the role of PQC in protein aggregation diseases.

                Hansen et al. show that SARS-CoV-2 infection of hamsters results in an acute pulmonary disease and hamsters develop a strong, durable antibody response with lesions consistent with alveolar bronchiolization. SARS-CoV-2 reinfection results in low levels of viral replication in the upper respiratory tract and protection from acute respiratory disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Environmentally sensitive hotspots in the methylome of the early human embryo</a></h4>

              
                In humans, DNA methylation marks inherited from gametes are largely erased following fertilisation, prior to construction of the embryonic methylome. Exploiting a natural experiment of seasonal variation including changes in diet and nutritional status in rural Gambia, we analysed three datasets covering two independent child cohorts and identified 259 CpGs showing consistent associations between season of conception (SoC) and DNA methylation. SoC effects were most apparent in early infancy, with evidence of attenuation by mid-childhood. SoC-associated CpGs were enriched for metastable epialleles, parent-of-origin specific methylation and germline DMRs, supporting a periconceptional environmental influence. Many SoC-associated CpGs overlapped enhancers or sites of active transcription in H1 ESCs and fetal tissues. Half were influenced but not determined by measured genetic variants that were independent of SoC. Environmental ‘hotspots’ providing a record of environmental influence at periconception constitute a valuable resource for investigating epigenetic mechanisms linking early exposures to lifelong health and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Slow oscillation–spindle coupling strength predicts real-life gross-motor learning in adolescents and adults</a></h4>

              
                Previously, we demonstrated that precise temporal coordination between slow oscillations (SOs) and sleep spindles indexes declarative memory network development (Hahn et al., 2020). However, it is unclear whether these findings in the declarative memory domain also apply in the motor memory domain. Here, we compared adolescents and adults learning juggling, a real-life gross-motor task. Juggling performance was impacted by sleep and time of day effects. Critically, we found that improved task proficiency after sleep lead to an attenuation of the learning curve, suggesting a dynamic juggling learning process. We employed individualized cross-frequency coupling analyses to reduce inter- and intragroup variability of oscillatory features. Advancing our previous findings, we identified a more precise SO–spindle coupling in adults compared to adolescents. Importantly, coupling precision over motor areas predicted overnight changes in task proficiency and learning curve, indicating that SO–spindle coupling relates to the dynamic motor learning process. Our results provide first evidence that regionally specific, precisely coupled sleep oscillations support gross-motor learning.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">P2Y1 purinergic receptor identified as a diabetes target in a small-molecule screen to reverse circadian β-cell failure</a></h4>

              
                The mammalian circadian clock drives daily oscillations in physiology and behavior through an autoregulatory transcription feedback loop present in central and peripheral cells. Ablation of the core clock within the endocrine pancreas of adult animals impairs the transcription and splicing of genes involved in hormone exocytosis and causes hypoinsulinemic diabetes. Here, we developed a genetically sensitized small-molecule screen to identify druggable proteins and mechanistic pathways involved in circadian β-cell failure. Our approach was to generate β-cells expressing a nanoluciferase reporter within the proinsulin polypeptide to screen 2640 pharmacologically active compounds and identify insulinotropic molecules that bypass the secretory defect in CRISPR-Cas9-targeted clock mutant β-cells. We validated hit compounds in primary mouse islets and identified known modulators of ligand-gated ion channels and G-protein-coupled receptors, including the antihelmintic ivermectin. Single-cell electrophysiology in circadian mutant mouse and human cadaveric islets revealed ivermectin as a glucose-dependent secretagogue. Genetic, genomic, and pharmacological analyses established the P2Y1 receptor as a clock-controlled mediator of the insulinotropic activity of ivermectin. These findings identify the P2Y1 purinergic receptor as a diabetes target based upon a genetically sensitized phenotypic screen.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Thymocytes trigger self-antigen-controlling pathways in immature medullary thymic epithelial stages</a></h4>

              
                Interactions of developing T cells with Aire<sup>+</sup> medullary thymic epithelial cells expressing high levels of MHCII molecules (mTEC<sup>hi</sup>) are critical for the induction of central tolerance in the thymus. In turn, thymocytes regulate the cellularity of Aire<sup>+</sup> mTEC<sup>hi</sup>. However, it remains unknown whether thymocytes control the precursors of Aire<sup>+</sup> mTEC<sup>hi</sup> that are contained in mTEC<sup>lo</sup> cells or other mTEC<sup>lo</sup> subsets that have recently been delineated by single-cell transcriptomic analyses. Here, using three distinct transgenic mouse models, in which antigen presentation between mTECs and CD4<sup>+</sup> thymocytes is perturbed, we show by high-throughput RNA-seq that self-reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> thymocytes induce key transcriptional regulators in mTEC<sup>lo</sup> and control the composition of mTEC<sup>lo</sup> subsets, including Aire<sup>+</sup> mTEC<sup>hi</sup> precursors, post-Aire and tuft-like mTECs. Furthermore, these interactions upregulate the expression of tissue-restricted self-antigens, cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules important for T-cell development. This gene activation program induced in mTEC<sup>lo</sup> is combined with a global increase of the active H3K4me3 histone mark. Finally, we demonstrate that these self-reactive interactions between CD4<sup>+</sup> thymocytes and mTECs critically prevent multiorgan autoimmunity. Our genome-wide study thus reveals that self-reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> thymocytes control multiple unsuspected facets from immature stages of mTECs, which determines their heterogeneity.

Most of the ATP derives primarily from pyruvate-mediated oxidative phosphorylation, a process that relies on import of pyruvate into mitochondria occuring exclusively via the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC). To investigate whether deficient oxidative phosphorylation impacts neuron excitability, we generated a mouse strain carrying a conditional deletion of MPC1, an essential subunit of the MPC, specifically in adult glutamatergic neurons. We found that, despite decreased levels of oxidative phosphorylation and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential in these excitatory neurons, mice were normal at rest. Surprisingly, in response to mild inhibition of GABA mediated synaptic activity, they rapidly developed severe seizures and died, whereas under similar conditions the behavior of control mice remained unchanged. We report that neurons with a deficient MPC were intrinsically hyperexcitable as a consequence of impaired calcium homeostasis, which reduced M-type potassium channel activity. Provision of ketone bodies restored energy status, calcium homeostasis and M-channel activity and attenuated seizures in animals fed a ketogenic diet. Our results provide an explanation for the seizures that frequently accompany a large number of neuropathologies, including cerebral ischemia and diverse mitochondriopathies, in which neurons experience an energy deficit.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">STAT3-mediated allelic imbalance of novel genetic variant rs1047643 and B cell specific super-enhancer in association with systemic lupus erythematosus</a></h4>

              
                Mapping of allelic imbalance (AI) at heterozygous loci has the potential to establish links between genetic risk for disease and biological function. Leveraging multi-omics data for AI analysis and functional annotation, we discovered a novel functional risk variant rs1047643 at 8p23 in association with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This variant displays dynamic AI of chromatin accessibility and allelic expression on <i>FDFT1</i> gene in B cells with SLE. We further found a B-cell restricted super-enhancer (SE) that physically contacts with this SNP-residing locus, an interaction that also appears specifically in B cells. Quantitative analysis of chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation profiles further demonstrated that the SE exhibits aberrant activity in B cell development with SLE. Functional studies identified that STAT3, a master factor associated with autoimmune diseases, directly regulates both the AI of risk variant and the activity of SE in cultured B cells. Our study reveals that STAT3-mediated SE activity and cis-regulatory effects of SNP rs1047643 at 8p23 locus are associated with B cell deregulation in SLE.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Telencephalic outputs from the medial entorhinal cortex are copied directly to the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Complementary actions of the neocortex and the hippocampus enable encoding and long-term storage of experience dependent memories. Standard models for memory storage assume that sensory signals reach the hippocampus from superficial layers of the entorhinal cortex (EC). Deep layers of the EC on the other hand relay hippocampal outputs to the telencephalic structures including many parts of the neocortex. Here we show that cells in Layer 5a of the medial EC send a copy of their telencephalic outputs back to the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Combining cell-type specific anatomical tracing with high-throughput RNA-sequencing based projection mapping and optogenetics aided circuit mapping, we show that in the mouse brain these projections have a unique topography and target hippocampal pyramidal cells and interneurons. Our results suggest that projections of deep medial EC neurons are anatomically configured to influence the hippocampus and neocortex simultaneously and therefore lead to novel hypotheses on the functional role of the deep EC.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Parallel evolution of Pseudomonas aeruginosa phage resistance and virulence loss in response to phage treatment in vivo and in vitro</a></h4>

              
                With rising antibiotic resistance, there has been increasing interest in treating pathogenic bacteria with bacteriophages (phage therapy). One limitation of phage therapy is the ease at which bacteria can evolve resistance. Negative effects of resistance may be mitigated when resistance results in reduced bacterial growth and virulence, or when phage coevolve to overcome resistance. Resistance evolution and its consequences are contingent on the bacteria-phage combination and their environmental context, making therapeutic outcomes hard to predict. One solution might be to conduct '<i>in vitro</i> evolutionary simulations' using bacteria-phage combinations from the therapeutic context. Overall, our aim was to investigate parallels between <i>in vitro</i> experiments and <i>in vivo</i> dynamics in a human participant. Evolutionary dynamics were similar, with high levels of resistance evolving quickly with limited evidence of phage evolution. Resistant bacteria - evolved <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> - had lower virulence. <i>In vivo</i>, this was linked to lower growth rates of resistant isolates, whereas <i>in vitro</i> phage resistant isolates evolved greater biofilm production. Population sequencing suggests resistance resulted from selection on <i>de novo</i> mutations rather than sorting of existing variants. These results highlight the speed at which phage resistance can evolve <i>in vivo</i>, and how <i>in vitro</i> experiments may give useful insights for clinical evolutionary outcomes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cellular organization in lab-evolved and extant multicellular species obeys a maximum entropy law</a></h4>

              
                The prevalence of multicellular organisms is due in part to their ability to form complex structures. How cells pack in these structures is a fundamental biophysical issue, underlying their functional properties. However, much remains unknown about how cell packing geometries arise, and how they are affected by random noise during growth - especially absent developmental programs. Here, we quantify the statistics of cellular neighborhoods of two different multicellular eukaryotes: lab-evolved ‘snowflake’ yeast and the green alga <i>Volvox carteri</i>. We find that despite large differences in cellular organization, the free space associated with individual cells in both organisms closely fits a modified gamma distribution, consistent with maximum entropy predictions originally developed for granular materials. This ‘entropic’ cellular packing ensures a degree of predictability despite noise, facilitating parent-offspring fidelity even in the absence of developmental regulation. Together with simulations of diverse growth morphologies, these results suggest that gamma-distributed cell neighborhood sizes are a general feature of multicellularity, arising from conserved statistics of cellular packing.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Pseudohypoxic HIF pathway activation dysregulates collagen structure-function in human lung fibrosis</a></h4>

              
                Extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffening with downstream activation of mechanosensitive pathways is strongly implicated in fibrosis. We previously reported that altered collagen nanoarchitecture is a key determinant of pathogenetic ECM structure-function in human fibrosis (Jones et al., 2018). Here, through human tissue, bioinformatic and ex vivo studies we provide evidence that hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway activation is a critical pathway for this process regardless of the oxygen status (pseudohypoxia). Whilst TGFβ increased the rate of fibrillar collagen synthesis, HIF pathway activation was required to dysregulate post-translational modification of fibrillar collagen, promoting pyridinoline cross-linking, altering collagen nanostructure, and increasing tissue stiffness. In vitro, knockdown of Factor Inhibiting HIF (FIH), which modulates HIF activity, or oxidative stress caused pseudohypoxic HIF activation in the normal fibroblasts. By contrast, endogenous FIH activity was reduced in fibroblasts from patients with lung fibrosis in association with significantly increased normoxic HIF pathway activation. In human lung fibrosis tissue, HIF-mediated signalling was increased at sites of active fibrogenesis whilst subpopulations of human lung fibrosis mesenchymal cells had increases in both HIF and oxidative stress scores. Our data demonstrate that oxidative stress can drive pseudohypoxic HIF pathway activation which is a critical regulator of pathogenetic collagen structure-function in fibrosis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Human spinal cord in vitro differentiation pace is initially maintained in heterologous embryonic environments</a></h4>

              
                Species-specific differentiation pace in-vitro indicates that some aspects of neural differentiation are governed by cell intrinsic properties. Here we describe a novel in-vitro human neural-rosette assay that recapitulates dorsal spinal cord differentiation but proceeds more rapidly than in the human embryo, suggesting that it lacks endogenous signalling dynamics. To test whether in-vitro conditions represent an intrinsic differentiation pace, human iPSC-derived neural rosettes were challenged by grafting into the faster differentiating chicken embryonic neural tube iso-chronically, or hetero-chronically into older embryos. In both contexts in-vitro differentiation pace was initially unchanged, while long-term analysis revealed iso-chronic slowed and hetero-chronic conditions promoted human neural differentiation. Moreover hetero-chronic conditions did not alter the human neural differentiation programme, which progressed to neurogenesis, while the host embryo advanced into gliogenesis. This study demonstrates that intrinsic properties limit human differentiation pace, and that timely extrinsic signals are required for progression through an intrinsic human neural differentiation programme.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition proceeds through directional destabilization of multidimensional attractor</a></h4>

              
                How a cell changes from one stable phenotype to another one is a fundamental problem in developmental and cell biology. Mathematically a stable phenotype corresponds to a stable attractor in a generally multi-dimensional state space, which needs to be destabilized so the cell relaxes to a new attractor. Two basic mechanisms for destabilizing a stable fixed point, pitchfork and saddle-node bifurcations, have been extensively studied theoretically, however direct experimental investigation at the single cell level remains scarce. Here we performed live cell imaging studies and analyses in the framework of dynamical systems theories on epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). While some mechanistic details remain controversial, EMT is a cell phenotypic transition (CPT) process central to development and pathology. Through time-lapse imaging we recorded single cell trajectories of human A549/Vim-RFP cells undergoing EMT induced by different concentrations of exogenous TGF-β in a multi-dimensional cell feature space. The trajectories clustered into two distinct groups, indicating that the transition dynamics proceeds through parallel paths. We then reconstructed the reaction coordinates and the corresponding quasi-potentials from the trajectories. The potentials revealed a plausible mechanism for the emergence of the two paths where the original stable epithelial attractor collides with two saddle points sequentially with increased TGF-β concentration, and relaxes to a new one. Functionally the directional saddle-node bifurcation ensures a CPT proceeds towards a specific cell type, as a mechanistic realization of the canalization idea proposed by Waddington.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Application of ATAC-Seq for genome-wide analysis of the chromatin state at single myofiber resolution</a></h4>

              
                Myofibers are the main components of skeletal muscle, which is the largest tissue in the body. Myofibers are highly adaptive and can be altered under different biological and disease conditions. Therefore, transcriptional and epigenetic studies on myofibers are crucial to discover how chromatin alterations occur in the skeletal muscle under different conditions. However, due to the heterogenous nature of skeletal muscle, studying myofibers in isolation proves to be a challenging task. Single cell sequencing has permitted the study of the epigenome of isolated myonuclei. While this provides sequencing with high dimensionality, the sequencing depth is lacking, which makes comparisons between different biological conditions difficult. Here we report the first implementation of single myofiber ATAC-Seq, which allows for the sequencing of an individual myofiber at a depth sufficient for peak calling and for comparative analysis of chromatin accessibility under various physiological and disease conditions. Application of this technique revealed significant differences in chromatin accessibility between resting and regenerating myofibers, as well as between myofibers from a mouse model of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (mdx) and wild type (WT) counterparts. This technique can lead to a wide application in the identification of chromatin regulatory elements and epigenetic mechanisms in muscle fibers during development and in muscle-wasting diseases.

                In many childhood-onset genetic epilepsies, seizures are accompanied by neurobehavioral impairments and motor disability. In the Stargazer mutant mouse, genetic disruptions of Cacng2 result in absence-like spike-wave seizures, cerebellar gait ataxia and vestibular dysfunction. Here, we combine videotracking and instrumented home-cage monitoring to resolve the neurobehavioral facets of the murine Stargazer syndrome. We find that despite their gait ataxia, stargazer mutants display horizontal hyperactivity and variable rates of repetitive circling behavior. While feeding rhythms, circadian or ultradian oscillations in activity are unchanged, mutants exhibit fragmented sleep bouts, atypical licking dynamics and lowered sucrose preference. Mutants also display an attenuated response to visual and auditory home-cage perturbations, together with profound reductions in voluntary wheel-running. Our results reveal that the seizures and ataxia of Stargazer mutants occur in the context of a more pervasive behavioral syndrome with elements of encephalopathy, repetitive behavior and anhedonia. These findings expand our understanding of the function of Cacng2/CACNG2, variants in which have been identified in patients with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spontaneous behavioural recovery following stroke relates to the integrity of sensory and association cortices</a></h4>

              
                Stroke is a devastating disease that results in neurological deficits and represents a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Following a stroke, there is a degree of spontaneous recovery of function, the neural basis of which is of great interest among clinicians in their efforts to reduce disability following stroke and enhance rehabilitation. Conventionally, work on spontaneous recovery has tended to focus on the neural reorganization of motor cortical regions, with comparably little attention being paid to changes in non-motor regions and how these relate to recovery. Here we show, using structural neuroimaging in a macaque stroke model and by exploiting individual differences in spontaneous behavioural recovery, that the preservation of regions in the sensory and association cortices predict animal recovery. To characterize recovery, we performed a clustering analysis using Non-Human Primate Stroke Scale (NHPSS) scores and identified a good versus poor recovery group. By comparing the preservation of brain volumes in the two groups, we found that brain areas in integrity of brain areas in parietal, temporal and somatosensory cortex were associated with better recovery. In addition, a decoding approach performed across all subjects revealed that the preservation of specific brain regions in the parietal, somatosensory and medial frontal cortex predicted recovery. Together, these findings highlight the importance of the sensory and association regions in spontaneous behavioural recovery, supporting the notion that the sensory retraining of impairments following stroke is critical to recovery and motor function.

Among the many advantages of such recordings is that they dramatically increase the quantity of identifiable, functional connections between neurons thereby providing an unprecedented view of local circuit interactions. Using high-density, Neuropixels recordings from single neocortical columns of primary visual cortex in nonhuman primates, we identified 1000s of functionally connected neuronal pairs using established crosscorrelation approaches. Our results reveal clear and systematic variations in the strength and synchrony of functional connections across the cortical column. Despite neurons residing within the same column, both measures of functional connectivity depended heavily on the vertical distance separating neuronal pairs, as well as on the similarity of stimulus tuning. In addition, we leveraged the statistical power afforded by the large numbers of connected pairs to categorize functional connections between neurons based on their crosscorrelation functions. These analyses identified distinct, putative classes of functional connections within the full population. These classes of functional connections were corroborated by their unique distributions across defined laminar compartments and were consistent with known properties of V1 cortical circuitry, such as the lead-lag relationship between simple and complex cells. Our results provide a clear proof-of-principle for the use of high-density neurophysiological recordings to assess circuit-level interactions within local neuronal networks.

	<p>Background: Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a psychiatric disorder characterized by excessive preoccupation with imagined defects in appearance. Optical illusions induce illusory effects that distort the presented stimulus, thus leading to ambiguous percepts. Using electroencephalography (EEG), we investigated whether BDD is related to differentiated perception during illusory percepts. Methods: A total of 18 BDD patients and 18 controls were presented with 39 optical illusions together with a statement testing whether or not they perceived the illusion. After a delay period, they were prompted to answer whether the statement was right/wrong and their degree of confidence in their answer. We investigated differences of BDD patients on task performance and self-reported confidence and analyzed the brain oscillations during decision-making using nonparametric cluster statistics. Results: Behaviorally, the BDD group exhibited reduced confidence when responding incorrectly, potentially attributed to higher levels of doubt. Electrophysiologically, the BDD group showed significantly reduced alpha power at the fronto-central and parietal scalp areas, suggesting impaired allocation of attention. Interestingly, the lower the alpha power of the identified cluster, the higher the BDD severity, as assessed by BDD psychometrics. Conclusions: Results evidenced that alpha power during illusory processing might serve as a quantitative EEG biomarker of BDD, potentially associated with reduced inhibition of task-irrelevant areas.</p>

	<p>Tongue pressure measurement (TPM) is an indicator of oral function. However, the association between tongue pressure and cerebral activation remains unclear. We used near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to examine the correlation between cerebral cortex activation and tongue pressure stimulation against the anterior palatal mucosa. We measured voluntary maximum tongue pressure (MTP) using a TPM device; a pressure value of approximately 60% of the MTP was used for the experimental tongue pressure (MTP60%). We examined the effect of oral functional tongue pressure stimulation against the anterior palatal mucosa on cerebral activation using NIRS in 13 adults. Tongue pressure stimulation caused significant changes in cerebral blood flow in some areas compared with controls (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). We performed a correlation analysis (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) between MTP60% and changes in oxygenated hemoglobin in all 47 NIRS channels. MTP60% triggered activation of the right somatosensory motor area and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and deactivation of the anterior prefrontal cortex (APFC). TPM balloon-probe insertion in the oral cavity activated the bilateral somatosensory motor area and deactivated the wide area of the APFC. Moreover, MTP60% via the TPM balloon probe activated the bilateral somatosensory and motor cortex areas. Tongue pressure stimulation changes cerebral blood flow, and NIRS is useful in investigating the relationship between oral stimulation and brain function.</p>

	<p>Background: Elevated admission glucose and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels have been suggested to be associated with 90-day functional outcomes in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with endovascular thrombectomy (EVT). However, whether the prognostic significance of admission glucose and that of HbA1c have a joint effect on patients with intravascular thrombolysis (IVT) and/or EVT remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the association between admission glucose combined with HbA1c and outcomes in patients with reperfusion therapy. Methods: Consecutive AIS patients treated with IVT and/or EVT between 2 January 2018 and 27 February 2021 in West China hospital were enrolled. Admission glucose and HbA1c levels were measured at admission. Participants were divided into four groups according to admission glucose level (categorical variable: &amp;amp;lt;7.8 and &amp;amp;ge;7.8 mmol/L) and HbA1c level (categorical variable: &amp;amp;lt;6.5% and &amp;amp;ge;6.5%): normal glucose and normal HbA1c (NGNA), normal glucose and high HbA1c (NGHA), high glucose and normal HbA1c (HGNA), and high glucose and high HbA1c (HGHA). The primary outcome was an unfavorable functional outcome defined as a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) &amp;amp;ge; 3. The secondary outcome was all-cause mortality at 90 days. Results: A total of 519 patients (mean age, 69.0 &amp;amp;plusmn; 13.4 years; 53.8% males) were included. Patients in the HGHA group had a significantly increased risk of unfavorable functional outcome (OR, 1.81; 95%CI, 1.01&amp;amp;ndash;3.23) and mortality (OR, 1.75; 95%CI, 1.01&amp;amp;ndash;3.06) at 90 days compared with those in the NGNA group after adjustment for confounders. There was no significant association between NGHA (OR, 0.43; 95%CI, 0.12&amp;amp;ndash;1.53) or HGNA (OR, 1.46; 95%CI, 0.84&amp;amp;ndash;2.56) and outcomes compared to the NGNA group. Conclusion: The combination of high admission glucose and high HbA1c level was significantly associated with unfavorable functional outcome and mortality at 90 days in AIS patients with reperfusion therapy.</p>

	<p>Objectives: In this retrospective study, we investigated how spasticity developed in patients diagnosed with a prolonged DOC over an almost two-year observation period (21 months), and how it related to the patients&amp;amp;rsquo; age, gender, time since injury, etiology, level of consciousness, and anti-spastic medications. Methods: In total, 19 patients with a severe brain injury and prolonged DOC admitted to a long-term care facility were included in this study (14 male, age: 45.8 &amp;amp;plusmn; 15.3 years, 10 traumatic brain injury, 1.01 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.99 years after brain injury, 11 minimally conscious state vs. 8 vegetative state). Each patient was assessed at admission and then quarterly, totaling eight assessments over 21 months. Spasticity was measured with the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) for both upper and lower limbs. The Western Neuro Sensory Stimulation Profile (WNSSP) was administered to assess the level of consciousness. Any other medical and demographic information of interest was obtained through medical records. Linear mixed models were used to assess each variable&amp;amp;rsquo;s impact on the change of spasticity over time. Results: Significant differences were observed in the evolution of spasticity in patients based on their etiology for the upper limbs [F (7, 107.29) = 2.226; p = 0.038], and on their level of consciousness for the lower limbs [F (7, 107.07) = 3.196; p = 0.004]. Conclusion: Our preliminary results suggest that spasticity evolves differently according to the type of brain lesion and the level of consciousness. Spasticity in DOCs might therefore be mediated by different mechanisms and might have to be treated differently among patients. Future longitudinal studies should be performed prospectively in a bigger cohort and with data collection beginning earlier after brain injury to confirm our results and better understand the evolution of spasticity in this population.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Endovascular Thrombectomy versus Medical Management in Isolated M2 Occlusions: Pooled Patient‐Level Analysis from the EXTEND‐IA Trials, INSPIRE and SELECT Studies</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To evaluate functional and safety outcomes of Endovascular thrombectomy(EVT) vs Medical Management(MM) in patients with M2 occlusion and examine their association with perfusion imaging mismatch and stroke severity.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In a pooled, patient-level analysis of 3 randomized controlled trials(EXTEND-IA, EXTEND-IA-TNK part 1&2) and 2 prospective non-randomized studies(INSPIRE&SELECT), we evaluated EVT association with 90-day functional independence(mRS 0-2) in isolated M2 occlusions as compared to medical management overall and in subgroups by mismatch profile status and stroke severity.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 517 patients(EVT=195, MM=322), baseline median(IQR) NIHSS was 13(8-19) in EVT vs 10(6-15) in MM, p&lt;0.001. Pre-treatment ischemic core did not differ(EVT=10(0-24)mL vs MM=9(3-21)mL, p=0.59). Compared to MM, EVT was more frequently associated with functional independence(68.3% vs 61.6%, aOR=2.42,95%CI=1.25-4.67, p=0.008,IPTW-OR=1.75,95% CI=1.00-3.75,p=0.05) with a shift towards better mRS outcomes(adjusted cOR=2.02,95%CI:1.23-3.29,p=0.005), and lower mortality(5% vs 10%, aOR=0.32,95%CI=0.12-0.87,p=0.025). EVT was associated with higher functional independence in patients with a perfusion mismatch profile(EVT=70.7% vs MM=61.3%, aOR=2.29, 95%CI=1.09-4.79,p=0.029, IPTW-OR=2.02,1.08-3.78,p=0.029), whereas no difference was found in those without mismatch(EVT=43.8% vs MM=62.7%,p=0.17, IPTW-OR: 0.71,95% CI=0.18-2.78,p=0.62). Functional independence was more frequent with EVT in patients with moderate or severe strokes, as defined by baseline NIHSS above any thresholds from 6-10, whereas there was no difference between groups with milder strokes below these thresholds.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In patients with M2 occlusion, EVT was associated with improved clinical outcomes when compared to medical management. This association was primarily observed in patients with a mismatch profile and those with higher stroke severity.</p>

                Natural killer (NK) cells eliminate virus-infected cells. Hammer et al. show that SARS-CoV-2 encodes for a peptide that does not bind to an inhibitory receptor of NK cells, thereby facilitating NK cell activation. This missing self recognition could enable NK cells to detect and kill SARS-CoV-2-infected cells.

                Kaufmann et al. show that BCG vaccination protects mice and hamsters against influenza, but not SARS-CoV-2. The distinct tropism of SARS-CoV-2 for pulmonary endothelial cells may lead to lung hemorrhage and systemic viral dissemination. Thus, the protection of BCG against viral pathogens is mainly determined by pathogenesis of infections.

                Size homeostasis is one of the most fundamental aspects of biology and it is particularly important for large cells as neurons. We have previously proposed a motor-dependent length-sensing and growth-regulating mechanism wherein a partial reduction in the levels of microtubule motor proteins should lead to accelerated neuronal growth. This prediction was originally validated in sensory neurons heterozygous for the Loa point mutation in dynein heavy chain 1 (Dync1h1Loa). Here we describe a new mouse model with a conditional allele allowing deletion of exons 24-25 in Dync1h1. Homozygous Islet1-Cre deletion of Dync1h1 is embryonic lethal, but heterozygous animals (Isl1-Dync1h1+/-) survive to adulthood with approximately 50% dynein expression in targeted cell types. Isl1-Dync1h1+/- adult sensory neurons reveal an accelerated growth phenotype, similar to that previously reported in Dync1h1Loa neurons. Moreover, Isl1-Dync1h1+/- mice show mild impairments in gait, proprioception and tactile sensation; and slightly impaired recovery from peripheral nerve injury. Thus, conditional deletion of Dync1h1 exons 24-25 enables targeted studies of the role of dynein in neuronal growth and neurological disorders.

                The thalamus is the principal information hub of the vertebrate brain, with essential roles in sensory and motor information processing, attention, and memory. The molecular mechanisms regulating the formation of thalamic nuclei are unclear. We apply longitudinal single-cell RNA-sequencing, regional abrogation of Sonic-hedgehog (Shh), and spatial profiling of gene expression to map the developmental trajectories of thalamic progenitors, intermediate progenitors, and post-mitotic neurons as they coalesce into distinct thalamic nuclei. These data reveal that the complex architecture of the thalamus is established early during embryonic brain development through the coordinated action of four cell differentiation lineages derived from Shh-dependent and independent progenitors. We systematically characterize the gene expression programs that define these lineages across time and demonstrate how their disruption upon Shh depletion causes pronounced locomotor impairment resembling infantile Parkinson's disease. These results reveal key principles of thalamic development and provide mechanistic insights into neurodevelopmental disorders resulting from thalamic dysfunction.

                Infant avoidance and aggression are promoted by activation of the Urocortin-3 expressing neurons of the perifornical area of hypothalamus (PeFAUcn3) in male and female mice. PeFAUcn3 neurons have been implicated in stress, and stress is known to reduce maternal behavior. We asked how chronic restraint stress (CRS) affects infant-directed behavior in virgin and lactating females and what role PeFAUcn3 neurons play in this process. Here we show that infant-directed behavior increases activity in the PeFAUcn3 neurons in virgin and lactating females. Chemogenetic inhibition of PeFAUcn3 neurons facilitates pup retrieval in virgin females. CRS reduces pup retrieval in virgin females and increases activity of PeFAUcn3 neurons, while CRS does not affect maternal behavior in mothers. Inhibition of PeFAUcn3 neurons blocks stress-induced deficits in pup-directed behavior in virgin females. Together, these data illustrate the critical role for PeFAUcn3 neuronal activity in mediating the impact of chronic stress on female infant-directed behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Synaptic Location Is a Determinant of the Detrimental Effects of α-Synuclein Pathology to Glutamatergic Transmission in the Basolateral Amygdala</a></h4>

              
                Alpha-synuclein (aSyn) is a soluble protein enriched at presynaptic boutons and its abnormal aggregation is a hallmark of Parkinsons disease (PD). The amygdala shows selective vulnerability to the formation of insoluble aSyn aggregates, and its circuit dysfunction may contribute to prevalent psychiatric deficits in PD. Yet, how aSyn aggregates affect the amygdala function remains elusive. In the present study, we examined the presence of aSyn in glutamatergic axon terminals and how its aggregation affects glutamatergic transmission in the basolateral amygdala (BLA). Using confocal microscopy, we showed that aSyn is primarily present in the axon terminals expressing vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGluT1), but not in those expressing vGluT2. Using electrophysiology and optogenetics, we found that glutamatergic neurotransmission from vGluT1+ axon terminals are functionally more vulnerable than vGluT2+ axon terminals to the toxic effects of pathological aSyn aggregation triggered by aSyn preformed fibrils (PFFs). Using the PFFs models and mouse genetics, we showed that loss of aSyn promotes short-term depression of cortico-BLA synapses responding to repetitive stimuli, leading to an input-selective filtering of cortical inputs to the BLA. Together, we demonstrate that aSyn expresses specifically in a subset of synapses in mouse amygdala, which causes an input-specific decrease of cortical inputs to the BLA as aSyn aggregation forms. These results might be relevant to the reduced cortical control of amygdala function that has been associated with psychiatric deficits in PD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Kir6.2-containing KATP channels are necessary for glucose dependent increases in amyloid-beta and Alzheimer's-related pathology</a></h4>

              
                Increased neuronal excitability contributes to amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) production and aggregation in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. Previous work from our lab demonstrated that hyperglycemia, or elevated blood glucose levels, increased brain excitability and A{beta} release potentially through inward rectifying, ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels. KATP channels are present on several different cell types and help to maintain excitatory thresholds throughout the brain. KATP channels are sensitive to changes in the metabolic environment, which are coupled to changes in cellular excitability. Therefore, we hypothesized that neuronal KATP channels are necessary for the hyperglycemic-dependent increases in extracellular A{beta} and eliminating KATP channel activity will uncouple the relationship between metabolism, excitability, and A{beta} pathology. First, we demonstrate that Kir6.2/KCNJ11, the pore forming subunits, and SUR1/ABCC8, the sulfonylurea receptors, are predominantly expressed on excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the human brain and that cortical expression of KCNJ11 and ABCC8 change with AD pathology in humans and rodent models. Next, we crossed APP/PS1 mice with Kir6.2 -/- mice, which lack neuronal KATP channel activity, to define the relationship between KATP channels, A{beta}, and hyperglycemia. Using in vivo microdialysis and hyperglycemic clamps, we explored how acute elevations in peripheral blood glucose levels impacted hippocampal interstitial fluid (ISF) glucose, lactate, and A{beta} levels in APP/PS1 mice with or without KATP channels. Kir6.2+/+, APP/PS1 mice and Kir6.2-/-, APP/PS1 mice were exposed to a high sucrose diet for 6 months to determine the effects of chronic hyperglycemia on A{beta} deposition. We found that elevations in blood glucose levels correlate with increased ISF A{beta}, amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP), and amyloid plaque pathology in APP/PS mice with intact KATP channels. However, neither acute hyperglycemia nor chronic sucrose overconsumption raised ISF A{beta} or increased A{beta} plaque burden in APP/PS1 mice lacking Kir6.2-KATP channel activity. Mechanistic studies demonstrate ISF glucose not only correlates with ISF A{beta} but also ISF lactate. Without KATP channel activity, ISF lactate does not increase during hyperglycemia, which correlates with decreased monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) expression, a lactate transporter responsible for astrocytic lactate release. This suggests that KATP channel activity regulates ISF lactate during hyperglycemia, which is important for A{beta} release and aggregation. These studies identify a new role for Kir6.2-KATP channels in Alzheimer's disease pathology and suggest that pharmacological antagonism of Kir6.2-KATP channels holds therapeutic promise in reducing A{beta} pathology, especially in diabetic and prediabetic patients.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Measuring brain beats: cardiac-aligned fast fMRI signals</a></h4>

              
                Blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pulse and flow throughout the brain, driven by the cardiac cycle. These fluid dynamics, which are essential to healthy brain function, are characterized by several noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods. Recent developments in fast MRI, specifically simultaneous multislice (SMS) acquisition methods, provide a new opportunity to rapidly and broadly assess cardiac-driven flow, including CSF spaces, surface vessels and parenchymal vessels. We use these techniques to assess blood and CSF flow dynamics in brief (3.5 minute) scans on a conventional 3T MRI scanner. Cardiac pulses are measured with a photoplethysmograph (PPG) on the index finger, along with fMRI signals in the brain. We retrospectively analyze the fMRI signals gated to the heart beat. Highly reliable cardiac-gated fMRI temporal signals are observed in CSF and blood on the timescale of one heartbeat (test-retest reliability within subjects R2>0.50). Cardiac pulsations with a local minimum following systole are observed in blood vessels, with earlier extrema in the carotid and basilar arteries and in branches of the anterior, posterior and middle cerebral arteries and extrema ~200 ms later in the superior sagittal, transverse and straight sinuses. CSF spaces in the ventricles and subarachnoid space showed cardiac pulsations with a local maximum following systole instead. Similar responses are observed, with less temporal detail, in slower resting state scans with slice timing retrospectively aligned to the cardiac pulse in the same manner. The SMS measurements rapidly, noninvasively and reliably sample brain-wide fMRI signal pulsations aligned to the heartbeat. The measurements estimate the amplitude and phase of cardiac driven fMRI pulsations in the CSF relative to those in the arteries, which is thought to be an estimate of the local intracranial impedance. Cardiac aligned fMRI signals can provide new insights about fluid dynamics or diagnostics for diseases where these dynamics are important.

                Integrating physiology with structural insights of the same neuronal circuit provides a unique approach to understanding how the mammalian brain computes information. However, combining the techniques that provide both streams of data represents an experimental challenge. When studying glomerular column circuits in the mouse olfactory bulb, this approach involves e.g. recording the neuronal activity with in vivo 2-photon (2P) calcium imaging, retrieving the circuit structure with synchrotron X-ray computed tomography with propagation-based phase contrast (SXRT) and/or serial block-face electron microscopy (SBEM) and correlating these datasets. Sample preparation and dataset correlation are two key bottlenecks in this correlative workflow. Here, we first quantify the occurrence of different artefacts when staining tissue slices with heavy metals to generate X-ray or electron contrast. We report improvements in the staining procedure, ultimately achieving perfect staining in ~67% of the 0.6 mm thick olfactory bulb slices that were previously imaged in vivo with 2P. Secondly, we characterise the accuracy of the spatial correlation between functional and structural datasets. We demonstrate that direct, single-cell precise correlation between in vivo 2P and SXRT tissue volumes is possible and as reliable as correlating between 2P and SBEM. Altogether, these results pave the way for experiments that require retrieving physiology, circuit structure and synaptic signatures in targeted regions. These correlative function-structure studies will bring a more complete understanding of mammalian olfactory processing across length scales and time.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Network communication models narrow the gap between the modular organization of structural and functional brain networks</a></h4>

              
                Structural and functional brain networks are modular. Canonical functional systems, such as the default mode network, are well-known modules of the human brain and have been implicated in a large number of cognitive, behavioral and clinical processes. However, modules delineated in structural brain networks inferred from tractography generally do not recapitulate canonical functional systems. Neuroimaging evidence suggests that functional connectivity between regions in the same systems is not always underpinned by anatomical connections. As such, direct structural connectivity alone would be insufficient to characterize the functional modular organization of the brain. Here, we demonstrate that augmenting structural brain networks with models of indirect (polysynaptic) communication unveils a modular network architecture that more closely resembles the brain's established functional systems. We find that diffusion models of polysynaptic connectivity, particularly communicability, narrow the gap between the modular organization of structural and functional brain networks by 20-60%, whereas routing models based on single efficient paths do not improve mesoscopic structure-function correspondence. This suggests that functional modules emerge from the constraints imposed by local network structure that facilitates diffusive neural communication. Our work establishes the importance of modeling polysynaptic communication to understand the structural basis of functional systems.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Unsupervised physiological noise correction of fMRI data using phase and magnitude information (PREPAIR)</a></h4>

              
                Of the sources of noise which affect BOLD fMRI, respiration and cardiac fluctuations are responsible for the largest part of the variance, particularly at high and ultra-high field. Existing approaches to removing physiological noise either use external recordings, which can be unwieldy and unreliable, or attempt to identify physiological noise from the magnitude fMRI data. Data-driven approaches are limited by sensitivity, temporal aliasing and the need for user interaction. In the light of the sensitivity of the phase of the MR signal to local changes in the field stemming from physiological processes, we have developed an unsupervised physiological noise correction method which uses the information carried in both the phase and the magnitude of EPI data. Our technique, Physiological Regressor Estimation from Phase and mAgnItude, sub-tR (PREPAIR) derives time series signals which are sampled at the slice TR from both phase and magnitude images. It allows physiological noise to be captured without aliasing, and efficiently removes other sources of signal fluctuations which are not related to physiology, prior to regressor estimation. We demonstrate that the physiological signal time courses identified with PREPAIR not only agree well with those from external devices, but also retrieve challenging cardiac dynamics. The removal of physiological noise was as effective as that achieved with the most commonly used approach based on external recordings, RETROICOR. In comparison with widely used physiological noise correction tools which do not use external signals, PESTICA and FIX, PREPAIR removed more respiratory and cardiac noise and achieved a larger increase in tSNR at both 3 T and 7 T.

                Optical marker-less hand-tracking systems incorporated into virtual reality (VR) headsets are transforming the ability to assess motor skills, including hand movements, in VR. This promises to have far-reaching implications for the increased applicability of VR across scientific, industrial and clinical settings. However, so far, there is little data regarding the accuracy, delay and overall performance of these types of hand-tracking systems. Here we present a novel methodological framework which can be easily applied to measure these systems' absolute positional error, temporal delay and finger joint-angle accuracy. We used this framework to evaluate the Meta Quest 2 hand-tracking system. Our results showed an average fingertip positional error of 1.1 cm, an average finger joint angle error of 9.6{degrees} and an average temporal delay of 38.0 ms. Finally, a novel approach was developed to correct for these positional errors based on a lens distortion model. This methodological framework provides a powerful tool to ensure the reliability and validity of data originating from VR-based, marker-less hand-tracking systems.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cardiac and gastric interoception have distinct neural substrates</a></h4>

              
                The functional roles of interoception or senses that arise from within the body have been thought to guide the agents in adaptive behavior by informing of various bodily states such as a heart rate or energy status. However, direct evidence that the different types of interoception are processed or represented differently in the human brain is still lacking. Here, we directly compared the neural activation for cardiac (awareness related to heartbeats) and gastric (awareness related to stomach) interoception in the same population (N = 31) where the participants were asked to focus on sensations of their heart and stomach in the magnetic resonance imaging scanner. The result showed that neural activation underlying gastric interoception encompassed the sensorimotor and reward-related regions when compared to cardiac interoception, including the occipitotemporal visual cortices, bilateral primary motor cortex, primary somatosensory cortex, left orbitofrontal cortex, and bilateral hippocampal regions. Conversely, cardiac interoception selectively activated the right frontal operculum/insula in contrast to gastric interoception. Moreover, we found that the left dorsal middle insula encoded cardiac and gastric interoception differently but the posterior insula was not by performing multivoxel pattern analysis. Our results demonstrated that cardiac and gastric interoception, different types of bodily awareness, have distinct neural substrates particularly relevant to the functions for each interoception for the first time.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Prefrontally Modulated Vagal Tone Inhibits Inflammatory Responses to Prevent Telomere Damage in Healthy Participants</a></h4>

              
                Background: Accumulated senescent cells are proposed to be one of the main drivers of age-related pathology through disruption of tissue structure and function. We recently proposed the Neuro-Immuno-Senescence Integrative Model (NISIM; Ask et al., 2018) which relates prefrontally modulated vagal tone and subsequent balance between vagal and sympathetic input to the spleen to inflammatory responses leading to generation of reactive oxygen species and oxidative telomere damage. The NISIM is based on converging evidence and argues for the existence of a prefrontal cortex-autonomic nervous system-spleen (PAS) axis, suggesting that the inflammation that induces reactive oxygen species-generation is downstream of this axis. Aim: In this study, we aim to assess inflammation as a mediator in the relationship between prefrontally modulated vagal tone and leukocyte telomere length to test the hypothesis that PAS axis dysregulation accelerates cellular aging. We also assess the relationship between a recently proposed index of vagal immunomodulation (vagal tone/inflammation ratio; NIM index; Gidron et al., 2018) and telomere length, and compare results between the NIM index and vagal tone as predictors of telomere length. Methods: This study uses participant data from a large nationally representative longitudinal study since 1974 with a total of 45,000 Norwegian residents so far. A sub-sample of 1372 participants from which vagal tone, C Reactive Protein, and leukocyte telomere length could be obtained were included in the study. Relationships were analyzed with hierarchical multiple linear regression using either vagal tone and C Reactive Protein or the NIM index to predict telomere length. Sleeping problems, tobacco use status, alcohol use status, time since last meal, and symptoms of depression were included as control variables. Results: In the mediation analysis, vagal tone was a significant positive predictor of telomere length, while C Reactive Protein was a significant negative predictor of telomere length. This relationship remained significant when individually controlling for some but not all confounding variables. The NIM index was a significant positive predictor of telomere length. This relationship remained significant when controlling for all confounding variables except one. In a reduced dataset excluding all participants where confounders were present, the NIM index remained a significant predictor of telomere length. Conclusion: This is the first study suggesting that PAS axis activity is associated with telomere length thus supporting the NISIM. Results indicate that the NIM index is a more sensitive indicator of PAS axis activity than vagal tone and C Reactive Protein in isolation. Clinical relevance and suggestions for future research are discussed.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Long noncoding RNA MEG3 activates neuronal necroptosis in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal cell loss is a defining feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but it remains unclear how neurons die and how this relates to other defining characteristics of the disease. Existing in vivo AD models only partially recapitulate the neuropathology of AD with very mild or no neuronal cell loss. Here we demonstrate that human neurons xenografted in mouse brain exposed to amyloid pathology develop sarkosyl-insoluble tau filaments, positive Gallyas silver staining, release phosphorylated tau (P-tau181) into the blood, and display considerable neuronal cell loss, providing a model for the induction of full Tau pathology by simple exposure to amyloid pathology in AD. The alterations are specific to human neurons and contrast with the mild effects exhibited in mouse neurons. A core transcriptional program in the human neurons is characterized by strong upregulation of MEG3, a neuron-specific long noncoding RNA. MEG3 is also strongly upregulated in neurons from AD patients in situ. MEG3 expression alone is sufficient to induce necroptosis in human neurons in vitro. Orally administered small molecule receptor-interacting protein (RIP) kinase -1 and -3 inhibitors rescued the neuronal cell loss in this novel AD model. Thus, xenografted human neurons are uniquely sensitive to amyloid pathology, recapitulate all the defining neuropathological features of AD, and ultimately die by necroptosis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ethanol exposure alters Alzheimer's-related pathology, behavior, and metabolism</a></h4>

              
                Epidemiological studies suggest that alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet the mechanisms underlying this relationship are poorly understood. Preclinical studies consistently show that chronic, high dose ethanol exposure increases amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) and tau pathology, hallmarks of AD, in rodent models. Conversely, other studies suggest that moderate ethanol consumption may also be protective against AD-related pathology. Thus, we used a modified two-bottle choice paradigm to identify how chronic ethanol exposure, at moderate levels, alters A{beta}-related pathology, cognitive performance, and metabolism. Over the course of the experiment, APP/PS1 mice consumed more ethanol than wild-type mice. This led to changes in food and water consumption in APP/PS1 mice, where ethanol-exposed APP/PS1 mice displayed a circadian shift in eating behavior. Ethanol-exposed APP/PS1 mice displayed glucose intolerance, a marker of insulin resistance, even though fasting blood glucose levels and body weights were comparable across all groups. Ethanol-exposed APP/PS1 mice exhibited deficits in nest building, a metric of self-care, as well as increased locomotor activity and central zone exploration in an open field test. Ethanol exposure also led to decreased brain mass, specifically in APP/PS1 mice, suggesting an interaction between ethanol exposure, amyloid pathology, and neurodegeneration. While there was a trend towards increased cortical A{beta} deposition, there was a shift in the distribution of plaque size and numbers, with ethanol-exposed APP/PS1 mice showing a greater number of smaller plaques than H2O-exposed APP/PS1 mice. Finally, we used in vivo microdialysis to explore whether acute ethanol modulates hippocampal interstitial fluid (ISF) A{beta} and ISF glucose levels in unrestrained, APP/PS1 mice. Acute intraperitoneal injection of ethanol led to a rapid rise in ISF ethanol and directly ISF A{beta} (e.g. decreasing during acute exposure and increasing during acute withdrawal), and ISF glucose levels in the hippocampus. Together, these studies indicate that chronic ethanol, even at moderate doses, is sufficient to exacerbate an Alzheimer's-like phenotype in APP/PS1 mice through the direct modulation of A{beta}.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Exploring the link between Parkinson's disease and Diabetes Mellitus in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disease characterized by high levels of glucose in blood. Recent epidemiological studies are highlighting the link between both diseases; it is even considered that DM might be a risk factor for PD. To further investigate the likely relation of these diseases, we have used a Drosophila PD model based on inactivation of the DJ-1{beta} gene (ortholog of human DJ-1), and diet-induced Drosophila and mouse T2DM models, together with human neuron-like cells. T2DM models were obtained by feeding flies with a high sugar containing medium, and mice with a high fat diet. Our results showed that both fly models exhibit common phenotypes such as alterations in carbohydrate homeostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction or motor defects, among others. In addition, we demonstrated that T2DM might be a risk factor of developing PD since our diet-induced fly and mouse T2DM models present DA neurodegeneration, a hallmark of PD. We have also confirmed that neurodegeneration is caused by increased glucose levels, which has detrimental effects in human neuron-like cells by triggering apoptosis and leading to cell death. Besides, the observed phenotypes were exacerbated in DJ-1{beta} mutants cultured in the high sugared medium, indicating that DJ-1 might have a role in carbohydrate homeostasis. Finally, we have confirmed that metformin, an antidiabetic drug, is a potential candidate for PD treatment and that it could prevent PD onset in T2DM model flies. This result supports antidiabetic drugs as promising PD therapeutics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Representational dynamics of memories for real-life events</a></h4>

              
                The continuous flow of experience that characterizes real-life events is not recorded as such in episodic memory. The unfolding of events is represented as a succession of moments of prior experience (referred to as "experience units") that are separated by temporal discontinuities, such that events are temporally compressed when remembered. To unravel the neural basis of this temporal structure of episodic memories, we recorded a series of real-life events using wearable camera technology and then used fMRI to investigate brain activity during the temporal unfolding of these events in memory. We found that, compared to the representation of static scenes in memory, dynamically unfolding memory representations were associated with greater activation of posterior brain regions that support episodic recollection (i.e., the precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex, retrosplenial cortex, and angular gyrus). Strikingly, by analyzing the autocorrelation of brain activity patterns at successive time points throughout the retrieval period, we found that these brain regions showed higher temporal dynamics when remembering the unfolding of events compared to static scenes. Furthermore, these effects were more pronounced when recalling events that included a higher density of experience units (i.e., actions compared to spatial displacements). These results reveal the key role of the posterior medial network in representing the dynamic unfolding of event segments that constitute episodic memories.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reduced sensorimotor beta dynamics could represent a "slowed movement state" in healthy individuals</a></h4>

              
                Beta oscillations (~13-30 Hz) recorded from the sensorimotor cortex have canonical amplitude changes during movement. Specifically, a movement-related beta decrease (MRBD) occurs before movement, and a post-movement beta rebound (PMBR) follows. We investigated how the MRBD and PMBR vary with movement speed. Individuals performed a task with blocks that generated longer reaction times (RTs) and shorter RTs (Slow and Fast blocks, respectively) while scalp-electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. The timing of task events before movement was also modulated to generate blocks with certain and uncertain timing (Fixed and Varied blocks, respectively). Beta modulation was reduced in Slow blocks compared to Fast blocks (i.e., a less negative MRBD and less positive PMBR). For the movement certainty manipulation, we saw mixed behavioral and EEG results. Our primary findings align with previous work which has shown reduced movement-related beta modulation in patients with Parkinson's disease. We propose that a "slowed movement state", whether it is experimentally induced or a manifestation of Parkinson's disease bradykinesia, is represented through reduced beta dynamics. Altogether, the MRBD and PMBR may represent motor speed on a continuum with Parkinson's disease as an extreme example of slowed movement.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Active haptic training improves somatosensory-motor feedback control in the motor skills of experts</a></h4>

              
                A common problem experts experience is the challenge of overcoming the ceiling effects of highly trained sensorimotor skills. Recent studies have demonstrated that the amount of practice fails to explain interindividual variation in experts' motor expertise, implicating hidden bottlenecks that prevent experts from overcoming this ceiling. Here, we show that somatosensory function in motion is one that defines further improvement of the sensorimotor skills of expert pianists. We found that even in expert pianists, specialized training that was designed to enhance somatosensory perception in motion improved sensorimotor skills in which feedback, but not feedforward, control plays a predominant role. Furthermore, training increased reliance on afferent information in motion relative to predictive information that could originate from internal models of movement. Together, these findings suggest that enhancement of somatosensory processing in motion improves the somatosensory-motor feedback loop and thereby enabling experts to surpass the ceiling that initially limited their motor expertise.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The impact of familiarity on cortical taste coding</a></h4>

              
                The role of the gustatory region of the insular cortex in mediating associative taste learning, such as conditioned taste aversion, has been well studied. However, while associative learning plays a role in some taste behaviors, such as avoidance of toxins, taste stimuli are often encountered by animals in their natural environment without explicit consequences. This type of inconsequential experience with sensory stimuli has been studied in other sensory systems, generally with the finding that neuronal responses habituate with repeated sensory exposure. The present study sought to determine the effect of taste familiarity on population taste coding in mouse gustatory cortex (GC). Using microendoscope calcium imaging, we studied the taste responses of visually identifiable neurons over five days of taste experience, during which animals could freely choose to consume taste stimuli. We found that the number of active cells in insular cortex, as well as the number of cells characterized as taste-responsive, significantly decreased as animals became familiar with taste stimuli. Moreover, the magnitude of taste-evoked excited responses increased, and inhibited responses decreased with experience. By tracking individual neurons over time, we focused on taste coding in a subpopulation of "stable" neurons that were present on all days of the taste familiarity paradigm. The population-level response across these stable cells was distinct when taste stimuli were novel but became more intercorrelated among those taste stimuli mice willingly consumed as the stimuli became familiar. Overall, these results highlight the effects of familiarity on taste responses in gustatory cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The virtual aging brain: a model-driven explanation for cognitive decline in older subjects</a></h4>

              
                Healthy aging is accompanied by heterogeneous decline of cognitive abilities among individuals, especially during senescence. The mechanisms of this variability are not understood, but have been associated with the reorganization of white matter fiber tracts and the functional co-activations of brain regions. Here, we built a causal inference framework to provide mechanistic insight into the link between structural connectivity and brain function, informed by brain imaging data and network modeling. By applying various degrees of interhemispheric degradation of structural connectivity, we were not only able to reproduce the age-related decline in interhemispheric functional communication and the associated dynamical flexibility, but we obtained an increase of global modulation of structural connectivity over the brain function during senescence. Notably, the increase in modulation between structural connectivity and brian function was higher in magnitude and steeper in its increase in older adults with poor cognitive performance. We independently validated the causal hypothesis of our framework via a Bayesian approach based on deep-learning. The current results might be the first mechanistic demonstration of dedifferentiation and scaffolding during aging leading to cognitive decline demonstrated in a large cohort.
