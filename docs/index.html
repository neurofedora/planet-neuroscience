              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21277">More than a feeling: Expressive style influences cortical speech tracking in subjective cognitive decline</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.21277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) approximately doubles the risk of progressing to MCI and dementia. The present study investigates how one's subjective concerns of his/her own cognition are manifested in the neural dynamics during speech perception. EEG was collected from 56 Cantonese, cognitively normal older adults (aged 60 - 70) while they listened to stimuli of four expressive styles that varied in prosody: scrambled, descriptive, dialogue, and exciting. Using encoding models to predict EEG signals from acoustic, segmentation, and phonotactic features, we found that greater subjective concern was associated with weaker cortical tracking of (1) higher-level linguistic features but not acoustic features and (2) less engaging stimuli (scrambled and descriptive styles) but not prosodically rich stimuli. Overall, our results suggest that early signs of cognitive impairment can be revealed from speech perception via cortical tracking, especially while listening to prosodically flat speech.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20916">Cross-Linguistic Analysis of Memory Load in Sentence Comprehension: Linear Distance and Structural Density</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.20916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines whether sentence-level memory load in comprehension is better explained by linear proximity between syntactically related words or by the structural density of the intervening material. Building on locality-based accounts and cross-linguistic evidence for dependency length minimization, the work advances Intervener Complexity-the number of intervening heads between a head and its dependent-as a structurally grounded lens that refines linear distance measures. Using harmonized dependency treebanks and a mixed-effects framework across multiple languages, the analysis jointly evaluates sentence length, dependency length, and Intervener Complexity as predictors of the Memory-load measure. Studies in Psycholinguistics have reported the contributions of feature interference and misbinding to memory load during processing. For this study, I operationalized sentence-level memory load as the linear sum of feature misbinding and feature interference for tractability; current evidence does not establish that their cognitive contributions combine additively. All three factors are positively associated with memory load, with sentence length exerting the broadest influence and Intervener Complexity offering explanatory power beyond linear distance. Conceptually, the findings reconcile linear and hierarchical perspectives on locality by treating dependency length as an important surface signature while identifying intervening heads as a more proximate indicator of integration and maintenance demands. Methodologically, the study illustrates how UD-based graph measures and cross-linguistic mixed-effects modelling can disentangle linear and structural contributions to processing efficiency, providing a principled path for evaluating competing theories of memory load in sentence comprehension.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16080">Interpretable Embeddings of Speech Enhance and Explain Brain Encoding Performance of Audio Models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.16080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speech foundation models (SFMs) are increasingly hailed as powerful computational models of human speech perception. However, since their representations are inherently black-box, it remains unclear what drives their alignment with brain responses. To remedy this, we built linear encoding models from six interpretable feature families: mel-spectrogram, Gabor filter bank features, speech presence, phonetic, syntactic, and semantic features, and contextualized embeddings from three state-of-the-art SFMs (Whisper, HuBERT, WavLM), quantifying electrocorticography (ECoG) response variance shared between feature classes. Variance-partitioning analyses revealed several key insights: First, the SFMs' alignment with the brain can be mostly explained by their ability to learn and encode simple interpretable speech features. Second, SFMs exhibit a systematic trade-off between encoding of brain-relevant low-level and high-level features across layers. Finally, our results show that SFMs learn brain-relevant semantics which cannot be explained by lower-level speech features, with this capacity increasing with model size and context length. Together, our findings suggest a principled approach to build more interpretable, accurate, and efficient encoding models of the brain by augmenting SFM embeddings with interpretable features.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01360">A Quotient Homology Theory of Representation in Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.01360v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous research has proven that the set of maps implemented by neural networks with a ReLU activation function is identical to the set of piecewise linear continuous maps. Furthermore, such networks induce a hyperplane arrangement splitting the input domain of the network into convex polyhedra $G_J$ over which a network $\Phi$ operates in an affine manner.
  In this work, we leverage these properties to define an equivalence class $\sim_\Phi$ on top of an input dataset, which can be split into two sets related to the local rank of $\Phi_J$ and the intersections $\cap \text{Im}\Phi_{J_i}$. We refer to the latter as the \textit{overlap decomposition} $\mathcal{O}_\Phi$ and prove that if the intersections between each polyhedron and an input manifold are convex, the homology groups of neural representations are isomorphic to quotient homology groups $H_k(\Phi(\mathcal{M})) \simeq H_k(\mathcal{M}/\mathcal{O}_\Phi)$. This lets us intrinsically calculate the Betti numbers of neural representations without the choice of an external metric. We develop methods to numerically compute the overlap decomposition through linear programming and a union-find algorithm.
  Using this framework, we perform several experiments on toy datasets showing that, compared to standard persistent homology, our overlap homology-based computation of Betti numbers tracks purely topological rather than geometric features. Finally, we study the evolution of the overlap decomposition during training on several classification problems while varying network width and depth and discuss some shortcomings of our method.

                arXiv:2508.16509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to quantify information transmission is crucial for the analysis and design of natural and engineered systems. The information transmission rate is the fundamental measure for systems with time-varying signals, yet computing it is extremely challenging. In particular, the rate cannot be obtained directly from experimental time-series data without approximations, because of the high dimensionality of the signal trajectory space. Path Weight Sampling (PWS) is a computational technique that makes it possible to obtain the information rate exactly for any stochastic system. However, it requires a mathematical model of the system of interest, be it described by a master equation or a set of differential equations. Here, we present a technique that employs Machine Learning (ML) to develop a generative model from experimental time-series data, which is then combined with PWS to obtain the information rate. We demonstrate the accuracy of this technique, called ML-PWS, by comparing its results on synthetic time-series data generated from a non-linear model against ground-truth results obtained by applying PWS directly to the same model. We illustrate the utility of ML-PWS by applying it to neuronal time-series data.

Abstract: We study the problem of building an efficient learning system. Efficient learning processes information in the least time, i.e., building a system that reaches a desired error threshold with the least number of observations. Building upon least action principles from physics, we derive classic learning algorithms, Bellman's optimality equation in reinforcement learning, and the Adam optimizer in generative models from first principles, i.e., the Learning $\textit{Lagrangian}$. We postulate that learning searches for stationary paths in the Lagrangian, and learning algorithms are derivable by seeking the stationary trajectories.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16735">A Theoretical Perspective on Why Stochastic Population Update Needs an Archive in Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.16735v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been widely applied to multi-objective optimization due to their population-based nature. Population update, a key component in multi-objective EAs (MOEAs), is usually performed in a greedy, deterministic manner. However, recent studies have questioned this practice and shown that stochastic population update (SPU), which allows inferior solutions have a chance to be preserved, can help MOEAs jump out of local optima more easily. Nevertheless, SPU risks losing high-quality solutions, potentially requiring a large population. Intuitively, a possible solution to this issue is to introduce an archive that stores the best solutions ever found. In this paper, we theoretically show that using an archive allows a small population and may enhance the search performance of SPU-based MOEAs. We examine two classic algorithms, SMS-EMOA and NSGA-II, on the bi-objective problem OneJumpZeroJump, and prove that using an archive can reduce the expected running time upper bound (even exponentially). The comparison between SMS-EMOA and NSGA-II also suggests that the $(\mu+\mu)$ update mode may be more suitable for SPU than the $(\mu+1)$ update mode. We also validate our findings empirically. We hope this work may provide theoretical support to explore different ideas of designing algorithms in evolutionary multi-objective optimization.

                arXiv:2509.18659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biological systems possess remarkable capabilities for self-recognition and morphological regeneration, often relying solely on local interactions. Inspired by these decentralized processes, we present a novel system of physical 3D bricks--simple cubic units equipped with local communication, processing, and sensing--that are capable of inferring their global shape class and detecting structural damage. Leveraging Neural Cellular Automata (NCA), a learned, fully-distributed algorithm, our system enables each module to independently execute the same neural network without access to any global state or positioning information. We demonstrate the ability of collections of hundreds of these cellular bricks to accurately classify a variety of 3D shapes through purely local interactions. The approach shows strong robustness to out-of-distribution shape variations and high tolerance to communication faults and failed modules. In addition to shape inference, the same decentralized framework is extended to detect missing or damaged components, allowing the collective to localize structural disruptions and to guide a recovery process. This work provides a physical realization of large-scale, decentralized self-recognition and damage detection, advancing the potential of robust, adaptive, and bio-inspired modular systems.

                arXiv:2506.03996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a new generation of energy-efficient neural networks suitable for implementation on neuromorphic hardware. As neuromorphic hardware has limited memory and computing resources, weight pruning and quantization have recently been explored to improve SNNs' efficiency. State-of-the-art SNN pruning/quantization methods employ multiple compression and training iterations, increasing the cost for pre-trained or very large SNNs. In this paper, we propose a new one-shot post-training pruning/quantization framework, Spiking Brain Compression (SBC), that extends the Optimal Brain Compression (OBC) method to SNNs. SBC replaces the current-based loss found in OBC with a spike train-based objective whose Hessian is cheaply computable, allowing a single backward pass to prune or quantize synapses and analytically rescale the rest. Our experiments on models trained with neuromorphic datasets (N-MNIST, CIFAR10-DVS, DVS128-Gesture) and large static datasets (CIFAR-100, ImageNet) show state-of-the-art results for one-shot post-training compression methods on SNNs, with single-digit to double-digit accuracy gains compared to OBC. SBC also approaches the accuracy of costly iterative methods, while cutting compression time by 2-3 orders of magnitude.

Abstract: Safety is an essential requirement for reinforcement learning systems. The newly emerging framework of robust constrained Markov decision processes allows learning policies that satisfy long-term constraints while providing guarantees under epistemic uncertainty. This paper presents mirror descent policy optimisation for robust constrained Markov decision processes (RCMDPs), making use of policy gradient techniques to optimise both the policy (as a maximiser) and the transition kernel (as an adversarial minimiser) on the Lagrangian representing a constrained MDP. Our proposed algorithm obtains an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(1/T^{1/3}\right)$ convergence rate in the sample-based RCMDP setting. In addition to the RCMDP setting, the paper also contributes an algorithm for approximate gradient descent in the space of transition kernels, which is of independent interest for designing adversarial environments. Experiments confirm the benefits of mirror descent policy optimisation in constrained and unconstrained optimisation, and significant improvements are observed in robustness tests when compared to baseline policy optimisation algorithms.

                arXiv:2509.20269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As deep neural networks are increasingly deployed in dynamic, real-world environments, relying on a single static model is often insufficient. Changes in input data distributions caused by sensor drift or lighting variations necessitate continual model adaptation. In this paper, we propose a hybrid training methodology that enables efficient on-device domain adaptation by combining the strengths of Backpropagation and Predictive Coding. The method begins with a deep neural network trained offline using Backpropagation to achieve high initial performance. Subsequently, Predictive Coding is employed for online adaptation, allowing the model to recover accuracy lost due to shifts in the input data distribution. This approach leverages the robustness of Backpropagation for initial representation learning and the computational efficiency of Predictive Coding for continual learning, making it particularly well-suited for resource-constrained edge devices or future neuromorphic accelerators. Experimental results on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate that this hybrid strategy enables effective adaptation with a reduced computational overhead, offering a promising solution for maintaining model performance in dynamic environments.

">Effects of Cholesterol Modulation on Cisplatin-Induced Hearing Loss</a></h4>

              
                Cisplatin is a widely used and effective anticancer drug. However, it causes permanent sensorineural hearing loss in over 50% of treated patients. There are no FDA-approved therapies to prevent cisplatin-induced hearing loss (CIHL) in adults, highlighting a critical unmet clinical need. Previous studies suggest that statins, commonly prescribed cholesterol-lowering drugs, are associated with reduced incidence and severity of cisplatin-induced hearing loss. Statins are primarily used to lower cholesterol, but they also exert several pleiotropic effects, making the mechanism(s) underlying this protection unclear. Here we examine whether reduced plasma cholesterol confers protection against CIHL independent of statin treatment. We utilized mice lacking serine protease proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (Pcsk9 knockout (KO) mice) as a genetic model of reduced plasma cholesterol. We find that Pcsk9 KO mice are protected against cisplatin-induced hearing loss, as reflected by significantly lower ABR and DPOAE threshold shifts relative to wild type (WT) mice following treatment. Histological analyses confirmed preservation of cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs) in Pcsk9 KO mice treated with cisplatin, whereas WT mice showed significant OHC loss in the high-frequency cochlear regions. Finally, hearing loss positively correlated with baseline plasma cholesterol levels. Together our data demonstrate that systemic cholesterol reduction provides significant protection against CIHL, and they suggest that the protective effect of statins against CIHL is mediated by cholesterol reduction.

                <p>When compared with nature sounds, exposure to mechanical sounds evokes higher levels of perceptual and physiological arousal, prompting the recruitment of attentional and physiological resources to elicit adaptive responses. However, it is unclear whether these attributes are solely related to the sound intensity of mechanical sounds, since in most real-world scenarios, mechanical sounds are present at high intensities or if other acoustic or semantic factors are also at play. We measured the skin conductance response (SCR), reflecting sympathetic nervous system activity as well as the pleasantness and eventfulness of the soundscape across two passive and active listening tasks in healthy subjects (<I>N</I> = 25; 14 females, 11 males). The auditory stimuli were divided into two categories, nature and mechanical sounds, and were manipulated to vary in three perceived loudness levels. As expected, we found that the sound category influenced perceived soundscape pleasantness and eventfulness. SCR was analyzed by taking the mean level across the stimulus epoch and also by quantifying its dynamics. We found that mean SCR was modulated by loudness only. SCR rise-time (a measure of the time it takes the skin response to increase from the baseline to its maximum value) correlated significantly with soundscape pleasantness and eventfulness for nature and mechanical sounds. This study highlights the importance of considering both the loudness level and sound category in evaluating the perceptual soundscape, and it identifies SCR as a valuable tool for such assessments.</p>

                <p>Rhythmic network states have been theorized to facilitate communication between brain regions, but how these oscillations influence communication subspaces, i.e., the low-dimensional neural activity patterns that mediate interregional communication, and in turn how subspaces impact behavior remain unclear. Using a spatial memory task in rats (male Long&ndash;Evans rats), we simultaneously recorded ensembles from hippocampal CA1 and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to address this question. We found that task behaviors best aligned with low-dimensional, shared subspaces between these regions rather than local activity in either region. Critically, both network oscillations and speed modulated the structure and performance of this communication subspace. To understand the communication space, we visualized shared CA1&ndash;PFC communication geometry using manifold techniques and found ring-like structures. We hypothesize that these shared activity manifolds are utilized to mediate the task behavior. These findings suggest that memory-guided behaviors are driven by shared CA1&ndash;PFC interactions that are dynamically modulated by oscillatory states, offering a novel perspective on the interplay between rhythms and behaviorally relevant neural communication.</p>

Drug effects are difficult to investigate in detail <i>in vivo</i>. However, a mechanistic understanding of drug action is clearly beneficial for both pharmaceutical development as well as for optimization of treatment designs. We here established a quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) mouse model which simultaneously describes whole-body pharmacokinetics of murine IFN-α as well as the cellular pharmacodynamic effect through the antiviral response biomarker Mx2. To this end, a dynamic model of intracellular IFN-α signalling in the JAK/STAT pathway was combined with a whole-body physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model of IFN-α in mice. The pharmacodynamic behaviour of the resulting mouse IFN-α QSP model was first compared to a cellular model of the JAK/STAT pathway to compare <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> drug effects and to identify functional differences. It was found that the <i>in vitro</i> drug effect in the cellular model overestimates the <i>in vivo</i> response in mice at least by a factor of two which is partly due to the missing drug clearance <i>in vitro</i>. Also, the drug responses in the <i>in vitro</i> model were time delayed. Interspecies analyses in murine and a previously published human QSP model of IFN-α next show a similar dynamic behavior. However, our models demonstrate eight to 16-fold stronger response levels in mice than in humans due to more efficient interferon binding. Our analysis supports a mechanistic analysis of both upstream pharmacokinetic as well as downstream pharmacodynamic drug effects through the combination of physiological knowledge and quantitative computational models. The study hence shows potential applications for QSP modelling in terms of study planning, for example by choosing physiologically relevant in vitro concentrations. Also, the QSP model allows inter-species comparisons of the effect strength in specific functional readouts, which in humans are otherwise not possible due to the limited sampling possibilities. We expect QSP modelling to play an increasingly important role in drug development and research in the future.

                <p>by Tianyong Yao, Ruby Kim</p>

Dopamine (DA) plays a vital role in mood, alertness, and behavior, with dysregulation linked to disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, ADHD, depression, and addiction. In this study, we develop and analyze a reduced mathematical model of dopamine synthesis, release, and reuptake to investigate how daily rhythms influence dopamine dynamics and the efficacy of dopamine reuptake inhibitors (DRIs) used in the treatment of various neuropsychiatric conditions. We simplify a detailed mathematical model of dopamine synthesis, release, and reuptake and demonstrate that our reduced system maintains key dynamical features including homeostatic regulation via autoreceptors. Our model captures core autoregulatory mechanisms and reveals that DRIs can exert substantial time-of-day effects, allowing for dopamine levels to be sustained at elevated levels when administered at circadian troughs. These fluctuations depend sensitively on the timing of DRI administration relative to circadian variations in enzyme activity. We further extend the model to incorporate feedback from local dopaminergic tone, which generates ultradian oscillations in the model independent of circadian regulation. Administration of DRIs lengthens the ultradian periodicity. Our findings provide strong evidence that intrinsic fluctuations in DA should be considered in the clinical use of DRIs, offering a mechanistic framework for improving chronotherapeutic strategies targeting dopaminergic dysfunction.

                <p>by Zhiqiang Ma, Ran Chen, Zibo Feng</p>
Background <p>Circulating proteins play a critical role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), yet few have been targeted therapeutically. This study aimed to identify novel protein targets for RA therapy.</p> Methods <p>We conducted a comprehensive proteome-wide Mendelian Randomization (MR), colocalization analysis, and summary-data-based MR (SMR) to explore potential causal relationships between plasma proteins and RA, with an overall sample size of 1,148,608. The GWAS data on plasma proteins were obtained from the FinnGen study, the UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project and Iceland GWAS data. Then, validation of key molecules’ differential expression pattern was done using external transcriptomic data from RA patients, while the Drug Signatures Database (DsigDB) was used to identify potential therapeutic drugs. Drugs and target proteins interactions was evaluated with molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations approaches. Potential side effects of plasma proteins associated with RA were elucidated by phenome-wide association study (Phe-WAS) approach.</p> Results <p>Genetically predicted levels of 68 plasma proteins were associated with RA. After colocalization and SMR analysis, 6 plasma proteins (FCRL3, SUGP1, TNFAIP3, EHBP1, HAPLN4, and CILP2) have been passed all tests and identified as having potential as therapeutic targets for RA. Further Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis indicated that three protiens (CILP2, TNFAIP3 and EHBP) have a good potential as biomarkers for RA. Differential gene analysis showed the downregulation of HAPLN4, FCRL3, EHBP1 and TNFAIP3 in RA, as well as the upregulation of CILP2 in RA. Further Phe-WAS suggested that targeting these proteins may have potential side effects.</p> Conclusion <p>Our study investigated the causal relationships between plasma proteins and RA, deepening our understanding of the molecular mechanisms and facilitating the development of new therapeutic drugs.</p>

                <p>by Baiwei Liu, Siyang Kong, Freek van Ede</p>

The N2pc is a popular human-neuroscience marker of covert and internal spatial attention that occurs 200–300 ms after being prompted to shift attention—a time window also characterized by the spatial biasing of small fixational eye movements known as microsaccades. Here, we show how co-occurring microsaccades profoundly modulate N2pc amplitude during top-down shifts of spatial attention in both perception and working memory. At the same time, we show that a significant—albeit severely weakened—N2pc can still be established in the absence of co-occurring microsaccades. Moreover, despite the strong modulation of the N2pc by microsaccade presence and direction, the N2pc does not align to the precise timing of microsaccades, ruling out that the observed N2pc modulations by microsaccades are a direct artifact of microsaccade-related eye-muscle activity, corneo-retinal dipole movement, or visual inputs moving over the retina. Thus, while microsaccades strongly modulate N2pc amplitude, microsaccades themselves are not a prerequisite for, nor a direct cause of, the N2pc.

The liver circadian clock and hepatic transcriptome are highly responsive to metabolic signals generated from feeding–fasting rhythm. Previous studies have identified a number of nutrient-sensitive signaling pathways that could interpret metabolic input to regulate rhythmic hepatic biology. Here, we investigated the role of O-GlcNAcylation, a nutrient-sensitive post-translational modification (PTM) in mediating metabolic regulation of rhythmic biology in the liver. We observe daily oscillation of global nuclear protein O-GlcNAcylation in the liver of mice subjected to night-restricted feeding (NRF) using label-free global O-GlcNAc proteomics. Additional site-specific O-GlcNAc analysis by tandem mass tag mass spectrometry further supports temporal differences in O-GlcNAcylation by revealing day–night differences. Proteins involved in gene expression are enriched among rhythmically O-GlcNAcylated proteins, suggesting rhythmic O-GlcNAcylation may directly regulate the hepatic transcriptome. We show that rhythmic O-GlcNAcylation can also indirectly modulate nuclear proteins by interacting with phosphorylation. Several proteins harboring O-GlcNAcylation-phosphorylation interplay motif exhibit rhythmic O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation. Specifically, we show that O-GlcNAcylation occurs at a phospho-degron of a key circadian transcriptional activator, circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK), thus regulating its stability and transcriptional output. Finally, we report that day-restricted feeding (DRF) in the nocturnal mouse significantly alters O-GlcNAcylation pattern. Whereas global O-GlcNAcylation analysis indicates dampening of global O-GlcNAcylation rhythm in mice fed under DRF, site-specific analysis reveals differential responses of O-GlcNAc sites when timing of food intake is altered. Notably, a substantial number of O-GlcNAcylation sites exhibit inverted day–night profiles when mice are subjected to DRF. This suggests the dysregulation of daily nuclear protein O-GlcNAcylation rhythm may contribute to the disruption in liver transcriptome previously observed in DRF condition. In summary, our results provide new mechanistic insights into metabolic regulation of hepatic transcriptional regulators via interplay between O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation and shed light on the deleterious effects of improper mealtimes.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003396">Cross‐species rescue reveals sequence requirements for a rapidly evolving intrinsically disordered region</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sang On Park, Rishad Khondker, Ariel Blank, Annie Dyatel, Corey Frazer, Richard J. Bennett, Robert J. Reid, Rodney J. Rothstein, Luke E. Berchowitz</p>

Many proteins contain intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) that are essential for their function but do not adopt a stable structure; instead, they exist as an ensemble of conformations. Because these regions lack fixed structural constraints, traditional structure-based and alignment-based approaches are often ineffective for studying their sequence–function relationships. Here, we present an approach that combines molecular evolution with genetic complementation to extract functional sequence features of an IDR. We use the budding yeast RNA-binding protein Rim4 as a model system. Rim4 is required for sporulation, and its IDR facilitates its dual role as a translational activator and repressor. Notably, Rim4’s IDR supports assembly into an SDS-resistant amyloid-like form, which is required for its repressor function. We demonstrate that the Rim4 IDR is functionally conserved across orthologous sequences spanning more than 400 million years of evolution, despite extensive sequence divergence. Our results suggest that noncomplementing Rim4 IDRs generally evolve toward higher hydrophobicity, and that reducing hydrophobicity can refunctionalize a nonfunctional IDR sequence that diverged over 200 million years ago. In the refunctionalized IDR, the activator function is restored, whereas assembly into an amyloid-like form remains uncomplemented. Overall, our findings add to evidence that IDRs can perform multiple functions, with each role optimized by distinct biochemical properties, and that evolutionary pressure favoring one function may drive the IDR toward biochemical characteristics that compromise its other functions.

                Ali et al. demonstrate that the neuropeptide ADM plays an important role in regulating GSC-macrophage symbiosis in GBM. EGFR-driven ADM promotes GSC self-renewal, macrophage infiltration, and pro-tumor reprogramming via the ADMR-STAT3/STAT6 pathway. Blocking this signaling axis disrupts the symbiosis and inhibits tumor growth in GBM mouse and PDX models.

                Newton et al. establish PERK as a copper-regulated kinase. The copper dependency of PERK kinase activity is characterized in vitro utilizing glutathione pull-down assays, kinase assays, and CETSA. The physiological implications of this regulatory paradigm for the modulation of ER stress tolerance are demonstrated in cellular and animal models.

                <p>Nature Photonics, Published online: 25 September 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-025-01764-4">doi:10.1038/s41566-025-01764-4</a></p>Thermodynamic-like phenomena in optics are a nascent yet elusive route to control light flow. By emulating Joule–Thomson expansion in synthetic photonic lattices, it is now possible to funnel light universally into a single output, regardless of the input.

Specifically, light launched into any input port of a nonlinear array is universally channelled into a tightly localized ground state. The principles of optical thermodynamics demonstrated may enable new optical functionalities.

                This study investigated 17α-estradiol’s effects on aged hypothalamic physiological activity via long-term administration. Single-nucleus transcriptomic sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on pooled hypothalami from each group: aged male Norway brown rats treated with 17α-estradiol (O.T), aged controls (O), and young controls (Y). Supervised clustering of neurons (based on neuropeptides/receptors) evaluated subtype responses to aging and 17α-estradiol. Aging-induced elevation of neuronal cellular metabolism, stress, and reduced synapse formation-related pathways were significantly attenuated by 17α-estradiol. Neuron population analysis showed that subtypes regulating food intake, reproduction, blood pressure, stress response, and electrolyte balance were sensitive to 17α-estradiol. 17α-estradiol increased serum oxytocin (Oxt) and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis activity (elevated plasma Gnrh, total testosterone; reduced estradiol). Gnrh1 upregulation mediated its effects on energy homeostasis, neural synapse, and stress response. Notably, <i>Crh</i> neurons in O.T showed prominent stress phenotypes, distinct from <i>Agrp/Ghrl</i> neurons. Thus, HPG axis and energy metabolism may be key 17α-estradiol targets in male hypothalamus. Additionally, our results demonstrate that supervised clustering (based on neuropeptides/receptors) effectively assesses the responses of hypothalamic neuron subtypes to aging and 17α-estradiol treatment.

                Glutamatergic synapses form the vast majority of connections within neuronal circuits, but how these subcellular structures are molecularly organized within the mammalian brain is poorly understood. Conventional electron microscopy using chemically fixed, metal-stained tissue has identified a proteinaceous, membrane-associated thickening called the ‘postsynaptic density’ (PSD). Here, we combined mouse genetics and cryo-electron tomography to determine the 3D molecular architecture of fresh isolated and anatomically intact synapses in the adult forebrain. The native glutamatergic synapse did not consistently show a higher density of proteins at the postsynaptic membrane, thought to be characteristic of the PSD. Instead, a ‘synaptoplasm’ consisting of cytoskeletal elements, macromolecular complexes, and membrane-bound organelles extended throughout the pre- and post-synaptic compartments. Snapshots of active processes gave insights into membrane remodeling processes. Clusters of up to 60 ionotropic glutamate receptors were positioned inside and outside the synaptic cleft. Together, these information-rich tomographic maps present a detailed molecular framework for the coordinated activity of synapses in the adult mammalian brain.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98624">Segment-specific axon guidance by Wnt/Fz signaling diversifies motor commands in Drosophila larvae</a></h4>

              
                Functional diversification of homologous neuronal microcircuits is a widespread feature observed across brain regions, as well as across species, while its molecular and developmental mechanisms remain largely unknown. We address this question in <i>Drosophila</i> larvae by focusing on segmentally homologous Wave command-like neurons, which diversify their wiring and function in a segment-specific manner. Anterior Wave (a-Wave) neurons extend axons anteriorly and connect to circuits inducing backward locomotion, whereas posterior Wave (p-Wave) neurons extend axons posteriorly and trigger forward locomotion. Here, we show that Frizzled receptors DFz2 and DFz4, together with the DWnt4 ligand, regulate the segment-specific Wave axon projection. <i>DFz2</i> knockdown (KD) not only reroutes Wave axons to posterior neuromeres but also biases its motor command to induce forward instead of backward locomotion as tactile response. Thus, segment-specific axon guidance diversifies the function of homologous command neurons in behavioral regulation. Since control of anterior-posterior (A-P) axon guidance by Wnt/Fz signaling is evolutionarily conserved, our results reveal a potentially universal molecular principle for formation and diversification of the command system in the nerve cord. Furthermore, this work indicates that sensorimotor transduction can be rerouted by manipulating a single gene in a single class of neurons, potentially facilitating the evolutionary flexibility in action selection.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100687">Steady-state neuron-predominant LINE-1 encoded ORF1p protein and LINE-1 RNA increase with aging in the mouse and human brain</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies have established a reciprocal causal link between aging and the activation of transposable elements, characterized in particular by a de-repression of LINE-1 retrotransposons. These LINE-1 elements represent 21% of the human genome, but only a minority of these sequences retain the coding potential essential for their mobility. LINE-1 encoded proteins can induce cell toxicity implicated in aging and neurodegenerative diseases. However, our knowledge of the expression and localization of LINE-1-encoded proteins in the central nervous system is limited. Using a novel approach combining atlas-based brain mapping with deep-learning algorithms on large-scale pyramidal brain images, we unveil a heterogeneous, neuron-predominant, and widespread ORF1p expression throughout the murine brain at steady-state. In aged mice, ORF1p expression increases significantly, which is corroborated in human post-mortem dopaminergic neurons by an increase in young LINE-1 elements including those with open reading frames. Mass spectrometry analysis of endogenous mouse ORF1p revealed novel, neuron-specific protein interactors. These findings contribute to a comprehensive description of the dynamics of LINE-1 and ORF1p expression in the brain at steady-state and in aging and provide insights on ORF1p protein interactions in the brain.

">Context-dependent presynaptic inhibition of somatostatin interneuron inputs to Layer 1 of the visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Layer 1 of the cortex is a critical site for integrating top-down inputs onto the distal dendrites of pyramidal neurons, where inhibitory neurons modulate these inputs to enable context-dependent sensory processing. Yet, it remains unclear how behavioral context dynamically regulates inhibition in Layer 1. We discover a circuit motif in which NDNF cortical interneurons (cINs) presynaptically inhibit the axonal outputs of somatostatin (SST) cINs in Layer 1 of the visual cortex. Using combinatorial genetics, monosynaptic retrograde tracing, super-resolution imaging, optogenetics, slice electrophysiology, and in vivo calcium imaging, we show that NDNF cINs form direct contacts onto SST axons and suppress their output, thereby modulating inhibitory responses in L2/3 pyramidal neurons. This presynaptic inhibitory circuit is preferentially engaged during locomotion and low-contrast visual conditions. By dynamically modulating Layer 1-mediated inhibitory output onto pyramidal neurons, this circuit motif enables context-dependent modulation of visual processing.

">The functional organization of retrosplenial feedback to V1</a></h4>

              
                Cortical feedback from higher frontal and association areas to early sensory cortex is thought to contribute to a range of cognitive processes in which sensory signals are processed in a context sensitive manner. Despite the ubiquity of feedback circuitry in the cortex, the information carried by feedback connections, and the principles governing how it is targeted from area to area remains poorly understood. Here we characterized the functional properties of a prominent feedback circuit which links retrosplenial cortex (RSC) and primary visual cortex (V1). We found that RSC>V1 axons relay retinotopically selective signals to V1 which at a coarse scale match the region of the V1 retinotopic map innervated, were tuned for spatial and temporal frequency, but not tuned for orientation. Two-color imaging of RSC>V1 boutons and local L2/3 V1 neurons further revealed that at a finer scale RSC>V1 bouton receptive fields are systematically offset relative to those of V1 in the nasal direction, consistent with RSC>V1 boutons conveying signals predictive of upcoming V1 activity in the retinotopic region innervated during forward movement.

">CS - plasticity and behavioral-state integration in the posterior insula during auditory fear learning</a></h4>

              
                During fear learning, animals learn to associate sensory cues (conditioned stimulus, CS) with aversive outcomes, and neurons in several brain areas become entrained to the CS. The posterior insular cortex (pInsCx) contains representations of internal states and sensory cues, amongst them auditory stimuli. Nevertheless, the possibility of plastic encoding of auditory responses in the pInsCx during fear learning, and its underlying synaptic mechanisms have not been addressed. Using single-unit recordings in the pInsCx of male mice during fear learning, we find that ~ 10% of putative principal neurons acquire a response to an auditory CS during fear learning ("CS learners"). CS learners are enriched in the insula auditory field (IAF) of the dorsal pInsCx, and strongly overlap with a larger neuronal subpopulation which increases its activity during movement initiation. Using optogenetic circuit mapping, we find that the IAF receives glutamatergic synapses from the non-lemniscal auditory thalamus and the auditory cortex (A1); fear learning induces a postsynaptic form of LTP at the cortical, but not at the thalamic input synapse. Combined single-unit recordings and optogenetic axon silencing showed that the acquired CS-response during fear recall depends on transmission at the A1 [-&gt;] pInsCx synapse. Our study shows that the pInsCx generates a plastic representation of an auditory CS during fear learning, driven by LTP of an associative cortical input. Future work should further investigate how the integration of CS- and movement information in the insula contributes to the expression of auditory-cued fear memories.

                Memory engrams change on the microscopic level with time and experience as the neurons that compose them switch in a process termed representational drift. On the macroscopic level the engrams are not static either: numbers of engram neurons in different brain regions change over time, which is considered to reflect the process of memory consolidation. Here we predict a link between these two levels, using a novel statistical physics approach to engram modeling. Importantly, it is general as it makes only minimal assumptions on the engram's nature, does not rely on a specific architecture, and its fundamental implications hold for any representational drift with random component. Our first, analytically well tractable model shows that an entropic force emerges at the region level from random representational drift at the neuronal level. We refine the model by incorporating the interaction of the entropic force with biological processes that shape neuronal engrams. Here, the connectivity between the brain regions strongly influences the (quasi-)equilibrium engram distribution. The obtained distributions are in qualitative agreement with the ones of a biologically detailed drifting assembly model. Our engram description allows to predict the engram evolution in large neuronal systems such as the mouse brain. We find several predictions that are consistent across the valid tested parameter ranges, such as a strong tendency of the engram to leave the hippocampus. The results suggest that the brain operates in a regime where engrams drift, both deterministically and randomly, to allow for memory consolidation.

">Proteolytic cleavage of G3BP1 by calpain 1 couples NMDAR activation to mTOR-dependent local translation</a></h4>

              
                Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules are dynamic, membraneless organelles that sequester translationally repressed mRNAs and RNA-binding proteins, playing a pivotal role in the regulation of localized protein synthesis. While disassembly of RNP granules is essential for reactivating translation, the mechanisms by which neuronal activity regulates this process remain poorly understood. In this study, we show that stimulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR) triggers calcium influx, leading to activation of calpain 1 and subsequent proteolytic cleavage of Ras-GTPase-activating protein binding protein 1 (G3BP1), a core component of stress granules. This cleavage results in the disassembly of G3BP1 granules in the neurites and promotes mTOR-dependent local translation, thereby linking synaptic activity to spatially restricted protein synthesis. Finally, we demonstrate that the NMDAR-calpain 1-G3BP1-mTOR signaling axis contributes to axonal regeneration, establishing proteolytic remodeling of RNP granules as a key mechanism of activity-dependent neural repair, with potential implications for therapeutic intervention in brain injury.

">A specialized cold sensing system in the naked mole-rat</a></h4>

              
                Avoiding cold or seeking warmth are universal animal needs. Homeothermic mammals maintain a constant body temperature despite fluctuating ambient temperatures. One exception is the naked mole-rat which lacks effective thermogenesis. We show that the naked mole-rat has evolved a greatly expanded cold sensing system. Compared to mice, this species has many more cold-sensitive sensory neurons and most express the cold-activated TRPM8 channel. The naked mole-rat TrpM8 gene harbors a unique upstream exon that when translated produces a TRPM8 protein with a 71 amino acid N-terminal extension. When expressed, the N-terminal extension prevents membrane targeting and abolishes TRPM8 function. Splice forms lacking the extension formed functional cold and menthol activated channels in vivo. Additionally, many naked mole-rat sensory neurons use a TRPM8-independent mechanism to detect cold. Thus, we identified molecular changes that confer both sensitivity and flexibility to cold sensing in a species that is critically dependent on following thermal cues.

">Whole-genome DNA methylation profiling in COVID-19 positive patients reveals alterations in pathways linked to neurological dysfunction</a></h4>

              
                Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly transmissible RNA betacoronavirus, causing coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Infection with SARS-CoV-2 can result in a broad spectrum of clinical outcomes, ranging from asymptomatic or mild to a severe, deadly illness. Emerging evidence suggests SARS-CoV-2 affects host gene regulation through epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, potentially contributing to immune dysregulation and post-acute sequelae, including neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, the extent and functional relevance of these epigenetic changes remain uncertain. Methods and results We employed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing to profile DNA methylation in peripheral blood from SARS-CoV-2-positive patients across a spectrum of symptom severity, ranging from asymptomatic to severe (n=101), in comparison to SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals (n=105). We observed a widespread hypomethylation in the genomes of infected individuals, which was more pronounced in severe cases. Notably, we identified differentially methylated genes in patients with mild (19 genes), moderate (19 genes), and severe (35 genes) symptoms. These genes included those involved in canonical immune responses as well as known to be linked to neurodegenerative diseases. Subsequent pathway enrichment analysis further supported the significant association between the differentially methylated genes and those implicated in Alzheimers and Parkinsons disease, as well as neuropsychiatric conditions, suggesting potential epigenetic links between acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and long-term neurological outcomes. This is one of the first studies to comprehensively map severity-stratified genome-wide DNA methylation changes in COVID-19 patients. Conclusion Our findings underscore the potential importance of epigenetic regulation in the acute responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and highlight an overlap with epigenetic mechanisms relevant for neuropsychiatric disease processes.

">High-Fidelity Neural Speech Reconstruction through an Efficient Acoustic-Linguistic Dual-Pathway Framework</a></h4>

              
                Reconstructing speech from neural recordings is crucial for understanding speech coding and developing brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, existing methods trade off acoustic richness (pitch, prosody) for linguistic intelligibility (words, phonemes). To overcome this limitation, we propose a dual-path framework to concurrently decode acoustic and linguistic representations. The acoustic pathway uses a long-short term memory (LSTM) decoder and a high-fidelity generative adversarial network (HiFi-GAN) to reconstruct spectrotemporal features. The linguistic pathway employs a transformer adaptor and text-to-speech (TTS) generator for word tokens. These two pathways merge via voice cloning to combine both acoustic and linguistic validity. Using only 20 minutes of electrocorticography (ECoG) data per subject, our approach achieves highly intelligible synthesized speech (mean opinion score = 4.0/5.0, word error rate = 18.9%). Our dual-path framework reconstructs natural and intelligible speech from ECoG, resolving the acoustic-linguistic trade-off.

">Changing the Motivation for Mental Work with Temporal Interference Stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Successful goal-directed behavior often requires the exertion of effortful control processes. The striatum is thought to play a key role in determining whether a goal is worth the required cognitive effort, but whether and how the striatum causally influences effort-based decisions in humans remained unclear. Here, we address this gap by employing transcranial temporal interference stimulation (tTIS), a novel non-invasive brain stimulation technique capable of targeting deeper brain regions. We applied striatum-targeted tTIS to healthy participants performing an effort-based decision task during functional MRI scanning. Supporting the idea that the striatum encodes both the benefits and costs of actions, we found that, on the behavioral level, striatum-targeted tTIS increased the sensitivity to both reward magnitudes and effort costs. At the neural level, this was mirrored by stronger representations of effort demands in the striatum under stimulation as well as by enhanced functional coupling between the striatum and the anterior cingulate cortex, a region at the intersection of motivation and cognition. Together, our findings provide insights into the causal contributions of the striatum to trading-off rewards against effort costs, informing neural accounts of motivated cognition and suggesting novel neural interventions for the treatment of amotivation.

">Peripheral nerve-targeting and pain-promoting transcriptomic signatures in early Guillain-Barr&eacute syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Guillain-Barr&eacute syndrome (GBS) is an autoimmune disorder that causes weakness, sensory loss, autonomic dysfunction, and chronic neuropathic pain. The mediators responsible for driving early autoimmune injury in the most common GBS variant, acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP), remain incompletely understood. We performed bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing on peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from early untreated AIDP-variant GBS patients and healthy controls to comprehensively deduce leukocyte transcriptome alterations and predict disease-driving interactions between pathogenic leukocytes and peripheral nervous system cells. Bulk transcriptomics showed interferon- and JAK/STAT-driven proinflammatory signatures in myeloid cells. CD8+ T-cells were highly proliferative and expressed axon guidance genes. Single-cell transcriptomics revealed dysregulation of CD4+FOXP3+ regulatory and CD4+ effector memory T-cells indicative of poorly controlled type 1 and type 17 immune responses. Highly activated intermediate monocytes upregulated genes related to angiogenesis and oncostatin M. Interactome analysis between GBS leukocytes, Schwann cells, and sensory neurons predicted increased engagement of ligand-receptor pairs with nerve integrity and pain functions, including epiregulin, interferon-beta, adrenomedullin, clusterin, IL-6, IL-15, and CCL4. Functional validation demonstrated that CCL4 sensitizes human sensory neurons in vitro. These results unearth molecular interactions by which specific leukocyte populations in AIDP-variant GBS may induce peripheral nerve injury and drive neuropathic pain.

">RHO1-2 meganuclease gene editing targets human P23H rhodopsin-induced retinitis pigmentosa to rejuvenate rods and maintain cones</a></h4>

              
                Autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP) is an inherited retinal dystrophy characterized by progressive vision loss and eventual blindness. The P23H mutation (proline to histidine substitution at codon 23) in the rhodopsin (RHO) gene represents the most common form of adRP in North Americans. Currently, there is no cure for P23H adRP. Genome editing targeting the mutant RHO allele, leaving a functional wildtype (WT) allele, is an attractive approach for P23H adRP, as only one copy of RHO is needed for normal retinal function. We re-engineered an I-Cre meganuclease, called RHO1-2, to target a 22bp recognition sequence encompassing the mutation responsible for the p.P23H RHO mutation. In vitro, RHO1-2, cuts human P23H RHO but not WT RHO. In vivo, we delivered scAAV5:GRK1:RHO1-2 via subretinal injection in early-stage degeneration using the only large animal model of human p.P23H RHO adRP (TgP23H pigs). We tested RHO1-2 efficacy and durability, on retinal function using full-field electroretinograms and on retinal structure using spectral domain optical coherence tomography and immunohistochemistry. We observe that RHO1-2 treatment: arrests rod photoreceptor degeneration, resurrects rod-driven retinal function that does not exist in untreated TgP23H pigs, restores mislocalized rhodopsin expression and rebuilds rod inner and outer segments (IS/OS). Rod rescue maintains cones. A year after RHO1-2 treatment, we show that TgP23H pigs use rod-driven vision to navigate a maze. Our results demonstrate that genome editing via RHO1-2 meganuclease is a viable treatment to cure human p.P23H RHO adRP. They also suggest that meganuclease-based editors can be effective for other IRDs.

">Whole-Brain Models of Minimal Phenomenal Experience: Approaching Criticality through Jhana Meditation</a></h4>

              
                Minimal phenomenal experiences (MPE) provide a distinctive entry point for investigating consciousness and understanding how certain meditative practices may represent and contribute to human flourishing. Adopting a neurophenomenological stance, we combine first-person phenomenology with formal whole-brain modeling to ask what mechanisms underlie MPE states and the progression towards it, as reached through jh[a]na meditation, a type of advanced concentrative absorption meditation (ACAM-J). We used a dataset of advanced practitioners performing the eight ACAM-J states scanned in high-field functional magnetic resonance imaging. For each state, we build a mechanistic whole-brain model that reproduces brain activity by modeling the dynamical regimes of different resting-state networks. We found that the later ACAM-J states, taken here as candidates for MPE, show a shift of functional network dynamics toward near-bifurcation working points. The default mode network exhibits the largest shift, from a distant noise-driven regime at a control condition to near-critical dynamics. We also observed that the pathway to MPE is non-linear, with prominent reconfigurations at key meditative milestones. Our results suggest that MPE corresponds to a globally susceptible state where near-critical dynamics dominate. We interpret this critical regime as a form of "openness", where the usual hierarchical and heterogeneous patterns of brain activity give way to generalized flexibility. In this light, MPE provides both a minimal model of consciousness and a window into how advanced meditation can profoundly reshape brain dynamics.

">Vision dominates sound in mediating classic cue-induced microsaccadic eye movement modulations in rhesus macaque monkeys</a></h4>

              
                Visual onsets in the environment cause a short-latency reduction in saccade generation likelihood. Concomitant with that, the metrics of the saccades that do happen near the time of saccadic inhibition reflect the landscape of stimulus-driven neural responses in topographically organized brain maps. While certain aspects of saccadic inhibition have already been explored from a neurophysiological perspective, several questions remain, including which sensory-motor pathways propagate visual input information to the final oculomotor control circuitry with such short latencies. Here, motivated by evidence of a dissociation between temporal and spatial aspects of saccadic inhibition, we devised behavioral paradigms experimentally manipulating either aspect. Rhesus macaque monkeys maintained gaze fixation, and we characterized visually-driven microsaccadic inhibition with and without paired auditory pulses. In one condition, the sound pulses were spatially-unbiased, thus only affecting the temporal processes associated with microsaccadic inhibition; in another, the pulses were spatially-biased, affecting both the temporal and spatial components. We found that sound pulses alone barely affected microsaccade rates. However, when paired with visual stimuli, they accelerated the timing of visually-driven microsaccadic inhibition by ~14-18 ms. In terms of microsaccade directions, spatially-unbiased sounds interfered with, but did not eliminate, visually-driven direction modulations. Surprisingly, spatially-biased sounds had a much weaker effect on microsaccade direction modulations, even when the sound source was in the opposite hemifield as the appearing visual stimulus. We conclude that vision dominates sound in mediating classic microsaccadic inhibition, and we argue that our paradigms are ideal for neurophysiological investigations of the parallel sensory-motor pathways contributing to such inhibition.

                Background: Antibodies against amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) are the only therapies capable of slowing cognitive decline and reducing A{beta} plaque burden in Alzheimer disease (AD). Yet the precise sites where antibodies engage A{beta} in the brain, and the mechanisms that drive A{beta} clearance, are not fully defined. Defining the A{beta} antibody engagement with A{beta} in brain is essential to understand how immunotherapy can be beneficial for AD. Methods: We administered the well-establsihed N-terminal A{beta} antibody 6E10 via intrahippocampal (IH), cisterna magna (CM), or intraperitoneal (IP) injection in AD mouse models. N-terminal A{beta} antibodies were seen as most effective in AD mouse models. Antibody 6E10 was not only assessed in A{beta} plaques, but also examined in association with diverse brain cells and vascular compartments. Glymphatic dynamics were evaluated following A{beta} antibody treatment. Results: As expected, A{beta} antibody 6E10 bound to A{beta} plaques but remarkably also localized to vulnerable neurons, such as hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells, as well as microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, perivascular macrophages (PVMs), and blood vessels. Glymphatic function showed no significant alterations after antibody administration. Conclusions: A{beta} antibodies distribute not only to amyloid plaques but also to neurons, glial cells, and blood vessels. This study provides detailed localizations of antibody in the AD brain, offering valuable insights into cellular targets and spatial dynamics of A{beta} antibody-based immunotherapy.

">The turbulent brain: Modelling vortex interactions for understanding human cognition</a></h4>

              
                The human brain needs distributed, time-critical computation to efficiently solve complex problems. Turbulence provides such highly efficient spacetime information processing and transmission across wide-spread brain networks, yet we have been missing a mechanistic understanding of the interactions of turbulent vortices underlying human cognition. Here, we build the first whole-brain model of turbulent vortices as defined by the levels of local synchronisation in brain signals quantifying turbulent interactions in vortex space. Specifically, using large-scale human neuroimaging data, we found that the interactions of turbulent vortices is an excellent framework for understanding cognition and brain computation. It is not only useful for distinguishing the detailed spacetime dynamics of rest and cognition - but can even distinguish between subtle sub-components of cognitive tasks, where manipulation of vortices can be shown to change cognition. Overall, this whole-brain framework creates a natural vortex space for the brain computation underlying cognition, as well as potentially providing novel ways of controlling turbulent interactions in disease.

">A dNmnat-sensitized in vivo platform for unbiased discovery of regulators of neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                Axon degeneration drives nervous system dysfunction in diverse neurological diseases and injuries. While key regulators of injury-induced Wallerian degeneration have been identified, approaches have largely relied on axotomy, a particularly extreme injury for a neuron. Here, we developed a forward genetic screening platform in the adult Drosophila wing that sensitizes neurons to degeneration through depletion of nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (dNmnat), the essential NAD biosynthetic enzyme. We screened 9,393 mutagenized chromosomes and recovered 59 mutations that suppress neurodegeneration induced by dNmant depletion, including the known pro-degenerative molecule dSarm, thereby validating our approach. We show loss of CG4098, the Drosophila homolog of the mammalian enzyme NUDT9, robustly preserved axons and induced widespread remodeling of NAD-related metabolites, which provides a new link between cADP-ribose hydrolase activity and neuronal survival. We further show mutations in the transcription factor Abrupt resulted in elevated dNmnat protein levels and blocked axon degeneration, suggesting Abrupt normally tunes dNmnat levels and neuronal NAD homeostasis. dNmnat depletion is thus a versatile approach for unbiased discovery of axon death pathway components, each of which may provide new entry points for therapeutic strategies to preserve axons in neurodegenerative diseases.

">Exponential Map Models as an Interpretable Framework for Generating Neural Spatial Representations</a></h4>

              
                A fundamental challenge in neuroscience and AI is understanding how physical space is mapped into neural representations. While artificial neural networks can generate brain-like spatial representations, such as place and grid cells, their black-box nature makes it difficult to determine if these representations arise as general solutions or as artifacts of a chosen architecture, objective function, or training protocol. Critically, these models offer no guarantee that learned solutions for core navigational tasks, like path integration (updating position from self-motion), will generalize beyond their training data. To address these challenges, we introduce a first-principles framework based on an exponential map model. Instead of using deep networks or gradient optimization, the presented model uses generator matrices to map physical locations into neural representations through the matrix exponential, creating a transparent framework that allows us to identify several exact algebraic conditions underlying key properties of neural maps. We show that path invariance (ensuring location representations are independent of traversal route) is achieved if the generators commute, while translational invariance (maintaining consistent spatial relationships across locations) demands generators producing orthogonal transformations. We also show that preserving the metric of flat space requires the eigenvalues of the generator matrices to form sets of roots of unity. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed framework constructs diverse biologically relevant spatial tuning, including place cells, grid cells, and context-dependent remapping. The framework we propose thus offers a transparent, theoretically-grounded alternative to black-box models, revealing the exact conditions required for a coherent neural map of space.

">Integrative analysis reveals generalizable human neurodegenerative disease-associated glial states</a></h4>

              
                Disease-associated glia represent plastic transcriptional cellular states observed across neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). In particular, microglial states have been characterized in Alzheimer's disease and mouse models of amyloidosis. Although single-cell transcriptomic technologies have increased the dimensionality of information available across cell states, few studies have systematically tested for changes in glial transcription across brain regions and disease states. Here, we report a statistical framework for glial annotation, disease association, and transcriptional profiling, which facilitate identification of generalizable glial states that are present across a spectrum of NDDs (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and Frontotemporal dementia). We identify seven astrocyte substates, 14 microglia/myeloid substates, and five oligodendrocyte substates where transcriptional variability is attributable to region, disease, or batch effects. Regional heterogeneity of astrocytes masked disease associations, even within cortical astrocytes. We found only limited oligodendrocyte transcriptional heterogeneity, resulting in few substates for further interrogation. Notably, microglia showed the strongest evidence for disease association. We show, for the first time, that this association exists across the entire NDD spectrum. Using latent factor analysis, we created a consensus human neurodegenerative disease-associated microglia (hnDAM) signature, which we experimentally validated in 11 independent sample series. We demonstrate that the hnDAM signature is a statistically testable biomarker for conserved microglial activation in NDDs by: i) comparing to murine DAM-like signatures, ii) performing transcription factor analysis, and iii) modeling transcriptional reprogramming perturbations in iPSC-derived microglia. Taken together, this work broadens our understanding of glial activation across neuropathologies and reveals hnDAM as a putative therapeutic target that can be widely generalized to patients suffering from NDDs.

">From Correlation to Causation: Cell-Type-Specific Gene Regulatory Networks in Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves complex regulatory disruptions across multiple brain cell types, yet a comprehensive understanding of the intracellular causal mechanisms remains unclear. METHODS: We presented an integrative analysis framework using single-nucleus transcriptomic with matched subject-level genotype data from 272 human AD in the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) study, and constructed causality-based, cell-type-specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs). RESULTS: Our method identifies regulatory genes from both transcription factors (TFs) and non-TFs, thereby capturing a complete and accurate causal regulatory map across different brain cell types. This work revealed both established and novel regulations, pathways, and cell-type-unique hub genes in AD. Beyond constructing transcriptome-wide GRNs, we quantitatively assessed hub genes and distinguished those with regulatory or responsive roles. DISCUSSION: Our study provides a comprehensive mapping of cell-type-specific causal GRNs in AD, providing a powerful resource for dynamic pathway exploration, hypothesis generation, and functional interpretation.

The database includes high-quality 3T fMRI data from 40 participants acquired during full-length movie-watching and three sensory mapping tasks: somatotopy, retinotopy, and tonotopy. Each participant also completed synchronized eye-tracking during movie-watching and retinotopy, physiological recordings, and a battery of behavioral and cognitive assessments. Data were collected across two MRI sessions and a remote testing session, with all data organized in a BIDS-compliant format. Technical validation confirms high data quality, with minimal head motion, accurate eye-tracker calibration, and robust task-evoked activation patterns. The database provides a unique resource for investigating individual differences, functional topographies, multimodal integration, and naturalistic cognition. All raw and preprocessed data, quality metrics, and preprocessing scripts are publicly available to support reproducible research.

">Modelling Discrete States and Long-Term Dynamics in Functional Brain Networks</a></h4>

              
                Functional brain network dynamics underlie fundamental aspects of human cognition and behaviour, including memory, ageing, and a range of clinical disorders. It has been shown that ongoing brain network dynamics can be reliably inferred at fast, sub-second timescales from electrophysiological data using unsupervised machine learning. However, these methods often struggle with inherent trade-offs. For example, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) have been used to infer categorical brain network states that provide good interpretability but do not model long-range temporal structure. Recently, deep learning approaches using recurrent neural networks (e.g., Dynamic Network Modes) have been proposed to model long-range temporal dependencies, but at the expense of interpretability. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Network States (DyNeStE) to address this problem. This new model employs amortised Bayesian inference with recurrent neural networks to model long-range temporal structure and uses a Gumbel-Softmax distribution to enforce categorical states for greater interpretability. In both simulations and real resting-state magnetoencephalography data, DyNeStE was able to recover plausible dynamic brain network states and showed superior performance over the HMM in capturing long-range temporal dependencies in network dynamics. These dynamic networks were reproducible across independent data splits and build on established HMM-based findings. Together, these results highlight DyNeStE as an interpretable and temporally informative framework, capable of representing large-scale neural activity as discrete state transitions while capturing transient and long-range brain network dynamics.

">Toward navigating emotional states using real-time representational similarity analysis fMRI neurofeedback - a feasibility study</a></h4>

              
                Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback (rt-fMRI-NF) is a promising non-invasive brain-computer-interface (BCI) technique for enhancing self-regulation of affective states in the brain. However, conventional univariate rt-fMRI-NF approaches are limited in their ability to distinguish neural patterns of distinct emotions that involve overlapping brain regions. In this study, we applied an rt-fMRI semantic neurofeedback (rt-fMRI-sNF) paradigm, incorporating real-time representational similarity analysis (rt-RSA) to enable navigation between emotional states. Four emotional patterns were first derived from functional localizer runs, each designed to evoke a specific emotion, and then applied as target patterns during neurofeedback. Using an RSA-informed circular semantic map (CSM), participants received real-time visual feedback indicating both the similarity and intensity of their current brain activity relative to target emotional patterns. Participants were instructed to use mental imagery to shift their brain activity toward the specific target pattern and increase its intensity. Twenty-four healthy participants completed the localizer runs, and two consecutive neurofeedback runs in the same session. Ten participants successfully engaged with both the similarity and intensity components of the CSM, showing effective modulations of their mental states. Analyses of the localizer runs revealed overlapping regional activations across emotions and demonstrated that RSA outperformed univariate analysis in distinguishing between them. For the neurofeedback runs, linear mixed-effects model (LMM) analyses across multiple performance metrics indicated consistent within-run improvements and higher initial performance in the second run, while significant between-run learning effects emerged only in exploratory models with quadratic time terms. A block-wise comparison also showed significantly higher performance at the end of each run compared to the beginning based on the intensity metric. These findings support the usability of RSA in differentiating multiple emotional states and demonstrate the feasibility of the rt-fMRI-sNF paradigm for emotion regulation.

">Altered coding of environmental boundaries in human aging: an fMRI study</a></h4>

              
                Aging is associated with changes in spatial memory and navigation, yet the mechanisms underlying these changes are not yet fully understood. Environmental boundaries are among the most salient and reliable spatial cues, supporting both spatial memory and orientation. Here, we investigated how aging affects the use and the neural representation of boundary information during a virtual object location memory task. Healthy young and older adults navigated a square virtual environment while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging, allowing us to assess moment-to-moment encoding of distance to environmental boundaries in the entorhinal cortex and subiculum. Behaviorally, both age groups showed more accurate memory for objects located near boundaries, but this effect was amplified in older adults, whose spatial precision declined more steeply with increasing distance from boundaries. Older adults also exhibited a stronger bias to recall objects closer to boundaries. Analysis of navigation behaviour revealed that older adults followed boundary-oriented paths regardless of target location, whereas young adults flexibly adapted their navigation based on spatial context. Neurally, older adults - but not young adults - showed significant blood-oxygen-level-dependent modulation by boundary distance in the entorhinal cortex and subiculum, with activity decreasing as participants moved farther from boundaries. This effect was most pronounced in low-performing older adults and was associated with stronger behavioral boundary bias, suggesting a maladaptive reliance on proximity-based cues. Together, our results provide converging behavioral and neural evidence that aging alters the use and representation of boundary information, with downstream effects on spatial memory. Altered boundary processing may represent a key mechanism contributing to age-related declines in spatial cognition.

">Preparatory encoding of diverse features of intended movement in the human motor cortex</a></h4>

              
                Over the course of a voluntary movement, motor cortical activity exhibits a transition from preparation to execution, with markedly different activity across these phases. Preparatory activity in particular might be used to improve brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that harness brain activity to control external assistive devices, for example by anticipating a user's intended movement trajectory for quick and fluid performance. However, to leverage preparatory activity for clinical BCIs, we must first understand which features of upcoming movements are encoded by preparatory activity in humans. In this work, we collected intracortical recordings from 3 research participants in the BrainGate2 clinical trial to investigate whether diverse features of movement, such as direction, curvature, and distance, are encoded by preparatory activity in the human motor cortex. We first show that preparatory activity is tuned to the direction of upcoming movements, and this tuning is largely preserved across movements with different effectors. Further investigation demonstrated this preparatory activity is also informative of initial and endpoint directions of curved movement trajectories, and encodes movement distance and speed independently. Finally, we present an online control paradigm that leverages preparatory activity to predict movements towards intended directions in advance, yielding rapid, self-paced control of a computer cursor by human participants. Altogether, these results demonstrate that preparatory activity in the human motor cortex encodes rich features of upcoming movement, highlighting its potential use for high performance brain-computer interface applications.

">Chronic stress facilitates behavioral engagement and alters lateral habenula activity during flexible decision making in a sex-dependent manner</a></h4>

              
                The ability to integrate feedback and flexibly adjust behavior under shifting environmental demands is required to optimize decision-making strategies. Clinical and preclinical data indicate that individuals with stress-related disorders and rodents exposed to chronic stress exhibit impaired behavioral flexibility. The lateral habenula (LHb) has emerged as a key brain region contributing to the effects of stress on cognitive performance. However, the extent to which the LHb is recruited to fine-tune decision-making strategies, as well as the impacts of chronic stress on LHb recruitment during task performance, remain largely unknown. To this end, we used a three-week model of chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) and performed in vivo fiber photometry to investigate Ca2+ transients in LHb neurons during an attentional set-shifting task in adult male and female Sprague Dawley rats (n=7-12/sex/group). We found that CUS exposure did not significantly impair behavioral flexibility. Rather, CUS-exposed rats made fewer omissions and exhibited shorter response latencies compared to controls, suggesting enhanced task engagement. We also observed sex differences in LHb Ca2+ activity. In control animals, we found that male rats showed stronger LHb signal prior to decision making, and greater activation following trial outcome than females. These differences were normalized by CUS, resulting in similar signaling patterns across sexes. Altogether, these findings reveal that chronic stress alters LHb activity in a sex-dependent manner without overtly impairing behavioral flexibility, thereby underscoring the importance of the LHb in decision making under stressful conditions.

">A neural network model of free recall learns multiple memory strategies</a></h4>

              
                Humans exhibit structured patterns of memory recall, including a tendency to recall more recent information and to recall events in the same order they were experienced. Classic computational models explain these patterns by positing that memories incorporate the ongoing ''temporal context'', formed by smoothly integrating the stimulus history. However, it is unclear whether a single mechanism can account for the full repertoire of human memory strategies, as the optimal approach may be task-dependent. For example, human memory experts widely apply the ''memory palace'' strategy, which is empirically better but not captured by temporal context models. Here we show that neural networks optimized for free recall develop diverse retrieval strategies, with only some of them resembling temporal context models. The best-performing models discovered a stimulus-invariant index code that emphasizes the studied position of each list item, instead of its temporal context. This creates a stable scaffold for forward recall akin to the memory palace technique. This index code was more likely to emerge when networks were i) encouraged to recall all studied items rather than prioritizing a few items, and ii) prevented from relying on recency, resonating with human data. Our findings demonstrate that human-like recall patterns can arise from multiple distinct computational mechanisms, and that sequential retrieval using item index is an optimal strategy that explains expert-level recall performance.

">Decoding Distraction From the Human Brain: A Unique Neural Signature Beyond Failures of Selective Attention and Control</a></h4>

              
                Distraction is a universal feature of human cognition, yet the reasons why it occurs remain poorly understood. Theories of sustained attention often point to failures of cognitive control in maintaining the task-set, while data-driven approaches suggest that distraction may instead reflect a breakdown in the selection of task-relevant information. This study aimed to better characterize the neural mechanisms of distraction and to test whether its EEG-based signature reflects a unique pattern or merely overlaps with failures in selective attention or task-set maintenance. Twenty adults completed a sustained attention go/no-go task (3,200 trials) while focusing on either numbers or letters, with EEG recorded simultaneously. Distraction was examined at two complementary levels: (i) trial-level lapses, defined as no-go errors, and (ii) attentional states, derived from reaction-time variability and categorized as 'in-the-zone' versus 'out-of-the-zone'. Across both levels, distraction was associated with attenuated event-related potentials, most notably a reduced P3 amplitude over parietal regions. Whole-scalp inter-electrode correlation analyses revealed weaker large-scale neural coordination during distraction. To isolate a unique EEG marker, we trained a machine-learning classifier to decode attentional state from EEG activity. Cross-validated decoding accuracy reached ~80% and remained robust even after controlling for reaction time, demonstrating that the signal captures information beyond overt performance. Finally, representational similarity analysis and additional classifiers confirmed that this neural signature is unique, as it was dissociable from other forms of attention, including the selection of the relevant stimulus side (left vs. right) and the control required for task-set maintenance (letter vs. number). Together, these findings reveal convergent neural markers of distraction and demonstrate the existence of a single EEG-derived signature that reliably predicts distraction, independently of behavior and other cognitive processes.

">Novel Olfactometer Reveals Brain-Breathing Interactions During Olfactory Perception</a></h4>

              
                This study introduces a novel, cost-effective olfactometer device synchronized to the respiratory cycle. Our olfactometer enables passive delivery of olfactory stimuli at specific respiratory phases during simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, improving standardization and sensitivity. The device is more objective than bio-behavioral paradigms that are (i) prone to within-subject variation on repeated testing and (ii) dependent upon cognitive, literary, and/or motor control abilities. The device was tested on 17 healthy subjects with three odors (peppermint, oregano, grapefruit) and a no-odor control, while recording simultaneous nasal respiration and EEG. In this paper, we introduce the idea of respiratory phase-locked event-related spectral perturbations (RPL-ERSP). RPL-ERSPs in the frontal/temporal region showed that neural activity was altered halfway through the first inhalation post-odor stimulus, compared to no-odor control. Tensor decomposition underlined the separation between stimuli and classified subject-level odor identification with above-chance performance (AUC = 0.75). Overall, we propose that RPL-ERSPs are a more accurate and informative method of reporting group-level responses to olfactory stimuli, and emphasize the importance of obtaining natural respiratory responses along with neural activity.

">Neurodegeneration Associated with Repeated High-Frequency Transcranial Focused Ultrasound</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial Focused Ultrasound (tFUS) is a popular tool for non-invasive neuromodulation which prior testing paradigms have suggested is benign. However, emerging use cases such as clinical therapies and brain-machine interfaces will likely require repeated or long-duration exposures with novel combinations of stimulus parameters (e.g., frequency, focal volume), and the safety of these conditions has not yet been rigorously validated. Therefore, as an initial study we delivered 1.8 MHz tFUS stimulation to the cortex of 4 non-human primates in 4 sessions each of approximately 90 min over 2 weeks. Motor skills were measured daily with a food pellet picking task. Animals were euthanized and the brain sections were processed for histological markers of neurodegeneration (Fluoro-Jade C). While the animals did not show disruption on the behavioral task, there was clear evidence of neurodegeneration in regions associated with short, intermediate, and extended-duration stimulation, but not with unstimulated control tissues in deeper brain areas. Additional neurodegeneration was observed at locations distant from but functionally connected to stimulated regions, consistent with retrograde damage propagated from neuron processes. We discuss alternative causes for the neurodegeneration, and we recommend the use of additional animal studies to understand this phenomenon, especially for novel stimulation paradigms or parameters and applications where extended or repeated exposures are planned.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>A crucial mechanism for the brain to make sense of the auditory environment is the synchronization of neural responses to external temporal regularities, such as a musical beat. It is debated whether this synchronization and the resulting beat percept reflect phase alignment of endogenous neural oscillations to the external regularity (“entrainment”), or evoked responses to the rhythmic stimulus (“tracking”). Here, we use the tempo-dependent properties of beat processing to differentiate between the two accounts. Participants listened to a repeating rhythmic pattern at different speeds. Behaviorally, they consistently tapped at the preferred beat rate (around 2 Hz) across tempi, shifting to higher metrical levels as tempo increased. We found a similar shift in EEG data, where the metrical level at which neural synchronization was strongest depended on tempo. This selective enhancement is consistent with entrainment accounts and could indeed be mimicked by an oscillator model. However, importantly, the results were also captured by a model simulating evoked responses. Together, our findings demonstrate that while neural responses to rhythm are selectively enhanced at the beat rate, this enhancement need not be taken as evidence for entrainment, but can also be explained by successive evoked responses.</span>

                <p>Perisynaptic astroglia provide critical molecular and structural support to regulate synaptic transmission and plasticity in the nanodomain of the axon&ndash;spine interface. Three-dimensional reconstruction from serial section electron microscopy (3DEM) was used to investigate relationships between perisynaptic astroglia and dendritic spine synapses undergoing plasticity in the adult hippocampus. Delta-burst stimulation (DBS) of the medial perforant pathway induced long-term potentiation (LTP) in the middle molecular layer and concurrent long-term depression (cLTD) in the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus in awake male rats. The contralateral hippocampus received baseline stimulation as a within-animal control. Brains were obtained 30&nbsp;min or 2&nbsp;h after DBS onset. An automated 3DEM pipeline was developed to enable unbiased quantification of astroglial coverage at the perimeter of the axon&ndash;spine interface. Under all conditions, &gt;85% of synapses had perisynaptic astroglia processes within 120&nbsp;nm of some portion of the perimeter. LTP broadened the distribution of spine sizes while reducing the presence and proximity of perisynaptic astroglia near the axon&ndash;spine interface of large spines. In contrast, cLTD transiently reduced the length of the axon&ndash;spine interface perimeter without substantially altering astroglial apposition. The postsynaptic density was discovered to be displaced from the center of the axon&ndash;spine interface, with this offset increasing during LTP and decreasing during cLTD. Astroglial access to the postsynaptic density was diminished during LTP and enhanced during cLTD, in parallel with changes in spine size. Thus, access of perisynaptic astroglia to synapses is dynamically modulated during LTP and cLTD alongside synaptic remodeling.</p>

                <p>Aggressive behavior can be acquired through observation, providing adaptive advantages but also posing significant social risks. In humans, individuals repeatedly exposed to aggression are more likely to engage in violent behavior later in life. Yet, the environmental factors and neural mechanisms underlying observationally acquired aggression remain unclear. Here, we propose that social familiarity with an aggressor is critical for activating neural circuits in observers that primes aggression. To investigate this, we established a novel behavioral paradigm termed "socially transmitted aggression (STA)," in which witness mice observed either familiar or unfamiliar demonstrators attacking intruder mice. Remarkably, male, but not female, witnesses displayed increased aggression only after observing familiar demonstrators, with no effect from unfamiliar ones. Given that excitatory neurons in the posterior&ndash;ventral segment of the medial amygdala (MeApv) have been implicated in aggression priming, we hypothesized these neurons might be involved in STA as well. Supporting this hypothesis, fiber photometry revealed selective activation of excitatory MeApv neurons during familiar, but not unfamiliar, demonstrator attacks. Chemogenetically and optogenetically inhibiting these neurons suppressed STA, while activating them during unfamiliar demonstrator attacks promoted aggression. These results establish social familiarity as essential for the observational transmission of aggression and identify excitatory MeApv neurons as critical mediators of this phenomenon, offering potential avenues for clinical intervention.</p>

                <p>Attention can be deployed in advance of visual stimuli based on features such as color or direction of motion. This anticipatory feature-based attention involves top-down neural control signals from the frontoparietal network that bias visual cortex to enhance attended information and suppress distraction. For example, anticipatory attention control can enable effective selection based on stimulus color while ignoring distracting information about stimulus motion. Anticipatory attention can also be focused more narrowly, for example, to select specific colors or motion directions that define task-relevant aspects of the stimuli. One important question that remains open is whether anticipatory attention control first biases broad feature dimensions such as color versus motion before biasing the specific feature attributes (e.g., blue vs green). To investigate this, we recorded EEG activity during a task where human participants of either sex were cued to either attend to a motion direction (up or down) or a color (blue or green) on a trial-by-trial basis. Applying multivariate decoding approaches to the EEG alpha band activity (8&ndash;12&nbsp;Hz) during attention control (cue-target interval), we observed significant decoding for both the attended dimensions (motion vs color) and specific feature attributes (up vs down; blue vs green). Importantly, the temporal onset of the dimension-level biasing (motion vs color) preceded that of the attribute-level biasing (up vs down and blue vs green). These findings demonstrate that the top-down control of feature-based attention proceeds in a hierarchical fashion, first biasing the broad feature dimension, and then narrowing to the specific feature attribute.</p>

                <p>The human brain must add information to the acoustic speech signal in order to understand language. Many accounts propose that the prosodic structure of utterances (including their syllabic rhythm and speech melody), in combination with stored lexical knowledge, cue and interact with higher order abstract semantic and syntactic information. While cortical rhythms, particularly in the delta and theta band, synchronize to quasi-rhythmic low-level acoustic speech features, it remains unclear how the human brain encodes abstract speech properties in neural rhythms in the absence of an acoustic signal, i.e., when speakers hold planned sentences in working memory. This study disentangles the contributions of prosodic and syntactic features in cortical rhythms during delayed sentence repetition. Using high-resolution ECoG during awake tumor surgery in the left perisylvian cortex in nine patients (five female), we show that the phase of neural rhythms with frequencies ranging from 1 to 48&nbsp;Hz and the broadband gamma power envelope code both low-level acoustic and abstract syntactic speech features during sentence processing and retention. Syntax and prosody coding occurred in the same frequency bands, which argues against the assumption of different frequency channels for processing and representing these speech features. Our data suggest the brain leverages the phase of various neural rhythms to code both acoustic and abstract linguistic features.</p>

                <p>Much research has focused on how perceptual, cognitive, and attentional processes modulate microsaccades, the small rapid gaze shifts that humans perform when attempting to maintain steady gaze on a point. Yet the reasons why these fixational saccades occur in the first place have remained unclear. Long-standing theories have argued for either spatial (i.e., gaze centering) or temporal mechanisms (i.e., a periodical release process). However, this debate has never been resolved, primarily because of uncertainty in determining where the observer looks. Whereas modern eye-trackers enable detection of small eye movements, accurate localization of the line of sight remains challenging. Here, rather than indirectly inferring gaze position from oculomotor activity, we used a gaze-contingent procedure to directly estimate the perceived center of the visual field, a method that has been previously shown to effectively reduce uncertainty. Our results from subjects of both sexes show that the generation of fixational saccades depends on the interaction of spatial and temporal factors. Fixational saccades are remarkably accurate in correcting for fixation errors, even when gaze is minimally displaced. However, fixational saccades also occur when gaze is centered, but their latency increases as the fixation error decreases. These results suggest that fixational saccades serve an important corrective function when needed, but they can only be avoided for a limited period of time when fixation is already accurate.</p>

                <p>In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) motor cortex, hyperexcitability is detected in both familial and sporadic cases, suggesting its centrality in the ALS phenotype; the underlying mechanisms, however, remain largely obscure. Here we utilize male and female UCHL1-eGFP (UeGFP) mice, in which the corticospinal neurons of the motor cortex are labeled with green fluorescent protein, to investigate the intrinsic excitability and synaptic inhibitory inputs on distinct neuron populations in WT-UeGFP and presymptomatic AlsinKO-UeGFP mice, which lack Alsin function and are a well-characterized mouse model for juvenile cases of ALS. We show that in the motor cortex of AlsinKO-UeGFP mice, eGFP-positive layer 5 pyramidal neurons, which represent upper motor neurons, show a decrease in intrinsic excitability compared with WT, whereas the electrophysiological properties of eGFP-negative cells, which identify callosal projection neurons, are unaffected. This alteration in intrinsic excitability, however, is counterbalanced by a decrease in the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory currents due to a cell-specific reduction in the number of inhibitory synaptic contacts on upper motor neurons. Thus, the overall excitability of upper motor neurons only displays negligible changes despite large alterations in intrinsic excitability and inhibitory synaptic input, which may explain why mice do not exhibit a prominent motor phenotype. The presence of this homeostatic interaction between intrinsic excitability and synaptic inhibition raises the question of which of the two changes is primary, and which is secondary, and shows that decreased function of motor cortex interneurons is an early event in ALS with Alsin mutations.</p>

                <p>Finding what you are looking for is a ubiquitous task in everyday life that relies on a two-way comparison between what is currently viewed and internal search goals held in memory. Despite a wealth of studies tracking visual verification among external contents of perception, complementary verification processes among internal contents of memory remain elusive. Building on a recently established gaze marker of internal visual focusing in working memory, we uncover the internal inspection process associated with confirming or dismissing potential search targets. We show how male and female human participants "look back" into working memory when faced with external stimuli that are perceived as potential targets and link such internal inspection to the time needed for visual verification. A direct comparison between visual verification among the contents of working memory or perception further revealed how verification in both domains engages frontal theta activity in scalp electroencephalography but also how mnemonic verification is slower to deploy than perceptual verification. This establishes internal verification as an integral component of visual search and provides new ways to look into this underexplored component of human search behavior.</p>

                <p>Changes in emotion recognition are observed in aging, in dementia, after brain lesions and as a function of mental health factors, such as depression. In aging, older adults have been argued to show a "positivity bias," which has been associated with a relatively spared recognition accuracy for positive emotion and an increased tendency to label emotions as positive. This bias has been suggested to support mental well-being. However, it has also been found in association with cognitive decline and brain lesions. Here, we investigated the behavioral and brain correlates of this age-related positivity bias. We used multimodal brain imaging in a large group of human adults (<I>n</I> = 665, 333 females) drawn from a population-derived cohort across the lifespan, together with a psychometric analysis of an emotion recognition task using facial expressions. Beyond reductions in expression recognition accuracy, older adults showed increased perceptual thresholds for negative emotions and a reduced threshold for the positive emotion, even after accounting for general face recognition abilities. This positivity bias in labeling emotions was strongly associated with lower cognitive performance in older people, but not with (nonclinical) depressive symptoms. It was also associated with reduced gray matter volume in the bilateral anterior hippocampus&ndash;amygdala and increased functional connectivity between these regions and the orbitofrontal cortex. Together, age-related positivity bias is associated with cognitive decline and structural and functional brain differences. A positivity bias in emotion recognition may therefore reflect an early marker of neurodegeneration, a hypothesis that could be tested in future longitudinal studies.</p>

                <p>Patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) face an increased risk of cognitive impairment, dementia, and stroke. While white matter (WM) lesions are frequently reported in patients with CAD, the effects on WM microstructure alterations remain largely unknown. We aimed to identify WM microstructural alterations in individuals with CAD compared with healthy controls (HC) and to examine their relationships with cognitive performance. Forty-three (43) patients with CAD (35 males and 8 females) and 36 HC (26 males and 10 females) aged 50 and older underwent comprehensive neuropsychological testing and multimodal 3&nbsp;T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A novel multivariate approach&mdash;the Mahalanobis distance (D2)&mdash;was used to quantify WM abnormalities as the amount of deviation from the HC reference group. D2 integrates multiple MRI-derived diffusion-weighted imaging, R1 relaxometry, and magnetization transfer imaging metrics, while accounting for covariance between metrics. Relationships between WM D2 and cognition (executive function and processing speed) were also assessed. Compared with HCs, patients with CAD had higher D2 values in the whole WM (<I>p</I> = 0.015) and in the right anterior and bilateral middle cerebral artery territories (<I>p</I> &lt; 0.05). Myelin-sensitive metrics, particularly R1 relaxation rate and MT saturation, were the most important contributors to D2. Processing speed was positively associated with greater R1 in both the whole WM and left middle cerebral artery territory. These findings suggest that greater WM microstructural alterations observed in patients with CAD were mainly driven by differences in myelin content. These alterations may contribute to a heightened risk of cognitive impairment.</p>

                <p>The early onset of peripheral deafness significantly alters the proper development of the auditory system. Likewise, exposure to loud noise during early development produces a similar disruptive effect. Before hearing onset in altricial mammals, cochlear inner hair cells (IHCs) exhibit spontaneous electrical activity that drives auditory circuit development. This activity is modulated by medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent feedback through &alpha;9&alpha;10 nicotinic cholinergic receptors in IHCs. In adults, these receptors are restricted to outer hair cells, where they mediate MOC feedback to regulate cochlear amplification. Although the MOC system's protective role to prevent noise-induced hearing loss in adulthood is well established, its influence during early developmental stages&mdash;especially in response to exposure to loud noise&mdash;remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigated the role of MOC feedback during early postnatal development using &alpha;9 knock-out (KO) and &alpha;9 knock-in (KI) mice of either sex, which respectively lack or exhibit enhanced cholinergic activity. Our findings reveal that both increased and absent olivocochlear activity result in altered auditory sensitivity at the onset of hearing, along with long-range alterations in the number and morphology of ribbon synapses. Early noise exposure caused lasting auditory damage in both wild-type and &alpha;9KO mice, with deficits persisting into adulthood. In contrast, &alpha;9KI mice were protected from noise-induced damage, with no long-term effects on auditory function. These results highlight the increased susceptibility of the auditory system during early postnatal development. Moreover, they indicate that an enhanced MOC feedback shields the auditory system from noise damage during this period.</p>

[version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Medicinal plants play a crucial role in pharmacological research, as many pharmaceutical companies rely on them for raw materials. Collard greens, also known as “Sukuma wiki,” are a member of the Brassica oleracea var. viridis family and are known for their medicinal properties. The aim of this study was to identify phytochemicals in the ethanol extract of collard green leaves that has traditional use in treating male infertility in Uganda. Method The leaves were dried and crushed into fine powder and the powdered leaves (800 g) A was cold macerated in 5 liters of 99% ethanol (1:5 w/v) for 72 hours in sterile glass container. The ethanol extract (5g) was subjected to Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Results Phytochemical analysis of the Ethanol extract from Brassica oleracea var. viridis (Collard green) leaves revealed the presence of various compounds, including flavonoids, alkaloids, phenolic compounds, fatty acids, and terpenoids. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis identified 77 bioactive compounds, such as 2-Methoxy-4-vinylphenol, 2, 7-Dimethyl-1, 7-octadien-3-amine, Octadecanoic acid, 9, 12, 15-Octadecatrienoic acid, Pentadecanoic acid, and several phenolic derivatives. Conclusion In conclusion, the phytochemicals identified in Brassica oleracea var. viridis (Collard greens), including Phytol, Omega-3 fatty acids, phenols, flavonoids, and sterols, demonstrate potential benefits for enhancing male fertility and reproductive health. These phytochemicals exert their beneficial action through their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and possibly neuroprotective properties. There is need for further research to establish the effectiveness of these phytochemicals in clinical settings and provide concrete guidelines for their use in treating male infertility.

                Background Early and accurate prediction of Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) is critical to reducing cardiovascular mortality through timely intervention. While deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in disease prediction, many lack interpretability, generalizability, and fairness—particularly when deployed across demographically diverse populations. These shortcomings limit clinical adoption and risk reinforcing healthcare disparities. Methods This study proposes a novel model: X-TLRABiLSTM (Explainable Transfer Learning–based Residual Attention Bidirectional LSTM). The architecture integrates transfer learning from pre-trained cardiovascular models into a BiLSTM framework with residual attention layers to improve temporal feature extraction and convergence. To ensure transparency, the model incorporates SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to quantify the contribution of each clinical feature to the final prediction. Additionally, a demographic reweighting strategy is applied to the training process to reduce bias across subgroups defined by age, gender, and ethnicity. The model was evaluated on the UCI Heart Disease dataset using 10-fold cross-validation. Results The X-TLRABiLSTM model achieved a classification accuracy of 98.2%, with an F1-score of 98.1% and an AUC of 99.1%, outperforming standard ML classifiers and state-of-the-art DL baselines. SHAP-based interpretability analysis highlighted clinically relevant predictors such as chest pain type, ST depression, and thalassemia. A fairness-aware reweighting strategy was applied during training, and fairness evaluation revealed minimal performance disparity across demographic subgroups, with F1-score gaps ≤ 0.6% and error rate gaps ≤ 0.4%. Confusion matrix analysis demonstrated low false-positive and false-negative rates, reinforcing the model’s reliability for clinical deployment. Conclusions X-TLRABiLSTM offers a highly accurate, interpretable, and demographically fair framework for IHD prognosis. By combining transfer learning, residual attention, explainable AI, and fairness-aware optimization, this model advances trustworthy AI in healthcare. Its successful performance on benchmark clinical data supports its potential for real-world integration in ethical, AI-assisted cardiovascular diagnostics.

                Background Corporate markups have risen markedly since the 1980s, widening the gap between profits and wages and fuelling income inequality. Counterbalance Economics (CBE) converts a portion of those markup rents into firm-redeemable vouchers for low-income households, promising redistribution without incurring large public budgets. This paper tests whether in-kind financed voucher scheme can neutralise the inequality effect of markups across advanced and emerging OECD economies. Methodology We assemble an unbalanced panel of 12 countries (1982–2016) that combines Study/World Bank Gini indices with De Loecker–Eeckhout aggregate markups, macro controls (log GDP per capita, terms of trade, R&D intensity, unemployment) and a newly coded CBE dummy capturing six staggered adoptions of mark-up-funded voucher programmes. A two-way fixed-effects difference-in-differences model estimates the causal impact of markups, CBE, and their interaction on inequality, controlling for country–clustered errors. Results In the absence of a policy, a 10-percentage-point rise in markups increases the Gini coefficient by 1.23 points. Where CBE is in force, the interaction term turns significantly negative implying the same markup increase now lowers the Gini by 2.9 points. Disaggregating the data reveals a more minor but still significant reduction in developed economies and a larger effect in emerging economies, consistent with higher initial inequality and weaker traditional safety nets. Placebo and pre-trend tests detect no spurious effects, and synthetic-control replications for early adopters confirm the magnitude of the effect. Conclusions Markup rents are a potent driver of inequality, yet a modest, rule-based in-kind mechanism that recycles those rents into vouchers can more than offset their distributive harm. CBE, therefore, offers policymakers a scalable, market-compatible complement to progressive taxation—especially valuable in emerging economies where fiscal capacity is limited. Future research should pair industry-level markups with micro-data on voucher use to refine targeting and assess long-run growth effects.

                Obesity and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in women are associated with significant reproductive dysfunction, manifesting as hormonal imbalances, anovulation, and subfertility. These conditions not only impair reproductive outcomes but also contribute to a reduced quality of life. Crucially, obesity and PCOS share a bidirectional relationship. While obesity can trigger and worsen PCOS manifestations, the convergence of these two conditions has contributed significantly to the growing incidence of female infertility. This review critically examines liraglutide’s mechanistic role and therapeutic potential in mediating metabolic restoration and improving the fertility outcomes in women burdened by obesity and PCOS. A literature search was conducted in original databases until March 2025 in PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science using the following keywords pertinently: ‘obesity’, ‘GLP-1R’, ‘liraglutide’, ‘female reproductive system’, ‘polycystic ovarian syndrome’, ‘ovarian function’, and ‘pregnancy outcomes’. Accumulated evidence suggests that liraglutide promotes greater weight loss and improves reproductive outcomes in women with obesity and PCOS by regulating endocrine parameters, reducing systemic inflammation, restoring menstrual cyclicity, and supporting folliculogenesis. It improves reproductive outcomes by increasing natural conception rates and improving responses to assisted reproductive techniques (ART). However, with all the positive outcomes, the major limitations using this drug for weight loss are the need for daily subcutaneous injections, cost, and gastrointestinal adverse effects. Long-term assessment of the sustained efficacy and impact on reproductive outcomes, including the pattern of ovulation and offspring health, is warranted. This review consolidated present findings and emphasized areas for further exploration to better inform clinical decision-making and future research directions.

                Background Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) diagnosis relies on observing acute neurological signs including loss of consciousness, post-traumatic amnesia, confusion and transient motor signs. Current guidelines assume real-time observation, creating systematic underdiagnosis when emergency medical services (EMS) arrival exceeds transient qualifying sign duration—particularly problematic in rural systems with transport delays. Objective To model the missed-diagnosis window — the probability that qualifying signs resolve before first medical contact. Methods We synthesized published EMS response distributions, acute neurological sign durations, and consensus guideline criteria to model the missed-diagnosis window—the probability that qualifying signs resolve before first medical contact. Analysis incorporated systematic review evidence from 37 studies (n=239,464,121 patients). Results Critical neurological signs resolve rapidly: median loss of consciousness <1 minute, altered mental status ~5 minutes, brief post-traumatic amnesia <30 minutes. EMS arrival approximates 15 minutes (urban) versus 25 minutes (rural). This temporal mismatch produces P (missed diagnosis) >0.70 in rural systems when arrival exceeds 20 minutes—representing systematic 70% underdiagnosis where guidelines default to “sign absent” rather than “sign unobserved.” Conclusions Implementing time-sensitive, retrospective, and telehealth-supported pathways within existing EMS protocols is both feasible and defensible, reducing missed diagnoses of mild traumatic brain injury in rural settings. By addressing EMS delays directly, this approach strengthens diagnostic accuracy, advances equity in rural health, and moves toward a new standard of care in emergency medicine.

                Background With rising health awareness and achieving SDGs on improve nutrition for all at all ages, consumers are increasingly seeking functional foods that offer nutritional benefits beyond basic sustenance. Edible gel beads enriched with nutrients represent an innovative option in the functional food market. However, limited research exists on consumer attitudes and the factors driving their purchase intention for such products. Objective This study aims to explore consumer attitudes and identify the key factors that influence the purchase intention of nutrient-enriched edible gel beads. Methodology A quantitative research approach was employed using a questionnaire distributed to 256 participants. This research was approved by the Human Research Ethics Review Committee, Multi-Institutional Group No.1, Chulalongkorn University COA No.165/67, Belmont Report 1979, Declaration of Helsinki 2013, Council for International organization of Medical Sciences (CIOM) 2016. The survey measured variables such as product knowledge, health consciousness, perceived benefits, price sensitivity, and attitude toward the product. Data were analyzed to identify significant predictors of purchase intention. Result The study confirms that Thai consumers’ purchase intentions for nutrient-enriched edible gel beads are strongly influenced by perceived health benefits, trust in health claims, and product attributes such as taste and labeling. Demographic factors like gender and education also play a role. These insights underscore opportunities for product innovation and targeted marketing, while highlighting the need for clearer labeling and broader consumer education to support informed health choices. Unique Contribution This research contributes to the emerging body of knowledge on functional food products by highlighting the specific psychological and economic factors that shape consumer behavior toward innovative health-oriented foods in the Thai context.

                Abstract* The Global Artery Project (GAP) launched by the Institute of Continuing Medical Education (ICME) in Cote d’Ivoire, a West African country aims to fill the gap between needs and contributions in the knowledge, diagnosis, and management of acquired degenerative arterial diseases. This project will have a progressive implementation in three phases and will focus on the main arterial diseases caused by atherosclerosis and mediacalcosis. It will concern Peripheral Artery Diseases, Coronary Artery Diseases and Carotid Artery Stenosis. Thus, we will have Phase -1 dedicated to Peripheral Artery Diseases (PAD), Phase -2 dedicated to Coronary Artery Diseases (CAD), and Phase -3 dedicated to Carotid Artery Stenosis (CAS). This protocol is related to Phase-1 and aims to set out objectives by explaining the actions to be taken, the rationale, and the tactics of these objectives.

                <p>by Joshua Looker, Kat S. Rock, Louise Dyson</p>

The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has had catastrophic effects on public health and economies. Around the world, many countries employed modelling efforts to help guide pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical measures designed to reduce the spread of the virus. Modelling efforts for future pandemics could use the theory of early warning signals (EWS), which aims to predict ‘critical transitions’ in complex dynamical systems. In infectious disease systems, such transitions correspond to (re-)emergence, peaks and troughs in infections which can be indirectly observed through the reported case data. There is increasing evidence that including EWS in modelling can help improve responses to upcoming increases or decreases in case reporting. Here, we present both theoretical and data-driven analyses of the suitability of EWS to predict epidemic transitions in reported case data. We derive analytical statistics for a variety of infectious disease models and show, through stochastic simulations of different modelling scenarios, the applicability of EWS in such contexts. Using the COVID-19 reported case dataset from the United Kingdom, we demonstrate the performance of a range of temporal and spatial statistics to anticipate transitions in the case data. Finally, we also investigate the applicability of using EWS analysis of hospitalisation data to anticipate transitions in the corresponding case data. Together, our findings indicate that EWS analysis could be a vital addition to future modelling analysis for real-world infection data.

Energy metabolism is essential to brain function, but its study is experimentally challenging. Similarly, biologically accurate computational models are too complex for simple investigations. Here, we analyse an experimentally-calibrated multiscale model of human brain energy metabolism using Computational Singular Perturbation. This approach leads to the novel identification of functional periods during and after synaptic activation, and highlights the central reactions and metabolites controlling the system’s behaviour within those periods. We identify a key role for both oxidative and glycolytic astrocytic metabolism in driving the brain’s metabolic circuitry. We also identify phosphocreatine as the main endogenous energy supply to brain cells, and propose revising our view of brain energy metabolism accordingly. Our approach highlights the importance of glial cells in brain metabolism, and introduces a systematic and unbiased methodology to study the dynamics of complex biochemical networks that can be scaled, in principle, to metabolic networks of any size and complexity.

                <p>by Bevelynn Whaler, Grant Lythe, Joseph J. Gillard, Thomas R. Laws, Jonathan Carruthers, Thomas Finnie, Carmen Molina-París, Martín López-García</p>

We present a mathematical model of the dynamics of <i>Bacillus anthracis</i> bacteria within the lymph nodes and blood of a host, following inhalation of an initial dose of spores. We also incorporate the dynamics of protective antigen, which is the binding component of the anthrax toxin produced by the bacteria. The model offers a mechanistic description of the early infection dynamics of inhalational anthrax, while its stochastic nature allows us to study the probabilities of different outcomes (for example, how likely it is that the infection will be cleared for a given inhaled dose of spores) in order to explain dose-response data for inhalational anthrax. The model is calibrated via a Bayesian approach, using <i>in vivo</i> data from New Zealand white rabbit and guinea pig infection studies, enabling within-host parameters to be estimated. We also leverage incubation-period data from the Sverdlovsk 1979 anthrax outbreak to show that the model can accurately describe human time-to-symptoms data under reasonable parameter regimes. Finally, we derive a simple approximate formula for the probability of symptom onset before time <i>t</i>, assuming that the number of inhaled spores has a Poisson distribution.

                <p>by Delaney E. Miller, Ashley E. Brown, Nicholas A. Bianco, Rucha Bhise, Scott L. Delp, Steven H. Collins</p>

For individuals with knee osteoarthritis, increased knee loading is linked to disease progression and pain. Some approaches to treating osteoarthritis, such as specialized footwear, braces, and powered exoskeletons, also increase the mass of the lower limbs, which could lead to increases in knee loads. Prior studies have investigated the effect of changes in torso mass and total body mass on peak knee contact forces, but the effects of increased leg mass remain unclear. In this study, we created musculoskeletal simulations informed by experimental data to estimate tibiofemoral knee contact force under different lower-limb segment mass conditions. The mass of the foot, shank, and thigh were varied by adding weights to each segment, separately and concurrently, as healthy young adults (N = 10) walked on a treadmill. Kinematics, kinetics, and muscle activity were recorded. Our simulations used an optimal control framework that enforced experimental kinematics while minimizing a combination of net joint moment errors and mismatch between measured and estimated muscle activity. The simulations revealed that adding mass to the lower-limb segments linearly increased early- and late-stance peaks in knee contact force, but that the slope of this relationship was different for each peak and each mass placement location. For each 1% of body weight (BW) added per limb (2% BW total) at the thigh, shank, and foot, early-stance peak knee contact force increased by 1.5%, 2.1%, and 5.9% (<i>r</i> = 0.71), while late-stance peak contact force increased by 1.6%, 0.9% and 3.0% (<i>r</i> = 0.67), respectively. Adding mass to the thigh and shank increases peak contact force at or below the rate of increase in body mass, while adding mass to the foot disproportionately increases peak knee contact force. These detrimental effects should be considered when designing interventions for osteoarthritis.

                <p>by Jennifer Snoozy, Sushila Bhattacharya, Brandon Johnson, Robin R. Fettig, Ashley Van Asma, Chloe Brede, Sophia G. Miller, Martina Ralle, Kurt Warnhoff</p>

Xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) is a molybdenum cofactor (Moco) requiring enzyme that catabolizes hypoxanthine into xanthine and xanthine into uric acid, the final steps in purine catabolism. Human patients with mutations in XDH develop xanthinuria which can lead to xanthine stones in the kidney, recurrent urinary tract infections, and renal failure. Currently, there are no therapies for treating human XDH deficiency. Thus, understanding mechanisms that maintain purine homeostasis is an important goal of human health. Here, we used the nematode Caenorhabditis <i>elegans</i> to model human XDH deficiency using two clinically relevant paradigms: Moco deficiency or loss-of-function mutations in <i>xdh-1</i>, the <i>C. elegans</i> ortholog of XDH<i>.</i> Both Moco deficiency and <i>xdh-1</i> loss of function caused the formation of autofluorescent xanthine stones in <i>C. elegans</i>. Surprisingly, only 2% of <i>xdh-1</i> null mutant <i>C. elegans</i> developed a xanthine stone, suggesting additional pathways may regulate this process. To uncover such pathways, we performed a forward genetic screen for mutations that enhance the penetrance of xanthine stone formation in <i>xdh-1</i> null mutant <i>C. elegans</i>. We isolated multiple loss-of-function mutations in the gene <i>sulp-4</i> which encodes a sulfate permease homologous to human SLC26 anion exchange proteins. We demonstrated that SULP-4 acts cell-nonautonomously in the excretory cell to limit xanthine stone accumulation. Interestingly, <i>sulp-4</i> mutant phenotypes were suppressed by mutations in genes that encode for cystathionase (<i>cth-2)</i> or cysteine dioxygenase (<i>cdo-1</i>), members of the sulfur amino acid catabolism pathway required for production of sulfate, a substrate of SULP-4. We propose that sulfate accumulation caused by <i>sulp-4</i> loss of function promotes xanthine stone accumulation. We speculate that sulfate accumulation causes osmotic imbalance, creating conditions in the intestinal lumen that favor xanthine stone accumulation. Supporting this model, a mutation in <i>osm-8</i> that constitutively activates the osmotic stress response also promoted xanthine stone accumulation in an <i>xdh-1</i> mutant background. Thus, our work establishes a <i>C. elegans</i> model for human XDH deficiency and identifies the sulfate permease <i>sulp-4</i> as a critical player controlling xanthine stone accumulation.

Animals rely on innate and learned behavior to respond to their environment, but how the brain balances hardwired responses with adaptive flexibility remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that innate looming stimulus responses in <i>Mus musculus</i> can be attenuated via repeated unreinforced presentation. This attenuation is long-lasting and generalizing, but is rapidly recovered when the stimulus is paired with an electric foot-shock. Fiber photometry recordings reveal attenuation of responses to visual looming stimuli in the SC and PAG, which do not recover following recovery of behavioral responses. Analysis of c-Fos expression uncovered a ventral CA1 (vCA1) ensemble that is active during both innate and learned looming fear responses. We report that this vCA1 engram is not necessary for innate defensive behavior but is necessary for learned fear responses. These findings reveal a novel role of the hippocampus in adapting to looming stimuli, and provide a platform for understanding the interaction of memory and instinct.

Sharing knowledge is a basic tenet of the scientific community, yet publication bias arising from the reluctance or inability to publish negative or null results remains a long-standing and deep-seated problem, albeit one that varies in severity between disciplines and study types. Recognizing that previous endeavors to address the issue have been fragmentary and largely unsuccessful, this Consensus View proposes concrete and concerted measures that major stakeholders can take to create and incentivize new pathways for publishing negative results. Funders, research institutions, publishers, learned societies, and the research community all have a role in making this an achievable norm that will buttress public trust in science.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-975/v1?src=rss">Scientific Productivity and Population Health: Correlating Research Output with Mortality Rates in Arab Countries [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Research suggests that scientific output may play a role in reducing mortality rates; however, this relationship has not been extensively explored at the national level. This observational study investigated the association between research output and mortality rates in Arab countries, focusing on the top ten causes of death. Methods Mortality rate data for the leading causes of death were obtained from the World Health Organization (WHO). The research output on these causes was retrieved using the SCOPUS database through Python™, and weighted citation ratios were gathered from SciVal. Spearman’s correlation test, performed in R, was used to measure the relationship between the research output and mortality rates. Results Over the past two decades, research output has grown significantly in Arab countries. Most countries showed an inverse correlation between research output and mortality rates, indicating that increased research output coincided with lower mortality rates. However, four countries demonstrated statistically significant increases in mortality despite higher research output. Among these, Algeria and Morocco had the lowest overall research outputs. Public health challenges, including a high prevalence of heart disease and risk factors, along with poor adherence to non-communicable disease prevention guidelines, have contributed to the rising mortality in these countries. Conclusions The findings suggest that research output is associated with improved mortality outcomes in Arab countries. However, these exceptions highlight the importance of public health infrastructure and disease-prevention efforts. A national focus on biomedical research, combined with effective health policies, may help further reduce mortality rates in the region.

                Background This study used ChatGPT for sentiment analysis to investigate the possible links between online sentiments and COVID-19 vaccination rates. It also examines Internet posts to understand the attitudes and reasons associated with vaccine-related opinions. Methods We collected 500,558 posts over 60 weeks from the Blind platform, mainly used by working individuals, and 854 relevant posts were analyzed. After excluding duplicates and irrelevant content, attitudes toward and reasons for vaccine opinions were studied through sentiment analysis. The study further correlated these categorized attitudes with the actual vaccination data. Results The proportions of posts expressing positive, negative, and neutral attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines were 5%, 83%, and 12%, respectively. The total post count showed a positive correlation with the vaccination rate, indicating a high correlation between the number of negative posts about the vaccine and the vaccination rate. Negative attitudes were predominantly associated with societal distrust and perceived oppression. Conclusions This study demonstrates the interplay between public perceptions of COVID-19 vaccines as expressed through social media and vaccination behavior. These correlations can serve as useful clues for devising effective vaccination strategies.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of clopidogrel plus aspirin for acute mild stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA) stratified by the status of symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS) or extracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ECAS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The study was a subgroup analysis of a randomized clinical trial. Participants with mild ischemic stroke or TIA were assigned to receive either clopidogrel plus aspirin or aspirin monotherapy. Participants were categorized into 4 groups by the status of symptomatic ICAS or ECAS: ICAS + ECAS group, only ECAS group, only ICAS group, and no stenosis group. The primary efficacy end point was any new stroke and the primary safety end point was moderate-to-severe bleeding within 90 days.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The study enrolled 5,664 patients. Compared with other groups, the ICAS + ECAS group had a higher risk of recurrent stroke within 90 days (no stenosis = 5.7%; only ICAS = 7.2%; only ECAS = 10.3%; and ICAS + ECAS = 13.2%; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Although clopidogrel plus aspirin showed a numerically lower recurrence risk versus aspirin alone, no significant treatment effect difference emerged across the 4 groups. No significant interaction between antiplatelet therapy and the status of symptomatic ICAS or ECAS for recurrent stroke and moderate-to-severe bleeding was identified.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>For acute mild ischemic stroke or TIA, although patients with both symptomatic ICAS and ECAS exhibited an elevated risk of recurrent stroke than other patients, no interaction effect between antiplatelet therapy and the status of symptomatic ICAS or ECAS for the risk of new stroke and moderate-to-severe bleeding was observed.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>An enduring puzzle in many inherited neurological disorders is the late onset of symptoms despite expression of function-impairing mutant protein early in life. We examined the basis for onset of impairment in spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6), a canonical late-onset neurodegenerative ataxia which results from a polyglutamine expansion in the voltage gated calcium channel, Cav2.1.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed serial transcriptome analysis with weighted gene correlation network analysis to investigate mechanisms for resilience in SCA6 mice that prevent onset of symptoms. We examined changes in membrane excitability that result in cerebellar Purkinje neuron spiking abnormalities through patch-clamp recordings of Purkinje neurons in acute brain slices.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Using unbiased transcriptome analysis, we identified endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress as a driver of disease. Using spatial transcriptome analysis, we identified Purkinje neuron specific changes in unfolded protein response (UPR) related pathways. Novel activation of a store-operated calcium current due to ER stress is the cause for Purkinje neuron spiking abnormalities in SCA6 mice. The impairments in Purkinje neuron spiking are unrelated to Cav2.1 ion-flux function. Redundant pathways of the UPR act through a HSP90-dependent mechanism to mitigate this ER stress.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our studies support a model whereby proteotoxicity from misfolded mutant Cav2.1 is mitigated by a HSP90-dependent UPR, and age-related breakdown of this response causes motor dysfunction and aberrant Purkinje neuron spiking. These studies elucidate a mechanism of resilience connecting aberrant proteostasis and calcium-dependent intrinsic membrane hyperexcitability to explain delayed disease onset more widely in age-dependent neurodegenerative disease.

                Background Hydatidosis of the thoracic wall differs from other hydatid localizations in its pathophysiology, diagnostic, and therapeutic management. It is a little-studied entity. The objectives of our work were to describe its surgical management and to analyze the factors that may influence recurrence and mortality. Methods A retrospective, descriptive, longitudinal, and multicenter study on four university hospital surgical centers of Tunis, from January 1995 to December 2022 including operated hydatid cysts of the thoracic wall. Overall survival (OS) and cumulative recurrence rates were calculated. Univariate and multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to identify recurrence and mortality risk factors. Results Forty-nine patients were included. The mean age was 41 ± 17 years [8-76]. The main presenting sign was thoracic parietal swelling (n=22). Chest ultrasound and CT scan showed multivesicular formation in 17 and 33 cases, respectively. Muscle involvement was in the intercostal (n=4), paravertebral (n=13), and pectoralis major (n=3) muscles. Bone involvement was vertebral (n=11), costal (n=12), costo-vertebral (n=21) and sternal (n=2). A posterolateral thoracotomy was performed (n=20). Surgical excision at various levels of the chest wall with spinal stabilization (n=15) was performed. Sixty-three percent of the patients received antiparasitic medical treatment. Recurrence occurred in 37% of cases. Four patients died from hydatidosis-related complications. Factors could be independently associated with recurrence such as male gender, and vertebral involvement. The presence of a visceral hydatid cyst located at a distance from the parietal lesion at the time of diagnosis and the occurrence of postoperative infectious complications could increase mortality. Conclusions Chest wall hydatidosis represents a rare medical condition where surgery remains the preferred treatment modality. However, it carries a substantial burden of morbidity and mortality, influenced by various factors. Further large-scale studies are necessary to gain a deeper understanding of these factors and to optimize management strategies accordingly.

                Objective To develop and validate predictive models for healthcare workforce transition success under decentralization using Support Vector Machine (SVM) analysis and to identify key determinants across organizational support domains. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 430 healthcare personnel transferred from Ministry of Public Health facilities to Provincial Administrative Organizations in Thailand (2023–2024). Thirty-seven predictors, including demographics, benefits, and welfare domains, were analyzed. Four kernel functions were compared using 10-fold cross-validation, and feature importance was assessed. Class imbalance was addressed with the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). Results The linear kernel achieved superior cross-validated performance (accuracy: 69 ± 4%, sensitivity: 46 ± 5%, specificity: 82 ± 4%, AUC: 0.64). SMOTE improved sensitivity to 54 ± 5% while maintaining specificity at 79 ± 5%. Five stable predictors were identified across validation folds: competitive compensation (0.427), career development opportunities (0.358), fair promotion processes (0.336), hazardous work compensation (0.285), and educational leave opportunities (0.252). Comparative analysis showed that SVM outperformed logistic regression (66% accuracy), random forest (66%), and gradient boosting (65%). Conclusions This study represents the first application of machine learning techniques to predict healthcare personnel transition success in decentralization contexts. The SVM model effectively identified critical factors influencing workforce transitions, emphasizing the importance of balanced organizational support mechanisms. These findings provide evidence-based guidance for healthcare administrators implementing decentralization policies, offering generalizable insights for workforce management during health system reforms.

                Background This study delves into how university students in Ghana are using generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools to boost their creative and critical thinking skills in academic tasks. Methods By employing a convergent parallel mixed-methods approach, we gathered quantitative survey data from 490 participants and complemented it with qualitative insights from semi-structured interviews. Results The results show that AI tools spark idea generation and enhance evaluative reasoning, while students still feel a strong sense of agency, often fine-tuning or dismissing AI suggestions based on their own understanding. Nonetheless, there are ongoing concerns about ethical limits, dependency on technology, and insufficient training. Conclusions The study wraps up by suggesting that AI serves best as a cognitive partner when users are equipped with solid digital literacy and ethical guidance. We also discuss the implications for teaching, theory, and policy, offering recommendations for creating learner-centred AI integration in education.

     alt="Focused Ultrasound-Induced Peripheral Nerve Blockade: Duration of Changes to Thermal Withdrawal Latency and Nerve Structure After Focused Ultrasound Application to the Sciatic Nerve in a Rat Model of Acute Pain"/>
<p>Focused ultrasound (FUS) applied to the sciatic nerve in a rodent model of acute pain produced reversible inhibition of nociceptive, non-nociceptive sensory, and motor behaviors lasting up to 9 weeks. Nerve ultrastructure changes persisted for up to 24 weeks. These findings support FUS as a potential non-invasive method for peripheral nerve blockade to manage pain.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Focused ultrasound (FUS) holds potential to inhibit peripheral nerves to manage pain. We previously found FUS parameters resulting in changes to nerve structure and reversible increased mechanical withdrawal threshold as well as reversible inhibition of motor and non-pain sensory fibers. However, as behaviors were only followed for 4 weeks and structure for 2 weeks, the duration of increased thermal withdrawal latency and changes to nerve structure were undetermined. We investigated the duration of increased thermal withdrawal latency and nerve structure alterations after FUS application in an acute pain model. FUS was applied directly to the rat sciatic nerve prior to hindpaw (HP) incision; animal behaviors (thermal and mechanical nociceptive thresholds, HP extension and flexion) were assessed for 12 weeks and nerve structure was assessed for 28 weeks. The primary outcome was the change in HP thermal withdrawal latency. Secondary outcomes were the changes to sciatic nerve structure and HP mechanical withdrawal threshold, extension, and flexion. Compared with controls, after FUS application, animals had increased thermal nociceptive thresholds until week 9, increased mechanical nociceptive thresholds until week 2, decreased HP motor response until week 3.5, and decreased HP plantar sensation until week 4. Nerve ultrastructure changes may have persisted until week 24. In this new longer-term follow-up study, after invasive FUS application to the sciatic nerve in a rodent model of acute incisional pain, we determined the duration of changes to thermal hyperalgesia, mechanical hyperalgesia, motor, and non-pain sensory responses, and changes to nerve structure.</p>

                Using advanced transcriptomic and physiological profiling, the authors identified deep-layer long-range GABAergic projection neurons as the most disrupted neuronal subtype and key contributor to brain dysfunction in the 15q13.3 neuropsychiatric mouse model. Late-onset impairments in these neurons disrupted sleep, which was rescued by chemogenetic inhibition, offering mechanistic insight and therapeutic potential.

                Korah, Reveron-Thornton, and Fallah et al. show that a subset of cancer-associated fibroblasts in PDAC use MYD88 signaling to suppress antitumor immunity and promote tumor growth. Combining MYD88 inhibition with immune checkpoint blockade mitigates these effects, revealing new insights into stromal regulation of the tumor immune microenvironment.

                Gadek et al. show that embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma formation is defined by the presence of primary cilia and limits SHH pathway competency in early endothelial progenitor cells that disappear during embryonic development and differentiation. This potentially explains why rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common soft tissue sarcoma in children and is rare in adults.
