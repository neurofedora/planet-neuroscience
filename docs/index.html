              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">cAMP triggers Na+ absorption by distal airway surface epithelium in cystic fibrosis swine</a></h4>

              
                Hyperactive epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) is believed to contribute to excessive Na+ and fluid reabsorption in cystic fibrosis airways. This hypothesis has been challenged by studies in CFTR−/− swine showing no increased Na+ reabsorption. Luan et al. report that cAMP-stimulated distal airways of CFTR−/− swine suffer from ENaC-mediated Na+ reabsorption.

                Applying localization microscopy, Mrestani et al. introduce compaction of presynaptic active zone scaffolds and individual Bruchpilot and RIM-binding protein subclusters correlating with presynaptic homeostatic potentiation. Active zone compaction without protein recruitment enhances local molecule concentrations, which may be misjudged as enlargement by intensity-based imaging approaches.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Feature selectivity can explain mismatch signals in mouse visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Muzzu and Saleem find neurons in the mouse visual cortex responding to stops or perturbations of open-loop visual flow. Perturbation responses are enhanced by running, and responsive neurons prefer low visual speeds. These results suggest concurrent selectivity for low visual speeds and running can explain sensorimotor mismatch signals in the visual cortex.

                D’Gama et al. dissect the genetic mechanisms underlying the formation of motile ciliated ependymal cell types in the zebrafish forebrain and their function in brain and spine morphogenesis. They show that an increasing diversity of ependymal lineages depends on the sequential or parallel activation of foxj1- and gmnc-dependent transcriptional programs.

                α5-Subunit-containing GABAA receptors are believed to be mainly localized outside synapses. Lodge et al. show that these receptors are expressed in GABAergic synapses onto young hippocampal neurons, generating powerful inhibition. During maturation, these receptors are excluded from perisomatic synapses, while they continue to be present in dendrite-targeting synapses.

                The insulin-activated serine/threonine kinase serum- and glucocorticoid-induced kinase 1 (SGK1) phosphorylates an identical substrate recognition motif to Akt. Here, Zhou et al. show that, in contrast to Akt, HFD-induced SGK1 overactivation promotes insulin resistance in liver by phosphorylating and inhibiting the activity of AMP-activated protein kinase.

                Although cell-to-cell heterogeneity in gene and protein expression within cell populations has been widely documented, we know little about its biological functions. By studying progenitors of the posterior region of bird embryos, we found that expression levels of transcription factors Sox2 and Bra, respectively involved in neural tube (NT) and mesoderm specification, display a high degree of cell-to-cell heterogeneity. By combining forced expression and downregulation approaches with time-lapse imaging, we demonstrate that Sox2-to-Bra ratio guides progenitor’s motility and their ability to stay in or exit the progenitor zone to integrate neural or mesodermal tissues. Indeed, high Bra levels confer high motility that pushes cells to join the paraxial mesoderm, while high levels of Sox2 tend to inhibit cell movement forcing cells to integrate the NT. Mathematical modeling captures the importance of cell motility regulation in this process and further suggests that randomness in Sox2/Bra cell-to-cell distribution favors cell rearrangements and tissue shape conservation.

	<p>Daytime napping contributes to retention of new word learning in children. Importantly, children transition out of regular napping between ages 3–5 years, and the impact of this transition on memory is unclear. Here, we examined the performance of both non-habitually napping children (nap 0–3 days per week, n = 28) and habitually napping children (nap 4–7 days per week, n = 30) on a word learning task after a delay including either sleep or wakefulness. Children ages 3.5–4.5 years old experienced a brief exposure to two novel labels and their referents during training, a scenario that replicates learning experiences children encounter every day. After a 4-h delay, children were tested on the object-label associations. Using mixed effects logistic regression, we compared retention performance. Non-habitual nappers and habitual nappers displayed a different pattern of retention such that non-habitually napping children did equally well on a test of retention regardless of whether they napped or stayed awake during the delay. In contrast, habitually napping children needed a nap after learning to retain the novel object-label associations 4 h later. As a group, habitual nappers who remained awake after learning performed no better than chance on the retention test. As children transition out of naps, they may be less susceptible to interference and are better able to retain newly learned words across a delay including wakefulness.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Although we use our visual and tactile sensory systems interchangeably for object recognition on a daily basis, little is known about the mechanism underlying this ability. This study examined how 3D shape features of objects form two congruent and interchangeable visual and tactile perceptual spaces in healthy male and female participants. Since active exploration plays an important role in shape processing, a virtual reality environment was used to visually explore 3D objects called digital embryos without using the tactile sense. In addition, during the tactile procedure, blindfolded participants actively palpated a 3D-printed version of the same objects with both hands. We first demonstrated that the visual and tactile perceptual spaces were highly similar. We then extracted a series of 3D shape features to investigate how visual and tactile exploration can lead to the correct identification of the relationships between objects. The results indicate that both modalities share the same shape features to form highly similar veridical spaces. This finding suggests that visual and tactile systems might apply similar cognitive processes to sensory inputs that enable humans to rely merely on one modality in the absence of another to recognize surrounding objects.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is an essential component of the basal ganglia and has long been considered to be a part of the ventral thalamus. However, recent neurodevelopmental data indicated that this nucleus is of hypothalamic origin which is now commonly acknowledged. In this work, we aimed to verify whether the inclusion of the STN in the hypothalamus could influence the way we understand and conduct research on the organization of the whole ventral and posterior diencephalon. Developmental and neurochemical data indicate that the STN is part of a larger glutamatergic posterior hypothalamic region that includes the premammillary and mammillary nuclei. The main anatomic characteristic common to this region involves the convergent cortical and pallidal projections that it receives, which is based on the model of the hyperdirect and indirect pathways to the STN. This whole posterior hypothalamic region is then integrated into distinct functional networks that interact with the ventral mesencephalon to adjust behavior depending on external and internal contexts.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) is an essential component of the brain circuitry supporting long-term memory by serving as an interface between the hippocampus and neocortex. Dysfunction of the LEC affects sensory coding in the hippocampus, leading to a view that the LEC provides the hippocampus with highly processed sensory information. It remains unclear, however, how the LEC modulates neural processing in the neocortical regions. To address this point, we pharmacologically inactivated the LEC of male rats during a temporal associative learning task and examined its impact on local network activity in one of the LEC's efferent targets, the prelimbic region of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Rats were exposed to two neutral stimuli, one of which was paired with an aversive eyelid shock over a short temporal delay. The LEC inhibition reduced the expression of anticipatory blinking responses to the reinforced stimuli without increasing responses to nonreinforced stimuli. In control rats, both the reinforced and nonreinforced stimuli evoked a short-lived, wide-band increase in the prelimbic network activity. With learning, the initial increase of gamma-band activity started to extend into the interval between the reinforced neutral stimulus and the eyelid shock. LEC inhibition attenuated the learning-induced sustained activity, without affecting the initial transient activity. These results suggest that the integrity of LEC is necessary for the formation of temporal stimulus associations and its neural correlates in the mPFC. Given the minimal effects on the innate network responses to sensory stimuli, the LEC appears not to be the main source of sensory inputs to the mPFC; rather it may provide a framework that shapes the mPFC network response to behaviorally relevant cues.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The importance of urgency in decision making based on dynamic information</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lorenzo Ferrucci, Aldo Genovesio, Encarni Marcos</p>

A standard view in the literature is that decisions are the result of a process that accumulates evidence in favor of each alternative until such accumulation reaches a threshold and a decision is made. However, this view has been recently questioned by an alternative proposal that suggests that, instead of accumulated, evidence is combined with an urgency signal. Both theories have been mathematically formalized and supported by a variety of decision-making tasks with constant information. However, recently, tasks with changing information have shown to be more effective to study the dynamics of decision making. Recent research using one of such tasks, the tokens task, has shown that decisions are better described by an urgency mechanism than by an accumulation one. However, the results of that study could depend on a task where all fundamental information was noiseless and always present, favoring a mechanism of non-integration, such as the urgency one. Here, we wanted to address whether the same conclusions were also supported by an experimental paradigm in which sensory evidence was removed shortly after it was provided, making working memory necessary to properly perform the task. Here, we show that, under such condition, participants’ behavior could be explained by an urgency-gating mechanism that low-pass filters the mnemonic information and combines it with an urgency signal that grows with time but not by an accumulation process that integrates the same mnemonic information. Thus, our study supports the idea that, under certain situations with dynamic sensory information, decisions are better explained by an urgency-gating mechanism than by an accumulation one.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Choice history effects in mice and humans improve reward harvesting efficiency</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Samuel López-Yépez Junior, Juliane Martin, Oliver Hulme, Duda Kvitsiani</p>

Choice history effects describe how future choices depend on the history of past choices. In experimental tasks this is typically framed as a bias because it often diminishes the experienced reward rates. However, in natural habitats, choices made in the past constrain choices that can be made in the future. For foraging animals, the probability of earning a reward in a given patch depends on the degree to which the animals have exploited the patch in the past. One problem with many experimental tasks that show choice history effects is that such tasks artificially decouple choice history from its consequences on reward availability over time. To circumvent this, we use a variable interval (VI) reward schedule that reinstates a more natural contingency between past choices and future reward availability. By examining the behavior of optimal agents in the VI task we discover that choice history effects observed in animals serve to maximize reward harvesting efficiency. We further distil the function of choice history effects by manipulating first- and second-order statistics of the environment. We find that choice history effects primarily reflect the growth rate of the reward probability of the unchosen option, whereas reward history effects primarily reflect environmental volatility. Based on observed choice history effects in animals, we develop a reinforcement learning model that explicitly incorporates choice history over multiple time scales into the decision process, and we assess its predictive adequacy in accounting for the associated behavior. We show that this new variant, known as the double trace model, has a higher performance in predicting choice data, and shows near optimal reward harvesting efficiency in simulated environments. These results suggests that choice history effects may be adaptive for natural contingencies between consumption and reward availability. This concept lends credence to a normative account of choice history effects that extends beyond its description as a bias.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Regulation of transcription reactivation dynamics exiting mitosis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sergio Sarnataro, Andrea Riba, Nacho Molina</p>

Proliferating cells experience a global reduction of transcription during mitosis, yet their cell identity is maintained and regulatory information is propagated from mother to daughter cells. Mitotic bookmarking by transcription factors has been proposed as a potential mechanism to ensure the reactivation of transcription at the proper set of genes exiting mitosis. Recently, mitotic transcription and waves of transcription reactivation have been observed in synchronized populations of human hepatoma cells. However, the study did not consider that mitotic-arrested cell populations progressively desynchronize leading to measurements of gene expression on a mixture of cells at different internal cell-cycle times. Moreover, it is not well understood yet what is the precise role of mitotic bookmarking on mitotic transcription as well as on the transcription reactivation waves. Ultimately, the core gene regulatory network driving the precise transcription reactivation dynamics remains to be identified. To address these questions, we developed a mathematical model to correct for the progressive desynchronization of cells and estimate gene expression dynamics with respect to a cell-cycle pseudotime. Furthermore, we used a multiple linear regression model to infer transcription factor activity dynamics. Our analysis allows us to characterize waves of transcription factor activities exiting mitosis and predict a core gene regulatory network responsible of the transcription reactivation dynamics. Moreover, we identified more than 60 transcription factors that are highly active during mitosis and represent new candidates of mitotic bookmarking factors which could be relevant therapeutic targets to control cell proliferation.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The majority of patients with a familial cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) referred for molecular screening do not show pathogenic variants in known genes. In this study, we aimed to identify novel CSVD causal genes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a gene-based collapsing test of rare protein truncating variants identified in exome data of 258 unrelated CSVD patients of an ethnically matched control cohort and of two publicly available large-scale databases, gnomAD and TOPMed. Western blotting was used to investigate variants functional consequences. Clinical and MRI features of mutated patients were characterized.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We showed that <i>LAMB1</i> truncating variants escaping nonsense-mediated mRNA decay are strongly overrepresented in CSVD patients, reaching genome-wide significance (p &lt; 5 x10<sup>-8</sup>). Using two antibodies recognizing the N-and C-terminal parts of LAMB1, we showed that truncated forms of LAMB1 are expressed in patients’ endogenous fibroblasts and are trapped in the cytosol. These variants are associated with a novel phenotype characterized by the association of a hippocampal type episodic memory defect and a diffuse vascular leukoencephalopathy.</p>
<h2>I<b>nterpretation</b>
</h2>
<p>These findings are important for diagnosis and clinical care, to avoid unnecessary and sometimes invasive investigations, and also from a mechanistic point of view to understand the role of extracellular matrix proteins in neuronal homeostasis.</p>

                Background: The gene FOXO3a has been elucidated to govern the development of chronic granulocytic leukemia (CGL). Moreover, it has been suggested that the levels of FOXO3a in circulation are affected by the FOXO3a rs4946936 gene polymorphism. However, no study has assessed the correlation between the FOXO3a rs4946936 gene polymorphism and the levels of FOXO3a. The objective of this study was to assess the association between the FOXO3a rs4946936 gene polymorphism and the levels of FOXO3a in CGL patients treated with imatinib mesylate.  Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from February 2019 to February 2020. The genotyping of FOXO3a rs4946936 gene polymorphism was conducted using PCR-RFLP, and the levels of FOXO3a were assessed using ELISA. The association between the FOXO3a rs4946936 gene polymorphism and the levels of FOXO3a were assessed using multiple logistic regression.  Results: A total of 60 CGL patients were assessed in our study. Among them, the CC, CT, and TT genotypes of the FOXO3a rs4946936 gene polymorphism were 35.0%, 48.3%, and 16.7% respectively. Our calculation revealed that elevated levels of FOXO3a were found in CGL patients with the CC genotype of the FOXO3a rs4946936 gene polymorphism. While we failed to clarify the association between either the CT or the TT genotype of FOXO3a rs4946936 gene polymorphism and the levels of FOXO3a.  Conclusion: Our study identifies that the CC genotype of the FOXO3a rs4946936 gene polymorphism affects the elevated levels of FOXO3a in CGL patients treated with imatinib mesylate.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Performing post-genome-wide association study analysis: overview, challenges and recommendations [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide  huge information on statistically significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with various human complex traits and diseases. By performing GWAS studies, scientists have successfully identified the association of hundreds of thousands to  millions of SNPs to a single phenotype. Moreover, the association of some SNPs with rare diseases has been intensively tested. However, classic GWAS studies have not yet provided solid, knowledgeable insight into functional and biological mechanisms underlying phenotypes or mechanisms of diseases. Therefore, several post-GWAS (pGWAS) methods have been recommended. Currently, there is no simple scientific document to provide a quick guide for performing pGWAS analysis. pGWAS is a crucial step for a better understanding of the biological machinery beyond the SNPs. Here, we provide an overview to performing pGWAS analysis and demonstrate the challenges behind each method. Furthermore, we direct readers to key articles for each pGWAS method and present the overall issues in pGWAS analysis.  Finally, we include a custom pGWAS pipeline to guide new users when performing their research.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Modelling sentiments based on objectivity and subjectivity with self-attention mechanisms [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The proliferation of digital commerce has allowed merchants to reach out to a wider customer base, prompting a study of customer reviews to gauge service and product quality through sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis can be enhanced through subjectivity and objectivity classification with attention mechanisms. Methods: This research includes input corpora of contrasting levels of subjectivity and objectivity from different databases to perform sentiment analysis on user reviews, incorporating attention mechanisms at the aspect level. Three large corpora are chosen as the subjectivity and objectivity datasets, the Shopee user review dataset (ShopeeRD) for subjectivity, together with the Wikipedia English dataset (Wiki-en) and Internet Movie Database (IMDb) for objectivity. Word embeddings are created using Word2Vec with Skip-Gram. Then, a bidirectional LSTM with an attention layer (LSTM-ATT) imposed on word vectors. The performance of the model is evaluated and benchmarked against classification models of Logistics Regression (LR) and Linear SVC (L-SVC). Three models are trained with subjectivity (70% of ShopeeRD) and the objectivity (Wiki-en) embeddings, with ten-fold cross-validation. Next, the three models are evaluated against two datasets (IMDb and 20% of ShopeeRD). The experiments are based on benchmark comparisons, embedding comparison and model comparison with 70-10-20 train-validation-test splits. Data augmentation using AUG-BERT is performed and selected models incorporating AUG-BERT, are compared. Results: L-SVC scored the highest accuracy with 56.9% for objective embeddings (Wiki-en) while the LSTM-ATT scored 69.0% on subjective embeddings (ShopeeRD).  Improved performances were observed with data augmentation using AUG-BERT, where the LSTM-ATT+AUG-BERT model scored the highest accuracy at 60.0% for objective embeddings and 70.0% for subjective embeddings, compared to 57% (objective) and 69% (subjective) for L-SVC+AUG-BERT, and 56% (objective) and 68% (subjective) for L-SVC. Conclusions: Utilizing attention layers with subjectivity and objectivity notions has shown improvement to the accuracy of sentiment analysis models.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Myogenin controls via AKAP6 non-centrosomal microtubule organizing center formation at the nuclear envelope</a></h4>

              
                Non-centrosomal microtubule organizing centers (MTOC) are pivotal for the function of multiple cell types, but the processes initiating their formation are unknown. Here, we find that the transcription factor myogenin is required in murine myoblasts for the localization of MTOC proteins to the nuclear envelope. Moreover, myogenin is sufficient in fibroblasts for nuclear envelope MTOC (NE-MTOC) formation and centrosome attenuation. Bioinformatics combined with loss- and gain-of-function experiments identified induction of AKAP6 expression as one central mechanism for myogenin-mediated NE-MTOC formation. Promoter studies indicate that myogenin preferentially induces the transcription of muscle- and NE-MTOC-specific isoforms of <i>Akap6</i> and <i>Syne1</i>, which encodes nesprin-1α, the NE-MTOC anchor protein in muscle cells. Overexpression of AKAP6β and nesprin-1α was sufficient to recruit endogenous MTOC proteins to the nuclear envelope of myoblasts in the absence of myogenin. Taken together, our results illuminate how mammals transcriptionally control the switch from a centrosomal MTOC to an NE-MTOC and identify AKAP6 as a novel NE-MTOC component in muscle cells.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The transcription factor Xrp1 is required for PERK-mediated antioxidant gene induction in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                PERK is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transmembrane sensor that phosphorylates eIF2a to initiate the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). eIF2a phosphorylation promotes stress-responsive gene expression most notably through the transcription factor ATF4 that contains a regulatory 5' leader. Possible PERK effectors other than ATF4 remain poorly understood. Here, we report that the bZIP transcription factor Xrp1 is required for ATF4-independent PERK signaling. Cell type-specific gene expression profiling in <i>Drosophila</i> indicated that delta-family glutathione-S-transferases (<i>gstD</i>) are prominently induced by the UPR-activating transgene <i>Rh1<sup>G69D</sup></i>. <i>Perk </i>was necessary and sufficient for such <i>gstD</i> induction, but<i> ATF4 </i>was not required. Instead, <i>Perk </i>and other regulators of eIF2a phosphorylation regulated Xrp1 protein levels to induce <i>gstDs</i>. The <i>Xrp1 </i>5' leader has a conserved upstream Open Reading Frame (uORF) analogous to those that regulate <i>ATF4 </i>translation. The <i>gstD-GFP</i> reporter induction required putative Xrp1 binding sites. These results indicate that antioxidant genes are highly induced by a previously unrecognized UPR signaling axis consisting of PERK and Xrp1.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Parallel functional testing identifies enhancers active in early postnatal mouse brain</a></h4>

              
                Enhancers are cis-regulatory elements that play critical regulatory roles in modulating developmental transcription programs and driving cell-type specific and context-dependent gene expression in the brain. The development of massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) has enabled high-throughput functional screening of candidate DNA sequences for enhancer activity. Tissue-specific screening of <i>in vivo</i> enhancer function at scale has the potential to greatly expand our understanding of the role of non-coding sequences in development, evolution, and disease. Here, we adapted a self-transcribing regulatory element MPRA strategy for delivery to early postnatal mouse brain via recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV). We identified and validated putative enhancers capable of driving reporter gene expression in mouse forebrain, including regulatory elements within an intronic <i>CACNA1C</i> linkage disequilibrium block associated with risk in neuropsychiatric disorder genetic studies. Paired screening and single enhancer <i>in vivo</i> functional testing, as we show here, represents a powerful approach towards characterizing regulatory activity of enhancers and understanding how enhancer sequences organize gene expression in the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Single-cell growth inference of Corynebacterium glutamicum reveals asymptoticallylinear growth</a></h4>

              
                Regulation of growth and cell size is crucial for the optimization of bacterial cellular function. So far, single bacterial cells have been found to grow predominantly exponentially, which implies the need for tight regulation to maintain cell size homeostasis. Here, we characterize the growth behavior of the apically growing bacterium Corynebacterium glutamicum using a novel broadly applicable inference method for single-cell growth dynamics. Using this approach, we find that C. glutamicum exhibits asymptotically linear single-cell growth. To explain this growth mode, we model elongation as being rate-limited by the apical growth mechanism. Our model accurately reproduces the inferred cell growth dynamics and is validated with elongation measurements on a transglycosylase deficient ΔrodA mutant. Finally, with simulations we show that the distribution of cell lengths is narrower for linear than exponential growth, suggesting that this asymptotically linear growth mode can act as a substitute for tight division length and division symmetry regulation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Y chromosome functions in mammalian spermatogenesis</a></h4>

              
                The mammalian Y chromosome is critical for male sex determination and spermatogenesis. However, linking each Y gene to specific aspects of male reproduction has been challenging. As the Y chromosome is notoriously hard to sequence and target, functional studies have mostly relied on transgene-rescue approaches using mouse models with large multi-gene deletions. These experimental limitations have oriented the field toward the search for a minimum set of Y genes necessary for male reproduction. Here, considering Y-chromosome evolutionary history and decades of discoveries, we review the current state of research on its function in spermatogenesis and reassess the view that many Y genes are disposable for male reproduction.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Early life experience sets hard limits on motor learning as evidenced from artificial arm use</a></h4>

              
                The study of artificial arms provides a unique opportunity to address long-standing questions on sensorimotor plasticity and development. Learning to use an artificial arm arguably depends on fundamental building blocks of body representation and would therefore be impacted by early-life experience. We tested artificial arm motor-control in two adult populations with upper-limb deficiencies: a congenital group - individuals who were born with a partial arm, and an acquired group - who lost their arm following amputation in adulthood. Brain plasticity research teaches us that the earlier we train to acquire new skills (or use a new technology) the better we benefit from this practice as adults. Instead, we found that although the congenital group started using an artificial arm as toddlers, they produced increased error noise and directional errors when reaching to visual targets, relative to the acquired group who performed similarly to controls. However, the earlier an individual with a congenital limb difference was fitted with an artificial arm, the better their motor control was. Since we found no group differences when reaching without visual feedback, we suggest that the ability to perform efficient visual-based corrective movements is highly dependent on either biological or artificial arm experience at a very young age. Subsequently, opportunities for sensorimotor plasticity become more limited.

                AAV gene therapies aimed at curing inherited retinal diseases to date have typically focused on photoreceptors and retinal pigmented epithelia within the relatively accessible outer retina. However, therapeutic targeting in diseases such as congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) that involve defects in ON-bipolar cells (ON-BCs) within the mid-retina has been challenged by the relative inaccessibility of the target cell in intact retinas, the limited transduction efficiency of these cells by existing AAV serotypes, poor availability of established ON-BC-specific promoters, and absence of appropriate patient-relevant large animal models. Here, we demonstrate safe and effective ON-BC targeting by AAV gene therapy in a recently characterized naturally-occurring canine model of CSNB, LRIT3-CSNB. To effectively target ON-BCs, new AAV capsid variants with ON-BC tropism and ON-BC specific modified GRM6 promoters were adopted to ensure cell-specific transgene expression. Notably, subretinal injection of one vector, AAVK9#4-shGRM6-cLRIT3-WPRE, significantly recovered rod-derived b-wave in all treated eyes (6/6) of adult dogs injected at 1-3 years of age. The robust therapeutic effect was evident 7 weeks post-injection and was sustained for at least 1 year in all treated eyes. Scotopic vision was significantly improved in treated eyes based on visually-guided obstacle course navigation. Restoration of LRIT3 signals was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Thus, we report on the first ON-BC functional rescue in a large animal model using a novel AAV capsid variant and modified promoter construct optimized for ON-BC specificity, thereby establishing both proof-of-concept and a novel translational platform for treatment of CSNB in patients with defects in photoreceptor-to-bipolar signaling.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Functional interaction between Drosophila olfactory sensory neurons and their support cells</a></h4>

              
                Insects detect volatile chemicals using antennae, which house a vast variety of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) that innervate hair-like structures called sensilla where odor detection takes place. In addition to OSNs, the antenna also hosts various support cell types. These include the triad of trichogen, tormogen and thecogen support cells that lie adjacent to their respective OSNs. The arrangement of OSN supporting cells occurs stereotypically for all sensilla and is widely conserved in evolution. While insect chemosensory neurons have received considerable attention, little is known about the functional significance of the cells that support them. For instance, it remains unknown whether support cells play an active role in odor detection, or only passively contribute to homeostasis, e.g. by maintaining sensillum lymph composition. To investigate the functional interaction between OSNs and support cells, we used optical and electrophysiological approaches in Drosophila. First, we characterized the distribution of various supporting cells using genetic markers. By means of an ex vivo antennal preparation and genetically-encoded Ca2+ and K+ indicators, we then studied the activation of these auxiliary cells during odor presentation in adult flies. We observed acute responses and distinct differences in Ca2+ and K+ fluxes between support cell types. Finally, we observed alterations in OSN responses upon thecogen cell ablation in mature adults. Upon inducible ablation of thecogen cells, we notice a gain in mechanical responsiveness to mechanical stimulations during single-sensillum recording, but a lack of change to neuronal resting activity. Taken together, these results demonstrate that support cells play a more active and responsive role during odor processing than previously thought. Our observations thus reveal that support cells functionally interact with OSNs and may be important for the extraordinary ability of insect olfactory systems to dynamically and sensitively discriminate between odors in the turbulent sensory landscape of insect flight.

                The p.H157Y variant of TREM2 (Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2) has been reported to increase Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk. This mutation in the extracellular domain of TREM2 localizes at the cleavage site, leading to enhanced shedding. Here, we generated a novel Trem2 H157Y knock-in mouse model to investigate how this H157Y mutation impacts TREM2 proteolytic processing, synaptic function, and AD-related amyloid pathology. Consistent with previous in vitro findings, TREM2-H157Y increases the amount of soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) in the cortex and serum of mutant mice compared to the wild type controls. Interestingly, the Trem2 H157Y variant enhances synaptic plasticity without affecting microglial density and morphology. In the presence of amyloid pathology, TREM2-H157Y surprisingly accelerates A{beta} clearance and reduces amyloid burden and microgliosis. Taken together, our findings support a beneficial effect of the Trem2 H157Y mutation in synaptic function and in mitigating amyloid pathology. Considering the genetic association of TREM2 p.H157Y with AD, we speculate TREM2-H157Y might increase AD risk through an amyloid-independent pathway, as such its effects on tauopathy and neurodegeneration merit further investigation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Olfactory-driven beta band entrainment of limbic circuitry during neonatal development</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive processing relies on the functional refinement of the limbic circuitry during the first two weeks of life. During this developmental period, when most sensory systems are still immature, the sense of olfaction acts as 'door to the world', providing the main source of environmental inputs. However, it is unknown whether early olfactory processing shapes the development of the limbic circuitry. Here, we address this question by combining simultaneous in vivo recordings from the olfactory bulb (OB), lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC), hippocampus (HP), and prefrontal cortex (PFC) with opto- and chemogenetic manipulations of mitral/tufted cells (M/TCs) in the OB of non-anesthetized neonatal mice. We show that the neonatal OB synchronizes the limbic circuity in beta frequency range. Moreover, it drives neuronal and network activity in LEC, as well as subsequently, HP and PFC via long-range projections from mitral cells (MCs) to HP-projecting LEC neurons. Thus, OB activity controls the communications within limbic circuits during neonatal development.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Slow oscillations provide the spatio-temporal framework for long-range neural communication during sleep</a></h4>

              
                Slow oscillations (SOs, <1Hz) during non-rapid eye movement sleep are thought to reflect sleep homeostasis and support memory consolidation. Yet, the fundamental properties of SOs and their impact on neural network communication are not understood. We used effective connectivity to estimate causal information flow across the electrode manifold during SOs and found two peak of information flow in specific phases of the SO. We show causal communication during non-rapid eye movement sleep peaks during specific phases of the SO, but only across long distances. We confirmed this prediction by cluster analysis demonstrating greater flow in global, compared with local, SOs. Finally, we tested the functional significance of these results by examining which SO properties supported overnight episodic memory improvement, with the underlying assumption that memory consolidation would engage global, long-range communication. Indeed, episodic memory improvement was predicted only by the SO properties with greatest causal information flow, i.e., longest distances between sinks and sources and global, but not local, SOs. These findings explain how NREM sleep (characterized as a state of low brain connectivity) leverages SO-induced selective information flow to coordinate a wide network of brain regions during memory formation.

                Neuroimaging using more ecologically valid stimuli such as audiobooks has advanced our understanding of natural language comprehension in the brain. However, prior naturalistic stimuli have typically been restricted to a single language, which limited generalizability beyond small typological domains. Here we present the "Le Petit Prince fMRI Corpus" (LPPC-fMRI), a multilingual resource for research in the cognitive neuroscience of speech and language during naturalistic listening (Open-Neuro: ds003643). 49 English speakers, 35 Chinese speakers and 28 French speakers listened to the same audiobook "The Little Prince" in their native language while multi-echo functional magnetic resonance imaging was acquired. We also provide time-aligned speech annotation and word-by-word predictors obtained using natural language processing tools. The resulting timeseries data are shown to be of high quality with good temporal signal-to-noise ratio and high inter-subject correlation. Data-driven functional analyses provide further evidence of data quality. This annotated, multilingual fMRI dataset facilitates future re-analysis that addresses cross-linguistic commonalities and differences in the neural substrate of language processing on multiple perceptual and linguistic levels.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural basis for adaptive motor behavior during car driving</a></h4>

              
                Car driving is supported by motor skills trained through continuous daily practice. One of the skills unique to expert drivers is the ability to detect abrupt changes in the driving environment and then quickly adapt their operation mode to the changes. Previous functional neuroimaging studies on motor control investigated the mechanisms underlying behaviors adaptive to changes in control properties of simple experimental devices such as a computer mouse or a joystick. The switching of multiple internal models mainly engages adaptive behaviors and underlies the interplay between the cerebellum and frontoparietal network (FPN) regions as the neural process. However, it remains unclear whether the neural mechanisms identified through an experimental paradigm using such simple devices also underlie practical driving behaviors. In the current study, we measure functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activities while participants control a realistic driving simulator inside the MRI scanner. Here, the accelerator sensitivity of a virtual car is abruptly changed, requiring participants to respond to this change as quickly as possible. We first compare brain activities before and after the sensitivity change. As a result, sensorimotor areas, including the left cerebellum, increase their activities after the sensitivity change. Moreover, after the change, activity significantly increases in the inferior parietal lobe and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, parts of the FPN regions. By contrast, the posterior cingulate cortex, a part of the default mode network, deactivates after the sensitivity change. Our results suggest that the neural bases found in previous experiments using the simpler devices can serve as the foundation of adaptive car driving. At the same time, this study also highlights the unique contribution of non-motor-related regions to addressing the high cognitive demands of driving.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Microglia mediate synaptic plasticity induced by 10 Hz repetitive magnetic stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that is widely used in clinical practice for therapeutic purposes. Nevertheless, the mechanisms that mediate its therapeutic effects remain poorly understood. Recent work implicates that microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, have a defined role in the regulation of physiological brain function, e.g. the expression of synaptic plasticity. Despite this observation, no evidence exists for a role of microglia in excitatory synaptic plasticity induced by rTMS. Here, we used repetitive magnetic stimulation of organotypic entorhino-hippocampal tissue cultures to test for the role of microglia in synaptic plasticity induced by 10 Hz repetitive magnetic stimulation (rMS). For this purpose, we performed PLX3397 (Pexidartinib) treatment to deplete microglia from tissue culture preparations. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, live-cell microscopy, immunohistochemistry and transcriptome analysis, we assessed structural and functional properties of both CA1 pyramidal neurons and microglia to correlate the microglia phenotype to synaptic plasticity. PLX3397 treatment over 18 days reliably depletes microglia in tissue cultures, without affecting structural and functional properties of CA1 pyramidal neurons. Microglia-depleted cultures display defects in the ability of CA1 pyramidal neurons to express plasticity of excitatory synapses upon rMS. Notably, rMS induces a moderate release of proinflammatory and plasticity-promoting factors, while microglial morphology stays unaltered. We conclude that microglia play a crucial role in rMS-induced excitatory synaptic plasticity.

                Language is a key part of human cognition. Whereas many neurocognitive abilities decline with age, for language the picture is much less clear and how exactly language processing changes with aging is still unknown. To investigate this, we employed magnetoencephalography (MEG) and recorded neuromagnetic brain responses to auditory linguistic stimuli in healthy participants of younger and older age using a passive task-free paradigm and a range of different linguistic stimulus contrasts, which enabled us to assess neural language processes at multiple levels (lexical, semantic, morphosyntactic). By using machine learning-based classification algorithms to scrutinise intertrial phase coherence of MEG responses in source space, we found significant differences between younger and older participants across several frequency bands and for all tested processing types, which shows multiple changes in the brain's neurolinguistic circuits which may be due to both healthy aging in general and compensatory processes in particular.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Severe distortion in the representation of foveal visual image locations in short term memory</a></h4>

              
                The foveal visual image region provides the human visual system with the highest acuity. However, it is unclear whether such a high fidelity representational advantage is maintained when foveal image locations are committed to short term memory. Here we describe a paradoxically large distortion in foveal target location recall by humans. We briefly presented small, but high contrast, points of light at eccentricities ranging from 0.1 to 12 deg, while subjects maintained their line of sight on a stable target. After a brief memory period, the subjects indicated the remembered target locations via computer controlled cursors. The biggest localization errors, in terms of both directional deviations and amplitude percentage overshoots or undershoots, occurred for the most foveal targets, and such distortions were still present, albeit with qualitatively different patterns, when subjects shifted their gaze to indicate the remembered target locations. Foveal visual images are severely distorted in short term memory.

                Neuroimaging studies have reported functional connectome aberrancies in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, the time-varying patterns of connectome topology in ASD individuals and the connection between these patterns and gene expression profiles remain unknown. To investigate case-control differences in dynamic connectome topology, we conducted mega- and meta-analyses of resting-state fMRI data of 939 participants (440 ASD patients and 499 healthy controls, all males) from 18 sites, selected from the ABIDE (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) dataset. Functional data was preprocessed using harmonized protocols, and brain module dynamics was assessed using a multilayer network model. We further leveraged postmortem brain-wide gene expression data to identify transcriptomic signatures associated with ASD-related alterations in brain dynamics. Compared to healthy controls, ASD individuals exhibited a higher global mean and lower standard deviation of whole-brain module dynamics, indicating an unstable and less regionally differentiated pattern. More specifically, ASD individuals showed increased module switching, primarily in the default-mode regions, and reduced switching in the visual regions, with the largest case-control differences in the medial prefrontal cortex. These alterations in brain dynamics were predictive of social impairments in ASD individuals and were linked with expression profiles of genes primarily involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter transport and secretion, as well as with previously identified autism-related genes. This study is the first to identify consistent alterations in brain network dynamics in ASD, and the transcriptomic signatures related to those alterations, furthering insights into the biological basis behind this disorder.

                Temporal nesting of cortical slow oscillations (SO), thalamic spindles and hippocampal ripples indicates the succession of regional neuronal interactions required for memory consolidation. However how the thalamic activity during spindles organizes hippocampal dynamics remains largely undetermined. We analyzed simultaneous recordings of anterodorsal thalamus and CA1 in mice to determine the contribution of thalamic spindles in cross-regional synchronization. Our results indicated that temporal hippocampo-thalamocortical coupling were more enhanced during slower and longer thalamic spindles. Additionally, spindles occurring closer to SO trough were more strongly coupled to ripples. We found that the temporal association between CA1 spiking/ripples and thalamic spindles was stronger following spatial exploration compared to baseline sleep. We further developed a hippocampal-thalamocortical model to explain the mechanism underlying the duration and frequency-dependent coupling of thalamic spindles to hippocampal activity. Our findings shed light on our understanding of the functional role of thalamic activity during spindles on multi-regional information transfer.

                An improved understanding of the molecular basis of alcohol seeking despite the catastrophic consequences of alcohol abuse is likely to enrich our treatments for Alcohol Use Disorders (AUD) and comorbidities. The compulsive seeking is characterized by an imbalance between the superior drive to substance and disruption in control of substance use. To model the development of compulsive engagement of alcohol seeking, we exploit two distinct behavioral programs of C. elegans in conflict, ethanol preference and avoidance of aversive stimulus, simultaneously. We demonstrate that C. elegans exhibited the recapitulation of the pivotal features of compulsive alcohol seeking in mammals, which are repeated attempts, endurance, and finally aversion-resistant ethanol seeking. We find that the neuropeptide signaling via SEB-3, CRF receptor-like GPCR, facilitates the development of ethanol preference and compels animals to seek ethanol compulsively. Furthermore, our functional genomic approach and behavioral elucidation suggest the interaction between neuropeptidergic signaling, SEB-3 and TKR-1, Neurokinin receptor orthologue, to progress compulsive ethanol seeking behavior.

                Humans can perceive and discriminate vibration frequency, yet the central representation of this fundamental feature is unknown. Using fMRI, we discovered that cortical responses are tuned for vibration frequency. Voxel tuning was biased in a manner that reflects perceptual sensitivity and the response profile of the Pacinian afferent system. These results imply the existence of tuned populations that may encode naturalistic vibrations according to their constituent spectra.

                Despite increasing use of in-vivo multielectrode array (MEA) implants for basic research and medical applications, the critical structural interfaces formed between the implants and the brain parenchyma, remain elusive. Prevailing view assumes that formation of multicellular inflammatory encapsulating-scar around the implants (the foreign body response) degrades the implant electrophysiological functions. Using gold mushroom shaped microelectrodes (gMEs) based perforated polyimide MEA platforms (PPMPs) that in contrast to standard probes can be thin sectioned along with the interfacing parenchyma; we examined here for the first time the interfaces formed between brains parenchyma and implanted 3D vertical microelectrode platforms at the ultrastructural level. Our study demonstrates remarkable regenerative processes including neuritogenesis, axon myelination, synapse formation and capillaries regrowth in contact and around the implant. In parallel, we document that individual microglia adhere tightly and engulf the gMEs. Modeling of the formed microglia-electrode junctions suggest that this configuration suffice to account for the low and deteriorating recording qualities of in vivo MEA implants. These observations help define the anticipated hurdles to adapting the advantageous 3D in-vitro vertical-electrode technologies to in-vivo settings, and suggest that improving the recording qualities and durability of planar or 3D in-vivo electrode implants will require developing approaches to eliminate the insulating microglia junctions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pain is so close to pleasure: the same dopamine neurons can mediate approach and avoidance in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                In mammals, dopamine is considered a central neuromodulator involved in all kinds of rewarding experiences ('common currency' hypothesis). In insects, the role of dopaminergic neurons in aversive stimuli was discovered before dopaminergic neurons were found to also be involved in processing appetitive stimuli. Here, we screened about 50 transgenic Drosophila lines, representing different subpopulations of dopaminergic neurons for their ability to sustain approach or avoidance behavior, when activated optogenetically in four different operant self-stimulation paradigms. None of the lines sustain consistent behavioral valence in all experiments. Individual lines sustain approach in one experiment and avoidance in another. One line mediated strong avoidance early in the experiment and weak approach in later stages. The evidence presented here appears to contradict a 'common currency' dopamine function in flies. Instead, different dopaminergic neurons convey valence in a context-dependent and flexible manner, reflecting the genetic heterogeneity of the dopaminergic neuronal population.

                Actions are biased by the outcomes they can produce: Humans are more likely to show action under reward prospect, but hold back under punishment prospect. Such motivational biases derive not only from biased response selection, but also from biased learning: humans tend to attribute rewards to their own actions, but are reluctant to attribute punishments to having held back. The neural origin of these biases is unclear; in particular, it remains open whether motivational biases arise solely from an evolutionarily old, subcortical architecture or also due to younger, cortical influences. Simultaneous EEG-fMRI allowed us to track which regions encoded biased prediction errors in which order. Biased prediction errors occurred in cortical regions (ACC, vmPFC, PCC) before subcortical regions (striatum). These results highlight that biased learning is not a mere feature of the basal ganglia, but arises through prefrontal cortical contributions, revealing motivational biases to be a potentially flexible, sophisticated mechanism.

                Thalamo-cortical networks are central to seizures, yet it's unclear how these circuits initiate the seizures. Here, we test the hypothesis that a facial region of the thalamus, the VPM, is a source of convulsive, tonic-clonic seizures. We devised an in vivo optogenetic mouse model to elicit tonic-clonic seizures by driving convergent input to the VPM. With viral tracing, we show dense cerebellar and cerebral cortical afferent input to the VPM. Lidocaine microinfusions into the cerebellar nuclei selectively block seizure initiation. We perform single-unit electrophysiology recordings during awake, convulsive seizures to define the local activity of thalamic neurons before, during, and after seizure onset. We find highly dynamic activity with biphasic properties, raising the possibility that heterogenous activity patterns promote seizures. These data reveal the VPM as a source of tonic-clonic seizures, with cerebellar input providing the predominant signals.

	<p>Objective: To describe the sleep problems experienced by children with Down syndrome attending a tertiary sleep clinic and relationship with behaviour, function and cognition. Methods: Data were collected from children with Down syndrome aged 3–18 years old. Carers completed the Abbreviated Child Sleep Habits Questionnaire, Child Behaviour Checklist and Life-Habits Questionnaire at enrolment. Cognitive assessment (Stanford-Binet 5) was undertaken by a trained psychologist. Children received management for their sleep problem as clinically indicated. Results: Forty-two subjects with a median age of 6.8 years (Interquartile Range-IQR 4.5, 9.8) were enrolled. A total of 92% were referred with snoring or symptoms of Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA), with 79% of those referred having had previous ENT surgery. Thus, 85% of all participants underwent a sleep study and 61% were diagnosed with OSA (OAHI ≥ 1/h). Based on questionnaires, 86% of respondents indicated that their child had a significant sleep disorder and non-respiratory sleep problems were common. Non-respiratory problems included: trouble going to sleep independently (45%), restless sleep (76%), night-time waking (24%) and bedtime resistance (22%). No significant correlations were found between sleep measures (behavioural and medical sleep problems) and the behavioural, functional or cognitive parameters. Conclusion: Sleep disorders were very common, especially non-respiratory sleep problems. OSA was common despite previous surgery. No association was found between sleep-related problems (snoring, sleep-study-confirmed OSA or non-respiratory sleep problem) and parent-reported behavioural problems, functional impairments or intellectual performance. This may reflect limitations of the measures used in this study, that in this population ongoing problems with daytime function are not sleep related or that a cross-sectional assessment does not adequately take into account the impacts of past disease/treatments. Further research is required to further evaluate the tools used to evaluate sleep disorders, the impact of those disorder on children with Down syndrome and interventions which improve both sleep and daytime function.</p>

	<p>It is well established that individuals with cognitive impairment present with disturbed forms of pain processing of still unknown origin. As a neurocognitive factor, executive functions have become favored candidates for explanation. For further insights, we aimed at comparing executive functions and memory in their association with parameters indicating onset and escalation of pain perception. Subjective ratings of experimentally induced pressure pain applied in ascending series were assessed in older individuals with (N = 32) and without mild cognitive impairments (MCI) (N = 32). We investigated whether executive functioning (Trail Making Test-B (TMT-B), semantic fluency) or memory (word list and figure recall) were more closely linked to the onset and the escalation of pain. For the MCI group, a strong linkage between pain responses and the TMT-B could be found, i.e., poor test performance was associated with weak pain onset but strong pain escalation. The contribution of memory functions was less substantial and systematic. The prominent role of executive function for pain processing in individuals with MCI could be replicated by a test of cognitive flexibility. This lack of adaptability let individuals with MCI be less vigilant to pain at the beginning but allows for escalating pain in the further course. Thus, being first not sufficiently prepared and later overwhelmed as regards pain may be an early problem in MCI individuals with reduced executive functioning.</p>

	<p>Our previous work has shown that monoamine oxidase A (MAO A) is overexpressed in glioma and prostate cancer. Near-infrared dye conjugate MAO A Inhibitor (NMI) inhibited the growth of these cancers. This study investigated the effects of NMI on other cancers by NCI60 screening. Our results showed that 48 out of 59 screened cell lines from nine types of cancer had 100% growth inhibition at 10 μM NMI treatment. The in vitro efficacy of NMI determined by growth inhibition (GI50 and TGI) and lethal doses (LC50) has been further studied in various cell lines of CNS cancer, prostate cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), these three cancers showed increased MAO A expression in tumors compared to normal tissues. Based on the waterfall plots and the 3D scatter plot of GI50, TGI, and LC50 data, NMI showed higher potency to several CNS cancer and NSCLC cell lines than prostate cancer cell lines. In vitro efficacy of NMI outperformed FDA-approved drugs for CNS cancer, prostate cancer, and NSCLC, respectively. The Pairwise Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) showed that NMI has a unique mechanism compared to the existing anticancer drugs. This study shows that NMI is a novel theragnostic drug with high potency and unique mechanisms for brain, prostate, NSCLC, and other cancers.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In the current study, we examined the number, distribution, and aspects of the neurochemical identities of infracortical white matter neurons, also termed white matter interstitial cells (WMICs), in the brains of a southern lesser galago (<i>Galago moholi</i>), a black-capped squirrel monkey (<i>Saimiri boliviensis boliviensis</i>), and a crested macaque (<i>Macaca nigra</i>). Staining for neuronal nuclear marker (NeuN) revealed WMICs throughout the infracortical white matter, these cells being most dense close to inner cortical border, decreasing in density with depth in the white matter. Stereological analysis of NeuN-immunopositive cells revealed estimates of approximately 1.1, 10.8, and 37.7 million WMICs within the infracortical white matter of the galago, squirrel monkey, and crested macaque, respectively. The total numbers of WMICs form a distinct negative allometric relationship with brain mass and white matter volume when examined in a larger sample of primates where similar measures have been obtained. In all three primates studied, the highest densities of WMICs were in the white matter of the frontal lobe, with the occipital lobe having the lowest. Immunostaining revealed significant subpopulations of WMICs containing neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and calretinin, with very few WMICs containing parvalbumin, and none containing calbindin. The nNOS and calretinin immunopositive WMICs represent approximately 21% of the total WMIC population; however, variances in the proportions of these neurochemical phenotypes were noted. Our results indicate that both the squirrel monkey and crested macaque might be informative animal models for the study of WMICs in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders in humans.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The dorsolateral striatum (DLS) of rodents is functionally subdivided into somatotopic subregions that represent each body part along both the dorsoventral and anteroposterior (A-P) axes and play crucial roles in sensorimotor functions via corticostriatal pathways. However, little is known about the spatial gene expression patterns and heterogeneity of spiny projection neurons (SPNs) within somatotopic subregions. Here, we show that the cell adhesion molecule gene <i>Cdh20</i>, which encodes a Type II cadherin, is expressed in discrete subregions covering the inner orofacial area and part of the forelimb area in the ventral domain of the DLS (v-DLS) in rats. <i>Cdh20-</i>expressing cells were localized in the v-DLS at the intermediate level of the striatum along the A-P axis and could be classified as direct-pathway SPNs or indirect-pathway SPNs. Unexpectedly, comprehensive analysis revealed that <i>Cdh20</i> is expressed in SPNs in the rat DLS but not in the mouse DLS or the ferret putamen (Pu). Our observations reveal that <i>Cdh20</i> expression demarcates somatotopic subregions and subpopulations of SPNs specifically in the rat DLS and suggest divergent regulation of genes differentially expressed in the v-DLS and Pu among mammals.</p>

     alt="Ephrin-A3 is required for tonotopic map precision and auditory functions in the mouse auditory brainstem"/>
<p>We investigated the molecular basis of tonotopic map formation in the mouse auditory brainstem. We found that the axon guidance cue ephrin-A3 is differentially expressed along the tonotopic map in the mouse auditory brainstem. Ephrin-A3 is sufficient to repel growing auditory nerve fibers in vitro. In mice lacking ephrin-A3, the tonotopic map is degraded in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus, and auditory activation patterns and the ability to discriminate sound frequency changes are also impaired.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Tonotopy is a prominent feature of the vertebrate auditory system and forms the basis for sound discrimination, but the molecular mechanism that underlies its formation remains largely elusive. Ephrin/Eph signaling is known to play important roles in axon guidance during topographic mapping in other sensory systems, so we investigated its possible role in the establishment of tonotopy in the mouse cochlear nucleus. We found that ephrin-A3 molecules are differentially expressed along the tonotopic axis in the cochlear nucleus during innervation. Ephrin-A3 forward signaling is sufficient to repel auditory nerve fibers in a developmental stage-dependent manner. In mice lacking ephrin-A3, the tonotopic map is degraded and isofrequency bands of neuronal activation upon pure tone exposure become imprecise in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus. Ephrin-A3 mutant mice also exhibit a delayed second wave in auditory brainstem responses upon sound stimuli and impaired detection of sound frequency changes. Our findings establish an essential role for ephrin-A3 in forming precise tonotopy in the auditory brainstem to ensure accurate sound discrimination.</p>

     alt="Axonal injury alters the extracellular glial environment of the axon initial segment and allows substantial mitochondrial influx into axon initial segment"/>
<p>Our present focused ion beam/scanning electron microscopy analysis demonstrates marked mitochondrial influx into the axon initial segment (AIS) in response to axonal injury. In the healthy (control) AIS, few mitochondria were observed, whereas mitochondria were abundantly localized in the cell body, axon hillock, and axon. On the other hand, after injury, numerous mitochondria were observed throughout the AIS (scale bar 5 μm).

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The axon initial segment (AIS) is structurally and functionally distinct from other regions of the axon, yet alterations in the milieu of the AIS after brain injury have not been well characterized. In this study, we have examined extracellular and intracellular changes in the AIS after hypoglossal nerve injury. Microglial adhesions to the AIS were rarely observed in healthy controls, whereas microglial adhesions to the AIS became apparent in the axonal injury model. Regarding intra-AIS morphology, we focused on mitochondria because mitochondrial flow into the injured axon appears critical for axonal regeneration. To visualize mitochondria specifically in injured axons, we used <i>Atf3</i>:BAC transgenic mice whose mitochondria were labeled with GFP in response to nerve injury. These mice clearly showed mitochondrial localization in the AIS after nerve injury. To precisely confirm the light microscopic observations, we performed three-dimensional ultrastructural analysis using focused ion beam/scanning electron microscopy (FIB/SEM). Although the healthy AIS was not surrounded by microglia, tight microglial adhesions with thick processes adhering to the AIS were observed after injury. FIB/SEM simultaneously allowed the observation of mitochondrial localization in the AIS. In the AIS of non-injured neurons, few mitochondria were observed, whereas mitochondria were abundantly localized in the cell body, axon hillock, and axon. Intriguingly, in the injured AIS, numerous mitochondria were observed throughout the AIS. Taken together, axonal injury changes the extracellular glial environment surrounding the AIS and intracellular mitochondrial localization in the AIS. These changes would be crucial responses, perhaps for injured neurons to regenerate after axonal injury.</p>

     alt="Morphological properties of the axon initial segment-like process of AII amacrine cells in the rat retina"/>
<p>AII amacrine cells in the mammalian retina display an axon initial segment (AIS)-like process that expresses voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels and generates spikes. Immunolabeling for the cytoskeletal linker protein ankyrin-G enables detection of the AIS-like processes in wholemounts and analysis of its distribution and spatial orientation. The AIS-like processes display no preferred orientation in the horizontal plane and randomly ascend or descend from the site of origin in the vertical plane of the retina, suggesting that this unique process is unlikely to take part in conventional synaptic connections. Instead, it may be adapted to respond to volume transmission by means of extrasynaptic receptors.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Signal processing within the retina is generally mediated by graded potentials, whereas output is conveyed by action potentials transmitted along optic nerve axons. Among retinal neurons, amacrine cells seem to be an exception to this general rule, as several types generate voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> (Na<sub>v</sub>) channel-dependent action potentials. The AII, a narrow-field, bistratified axon-less amacrine cell found in mammalian retinas, displays a unique process that resembles an axon initial segment (AIS), with expression of Na<sub>v</sub> channels colocalized with the cytoskeletal protein ankyrin-G, and generates action potentials. As the role of spiking in AIIs is uncertain, we hypothesized that the morphological properties of the AIS-like process could provide information relevant for its functional importance, including potential pre- and/or postsynaptic connectivity. For morphological analysis, we injected AII amacrine cells in slices with fluorescent dye and immunolabeled the slices for ankyrin-G. Subsequently, this enabled us to reliably identify AII-type processes among ankyrin-G-labeled processes in wholemount retina. We systematically analyzed the laminar localization, spatial orientation, and distribution of the AIS-like processes as a function of retinal eccentricity. In the horizontal plane, the processes displayed no preferred orientation and terminal endings were randomly distributed. In the vertical plane, the processes displayed a horizontal preference, but also ascended and descended into the inner nuclear layer and proximal inner plexiform layer, respectively. These results suggest that the AII amacrine AIS-like process is unlikely to take part in conventional synaptic connections, but may instead be adapted to respond to volume neurotransmission by means of extrasynaptic receptors.</p>

     alt="Mapping reward mechanisms by intracerebral self-stimulation in the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta)"/>
<p>
Testing the reward versus aversive value of electrical stimulation of 74 structures of the macaque brain revealed a ubiquitous distribution of valenced sites in pathways throughout the brain. Most positive were striatal and frontal cortical structures densely innervated by pathways originating in midbrain dopaminergic (DA) cell groups A9 and A10. Nevertheless, reward related more to structures' neurobehavioral function than to density of DA-innervation. Many positive sites were found in non-DA posterior cingulate cortex, and stimulation of purely sensory and motor areas was generally negative, regardless of DA innervation.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The objective of the study was to identify brain structures that mediate reward as evidenced by positive reinforcing effects of stimuli on behavior. Testing by intracerebral self-stimulation enabled monkeys to inform whether activation of ~2900 sites in 74 structures of 4 sensorimotor pathways and 4 modulatory loop pathways was positive, negative or neutral. Stimulation was rewarding at 30% of sites, negative at 17%, neutral at 52%. Virtually all (99%) structures yielded some positive or negative sites, suggesting a ubiquitous distribution of pathways transmitting valence information. Mapping of sites to structures with dense versus sparse dopaminergic (DA) or noradrenergic (NA) innervation showed that stimulation of DA-pathways was rewarding or neutral. Stimulation of NA-pathways was not rewarding. Stimulation of association areas was generally rewarding; stimulation of purely sensory or motor structures was generally negative. Reward related more to structures' sensorimotor function than to density of DA-innervation. Stimulation of basal ganglia loop pathways was rewarding except in lateral globus pallidus, an inhibitory structure in the negative feedback loop; stimulation of the cerebellar loop was rewarding in anterior vermis and the spinocerebellar pathway; and stimulation of the hippocampal CA1 loop was rewarding. While most positive sites were in the DA reward system, numerous sites in sparsely DA-innervated posterior cingulate and parietal cortices may represent a separate reward system. DA-density represents concentrations of plastic synapses that mediate acquisition of new synaptic connections. DA-sparse areas may represent innate, genetically programmed reward-associated pathways. Implications of findings in regard to response habituation and addiction are discussed.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Finding and Keeping the Beat: Neural Mechanisms Differ as Beat Perception Unfolds</a></h4>

              
                Perception of a regular beat is essential to our ability to synchronize movements to music in an anticipatory fashion. Beat perception requires multiple, distinct neural functions, corresponding to the perceptual stages that occur over time, including 1) detection that regularity is present (beat finding), 2) prediction of future regular events to enable anticipation (beat continuation), and 3) dynamic adjustment of predictions as the rhythmic stimulus changes (beat adjustment). The striatum has been shown to be crucial for beat perception generally, although it is unclear how, or whether, distinct regions of the striatum contribute to these different stages of beat perception. Here, we used fMRI to investigate the activity of striatal subregions during the different stages of beat perception. Participants listened to pairs of rhythms (polyrhythms) whose temporal structure induced distinct perceptual stages: finding, continuation, and adjustment of the beat. Dorsal putamen was preferentially active during beat finding, whereas the ventral putamen was preferentially active during beat adjustment. We also observed that anterior insula activity was sensitive to metrical structure (greater when polyrhythms were metrically incongruent than when they were congruent). These data implicate the dorsal putamen in the detection of regularity, possibly by detection of coincidences between cortical oscillations, and the ventral putamen in the adjustment of regularity perception, possibly by integration of prediction errors in ongoing beat predictions. Additionally, activity in the supramarginal and superior temporal gyri correlated with beat tapping performance, and activity in the superior temporal gyrus correlated with beat perception (performance on the Beat Alignment Test).

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Bidirectional Switch in the Shank3 Phosphorylation State Biases Synapses toward Up or Down Scaling</a></h4>

              
                Homeostatic synaptic plasticity requires widespread remodeling of synaptic signaling and scaffolding networks, but the role of posttranslational modifications in this process has not been systematically studied. Using deepscale, quantitative analysis of the phosphoproteome in mouse neocortical neurons, we found wide-spread and temporally complex changes during synaptic scaling up and down. We observed 424 bidirectionally modulated phosphosites that were strongly enriched for synapse-associated proteins, including S1539 in the ASD-associated synaptic scaffold protein Shank3. Using a parallel proteomic analysis performed on Shank3 isolated from rat neocortical neurons by immunoaffinity, we identified two sites that were hypo-phosphorylated during scaling up and hyper-phosphorylated during scaling down: one (rat S1615) that corresponded to S1539 in mouse, and a second highly conserved site, rat S1586. The phosphorylation status of these sites modified the synaptic localization of Shank3 during scaling protocols, and dephosphorylation of these sites via PP2A activity was essential for the maintenance of synaptic scaling up. Finally, phosphomimetic mutations at these sites prevented scaling up but not down, while phosphodeficient mutations prevented scaling down but not up. Thus, an activity-dependent switch between hypo- and hyperphosphorylation at S1586/ S1615 of Shank3 enables scaling up or down, respectively. Collectively our data show that activity-dependent phosphoproteome dynamics are important for the functional reconfiguration of synaptic scaffolds, and can bias synapses toward upward or downward homeostatic plasticity.

                In vivo cortical optical imaging needs to overcome the scattering of skull. Compared to the traditional transcranial surgery-based open-skull glass window and thinned-skull preparation, chemical tissue optical clearing techniques can provide a skull-remained optical access to the brain while maintaining its original environment. However, previously demonstrated skull optical clearing windows could only maintain transparency for a couple of hours and hardly capable for high-resolution monitoring of awake animals. Here, we developed a convenient and easy-handling chronic skull optical clearing technique, named "Through-Intact-Skull (TIS) window", which was compatible with long-term observation at high resolution, and yielded large imaging depth of 900 m for cortical neurovascular visualization. In addition, our TIS window could monitor neuron activity in awake mice for a long term. Therefore, our bio-compatible and non-invasive TIS window is a new promising approach for intravital brain microscopy with great potential for basic research in neuroscience.

                Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by early onset deficits in social behavior and repetitive behavior. Chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein (CHD8) is one of the genes with the strongest association to autism. Alongside with the core symptoms of ASD, individuals with ASD are reported to have gastrointestinal (GI) problems, and a majority of individuals with CHD8 mutations display GI problems. However, the relationship between autism related genes, such as CHD8, gastrointestinal function, and autism related behaviours are yet very unclear. In the current study, we found that mice haploinsufficient for CHD8 have leaky gut, a dysregulated transcriptome in gut epithelial cells, decreased gut tuft cells and goblet cells, and an increase in microbial load. Specific deletion of CHD8 in gut epithelial cells induced an increase in anxiety-related behaviours in, a phenotype that is often observed in autism and full body knockdown of CHD8, in addition to decreased tuft cells. In addition, antibiotic treatment of CHD8 haploinsufficient mice attenuates sociability deficits. Therefore, the current study determines a pathway for autism-related GI deficits, and how these deficits may play a direct role in the development of autism-related behaviours.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">tACS competes with ongoing oscillations for control of spike-timing in the primate brain.</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is a promising but controversial method for modulating neural activity noninvasively. Much of the controversy revolves around the question of whether tACS can generate electric fields that are strong enough to entrain neuronal spiking activity. Here we show that what matters is not the electric field strength per se, but rather the strength of the stimulation relative to ongoing oscillatory entrainment. We recorded from single neurons in the cortex and subcortex of behaving non-human primates, while applying tACS at different frequencies and amplitudes. When neuronal activity was weakly locked to ongoing oscillations, tACS readily entrained single-neuron activity to specific stimulation phases. In contrast, neurons that were strongly locked to ongoing oscillations usually exhibited decreased entrainment during low-amplitude tACS. As this reduced entrainment is a property of many oscillating systems, attempts to impose an external rhythm on spiking activity may often yield precisely the opposite effect.

                The brain excels at processing sensory input, even in rich or chaotic environments. Mounting evidence attributes this to the creation of sophisticated internal models of the environment that draw on statistical structures in the unfolding sensory input. Understanding how and where this modeling takes place is a core question in statistical learning. It is unknown how this modeling applies to random sensory signals. Here, we identify conditional relations, through transitional probabilities, as an implicit structure supporting the encoding of a random auditory stream. We evaluate this representation using intracranial electroencephalography recordings by applying information-theoretical principles to high-frequency activity (75-145 Hz). We demonstrate how the brain continuously encodes conditional relations between random stimuli in a network outside of the auditory system following a hierarchical organization including temporal, frontal and hippocampal regions. Our results highlight that hierarchically organized brain areas continuously attempt to order incoming information by maintaining a probabilistic representation of the sensory input, even under random stimuli presentation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinct signatures of loss of consciousness during Focal Impaired Awareness (FIA) versus Focal to Bilateral Tonic-Clonic (FBTC) seizures</a></h4>

              
                Loss of consciousness (LOC) is a hallmark of many epileptic seizures and carries risks of serious injury and sudden death. While cortical sleep-like activities accompany LOC during focal impaired awareness (FIA) seizures, the mechanisms of LOC during focal to bilateral tonic-clonic (FBTC) seizures remain unclear. Quantifying differences in markers of cortical activation and ictal recruitment between FIA and FBTC seizures may also help to understand their different consequences for clinical outcomes and to optimize neuromodulation therapies. We quantified clinical signs of LOC and intracranial EEG (iEEG) activity during 129 FIA and 50 FBTC from 41 patients. We characterized iEEG changes both in the seizure onset zone (SOZ) and in areas remote from SOZ with a total of 3386 electrodes distributed across brain areas. First, we compared the dynamics of iEEG sleep-like activities: slow-wave activity (SWA; 1-4 Hz) and beta/delta ratio (B/D; a validated marker of cortical activation) during FIA vs. FBTC. Second, we quantified differences between FBTC and FIA for a marker validated to detect ictal cross-frequency coupling: phase-locked high-gamma (PLHG; high gamma phased locked to low frequencies) and a marker of ictal recruitment: the epileptogenicity index (i.e. the number of channels crossing an energy ratio threshold for high vs. low frequency power). Third, we assessed changes in iEEG activity preceding and accompanying behavioral generalization onset and their correlation with electromyogram (EMG) channels. In addition, we analyzed human cortical multi-unit activity recorded with Utah arrays during three FBTC. Compared to FIA, FBTC seizures were characterized by deeper LOC and by stronger increases in SWA in parieto-occipital cortex. FBTC also displayed more widespread increases in cortical activation (B/D), ictal cross-frequency coupling (PLHG) and ictal recruitment (epileptogenicity index). Even before generalization, FBTC displayed deeper LOC; this early LOC was accompanied by a paradoxical increase in B/D in fronto-parietal cortex. Behavioral generalization coincided with complete loss of responsiveness and a subsequent increase in high-gamma in the whole brain, which was especially synchronous in deep sources and could not be explained by EMG. Similarly, multi-unit activity analysis of FBTC revealed sustained increases in cortical firing rates during and after generalization onset in areas remote from the SOZ. Unlike during FIA, LOC during FBTC is characterized by a paradoxical increase in cortical activation and neuronal firing. These findings suggest differences in the mechanisms of ictal LOC between FIA and FBTC and may account for the more negative prognostic consequences of FBTC.

                Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) affects young children and manifests symptoms such as hyperactivity, impulsivity and cognitive disabilities. Psychostimulants, which are the primary treatment for ADHD, target monoamine transporters and have a paradoxical calming effect, but their mechanism of action, is unclear. Studies using the dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT) knockout mice, which have elevated striatal DA levels and are considered an animal model of ADHD, have suggested that the paradoxical calming effect of psychostimulants might be through the actions on serotonin neurotransmission. On the other hand, newer non-stimulant class of drugs such as atomoxetine and Intuniv suggest that targeting the norepinephrine (NE) system in the PFC might explain this paradoxical calming effect. We sought to decipher the mechanism of this paradoxical effect of psychostimulants through an integrated approach using ex vivo monoamine efflux experiments, monoamine transporter knockout mice, drug infusions and behavior. Our ex vivo efflux experiments reveal that NE transporter (NET) blocker desipramine elevates both norepinephrine and dopamine but not serotonin levels, in PFC tissue slices from wild-type and DAT-KO but not NET KO mice. However, serotonin (5-HT) transporter (SERT) inhibitor fluoxetine elevates only serotonin in all three genotypes. Systemic administration of both desipramine and fluoxetine but local PFC infusion of only desipramine and not fluoxetine inhibits hyperactivity in the DAT-KO mice. In contrast, pharmacological norepinephrine depletion but dopamine elevation using Nepicastat also inhibits hyperactivity in DATKO mice. Together, these data suggest that elevation of PFC dopamine and not norepinephrine or serotonin as a convergent mechanism for the paradoxical psychostimulant effects observe in ADHD therapy.

                Background music is widely used to sustain attention, but little is known about what musical properties aid attention. This may be due to inter-individual variability in neural responses to music. We test the hypothesis that music can sustain attention by affecting oscillations via acoustic amplitude modulation, differentially for those with varying levels of attentional difficulty. We first show that heavily-modulated music improves sustained attention for participants with more ADHD symptoms. FMRI showed this music elicited greater activity in attentional networks in this group only, and EEG showed greater stimulus-brain coupling for this group in response to the heavily-modulated music. Finally, we parametrically manipulated the depth and rate of amplitude modulations inserted in otherwise-identical music, and found that beta-range modulations helped more than other frequency ranges for participants with more ADHD symptoms. Results suggest the possibility of an oscillation-based neural mechanism for targeted music to support improved cognitive performance.

                We seldom time life events intently yet recalling the duration of events is lifelike. Is episodic time the outcome of a rational after-thought or of physiological clocks keeping track of time without our conscious awareness of it? To answer this, we recorded human brain activity with magnetoencephalography (MEG) during quiet wakefulness. Unbeknownst to participants, we asked them after the MEG recording to guess its duration. In the absence of overt attention to time, the relative amount of time participants' alpha brain rhythms (  ~ 10 Hz) were in bursting mode predicted participants' retrospective duration estimate. This relation was absent when participants prospectively measured elapsed time during the MEG recording. We conclude that  bursts embody discrete states of awareness for episodic timing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Detection of the 40-Hz Auditory Steady-state Response with Optically Pumped Magnetometers</a></h4>

              
                Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a functional neuroimaging technique that noninvasively detects the brain magnetic field from neuronal activations. Conventional MEG measures brain signals using superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs). SQUID based MEG requires a cryogenic environment involving a bulky non-magnetic dewar and the consumption of liquid helium, which restricts the variability of the sensor array and the gap between the cortical sources and sensors. Recently, miniature optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) have been developed and commercialized. OPMs do not require cryogenic cooling and can be placed within millimeters from the scalp. In the present study, we arranged six OPM sensors on the temporal area to detect auditory related brain responses in a two layer magnetically shielded room. We presented the auditory stimuli of 1 kHz pure tone bursts with 200 ms duration and obtained the M50 and M100 components of auditory evoked fields. We delivered the periodic stimuli with a 40 Hz repetition rate and observed the gamma band power changes and inter trial phase coherence of auditory steady state responses at 40 Hz. We found that the OPM sensors have a performance comparable to that of conventional SQUID based MEG sensors, and our results suggest the feasibility of using OPM sensors for functional neuroimaging and brain computer interface applications.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Presaccadic attention enhances contrast sensitivity, but not at the upper vertical meridian</a></h4>

              
                Human visual performance is not only better at the fovea and decreases with eccentricity, but also has striking radial asymmetries around the visual field: At a fixed eccentricity, it is better along (1) the horizontal than vertical meridian and (2) the lower than upper vertical meridian. These asymmetries, known as performance fields, are pervasive -they emerge for many visual dimensions, regardless of head rotation, stimulus orientation or display luminance- and resilient -they are not alleviated by covert exogenous or endogenous attention, deployed in the absence of eye movements. Performance fields have been studied exclusively during eye fixation. However, a major driver of everyday attentional orienting is saccade preparation, during which visual attention automatically shifts to the future eye fixation. This presaccadic shift of attention is considered strong and compulsory, and relies on fundamentally different neural computations and substrates than covert attention. Given these differences, we investigated whether presaccadic attention can compensate for the ubiquitous performance asymmetries observed during eye fixation. Our data replicate polar performance asymmetries during fixation and document the same asymmetries during saccade preparation. Crucially, however, presaccadic attention enhanced contrast sensitivity at the horizontal and lower vertical meridian, but not at the upper vertical meridian. Thus, instead of attenuating polar performance asymmetries, presaccadic attention exacerbates them.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Local brain-state dependency of effective connectivity: evidence from TMS-EEG</a></h4>

              
                Background: Spontaneous cortical oscillations have been shown to modulate cortical responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). If not controlled for, they might increase variability in responses and mask meaningful changes in the signals of interest when studying the brain with TMS combined with electroencephalography (TMS-EEG). To address this challenge in future closed-loop stimulation paradigms, we need to understand how spontaneous oscillations affect TMS-evoked responses. Objective: To describe the effect of the pre-stimulus phase of cortical mu (8-13 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) oscillations on TMS-induced effective connectivity patterns. Methods: We applied TMS to the left primary motor cortex and right pre-supplementary motor area of three subjects while recording EEG. We classified trials off-line into positive- and negative-phase classes according to the mu and beta rhythms. We calculated differences in the global mean-field amplitude (GMFA) and compared the cortical spreading of the TMS-evoked activity between the two classes. Results: Phase had significant effects on the GMFA in 11 out of 12 datasets (3 subjects x 2 stimulation sites x 2 frequency bands). Seven of the datasets showed significant differences in the time range 15-50 ms, nine in 50-150 ms, and eight after 150 ms post-stimulus. Source estimates showed complex spatial differences between the classes in the cortical spreading of the TMS-evoked activity. Conclusions: TMS-evoked effective connectivity appears to depend on the phase of local cortical oscillations at the stimulated site. This may be crucial for efficient design of future brain-state-dependent and closed-loop stimulation paradigms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Gamma Entrainment Improves Synchronization Deficits Caused by Dementia</a></h4>

              
                Non-invasive gamma entrainment has shown promising results in alleviating cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer's disease in mice and humans. In this study, we examine improvements in the synchronization characteristics of the brain's oscillations induced by 40Hz auditory stimulation based on electroencephalography data recorded from a group of dementia patients. We observed that when the quality of entrainment surpasses a certain level, several indicators of brain synchronization significantly improve. Specifically, the entrained oscillatory activity maintains temporal phase stability in the frontal, parietal, and occipital regions, and persistent spatial phase coupling between them. In addition, notable theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling is observed in these areas. Interestingly, a high theta power at rest predicts the quality of entrainment. We identify differentiating attributes of temporal/spatial synchronization and cross-frequency coupling in the data of two groups with entrained and non-entrained responses which point to enhanced network synchronization caused by entrainment and can explain its potential therapeutic effects.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">TRACER: A toolkit to register and visualize anatomical coordinates in the rat brain</a></h4>

              
                The need for anatomical registration and visualization tools is greater than ever thanks to novel technologies that allow users to record from thousands of neurons across multiple brain regions simultaneously. The vast majority of digital reconstruction toolkits for rodent models were developed using mouse brain atlases, leaving few options for those using rats. Retrofitting rat atlases into extant software is possible, but this demands effort and programming skills which most end-users lack. We therefore developed an open-source, python-based Toolkit for Reconstructing Anatomical CoordinatEs in Rats, TRACER, which allows users to reconstruct the trajectories of recording electrodes (e.g Neuropixels) or to visualize virus expression or other features in a comprehensively annotated 3D volume, the Waxholm Space (WHS) rat brain atlas. The WHS atlas is made from high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scans, and contains >200 regional delineations. Beyond post-hoc reconstructions of electrodes or virus expression, TRACER can be used to generate coordinates for targeting brain regions prior to surgery. TRACER is available openly on GitHub and is compatible with Windows, macOS and Linux operating systems.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Context-dependent selectivity to natural scenes in the retina</a></h4>

              
                Retina ganglion cells extract specific features from natural scenes and send this information to the brain. In particular, they respond to local light increase (On responses), or decrease (Off). However, it is unclear if this On-Off selectivity, characterized with synthetic stimuli, is maintained when they are stimulated with natural scenes. Here we recorded the responses of ganglion cells of mice and axolotls to stimuli composed of natural images slightly perturbed by patterns of random noise to determine their selectivity during natural stimulation. The On-Off selectivity strongly depended on the natural image. A single ganglion cell can signal luminance increase for one natural image, and luminance decrease for another. Modeling and experiments showed that this was due to the non-linear combination of different pathways of the retinal circuit. Despite the versatility of the On-Off selectivity, a systematic analysis demonstrated that contrast was reliably encoded in these responses. Our perturbative approach thus uncovers the selectivity of retinal ganglion cells to more complex features than initially thought during natural scene stimulation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Anatomical and functional connectivity support the existence of a salience network node within the caudal ventrolateral prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Three large-scale brain networks are considered essential to cognitive flexibility: the ventral and dorsal attention (VAN and DAN) and salience (SN) networks. The ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) is a known component of the VAN and DAN, but its role in the SN is controversial. In this study, we used a translational and multimodal approach to demonstrate the existence of a SN node within the vlPFC. First, we used tract-tracing methods in non-human primates (NHP) to quantify the anatomic connectivity strength between the different vlPFC areas and the frontal and insular cortices. The strongest connections with the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and anterior insula (AI) locations comprising the two main cortical SN nodes were derived from the caudal area 47/12. This location also has strong axonal projections to subcortical structures of the salience network, including the dorsomedial thalamus, hypothalamus, sublenticular extended amygdala, and periaqueductal gray. Second, we used a seed-based functional connectivity analysis in NHP resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) data to validate the caudal area 47/12 as an SN node. Third, we used the same approach in human rsfMRI data to identify a homologous structure in caudal area 47/12, also showing strong connections with the SN cortical nodes, thus confirming the caudal area 47/12 as the SN node in the vlPFC. Taken together, the vlPFC contains nodes for all three cognitive networks, the VAN, DAN, and SN. Thus, the vlPFC is in a position to switch between these three cognitive networks, suggesting a key role as an attentional hub. Its tight additional connections to the orbitofrontal, dorsolateral, and ventral premotor cortices, places the vlPFC at the center for switching behaviors based on environmental stimuli, computing value and cognitive control.

	<p>The insula is involved in a wide variety of functions, including social and emotional processing. Despite the numerous connections it shares with brain structures known to play a role in autobiographical memory (AM), little is known on the contribution of the insula to AM processing. The aim of the study was to examine emotional AM retrieval in patients with insular resection for drug-resistant epilepsy. Ten patients who underwent partial or complete insular resection (IR) were matched on age, sex, and education, to fifteen patients who underwent temporal lobectomy (TL), and to fifteen healthy controls. Participants were asked to recall four positive, four negative, and four neutral memories from their past using the autobiographical interview procedure. The results suggest that AM for emotional and neutral events after IR was comparable to that of healthy controls, whereas deficits were observed after TL. However, an independent examiner judged IR patients’ memories as poorer than those of healthy controls on the episodic richness scale, suggesting a lack of some aspects of rich and vivid remembering. Furthermore, analysis on subjective self-rated scales revealed that, contrary to healthy controls, patients with IR judged their neutral memories as more emotional. This study suggests that AM is generally preserved after IR. However, given the small sample size and varied lesion location, one cannot totally exclude a potential role of specific insular sub-regions on some aspects of autobiographical memory. In addition, IR patients showed poor emotional judgment for neutral memories, which is congruent with previous findings of altered emotional processing in this population.</p>

	<p>Adult development throughout a lifetime implies a series of changes in systems, including cognitive and linguistic functioning. The aim of this article is to study the effect of foreign language training on linguistic processing, particularly the frequency of the tip-of-the-tongue (TOT) phenomenon and on other cognitive processes such as processing speed and working memory in adults aged 40 to 60 years. Sixty-six healthy Colombian teachers were enrolled in this study. They were then randomly divided into an experimental group (33 healthy adults who underwent a four-week training period) and a passive control group (33 healthy adults who did not undergo any training). All participants performed induction tasks for the TOT phenomenon, working memory and processing speed before and after the four weeks. Results showed more of an effect in the semantic access, phonological access and processing speed measures with a better performance in the experimental group than in the control group. In Colombia, this type of training is still new and little is known to date about programs to prevent cognitive impairments. The need to conduct more studies confirming or refuting these findings is discussed, thus raising awareness about the extent of this type of training to increase the linguistic and cognitive performance of adults.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Myelination allows for the regulation of conduction velocity, affecting the precise timing of neuronal inputs important for the development and function of brain circuits. In turn, myelination may be altered by changes in experience, neuronal activity, and vesicular release, but the links between sensory experience, corresponding neuronal activity, and resulting alterations in myelination require further investigation. We thus studied the development of myelination in the <i>Xenopus laevis</i> tadpole, a classic model for studies of visual system development and function because it is translucent and visually responsive throughout the formation of its retinotectal system. We begin with a systematic characterization of the timecourse of early myelin ensheathment in the <i>Xenopus</i> retinotectal system using immunohistochemistry of myelin basic protein (MBP) along with third-harmonic generation (THG) microscopy, a label-free structural imaging technique. Based on the mid-larval developmental progression of MBP expression in <i>Xenopus</i>, we identify an appropriate developmental window in which to assess the effects of early temporally patterned visual experience on myelin ensheathment. We used calcium imaging of axon terminals in vivo to characterise the responses of retinal ganglion cells over a range of stroboscopic stimulation frequencies. Strobe frequencies that reliably elicited robust versus dampened calcium responses were then presented to animals for 7 d, and differences in the amount of early myelin ensheathment at the optic chiasm were subsequently quantified. This study provides evidence that it is not just the presence but also to the specific temporal properties of sensory stimuli that are important for myelin plasticity.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The human hippocampus is difficult to image given its small size, location, shape, and complex internal architecture. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has shown age-related hippocampal volume changes that vary along the anterior–posterior axis. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides complementary measures related to microstructure, but there are few hippocampus DTI studies investigating change with age in healthy participants, and all have been limited by low spatial resolution. The current study uses high resolution 1 mm isotropic DTI of 153 healthy volunteers aged 5–74 years to investigate diffusion and volume trajectories of the hippocampus (whole, head, body, and tail) and correlations with memory. Hippocampal volume showed age-related changes that differed between head (peaking at midlife), body (no changes), and tail (decreasing across the age span). Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean, axial, and radial diffusivities (MD, AD, RD) yielded peaks or minima, respectively, at ~30–35 years in all three subregions of the hippocampus. Greater magnitude changes were observed during development than in aging. Age trajectories for both volume and DTI were similar between males and females. Correlations between tests of memory and FA and/or volume were significant in younger subjects (5–17 years), but not in 18–49 year olds or 50–74 year olds. MD was significantly correlated with memory performance in 18–49 year olds, but not in other age groups. Given the diffusion-weighted image contrast and resolution, head digitations could be examined revealing that the majority of subjects had 3–4 (48%) or 2 (32%) bilaterally with no effect of age. One millimeter isotropic DTI yielded high quality diffusion-weighted maps of the human hippocampus that showed regionally specific age effects and cognitive correlations along the anterior–posterior axis from 5 to 74 years.</p>

                Direct activation of cell-surface receptors is highly desirable for elucidating the physiological roles of receptors. However, subtype-selective ligands are very limited because of the high homology among receptor subtypes. A potential approach for selective activation of a receptor subtype is chemogenetics, in which both point mutagenesis of the receptors and designed ligands are used. However, ligand-binding properties are affected in most current methods. Here, we developed a chemogenetic method for direct activation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGlu1), which plays essential roles in cerebellar functions in the brain. Our screening identified a mGlu1 mutant, mGlu1(N264H), that was directly activated by palladium complexes. Notably, a palladium complex showing low cytotoxicity successfully activated mGlu1 in mGlu1(N264H) knock-in mice, revealing that activation of endogenous mGlu1 is sufficient to evoke the critical cellular mechanism of synaptic plasticity, a basis of motor learning in the cerebellum.

                When presented with two egg-laying substrates, Drosophila lay most of their eggs on the option with higher relative value. How do flies make this relative-value decision? Might the strategy they use allow them to choose the best option even when they experience substrates with a more complex spatiotemporal profile than in canonical two-choice paradigms? We measured Drosophila egg-laying behavior in diverse substrate environments. In all cases, we found that flies dynamically increase or decrease their egg-laying rates as they explore substrates for a deposition site so as to target eggs to the best, recently visited option. Visiting the best option typically led to a strong reduction in egg laying on other substrates for several minutes, with this timescale varying across fly strains. Our data support a model in which flies compare the value of the current substrate with an internally constructed expectation on the value of available options to regulate the likelihood of laying an egg. We show that dopamine-neuron activity is critical for learning and/or expressing this expectation, similar to its role in certain tasks in vertebrates. Integrating sensory experiences over minutes to generate an internal sense of the quality of available options, i.e., forming an expectation, allows flies to use a dynamic reference point for judging the current substrate and might be a general way in which decisions are made, even beyond flies and egg laying.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Capillary stall quantification from optical coherence tomography angiogram maximum intensity projections</a></h4>

              
                Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is applicable to the study of cerebral microvasculature in vivo. Optimised acquisition schemes enable the generation of three-dimensional OCT angiograms, i.e., volumetric images of red blood cell flux in capillary networks, currently at a repetition rate of up to 1/10 seconds. This makes testable a new class of hypotheses that strive to bridge the gap between microscopic phenomena occurring at the spatial scale of neurons, and less invasive but crude techniques to measure macroscopic blood flow dynamics. Here we present a method for quantifying the occurrence of transient capillary stalls in OCT angiograms, i.e., events during which blood flow through a capillary branch is temporarily occluded. By making the assumption that information on such events is present predominantly in the imaging plane, we implemented a pipeline that automatically segments a network of interconnected capillaries from the maximum intensity projections (MIP) of a series of 3D angiograms. We then developed tools enabling rapid manual assessment of the binary flow status (open/stalled) of hundreds of capillary segments based on the intensity profile of each segment across time. The entire pipeline is optimized to run on a standard laptop computer, requiring no high-performance, low-availability resources, despite very large data volumes. To further reduce the threshold of adoption, and ultimately to support the development of reproducible research methods in the young field, we provide the documented code for scrutiny and re-use under a permissive open-source license.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The generalized spatial representation in the prefrontal cortex is inherited from the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal and neocortical neural activity is modulated by the position of the individual in space. While hippocampal neurons provide the basis for a spatial map, prefrontal cortical neurons generalize over environmental features. Whether these generalized representations result from a bidirectional interaction with, or are mainly derived from hippocampal spatial representations is not known. By examining simultaneously recorded hippocampal and medial prefrontal neurons, we observed that prefrontal spatial representations show a delayed coherence with hippocampal ones. We also identified subpopulations of cells in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex that formed functional cross-area couplings; these resembled the optimal connections predicted by a probabilistic model of spatial information transfer and generalization. Moreover, cross-area couplings were strongest and had the shortest delay preceding spatial decision-making. Our results suggest that generalized spatial coding in the medial prefrontal cortex is inherited from spatial representations in the hippocampus, and that the routing of information can change dynamically with behavioral demands.

Or... is it? : A proposition for analyses and reporting standards for structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging of the noradrenergic Locus Coeruleus</a></h4>

              
                The noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) in the brainstem shows early signs of protein pathologies in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. As the LC's small size (approximately 2.5 mm in width) presents a challenge for molecular imaging, the past decade has seen a steep rise in structural and functional Magnetic Resonance (MR) studies aiming to characterise the LC's changes in ageing and neurodegeneration. However, given its position in the brainstem and small volume, great care must be taken to yield methodologically reliable MR results as spatial deviations in transformations can greatly reduce the statistical power of the analyses at the group level. Here, we suggest a spatial transformation procedure and a set of quality assessment methods which allow LC researchers to achieve the spatial precision necessary for investigating this small but potentially impactful brain structure. Using a combination of available toolboxes (SPM12, ANTs, FSL, FreeSurfer), individual structural and functional 3T LC scans are transformed into MNI space via a study-specific anatomical template. Following this, the precision of spatial alignment in individual MNI-transformed images is quantified using in-plane distance measures based on slice-specific centroids of structural LC segmentations and based on landmarks of salient anatomical features in mean functional images, respectively. Median in-plane distance of all landmarks on the transformed structural as well as functional LC imaging data were below 2 mm, thereby falling below the typical LC width of 2.5 mm suggested by post-mortem data. With the set of spatial post-processing steps outlined in this paper and available for download, we hope to give readers interested in LC imaging a starting point for a reliable analysis of structural and functional MR data of the LC and to have also taken a first step towards establishing reporting standards of LC imaging data.

                Changes in epigenetic modifications present a mechanism how environmental factors like the experience of stress can alter gene regulation. While stress-related disorders have consistently been associated with differential DNA methylation, little is known about the time scale in which these alterations emerge. We investigated dynamic DNA methylation changes in whole blood of 42 healthy male individuals in response to a stressful cognitive task, its association with concentration changes in cortisol and its modulation by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). We observed a continuous increase in COMT promotor DNA methylation which correlated with higher saliva cortisol levels and was still detectable one week later. However, this lasting effect was suppressed by concurrent activity-enhancing anodal tDCS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Our findings support the significance of gene-specific DNA methylation in whole blood as potential biomarkers for stress-related disorders. Moreover, they suggest alternative molecular mechanisms possibly involved in lasting behavioral effects of tDCS.

                Animal models of disease are valuable resources for investigating pathogenic mechanisms and potential therapeutic interventions. However, for complex disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), the generation and availability of innumerous distinct animal models present unique challenges to AD researchers and hinder the success of useful therapies. Here, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the 3xTg-AD mouse model of AD across its lifespan to better inform the field of the various pathologies that appear at specific ages, and comment on drift that has occurred in the development of pathology in this line since its development 20 years ago. This modern characterization of the 3xTg-AD model includes an assessment of impairments in behavior, cognition, and long-term potentiation followed by quantification of amyloid beta (A{beta}) plaque burden and neurofibrillary tau tangles, biochemical levels of A{beta}, and tau protein, and neuropathological markers such as gliosis and accumulation of dystrophic neurites. We also present a novel comparison of the 3xTg-AD model with the 5xFAD model using the same deep-phenotyping characterization pipeline. The results from these analyses are freely available via the AD Knowledge Portal (https://admodelexplorer.synapse.org). Our work demonstrates the utility of a characterization pipeline that generates robust and standardized information relevant to investigating and comparing disease etiologies of current and future models of AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Oral and injected tamoxifen alter adult hippocampal neurogenesis in female and male mice</a></h4>

              
                Inducible Cre recombinase facilitates temporal control of genetic recombination in numerous transgenic model systems, a feature which has made it a popular tool for studies of adult neurogenesis. One of the most common forms of inducible Cre, CreERT2, requires activation by the synthetic estrogen tamoxifen (TAM) to initiate recombination of LoxP-flanked sequences. To date, most studies deliver TAM via intraperitoneal injection. But the introduction of TAM-infused commercial chows has recently expanded the possible modes of TAM delivery. Despite the widespread use of TAM-inducible genetic models in adult neurogenesis research, the comparative efficiency and off-target effects of TAM administration protocols is surprisingly infrequently studied. Here we compare a standard, 5 day TAM injection regimen with voluntary consumption of TAM-infused chow. First, we used adult NestinCreERT2;Rosa-LoxP-STOP-LoxP-EYFP reporter mice to show that 2 weeks of TAM chow and 5 days of injections led to LoxP recombination in a similar phenotypic population of neural stem and progenitor cells in the adult dentate gyrus. However, TAM chow resulted in substantially less overall recombination than injections. TAM administration also altered adult neurogenesis, but in different ways depending on administration route: TAM injection disrupted neural progenitor cell proliferation 3 weeks after TAM, whereas TAM chow increased neuronal differentiation of cells generated during the diet period. These findings provide guidance for selection of TAM administration route and appropriate controls in adult neurogenesis studies using TAM-inducible Cre mice. They also highlight the need for better understanding of off-target effects of TAM in other neurological processes and organ systems.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dual medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus projecting neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus</a></h4>

              
                The paraventricular nucleus (PVT) of the midline thalamus is a critical higher-order cortico-thalamo-cortical integration site that plays a critical role in various behaviors including reward seeking, cue saliency, and emotional memory. Anatomical studies have shown that PVT projects to both medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus (HC). However, dual mPFC-HC projecting neurons which could serve a role in synchronizing mPFC and HC activity during PVT-dependent behaviors, have not been explored. Here we used a dual retrograde adenoassociated virus (AAV) tracing approach to characterize the location and proportion of different projection populations that send collaterals to mPFC and/or ventral hippocampus (vHC). Additionally, we examined the distribution of calcium binding proteins calretinin (CR) and calbindin (CB) with respect to these projection populations PVT. We found that PVT contains separate populations of cells that project to mPFC, vHC, and those that innervate both regions. Interestingly, dual mPFC-HC projecting cells expressed neither CR or CB. Topographically, mPFC- and vHC-projecting CB+ and CR+ cells clustered around dual projecting neurons in PVT. These results are consistent with the features of dual mPFC-vHC projecting cells in the nucleus reuniens (RE) and suggestive of a functional mPFC-PVT-vHC system that may support mPFC-vHC interactions in PVT-dependent behaviors.

                The Ataxin-2 (Atx2) protein contributes to the progression of neurodegenerative phenotypes in animal models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), type 2 spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA-2), Parkinsons Disease (PD) and Huntingtons Disease (HD). However, because the Atx2 protein contains multiple separable activities, deeper understanding requires experiments to address the exact mechanisms by which Atx2 modulates ND progression. Recent work on two ALS models, C9ORF72 and FUS, in Drosophila has shown that a C-terminal intrinsically disordered region (cIDR) of Atx2 protein, required for assembly of RNP granules, is essential for the progression of neurodegenerative phenotypes as well as for accumulation of protein inclusions associated with these ALS models. Here we show that the Atx2-cIDR also similarly contributes to the progression of degenerative phenotypes and accumulation of Huntingtin protein aggregates in Drosophila models of HD. Because Huntingtin is not an established component of RNP granules, these observations support a recently hypothesised, unexpected protein-handling function for RNP granules, which could contribute to the progression of Huntingtons disease and, potentially, other proteinopathies.

                Chronic sleep loss profoundly impacts health in ways coupled to metabolism; however, much existing literature links sleep and metabolism only on acute timescales. To explore the impact of chronically reduced sleep, we conducted unbiased metabolomics on heads from three Drosophila short-sleeping mutants. Common features included elevated ornithine and polyamines; and lipid, acyl-carnitine, and TCA cycle changes suggesting mitochondrial dysfunction. Biochemical studies of overall, circulating, and excreted nitrogen in sleep mutants demonstrate a specific defect in eliminating nitrogen, suggesting that elevated polyamines may function as a nitrogen sink. Both supplementing polyamines and inhibiting their synthesis with RNAi regulated sleep in control flies. Finally, both polyamine-supplemented food and high-protein feeding were highly toxic to sleep mutants, suggesting their altered nitrogen metabolism is maladaptive. Together, our results suggest polyamine accumulation specifically, and nitrogen stress in general, as potential mechanisms linking chronic sleep loss to adverse health outcomes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Expression and Neurotransmitter Association of the Synaptic Calcium Sensor Synaptotagmin in the Avian Auditory Brain Stem</a></h4>

              
                In the avian auditory brain stem, acoustic timing and intensity cues are processed in separate, parallel pathways via the two division of the cochlear nucleus, nucleus angularis (NA) and nucleus magnocellularis (NM). Differences in excitatory and inhibitory synaptic properties, such as release probability and short-term plasticity, contribute to differential processing of the auditory nerve inputs. We investigated the distribution of synaptotagmin, a putative calcium sensor for exocytosis, via immunohistochemistry and double immunofluorescence in the embryonic and hatchling chick brain stem (Gallus gallus). We found that the two major isoforms, synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1) and synaptotagmin 2 (Syt2), showed differential expression. In the NM, anti-Syt2 label was strong and resembled the endbulb terminals of the auditory nerve inputs, while anti-Syt1 label was weaker and more punctate. In NA, both isoforms were intensely expressed throughout the neuropil. A third isoform, synaptotagmin 7 (Syt7), was largely absent from the cochlear nuclei. In nucleus laminaris (NL, the target nucleus of NM), anti-Syt2 and anti-Syt7 strongly labeled the dendritic lamina. These patterns were established by embryonic day 18 and persisted to postnatal day 7. Double labeling immunofluorescence showed Syt1 and Syt2 were associated with Vesicular Glutamate Transporter 2 (VGluT2), but not Vesicular GABA Transporter (VGAT), suggesting these Syt isoforms were localized to excitatory, but not inhibitory, terminals. These results suggest that Syt2 is the major calcium binding protein underlying excitatory neurotransmission in the timing pathway comprising NM and NL, while Syt2 and Syt1 regulate excitatory transmission in the parallel intensity pathway via cochlear nucleus NA.

	<p>We investigated the intervention effect of training using a feedback-type tactile discrimination system on sensorimotor dysfunction of the hand after a stroke. A human male subject with sensorimotor dysfunction in his left hand after a stroke was asked to perform peg manipulation practice, a building block stacking task, and a material identification task for 10 min each for six weeks. During the activities, a tactile discrimination feedback system was used. The system is a device that detects the vibration information generated when touching an object with a hand and that feeds back the captured information in real time as vibration information. After the intervention, in addition to the reorganization of the sensorimotor areas, the deep sensation, sense of agency, numbness, amount of use, and quality of the left-hand movement improved. Our results suggest that training with the use of a feedback system could be a new form of rehabilitation for sensorimotor dysfunction of the hand.</p>

	<p>It is a widely held belief that developmental dyslexia (DD) is a phonological disorder in which readers have difficulty associating graphemes with their corresponding phonemes. In contrast, the magnocellular theory of dyslexia assumes that DD is a visual disorder caused by dysfunctional magnocellular neural pathways. The review explores arguments for and against these theories. Recent results have shown that DD is caused by (1) a reduced ability to simultaneously recognize sequences of letters that make up words, (2) longer fixation times required to simultaneously recognize strings of letters, and (3) amplitudes of saccades that do not match the number of simultaneously recognized letters. It was shown that pseudowords that could not be recognized simultaneously were recognized almost without errors when the fixation time was extended. However, there is an individual maximum number of letters that each reader with DD can recognize simultaneously. Findings on the neurobiological basis of temporal summation have shown that a necessary prolongation of fixation times is due to impaired processing mechanisms of the visual system, presumably involving magnocells and parvocells. An area in the mid-fusiform gyrus also appears to play a significant role in the ability to simultaneously recognize words and pseudowords. The results also contradict the assumption that DD is due to a lack of eye movement control. The present research does not support the assumption that DD is caused by a phonological disorder but shows that DD is due to a visual processing dysfunction.</p>

	<p>Various studies demonstrate a special role of the right compared to the left anterior insula in mediating our self. However, the neural features of the right insula that allow for its special role remain unclear. Presupposing a spatiotemporal model of self—“Basis model of self-specificity” (BMSS)—we here address the following question: what spatial-topographic and temporal-dynamic features render neural activity in the right insula to be more suitable in mediating self-specificity than the left insula? First, applying fMRI, we demonstrate that the right insula (i) exhibits higher degrees of centrality in rest, and (ii) higher context-dependent functional connectivity in a self-specific task among regions of distinct layers of self (intero-, extero-proprioceptive, and mental). Second, using EEG in rest and task, we show that the right insula shows longer autocorrelation window (ACW) in its neural activity than both left insula and other regions of the different layers of self. Together, we demonstrate special topographic, i.e., high functional connectivity, and dynamic, i.e., long ACW, neural features of the right insula compared to both left insula and other regions of the distinct layers of self. This suits neural activity in the right insula ideally for high functional integration and temporal continuity as key features of the self including its intero-, extero-proprioceptive, and mental layers.</p>

	<p>There is increasing recognition of the involvement of the nigrostriatal and mesolimbic dopamine systems in the modulation of chronic pain. The first part of the present article reviews the evidence indicating that dopamine exerts analgesic effects during persistent pain by stimulating the D2 receptors in the dorsal striatum and nucleus accumbens (NAc). Thereby, dopamine inhibits striatal output via the D2 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (D2-MSN). Dopaminergic neurotransmission in the mesostriatal pathways is hampered in chronic pain states and this alteration maintains and exacerbates pain. The second part of this article focuses on the glutamatergic inputs from the medial prefrontal cortex to the NAc, their activity changes in chronic pain, and their role in pain modulation. Finally, interactions between dopaminergic and glutamatergic inputs to the D2-MSN are considered in the context of persistent pain. Studies using novel techniques indicate that pain is regulated oppositely by two independent dopaminergic circuits linking separate parts of the ventral tegmental area and of the NAc, which also interact with distinct regions of the medial prefrontal cortex.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Separable actions of acetylcholine and noradrenaline on neuronal ensemble formation in hippocampal CA3 circuits</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Luke Y. Prince, Travis Bacon, Rachel Humphries, Krasimira Tsaneva-Atanasova, Claudia Clopath, Jack R. Mellor</p>

In the hippocampus, episodic memories are thought to be encoded by the formation of ensembles of synaptically coupled CA3 pyramidal cells driven by sparse but powerful mossy fiber inputs from dentate gyrus granule cells. The neuromodulators acetylcholine and noradrenaline are separately proposed as saliency signals that dictate memory encoding but it is not known if they represent distinct signals with separate mechanisms. Here, we show experimentally that acetylcholine, and to a lesser extent noradrenaline, suppress feed-forward inhibition and enhance excitatory–inhibitory ratio in the mossy fiber pathway but CA3 recurrent network properties are only altered by acetylcholine. We explore the implications of these findings on CA3 ensemble formation using a hierarchy of models. In reconstructions of CA3 pyramidal cells, mossy fiber pathway disinhibition facilitates postsynaptic dendritic depolarization known to be required for synaptic plasticity at CA3-CA3 recurrent synapses. We further show in a spiking neural network model of CA3 how acetylcholine-specific network alterations can drive rapid overlapping ensemble formation. Thus, through these distinct sets of mechanisms, acetylcholine and noradrenaline facilitate the formation of neuronal ensembles in CA3 that encode salient episodic memories in the hippocampus but acetylcholine selectively enhances the density of memory storage.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Memory shapes microbial populations</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Chaitanya S. Gokhale, Stefano Giaimo, Philippe Remigi</p>

Correct decision making is fundamental for all living organisms to thrive under environmental changes. The patterns of environmental variation and the quality of available information define the most favourable strategy among multiple options, from randomly adopting a phenotypic state to sensing and reacting to environmental cues. Cellular memory—the ability to track and condition the time to switch to a different phenotypic state—can help withstand environmental fluctuations. How does memory manifest itself in unicellular organisms? We describe the population-wide consequences of phenotypic memory in microbes through a combination of deterministic modelling and stochastic simulations. Moving beyond binary switching models, our work highlights the need to consider a broader range of switching behaviours when describing microbial adaptive strategies. We show that memory in individual cells generates patterns at the population level coherent with overshoots and non-exponential lag times distributions experimentally observed in phenotypically heterogeneous populations. We emphasise the implications of our work in understanding antibiotic tolerance and, in general, bacterial survival under fluctuating environments.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Action planning and control under uncertainty emerge through a desirability-driven competition between parallel encoding motor plans</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Vince Enachescu, Paul Schrater, Stefan Schaal, Vassilios Christopoulos</p>

Living in an uncertain world, nearly all of our decisions are made with some degree of uncertainty about the consequences of actions selected. Although a significant progress has been made in understanding how the sensorimotor system incorporates uncertainty into the decision-making process, the preponderance of studies focus on tasks in which selection and action are two separate processes. First people select among alternative options and then initiate an action to implement the choice. However, we often make decisions during ongoing actions in which the value and availability of the alternatives can change with time and previous actions. The current study aims to decipher how the brain deals with uncertainty in decisions that evolve while acting. To address this question, we trained individuals to perform rapid reaching movements towards two potential targets, where the true target location was revealed only after the movement initiation. We found that reaction time and initial approach direction are correlated, where initial movements towards intermediate locations have longer reaction times than movements that aim directly to the target locations. Interestingly, the association between reaction time and approach direction was independent of the target probability. By modeling the task within a recently proposed neurodynamical framework, we showed that action planning and control under uncertainty emerge through a desirability-driven competition between motor plans that are encoded in parallel.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Hypothesis on the pathophysiology of syringomyelia based on analysis of phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging of Chiari-I malformation patients [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Despite a number of hypotheses, our understanding of the pathophysiology of syringomyelia is still limited. The current prevailing hypothesis assumes that the piston-like movement of the cerebellar tonsils drives the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into the syrinx through the spinal perivascular space. However, it still needs to be verified by further experimental data. A major unexplained problem is how CSF enters and remains in the syrinx that has a higher pressure than the subarachnoid space. Methods: I analyzed phase-contrast MRI scans of 18 patients with Chiari-I malformation with syringomyelia undergoing foramen magnum decompression and 21 healthy volunteers. I analyzed the velocity waveforms of the CSF and the brain in various locations. The obtained velocity waveforms were post-processed using a technique called synchronization in situ. I compared between the preoperative data and the control data (case-control study), as well as between the preoperative and postoperative data (cohort study). Results: The syrinx shrank in 17 (94%) patients with good clinical improvement. In Chiari-I patients, the velocity of the tonsil was significantly larger than controls, but was significantly smaller than that of the CSF in the subarachnoid space, suggesting passive rather than active movement. The abnormal tonsillar movement disappeared after surgery, but the velocity waveform of the spinal subarachnoid CSF did not change. These results, contradicting the above mentioned hypothesis, required an alternative explanation. I thus hypothesized that there is a CSF channel between the fourth ventricle and the syrinx. This channel assumes one-way valve function when mildly compressed by the cyclical movement of the cerebellar tonsil. The decompression of the tonsils switches off the one-way valve, collapsing the syrinx. Conclusions: My hypothesis reasonably explained my data that clearly contradicted the existing hypothesis, and successfully addressed the above-mentioned theoretical problem. It will serve as a working hypothesis for further study of syringomyelia pathophysiology.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Long‐term cognitive outcome in anti‐NMDA receptor encephalitis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Cognitive dysfunction is a core symptom of NMDAR encephalitis, but detailed studies on prevalence, characteristics of cognitive deficits, and the potential for recovery are missing. Here, we performed a prospective longitudinal study to assess cognitive long-term outcome and identify clinical predictors.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Standardized comprehensive neuropsychological assessments were performed in 43 patients with NMDAR encephalitis 2.3 years and 4.9 years (median) after disease onset. Cognitive assessments covered executive functions, working memory, verbal/visual episodic memory, attention, as well as subjective complaints, depression and anxiety levels. Cognitive performance of patients was compared to that of 30 healthy participants matched for age, sex, and education.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>All patients had persistent cognitive deficits 2.3 years after onset, with moderate or severe impairment in more than 80% of patients. Core deficits included memory and executive function. After 4.9 years, significant improvement of cognitive function was observed, but moderate to severe deficits persisted in 2/3 of patients, despite favorable functional neurological outcomes (median mRS=1). Delayed treatment, higher disease severity, and longer duration of the acute phase were predictors for impaired cognitive outcome. The recovery process was time-dependent with greater gains earlier after the acute phase, while improvements were possible for several years after disease onset.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Cognitive deficits are the main contributor to long-term morbidity in NMDAR encephalitis and persist beyond functional neurological recovery. Nonetheless, cognitive improvement is possible for several years after the acute phase and should be supported by continued cognitive rehabilitation. Cognition should be included as outcome measure in future clinical studies.</p>

                <p>We conducted a prospective cohort study to determine the prevalence of leukotriene A4 hydrolase (<i>LTA4H</i>) polymorphisms in Zambian adults with tuberculous meningitis (TBM) and its association with mortality. We completed genotype testing on 101 definite cases of TBM and 119 consecutive non-TBM controls. The distribution of genotypes among TBM patients was as follows: C/C (0.83), C/T (0.14), T/T (0.03). There was no significant difference in genotype distribution between TBM and non-TBM patients. We found no relationship between <i>LTA4H</i> polymorphism and survival. Prospective studies are needed to determine the benefit of adjuvant steroids in TBM based upon population LTA4H genotype.</p>
