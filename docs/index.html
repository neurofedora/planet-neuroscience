	<p>Early rehabilitation with the right intensity contributes to the physical recovery of stroke survivors. In clinical practice, physicians determine whether the training intensity is suitable for rehabilitation based on patients&amp;amp;rsquo; narratives, training scores, and evaluation scales, which puts tremendous pressure on medical resources. In this study, a lightweight facial expression recognition algorithm is proposed to diagnose stroke patients&amp;amp;rsquo; training motivations automatically. First, the properties of convolution are introduced into the Vision Transformer&amp;amp;rsquo;s structure, allowing the model to extract both local and global features of facial expressions. Second, the pyramid-shaped feature output mode in Convolutional Neural Networks is also introduced to reduce the model&amp;amp;rsquo;s parameters and calculation costs significantly. Moreover, a classifier that can better classify facial expressions of stroke patients is designed to improve performance further. We verified the proposed algorithm on the Real-world Affective Faces Database (RAF-DB), the Face Expression Recognition Plus Dataset (FER+), and a private dataset for stroke patients. Experiments show that the backbone network of the proposed algorithm achieves better performance than Pyramid Vision Transformer (PvT) and Convolutional Vision Transformer (CvT) with fewer parameters and Floating-point Operations Per Second (FLOPs). In addition, the algorithm reaches an 89.44% accuracy on the RAF-DB dataset, which is higher than other recent studies. In particular, it obtains an accuracy of 99.81% on the private dataset, with only 4.10M parameters.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Activation/suppression balances in rat Superior Colliculus encode the visual continuity illusion</a></h4>

              
                The continuity illusion occurs when visual stimuli are presented at a sufficiently high frequency, thereby triggering a shift from the static to the dynamic vision mode. This facilitates perception of continuous and moving objects, which is key for interactions with the surrounding environment. However, how the continuity illusion is encoded along the entire visual pathway remains poorly understood, with disparate Flicker Fusion Frequency (FFF) measured at the retinal, cortical, and behavioural levels. Here, we combine a behavioural paradigm, functional-MRI (fMRI), and electrophysiological validation for studying the mechanisms underlying the encoding of the continuity illusion effect in the rat. Our behavioural measurements reported a Flicker Fusion Frequency (FFF) of 18{+/-}2 Hz. Remarkably, whole-pathway fMRI revealed marked zero-crossings from positive to negative fMRI signal regimes at the FF in the superior colliculus (SC) - an important visual saliency detector - but not in higher cortical or thalamic visual areas. Our electrophysiological recordings in SC explained the sources of these observations as arising from strong neuronal suppression when the continuity illusion is achieved. Combined, our data suggests that activation and suppression balances in SC play a critical role in encoding the continuity illusion effect.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Optical measurement of glutamate release robustly reports short-term plasticity at a fast central synapse</a></h4>

              
                Recently developed fluorescent neurotransmitter indicators have enabled direct measurements of neurotransmitter in the synaptic cleft. Precise optical measurements of neurotransmitter release may be used to make inferences about presynaptic function independent of electrophysiological measurement techniques. Here, we express iGluSnFR, a genetically encoded glutamate reporter in mouse spiral ganglion neurons to compare electrophysiological and optical readouts of presynaptic function and short-term synaptic plasticity at the endbulb of Held synapse. We conclude that iGluSnFR robustly and approximately linearly reports glutamate release from the endbulb of Held during synaptic transmission and allows assessment of short-term plasticity during high-frequency train stimuli. Furthermore, we show that iGluSnFR expression slightly alters the time course of spontaneous postsynaptic currents, but is unlikely to impact measurements of evoked synchronous release of many synaptic vesicles.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Timescales of adaptation to context in horizontal sound localization</a></h4>

              
                Psychophysical experiments explored how the repeated presentation of a context, consisting of an adaptor and a target, induces plasticity in the localization of an identical target presented alone on interleaved trials. The plasticity, and its time course, was examined both in a classroom and in an anechoic chamber. Adaptors and targets were 2-ms noise clicks and listeners were tasked with localizing the targets while ignoring the adaptors (when present). The context had either a fixed temporal structure, consisting of a single-click adaptor and a target, or its structure varied from trial to trial, either containing a single-click or an 8-click adaptor. The adaptor was presented either from a frontal or a lateral location, fixed within a run. The presence of context caused responses to the isolated targets to be displaced up to 14 degrees away from the adaptor location. This effect was stronger and slower if the context was variable, growing over the 5-minute duration of the runs. Additionally, the fixed-context buildup had a slower onset in the classroom. Overall, the results illustrate that sound localization is subject to slow adaptive processes that depend on the spatial and temporal structure of the context and on the level of reverberation in the environment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Parametric information about eye movements is sent to the ears</a></h4>

              
                Eye movements alter the relationship between the visual and auditory spatial scenes. Signals related to eye movements affect neural pathways from the ear through auditory cortex and beyond, but how these signals contribute to computing the locations of sounds with respect to the visual scene is poorly understood. Here, we evaluated the information contained in eye movement-related eardrum oscillations (EMREOs), pressure changes recorded in the ear canal that occur in conjunction with simultaneous eye movements. We show that EMREOs contain parametric information about horizontal and vertical eye displacement as well as initial/final eye position with respect to the head. The parametric information in the horizontal and vertical directions combines linearly, allowing accurate prediction of the EMREOs associated with oblique eye movements from their respective horizontal and vertical components. Target location can also be inferred from the EMREO signals recorded during eye movements to those targets. We hypothesize that the thus-far unknown mechanism underlying EMREOs could impose a two-dimensional eye-movement related transfer function on any incoming sound, permitting subsequent processing stages to compute the positions of sounds in relation to the visual scene.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reactivating Positive Personality Traits During Sleep Impacts Self-Evaluative Memories</a></h4>

              
                People tend to view themselves through rose-tinted glasses, as evidenced by preferential recall of positive personality traits. We asked whether reactivating positive personality traits during sleep could enhance peoples' positive self-evaluative memories. After a baseline self-referential encoding task in which participants endorsed positive and negative traits as self-descriptive, participants were trained to give timely responses to positive traits in a cue-approach training (CAT) task. Once participants had entered slow-wave sleep during a subsequent nap, half of the trained positive traits were unobtrusively re-played to them to promote consolidation (targeted memory reactivation, TMR). Participants completed free-recall tasks about self-descriptive traits to measure their self-evaluative memories. Our findings revealed that TMR prioritized the recall of positive traits that were strongly memorized before sleep, while impairing the recall of intermediate traits. The results suggest pre-TMR self-evaluative memory strength modulated the TMR benefits. Sleep EEG analyses revealed that compared with weak/intermediate/control traits, re-playing strongly memorized traits during sleep elicited greater sigma power changes, which likely reflect preferential memory reactivation. Our results demonstrate the potential implication of wakeful cue-approach training and sleep-based memory reactivation in strengthening positive self-evaluative memories.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Auditory Brainstem Mechanisms Likely Compensate for Self-imposed Peripheral Inhibition</a></h4>

              
                It is well known that the medial olivocochlear reflex (MOCR) in the brainstem, part of the efferent network, inhibits the cochlear active gain mechanism. The upstream neural influence of this peripheral inhibition is less understood. When the MOCR is activated, responses generated in the cochlea and cortex undergo putative attenuation, yet the amplitude of responses generated in the brainstem are perplexingly unaffected despite decreased input from the periphery. Based on known neural circuitry, we hypothesized that the inhibition of peripheral input is compensated for by equivalent positive feedback in the brainstem over time. We predicted that the inhibition can be captured at the brainstem with stimuli shorter (1.5 s) than previously employed long durations (4 min) where this inhibition is diminished due to compensation. Results from 18 normal hearing human listeners support our hypothesis in that when the MOCR is activated, there is a robust reduction of responses generated at the periphery, brainstem, and cortex for short stimuli and that brainstem inhibition diminishes for longer stimuli. Our methodology and findings have implications for auditory disorders such as tinnitus, evaluation of efferent function, and provides a novel non-invasive window into potential gain compensation mechanisms in the brainstem.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Two differentiated brain systems micro-structurally associated with obesity</a></h4>

              
                The relationship between obesity and brain structure is incompletely understood. Using diffusion-weighted MRI from ~33,000 UK Biobank participants we test the hypothesis that obesity (waist-to-hip ratio, WHR) is associated with regional differences in two micro-structural MRI metrics: isotropic volume fraction (ISOVF), an index of free water, and intra-cellular volume fraction (ICVF), an index of neurite density. We observed significant associations with obesity in two coupled but distinct brain systems: a prefrontal-temporal- striatal system associated with ISOVF and a medial temporal-occipital-striatal system associated with ICVF. The ISOVF~WHR system colocated with expression of genes enriched for innate immune functions, decreased glial density, and high mu opioid (MOR) and other neurotransmitter receptor density. Conversely, the ICVF~WHR system co-located with expression of genes enriched for G-protein coupled receptors and decreased density of MOR and other receptors. To test whether these distinct brain phenotypes might differ in terms of their underlying shared genetics, we estimated the genetic correlations between WHR and ISOVF (rg = 0.026, P = 0.36) and ICVF (rg = 0.112, P < 9x10-4). These correlational results are consistent with a two-way mechanistic model whereby genetically determined differences in neurite density in the medial temporal system may contribute to obesity, whereas water content in the prefrontal system could reflect a consequence of obesity mediated by innate immune system activation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Independence and interaction between the control of moving and holding still in post-stroke arm paresis</a></h4>

              
                Moving and holding still have been posited to be under separate control regimes for both eye and arm movements. The paretic arm after stroke is notable for abnormalities both at rest and during movement, thus it provides an opportunity to address the relationships between control of reaching, stopping and stabilizing. Here, we asked whether independence of these behaviors is preserved in arm paresis. To address this question, we quantified resting postural abnormalities in stroke patients by measuring their biases in force production as they held their hand still in various locations in a planar workspace, and then assessed the influence of these resting force biases on active reaching in the same workspace. We found that patients had marked resting postural force biases at each location. However, these biases did not manifest during any phase of planar reaching movements in the setting of weight support: not during initial acceleration, not to mid-trajectory perturbations, and not during deceleration to a stop. Resting force biases only appeared to switch on after a movement had fully stopped. These findings in stroke suggest that moving and holding still are functionally separable modes of control. At the same time, we found that patients' resting postural force biases mirrored characteristics of abnormal synergies active during movement: they markedly decreased when arm support was provided; they were higher in more distal positions which require breaking out of flexion; and they scaled with the Fugl-Meyer score for the upper extremity (a measure of intrusion of abnormal synergies during active movement). These three shared features suggest a common mechanism for resting postural biases and abnormal synergies, which appears to be a contradiction given the functional separation of moving and holding still observed in the same patients. To resolve this apparent paradox, we propose a model that predicts a breakdown in the functional separation between reaching and holding still when patients move in the absence of weight support. Thus, the model posits that synergies are the behavioral manifestation of a spillover of posture into movement. Mapping these functional systems onto anatomical and physiological details of lesioned substrate after stroke may provide implementation-level insight into how normal arm motor control is assembled.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Expected Costs of Mental Efforts are Updated When People Exert Effort, not by Prospective Information</a></h4>

              
                To understand human behaviour, it is crucial to reveal the mechanisms by which we learn and decide about effort costs and benefits in an uncertain world. Whereas the mechanisms for reward learning are well-understood, the mechanisms for effort cost learning, and especially mental effort, remain elusive. Initially, we hypothesized that cost learning follows temporal-difference learning such that brains update expected costs when informed about upcoming effort levels. However, fMRI data revealed neural correlates of a cost-prediction error of mental effort during task execution and not in response to an effort cue about upcoming effort demands. These results imply that expected costs are updated during actual effort exertion, implying that the adaptive learning of mental effort cost does not follow traditional temporal-difference learning. This study contributes to the understanding of the neural mechanism underlying unwillingness to work, suggesting that humans learn mental effort costs only when they experience effort exertion.

                Lactylation is a newly found lactate-derived post-translational modification, which is firstly reported on histone protein lysine residues to regulate gene expression. Here, we provided evidence that higher serum lactate level was possibly associated with better prognosis in ischemic stroke patients. Meanwhile, inhibition of endogenous lactate increased the infarct volume and decreased protein pan-lactylation in the affected brain tissue in cerebral ischemia mice. We further demonstrated that downregulating lactylation level of Hdac6 (Histone Deacetylase 6) in neurons exacerbated ischemic neuronal injury. The underlying mechanisms involved Hdac6 lactylation disturbing calcium homeostasis through binding BiP (Binding immunoglobulin protein), an endoplasmic reticulum-related protein. Collectively, our findings identified a new effect of lactate for neuroprotection through Hdac6 lactylation during cerebral ischemic reperfusion injury which introduced a potential therapeutic approach against ischemic stroke.

     alt="Long-term effects of prophylactic MgSO4 in maternal immune activation rodent model at adolescence and adulthood"/>
<p>Despite the putative advantages of MgSO<sub>4</sub> as a neuroprotective agent, the long-term neuroprotective effect on the offspring is still unraveled. Here, we studied the long-term impact of antenatal MgSO<sub>4</sub> at the late gestational periods on the offspring behavior in a mouse MIA model. MgSO<sub>4</sub> treatment for preventing brain injuries can adversely affect offspring cognition behavior later in life, depending on the sex and age of the offspring.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The effects of MgSO<sub>4</sub> as an anti-inflammatory agent in pregnant women have been investigated in the last few years. Infections can cause an inflammatory reaction involving the placenta membranes and amniotic cavity. They may have short-term effects on the mother and her fetuses, like preterm birth, cerebral palsy, and developmental delay. Despite the alleged advantages of MgSO<sub>4</sub> as a neuroprotective agent in the preterm brain, the long-term molecular and behavioral function of MgSO<sub>4</sub> has not been fully elucidated. Here, we investigated the long-term effect of antenatal MgSO<sub>4</sub>, during late gestation, on offspring's behavior focusing on cognitive function, motor activity, and social cognition in adolescence and adulthood, and explored its influence on brain gene expression (e.g., ErbB signaling, pro-inflammatory, and dopaminergic markers) in adulthood. A significant abnormal exploratory behavior of offspring of MgSO<sub>4</sub>-treated dams was found compared to the control group in both adolescence and adulthood. Furthermore, we found that adult females exposed to MgSO<sub>4</sub> under inflammation displayed working and recognition memory impairment. A reduction in IL-6 expression was detected in the prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus specimens derived from LPS–Mg-treated group. In contrast, an imbalanced expression of dopamine 1 and 2 receptors was detected only in prefrontal cortex specimens. Besides, we found that MgSO<sub>4</sub> ameliorated the overexpression of the Nrg1 and Erbb4 receptors induced by LPS in the hippocampus. Thus, MgSO<sub>4</sub> treatment for preventing brain injuries can adversely affect offspring cognition behavior later in life, depending on the sex and age of the offspring.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Batten disease consists of a family of primarily autosomal recessive, progressive neuropediatric disorders, also known as neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs). These pathologies are characterized by seizures and visual, cognitive and motor decline, and premature death. The pathophysiology of this rare disease is still unclear despite the years of trials and financial aids. This paper has reviewed advantages and limits of in vivo and in vitro models of Batten disease from murine and larger animal models to primitive unicellular models, until the most recently developed patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells. For each model advantages, limits and applications were analyzed. The first prototypes investigated were murine models that due to their limits were replaced by larger animals. In vitro models gradually replaced animal models for practical, cost, and ethical reasons. Using induced pluripotent stem cells to study neurodegeneration is a new way of studying the disease, since they can be distinguished into differentiating elements like neurons, which are susceptible to neurodegeneration. In vivo and in vitro models have contributed to clarifying to some extent the pathophysiology of the disease. The collection and sharing of suitable human bio samples likely through biobanks can contribute to a better understanding, prevention, and to identify possible treatment strategies of Batten disease.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To study the comparative safety of antiseizure medication (ASM) monotherapy in pregnancy with respect to risk of major congenital malformations (MCM), overall and MCM subtypes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a population-based cohort study using national health register data from Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden (1996-2020). We compared pregnancies with first trimester exposure to lamotrigine monotherapy to ASM unexposed, carbamazepine, valproate, oxcarbazepine, levetiracetam, and topiramate to lamotrigine monotherapy, and stratified monotherapy groups by dose. The outcome was non-genetic MCM and specific subtypes. We estimated adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) with log-binomial regression and propensity score weights.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>There was a higher crude risk of any MCM in pregnancies exposed to lamotrigine monotherapy (n=8339) compared to ASM unexposed (n=4,866,362), but not after confounder adjustment (aRR 0.97, 95% CI 0.87-1.08). Compared to lamotrigine, there was an increased risk of malformations associated with valproate (n=2031, aRR 2.05, 1.70-2.46) and topiramate (n=509, aRR 1.81, 1.26-2.60) which increased in a dose-dependent manner. We found no differences in malformation risk for carbamazepine (n=2674, aRR 0.91, 0.72-1.15), oxcarbazepine (n=1313, RR 1.09, 0.83-1.44), or levetiracetam (n=1040, aRR 0.78, 0.53-1.13). Valproate was associated with several malformation subtypes including nervous system, cardiac, oral clefts, clubfoot, and hypospadias whereas lamotrigine and carbamazepine were not.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Topiramate is associated with an increased risk of MCM similar to that associated with valproate, but lower doses may mitigate the risks for both drugs. Conversely, we found no increased risks for lamotrigine, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, or levetiracetam, which is reassuring.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Simplified Model of Motor Control</a></h4>

              
                In general, control of movement is considered to be either cortical, spinal, or purely biomechanical and is studied separately at these levels. To achieve this separation when studying a particular level, variations that may be introduced by the other levels are generally either ignored or restricted. This restriction misrepresents the way movements occur in realistic scenarios and limits the ability to model movements in a biologically inspired manner. In this work, we propose a heuristic model for motor control that conceptually and mathematically accounts for the entire motor process, from target to endpoint. It simulates human arm motion and is able to represent functionally different motion properties by flexibly choosing more or less complex motion paths without built-in optimization or joint constraints. With a novel implementation of hierarchical control, this model successfully overcomes the problem of degrees of freedom in robotics. It can serve as a template for neurocomputational work that currently uses control architectures that do not mirror the human motor control process. The model itself also suggests a maximum threshold for delays in position feedback for effective movement, and that the primary role of position feedback in movement is to overcome the effects of environmental perturbations at the joint level. These findings can inform future efforts to develop biologically inspired motor control techniques for prosthetic devices.

                The development and survival of dopaminergic neurons are influenced by the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) pathway. Anosmin-1 (A1) is an extracellular matrix protein that acts as a major regulator of this signaling pathway, controlling FGF diffusion, and receptor interaction and shuttling. Furthermore, overexpression of A1 in vivo gives rise to higher number of dopaminergic neurons in the olfactory bulb. Here, using A1 overexpressing mice (A1-mice), we studied the effects of A1 on different populations of catecholaminergic neurons in the central (CNS) and the peripheral nervous systems (PNS). A1 overexpression increases the number of dopaminergic SNpc neurons and alters the striosome/matrix organization of the striatum. Interestingly, these numerical and morphological changes in the nigrostriatal pathway of A1-mice do not confer an altered susceptibility to experimental MPTP-parkinsonism with respect to wild type controls. Moreover, the study of the effects of A1 overexpression was extended to different dopaminergic tissues associated with the PNS, detecting a significant reduction in the number of dopaminergic chemosensitive carotid body glomus cells in A1-mice. Overall, these analyses confirm A1 as a principal regulator of the FGF pathway in the development and survival of dopaminergic neurons in different nuclei of the mammalian nervous system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A back-translational study of descending interactions with central mechanisms of hyperalgesia induced by high frequency stimulation in rat and human</a></h4>

              
                In humans and animals, high frequency electrocutaneous stimulation (HFS) may produce an early long-term potentiation-like sensitisation. Peripheral and central modulatory processes are proposed to play a role. To explore the impact of descending inhibitory pathway activation on the development of HFS-induced hyperalgesia, we concurrently applied HFS with i) a conditioned pain modulation (CPM) paradigm during psychophysical testing in humans, or ii) a diffuse noxious inhibitory controls (DNIC) paradigm during in vivo electrophysiological recording of spinal neurones in anaesthetised animals in parallel studies that utilised identical stimuli. HFS induced enhanced perceptual responses to pin-prick stimuli in cutaneous areas secondary to the area of stimulation in humans and heightened the excitability of spinal neurones in rats (which exhibited stimulus intensity dependent coded responses to pin-prick stimulation in a manner that tracked with human psychophysics), where we also observed indicators of increased central neuronal hyperexcitability. In humans, a HFS(+CPM) paradigm did not alter primary or secondary hyperalgesia, and the area and pain intensity of secondary hyperalgesia did not correlate with temporal summation of pain or CPM magnitude, while in rats application of a DNIC paradigm concurrent to HFS did not impact the development of neuronal hyperexcitability. Concordance between human and rat data supports their translational validity. Our finding that excitatory signalling exceeds inhibitory controls suggests that dampening facilitatory mechanisms may be a preferable strategy for certain chronic pain states. If facilitatory mechanisms dominate, our data could explain why enhancing activity in descending inhibitory controls is not sufficient to induce pain relief in vulnerable patients.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Kinetic models for PET displacement studies</a></h4>

              
                The traditional design of PET target engagement studies is based on a baseline scan and one or more scans after drug administration. We here evaluate an alternative design in which the drug is administered during an on-going scan (i.e., a displacement study). This approach results both in lower radiation exposure and lower costs. Existing kinetic models assume steady state. This condition is not present during a drug displacement and consequently, our aim here was to develop kinetic models for analysing PET displacement data. We modified existing compartment models to accommodate a time-variant increase in occupancy following the pharmacological in-scan intervention. Since this implies the use of differential equations that cannot be solved analytically, we developed instead one approximate and one numerical solution. Through simulations, we show that if the occupancy is relatively high, it can be estimated without bias and with good accuracy. The models were applied to PET data from six pigs where [11C]UCB-J was displaced by intravenous brivaracetam. The dose-occupancy relationship estimated from these scans showed good agreement with occupancies calculated with Lassen plot applied to baseline-block scans of two pigs. In summary, the proposed models provide a framework to determine target occupancy from a single displacement scan.

                In the past years, machine-learning-based approaches to track animal poses with high spatial and temporal resolution have become available, but toolkits to extract, integrate, and analyze coordinate datasets in a user-friendly manner have lagged behind. Here, we introduce Fear-Mouse Tracker (FMT), a simple and open-source MATLAB-based pipeline to extract and quantitatively analyze DeepLabCut-derived coordinates of mice presented with threatening stimuli that commonly trigger innate defensive responses. This framework allows for unbiased quantitative estimations of stretch-attend posture (SAP) observed during risk assessment behaviors, as well as for measurements of the timing and extent of freezing and escape responses that follow the presentation of threatening stimuli such as a predator odor, or sweeping and looming stimuli resembling predator approaches. FMT is specially designed for users not very experienced in using programming languages, thus making it more accessible to a broader audience.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sex-differences in prostaglandin signaling: a semi-systematic review and characterization of PTGDS expression in human sensory neurons</a></h4>

              
                There is increasing evidence of sex differences in underlying mechanisms causing pain in preclinical models, and in clinical populations. There are also important disconnects between clinical pain populations and the way preclinical pain studies are conducted. For instance, osteoarthritis pain more frequently affects women but most preclinical studies have been conducted using males in animal models. The most widely used painkillers, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), act on the prostaglandin pathway by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes. The purpose of this study was to analyze the preclinical and clinical literature on the role of prostaglandins and COX in inflammation and pain. We aimed to specifically identify studies that used both sexes and investigate whether any sex-differences in the action of prostaglandins and COX inhibition had been reported, either in clinical or preclinical studies. We conducted a PubMed search and identified 369 preclinical studies and 100 clinical studies that matched our inclusion/exclusion criteria. Our analysis shows that only 17% of preclinical studies on prostaglandins used both sexes and, out of those, only 19% analyzed or reported data in a sex-aware fashion. In contrast, 79% of the clinical studies analyzed used both sexes. However, only 6% of those reported data in a sex-aware fashion. Interestingly, 14 out of 15 preclinical studies and 4 out of 5 clinical studies that analyzed data in a sex-aware fashion have identified sex-differences. This builds on the increasing evidence of sex-differences in prostaglandin signaling and the importance of sex-awareness in data analysis. The preclinical literature identifies a sex difference in prostaglandin D2 synthase (PTGDS) expression where it is higher in female than in male rodents in the nervous system. We experimentally validated that PTGDS expression is higher in female human dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons recovered from organ donors. Our semi-systematic literature review reveals a need for continued inclusivity of both male and female animals in prostaglandins studies and sex-aware analysis in data analysis in preclinical and clinical studies. Our finding of sex-differences in neuronal PTGDS expression in humans exemplifies the need for a more comprehensive understanding of how the prostaglandin system functions in the DRG in rodents and humans.

                During memory retrieval, people tend to reenact the same eye movements performed when memorized items were first displayed and to gaze at similar locations. This was hypothesized to reflect the role of eye movements as retrieval cues. However, it is unknown what is it about eye movements that makes them effective retrieval cues. Here, we examine, for the first time, the individual and combined contributions of the visual and the motor components of eye movements to memory retrieval. Results (N=70) revealed a non-additive benefit of both components of eye movements to memory performance. Additionally, we found that individuals who gained from one component, were more likely to gain from the other as well. Together, these findings unravel the central role of eye movements in episodic memory; they show how the visual and motor components are integrated into a single effective memory retrieval cue and how this integration varies among individuals.

                The contraction bias has been extensively studied in psychophysics, but only recently has its origin begun to be investigated with neural activity recordings. Leveraging the fact that it is currently possible to train recurrent networks of spiking neurons to perform cognitive tasks, we investigated the causes of the contraction bias and how behavior relates to population firing activity in networks trained to discriminate temporal intervals. A novel normative model containing potential sources of the bias guided us in investigating how it emerged in the networks. Various geometric features of state-space trajectories encoded compressed representations of the durations of the first interval, which were modulated by sensory history. Furthermore, these compressions conveyed a Bayesian estimate of the durations, thus relating activity and behavior. We conjecture that this occurs in areas of the brain where information about the current and preceding stimuli converges, and that it holds generally in delayed comparison tasks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Self-Regulation of Visual Word Form Area activation with real-time fMRI neurofeedback</a></h4>

              
                The Visual Word Form Area (VWFA) is a key region of the brain's reading network and its activation has been shown to be strongly associated with reading skills. Here, for the first time, we investigated whether voluntary regulation of VWFA activity is feasible using real-time fMRI neurofeedback. 40 adults with typical reading skills were instructed to either upregulate (UP group) or downregulate (DOWN group) their own VWFA activity during six neurofeedback training runs. The VWFA target region was individually defined based on a functional localizer task. Before and after training, also regulation runs without feedback ('no-feedback runs') were performed. When comparing the two groups, we found stronger activity across the whole reading network, including the VWFA, for the UP than the DOWN group. Crucially, we observed a significant interaction of group and time (pre, post) for the no-feedback runs: The two groups did not differ in their VWFA activity before neurofeedback training, but the UP group showed significantly stronger activity than the DOWN group after neurofeedback training. Our results indicate that self-regulation of the VWFA activity is feasible and that, once learned, successful self-regulation can even be performed in the absence of feedback. These results are a crucial step toward to development of a potential clinical intervention to improve reading skills in individuals with reading impairments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Uncovering 2-D toroidal representations in grid cell ensemble activity during 1-D behavior</a></h4>

              
                Neuroscience is pushing toward studying the brain during naturalistic behaviors with open-ended tasks. Grid cells are a classic example, where free behavior was key to observing their characteristic spatial representations in two-dimensional environments. In contrast, it has been difficult to identify grid cells and study their computations in more restrictive experiments, such as head-fixed wheel running. Here, we challenge this view by showing that shifting the focus from single neurons to the population level changes the minimal experimental complexity required to study grid cell representations. Specifically, we combine the manifold approximation in UMAP with persistent homology to study the topology of the population activity. With these methods, we show that the population activity of grid cells covers a similar two-dimensional toroidal state space during wheel running as in open field foraging, with and without a virtual reality setup. Trajectories on the torus correspond to single trial runs in virtual reality and changes in experimental conditions are reflected in the internal representation, while the toroidal representation undergoes occasional shifts in its alignment to the environment. These findings show that our method can uncover latent topologies that go beyond the complexity of the task, allowing us to investigate internal dynamics in simple experimental settings in which the analysis of grid cells has so far remained elusive.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural alpha oscillations and pupil size differentially index cognitive demand under competing audio-visual task conditions</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive demand is thought to modulate two often used, but rarely combined, measures: pupil size and neural alpha (8-12 Hz) oscillatory power. However, it is unclear whether these two measures capture cognitive demand in a similar way, and whether a measured cognitive demand response in pupil size or brain activity is dependent on sensory modality by which the demand is induced. Here we recorded pupil size and neural alpha power (using electroencephalography), while human participants of both sexes concurrently performed a visual multiple object-tracking task and an auditory gap-detection task. Difficulties of the two tasks were manipulated independent of each other. Participants' performance decreased in accuracy and speed with increasing cognitive demand. Pupil size increased with increasing demand for both the auditory and the visual task. Alpha power emerging from two cortical sources showed counteracting neural dynamics: Alpha power in visual cortex decreased with increasing demand in the visual task, whereas alpha power in parietal cortex increased with increasing demand in the auditory task. Furthermore, demand-related changes in pupil size and alpha power were uncorrelated, suggesting that they index different aspects of cognitive demand. Overall, the current study demonstrates that the dynamics of the neurophysiological indices of cognitive demand and associated effort are multi-faceted and potentially modality-dependent under complex audio-visual task conditions.

                While sensory representations in the brain depend on context, it remains unclear how such modulations are implemented at the biophysical level, and how processing layers further in the hierarchy can extract useful features for each possible contextual state. Here, we first demonstrate that thin dendritic branches are well suited to implementing contextual modulation of feedforward processing. Such neuron-specific modulations exploit prior knowledge, encoded in stable feedforward weights, to achieve transfer learning across contexts. In a network of biophysically realistic neuron models with context-independent feedforward weights, we show that modulatory inputs to thin dendrites can solve linearly non-separable learning problems with a Hebbian, error-modulated learning rule. Finally, we demonstrate that local prediction of whether representations originate either from different inputs, or from different contextual modulations of the same input, results in representation learning of hierarchical feedforward weights across processing layers that accommodate a multitude of contexts.

	<p>Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is consistently associated with a host of social problems, such as victimization and difficulties in maintaining close friendships. These problems are not limited to offline relations but also manifest in the online social world, as previous research shows that ADHD is associated with problematic use of social media. Given the ubiquitous nature of social media, the goal of the current review is to understand why adolescents with ADHD demonstrate more problematic social media use than their typically developing peers. To this end, we provide a narrative review on the evidence for the link between ADHD and social media use, and consequently present an integrative framework, which encompasses neurobiological mechanisms (i.e., imbalance theory of brain development and dual pathway model of ADHD) and social mechanisms, including influences from peers and parents. We conclude that empirical work shows most consistent evidence for the link between problematic social media use and ADHD (symptoms), while intensity of social media use is also associated with several other behaviors and outcomes. Finally, we hypothesize how existing interventions for ADHD may work on the identified mechanisms and provide at-hand clinical recommendations for therapists working with adolescents with ADHD who exhibit problematic social media use.</p>

	<p>The benefits of sport activity on cognition and especially on executive function development are well-known, and in recent years, several kinds of cognitive-motor training (CMT) have been proven effective in adults and older people. Less is known about possible CMT benefits in children. This study aims to confirm the positive influence played by CMTs on specific executive functions (planning abilities and visual search) in young soccer players. Twenty-four 10-year-old athletes were recruited and randomly assigned to the experimental (Exp) and control (Con) groups of 12 players. Both groups were trained for 10 weeks, twice a week (90 min per training), following standard soccer training (technical-tactical exercises). The Exp group, during the first training session of the week, in the last 22 min, performed the experimental treatment, which consisted of a psychokinetic CMT. Both groups were examined before and after the ten-week training using the Tower of London and WISC-IV cancellation tests. Results revealed that the Exp group, following treatment, reported significantly better scores than the Con group in all the cognitive measures. We concluded that the proposed CMT is more effective than motor training alone at improving planning abilities and visual search abilities, even in children.</p>

	<p>A range of professional figures are needed to preserve the quality of life of people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This study aimed to explore the beginning of the care process as negotiated by people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, their caregivers, and healthcare professionals. We designed the study according to the constructivist Grounded Theory method, collecting data through open-ended, semi-structured interviews, employing theoretical sampling and constant comparison, and performing conceptual coding as data analysis. By naming the core category &amp;amp;ldquo;off-beat interfacing&amp;amp;rdquo;, we were able to show how the demands of the professionals concerned did not correspond to the ability of people with ALS and their proxies to process information, deal with requests, and be at ease in making decisions at the beginning of the shared care pathway. Three categories were generated: (i) navigating different paths, (ii) offering and experiencing a standard, non-personalized pathway, and (iii) anticipating decisions. The network of services must be organized according to guidelines, but must also contemplate a patient-family-centered approach that permits more personalized assistance.</p>

	<p>Compared to other primates, humans are late bloomers, with exceptionally long childhood and adolescence. The extensive developmental period of humans is thought to facilitate the learning processes required for the growth and maturation of the complex human brain. During the first two and a half decades of life, the human brain is a construction site, and learning processes direct its shaping through experience-dependent neuroplasticity. Formal and informal learning, which generates long-term and accessible knowledge, is mediated by neuroplasticity to create adaptive structural and functional changes in brain networks. Since experience-dependent neuroplasticity is at full force during school years, it holds a tremendous educational opportunity. In order to fulfill this developmental and learning potential, educational practices should be human-brain-friendly and &amp;amp;ldquo;ride&amp;amp;rdquo; the neuroplasticity wave. Neuroscience can inform educators about the natural learning mechanisms of the brain to support student learning. This review takes a neuroscientific lens to explore central concepts in education (e.g., mindset, motivation, meaning-making, and attention) and suggests two methods of using neuroscience as an educational tool: teaching students about their brain (content level) and considering the neuro-mechanisms of learning in educational design (design level).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Characteristics and contributing factors of adverse drug reactions: an analytical study of patients with tuberculosis receiving treatment under the National TB Program of India [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Tuberculosis (TB) continues to pose a serious threat to the public health system in India. Although the National Tuberculosis Elimination Program (NTEP) is providing a wide range of interventions from early diagnosis to complete treatment to reduce morbidity and mortality from TB, adverse drug reactions (ADR) remain a challenge in treatment adherence and completion. Methods An observational cross-sectional study was conducted in selected districts of Gujarat state. A total of 593 reported TB patients were recruited with an adjusted unified distribution based on the type of cases, site of diseases, and service facility through a simple random sampling method. A semi-structured questionnaire tool was used to collect socio-demographic, clinical, and ADR-related data from the TB patients. Data was analyzed for the frequency, percentage, chi-squared, and adjusted odds ratio to find the association between the variables. Results The majority of the study participants were male (87.2%), aged 15 to 60 (57.8%), daily laborers (22.4%), and married (64.2%). Over 75% of individuals had pulmonary TB, with 87% having experienced their first episode, 83% being new cases, and 44.7% having a history of addiction. ADR with mild symptoms was reported by more than a quarter (29%) of TB patients during the intensive phase (77%). The association between ADR experience and drug susceptibility was significant (p<0.005) and drug-resistant TB patients experience two times more ADRs than drug-sensitive TB patients (OR 2.04). Binomial logistic regression was carried out to describe the association between various variables and occurrence of ADRs. Conclusion The study highlighted a need to enhance health care providers’ capacity and program structure for managing ADRs among TB patients. In order to completely eliminate TB across the country, it also emphasized the attention for a holistic and all-encompassing strategy for managing TB patients at the field level.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Validation of an instrument in Latin America to measure fear perception of the consequences of a large-scale war (war-effect) [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The Russia-Ukraine war brought immediate and delayed socio-economic consequences. In general, the repercussions caused fear all over the world. This study aims to validate an instrument for measuring fear perception caused by the consequences of a large-scale war in Latin American citizens. Methodology: An instrumental study in which 1705 residents of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Paraguay, Peru and other countries were surveyed through a virtual format. A literature search, expert judgment, preliminary (then exploratory and confirmatory) analysis, as well as reliability assessment were carried out. Results: The skewness and kurtosis values of the 13 questions did not exceed the range ± 1.5 and showed significant correlations (>0.30). The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin index (0.962) and Bartlett's test (19558.5; df=78; p=0.001) had good indicators. The parallel analysis suggested a single factor, which explained 75.59% of the total variance. The confirmatory factor analysis generated an instrument with six items (χ2=47.33, df=9, p=0.001; RMR=0.010; GFI=0.990; CFI=1.00; TLI=0.990; and RMSEA=0.050), with an overall Cronbach's Alpha=0.949 (95% CI=0.94–0.95). Conclusion: A six-item instrument that measures the perception of fear caused by the consequences of a large-scale war was validated in half a dozen Latin American countries. This short and valid instrument can be administered to a broad population in Latin America.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Spatial association of land-use areas and disease occurred by pesticide poisoning in Thailand [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Thailand is one of the Asian countries where high pesticides use is common for agriculture. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the spatial association between types of land-use areas and diseases occurred by pesticide poisoning in Thailand. Methods: This study was conducted by using the data set of average prevalence of diseases occurred by pesticide pollution and the land-use areas between 2018-2020. A Moran’s I and local indicators of spatial association (LISA) were used to identify the spatial autocorrelation between each type of land use areas and diseases developed due to pesticide poisoning in Thailand. Results: This present study observed that the average prevalence of disease occurred from pesticide pollution between 2018-2020 was 13.17 (95% CI: 10.83 - 15.50) per 100,000 in Thailand. The results identified the spatial global autocorrelation of each type of land used and occurrence of diseases due to pesticide pollution, including rice field areas, field crops, fruit trees and perennials, vegetables and flowers, and other agriculture with Moran’s I 0.270, 0.144, 0.606, 0.135, and 0.324 respectively. A spatial association between various factors and average prevalence of pesticide pollutions with significant LISA analysis were; rice field areas with eight high-high clusters and nine low-low clusters, field crops areas with three high-high clusters and 11 low-low clusters,  fruit trees and perennials areas with eight high-high clusters and 12 low-low clusters, and six high-high clusters and four low-low clusters vegetable and flower areas. Similarly, nine high-high clusters and nine low-low clusters of other agricultural areas had been observed with prevalence of diseases acquired by pesticide pollution. Conclusions: There was significant spatial association between land-use areas and diseases acquired by pesticide pollution in Thailand. It should be controlled by new policy recommendations for pesticides use for agriculture.,  especially, in provinces with more land-use areas for each type of plant.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Zen meditation-integrated CBT normalized the impaired brain function of a chronic low back pain patient—from the findings of brain blood flow SPECT imaging [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Mindfulness meditation for chronic pain is popular globally, but evidence of its efficacy is limited. Moreover, there are no established methods on the objective evaluation of the effectiveness of interventions for chronic pain. In this study, a chronic low back pain patient was treated with traditional Japanese Buddhism meditation-integrated cognitive behavioral therapy and the pre- and post-intervention brain single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images were compared. Case: A 45-year-old man was experiencing continuous back pain after a vehicular accident and experienced insufficient improvement after drug treatment. The patient underwent a 3-month outpatient mindfulness meditation-integrated cognitive behavioral therapy program executed by a multidisciplinary team: physician visits (once a week for 30 min), multidisciplinary medical and meditation education (Zen breath counting meditation and mantra), physiotherapy interventions (twice weekly), occupational therapy interventions (twice weekly), psychiatric occupational therapy interventions (twice weekly), and nutritional interventions (twice weekly). After treatment, the patient reported a decrease in subjective pain overall, based on whether or not a pain attack occurred. Brain SPECT imaging revealed an improvement in excess blood flow from the right temporoparietal junction to the inferior parietal lobe. Conclusions: These findings indicate that Zen meditation is an effective intervention method for chronic pain and SPECT is a useful tool for measuring its effectiveness.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Frontier model of the environmental inefficiency effects on livestock bioeconomy [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This work was focused on measuring environmental inefficiency in Mexican dairy farms, considering climate change variables related to the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) and planetary geomagnetic activity. Methods: The applied methodology measures the eco-efficiency of Mexican dairy farms using the empirical application of a stochastic frontier model of the bioeconomy. The productive sector of the bioeconomy studied was the eco-intensification of the livestock production system (dairies). The environmental inefficiency effect was assumed to be a distribution-independent truncation of a normal distribution with constant variance, while the mean was a linear environmental function of the observable variable. Results: The results showed that the coefficients of the frontier model were highly significant, highlighting the investment in livestock (50%). The inefficiency model had an impact on climate variation with greenhouse gas emissions CH4 (1.96%). The results of the environmental technical efficiency in geometric average were 81.28%. The producers that reached the border with a technical efficiency equal to 1 are the references for the rest, marking the relative technical efficiency. Conclusions: It was concluded that the coefficients in the model were very significant, showing the level of investment in livestock (50%). The low-performance model estimates the impact of climate change on GHG emissions CH4 (1.96%) explaining the trend of increasing GHG emissions, keeping in view that the management of food and cattle during the study period were affected by summer feeding, which allowed considering the activity of GHG emissions. According to the results, the geometric mean environmental performance of engineering is 81.28%.

                Background: Environmental problems are becoming more recurrent nowadays, which is why many countries have acted on the matter, through different forms, laws and taxes that can contribute and reduce the polluting impact of companies at the time of manufacturing their products. One of the reforms has been environmental taxes, which are not only aimed at raising money, but also at taking corrective action on the behavior of companies that damage both the environment and the health of the population. The research is intended to finding out the opinion and interest of managers of different companies in the industrial sector on environmental taxes, also known as green taxes, and whether they consider it necessary to add green taxes to the current tax system. Method: For data collection of the research, 120 managers of small and medium-sized enterprises in the industrial sector were questioned about whether green taxes could have an influence on ecosystem conservation and several other questions. Results: 63.3% of the managers surveyed agree that the application of an environmental tax is necessary. Conclusion: It is concluded that managers are in favor of green taxes and  approve that  such taxes should be given as part of ecosystem conservation and environmental protection for all businesses, and that they promote businesses that do not generate any side effects or transformations to the environmental balance, thus improving the quality of life of residents.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dorsal striatum coding for the timely execution of action sequences</a></h4>

              
                The automatic initiation of actions can be highly functional. But occasionally these actions cannot be withheld and are released at inappropriate times, impulsively. Striatal activity has been shown to participate in the timing of action sequence initiation and it has been linked to impulsivity. Using a self-initiated task, we trained adult male rats to withhold a rewarded action sequence until a waiting time interval has elapsed. By analyzing neuronal activity we show that the striatal response preceding the initiation of the learned sequence is strongly modulated by the time subjects wait before eliciting the sequence. Interestingly, the modulation is steeper in adolescent rats, which show a strong prevalence of impulsive responses compared to adults. We hypothesize this anticipatory striatal activity reflects the animals’ subjective reward expectation, based on the elapsed waiting time, while the steeper waiting modulation in adolescence reflects age-related differences in temporal discounting, internal urgency states, or explore–exploit balance.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cell-intrinsic ceramides determine T cell function during melanoma progression</a></h4>

              
                Acid sphingomyelinase (Asm) and acid ceramidase (Ac) are parts of the sphingolipid metabolism. Asm hydrolyzes sphingomyelin to ceramide, which is further metabolized to sphingosine by Ac. Ceramide generates ceramide-enriched platforms that are involved in receptor clustering within cellular membranes. However, the impact of cell-intrinsic ceramide on T cell function is not well characterized. By using T cell-specific Asm- or Ac-deficient mice, with reduced or elevated ceramide levels in T cells, we identified ceramide to play a crucial role in T cell function in vitro and in vivo. T cell-specific ablation of Asm in <i>Smpd1<sup>fl/fl</sup>/Cd4<sup>cre/+</sup></i> (Asm/CD4cre) mice resulted in enhanced tumor progression associated with impaired T cell responses, whereas <i>Asah1<sup>fl/fl</sup>/Cd4<sup>cre/+</sup></i> (Ac/CD4cre) mice showed reduced tumor growth rates and elevated T cell activation compared to the respective controls upon tumor transplantation. Further in vitro analysis revealed that decreased ceramide content supports CD4<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cell differentiation and interferes with cytotoxic activity of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. In contrast, elevated ceramide concentration in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from Ac/CD4cre mice was associated with enhanced cytotoxic activity. Strikingly, ceramide co-localized with the T cell receptor (TCR) and CD3 in the membrane of stimulated T cells and phosphorylation of TCR signaling molecules was elevated in Ac-deficient T cells. Hence, our results indicate that modulation of ceramide levels, by interfering with the Asm or Ac activity has an effect on T cell differentiation and function and might therefore represent a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of T cell-dependent diseases such as tumorigenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Metrics of high cofluctuation and entropy to describe control of cardiac function in the stellate ganglion</a></h4>

              
                Stellate ganglia within the intrathoracic cardiac control system receive and integrate central, peripheral, and cardiopulmonary information to produce postganglionic cardiac sympathetic inputs. Pathological anatomical and structural remodeling occurs within the neurons of the stellate ganglion (SG) in the setting of heart failure. A large proportion of SG neurons function as interneurons whose networking capabilities are largely unknown. Current therapies are limited to targeting sympathetic activity at the cardiac level or surgical interventions such as stellectomy, to treat heart failure. Future therapies that target the stellate ganglion will require understanding of their networking capabilities to modify any pathological remodeling. We observe SG networking by examining cofluctuation and specificity of SG networked activity to cardiac cycle phases. We investigate network processing of cardiopulmonary transduction by SG neuronal populations in porcine with chronic pacing-induced heart failure and control subjects during extended in-vivo extracellular microelectrode recordings. We find that information processing and cardiac control in chronic heart failure by the SG, relative to controls, exhibits: i) more frequent, short-lived, high magnitude cofluctuations, ii) greater variation in neural specificity to cardiac cycles, and iii) neural network activity and cardiac control linkage that depends on disease state and cofluctuation magnitude.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Processing of the same narrative stimuli elicits common functional connectivity dynamics between individuals</a></h4>

              
                It has been suggested that the richness of conscious experience can be directly linked to the richness of brain state repertories. Brain states change depending on our environment and activities we engage in by taking both external and internally derived information into account. It has been shown that high-level sensory stimulation changes local brain activity and induces neural synchrony across participants. However, the dynamic interplay of cognitive processes that underlie moment-to-moment information processing remains poorly understood. Using naturalistic movies as an ecological laboratory model of the real world, here we assess how the processing of complex naturalistic stimuli alters the dynamics of brain networks' interactions, and how these in turn support information processing. Participants underwent fMRI recordings during movie watching, scrambled movie watching, and rest. Measuring phase-synchrony between different brain networks, we computed whole-brain connectivity patterns. We showed that specific connectivity patterns were associated with each experimental condition. We hypothesized that functional connectivity dynamics would be similar across participants during the plot-driven movie. We found a higher synchronization of brain patterns across participants during movie watching compared to resting state and scrambled movie conditions. Moreover, synchronization increased during the most engaging parts of the movie. The synchronization dynamics across participants were associated with suspensefulness; more suspenseful scenes induced higher synchronization. These results suggested that processing of the same high-level information elicits common neural dynamics among individuals and that whole-brain functional connectivity tracks variations in the processed information and the subjective experience.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">BDNF and TRiC-inspired Reagents Rescue Cortical Synaptic Deficits in a Mouse Model of Huntington's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Huntingtons disease (HD) results from a CAG repeat expansion in the gene for Huntington (HTT) resulting in expansion of the polyglutamine (Q) tract in the mutant protein (mHTT). Synaptic changes are early manifestations of neuronal dysfunction in HD. However, the mechanism(s) by which mHTT impacts synapse formation and function is not well defined. Herein we explored HD pathogenesis in the BACHD and the deltaN17-BACHD mouse models of HD by examining cortical synapse formation and function in primary cultures maintained for up to 35 days (DIV35). We identified synapses by immunostaining with antibodies against pre-synaptic (Synapsin 1) and a post-synaptic (PSD95) marker. Consistent with earlier studies, cortical neurons from both WT and the HD models began to form synapses at DIV14; at this age there were no genotypic differences in synapse numbers. However, from DIV21 through DIV35 BACHD neurons showed progressively smaller numbers of synapses relative to WT neurons. Remarkably, BACHD synaptic deficits were completely rescued by treating cultures with BDNF. Building on earlier studies using reagents inspired by the chaperonin TRiC, we found that addition of the recombinant apical domain of CCT1 partially rescued synapse number. Unexpectedly, unlike BACHD cultures, synapses in deltaN17-BACHD cultures showed a progressive increase in number as compared to WT neurons, thus distinguishing synaptic changes in these HD models. Using multielectrode arrays, we discovered age-related functional deficits in BACHD cortical cultures with significant differences present by DIV28. As for synapse number, BDNF treatment prevented most synaptic deficits, including mean firing rate, spikes per burst, inter-burst interval, and synchrony. The apical domain of CCT1 showed similar, albeit less potent effects. These data are evidence that deficits in HD synapse number and function can be replicated in vitro and that treatment with either BDNF or a TRiC-inspired reagent can prevent them. Our findings support the use of cellular models to further explicate HD pathogenesis and its treatments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Notch inhibition rescues TNF-α mediated block in multiciliated ependymal cell differentiation: Implications for hydrocephalus therapy</a></h4>

              
                Hydrocephalus is a prevalent condition among newborns leading to substantial neurocognitive and motor impairment. Novel therapies are needed to supplant invasive surgeries but identifying targetable cells and pathways remains a hurdle to devising alternative pharmacological options. Multiciliated ependymal cells (MECs) promote cerebrospinal fluid flow within brain ventricles and their dysfunction is associated with various forms of hydrocephalus. Here we show that an acute exposure to TNF- strongly impairs the conversion of ependymal cell radial glial progenitors (ecRGPs) into MECs. Inhibition of MEC differentiation was correlated with elevated expression levels of notch pathway effectors normally downregulated prior to the transition of ecRGPs into MECs. TNF- inhibited Multicilin gene upregulation along with downstream genes critical for centriole amplification and multicilia formation resulting in cells with greatly diminished basal bodies and multicilia. Treatment with notch inhibitor, DBZ, either in parallel with TNF- or sequentially days later rescued MEC differentiation and expression of genes required for multicilia formation. These results provide a rationale for how TNF- can impair MEC development, and they offer a targetable pathway to the treatment of some forms of hydrocephalus.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Anti-NMDAR encephalitis antibodies cause long-lasting degradation of the hippocampal neural representation of memory</a></h4>

              
                N-methyl D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is an immune-mediated disorder characterized by a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome together with a reduction of NMDAR. Although in most patients the life-threatening symptoms of the acute stage resolve with immunotherapy, memory and executive functions remain altered for several months or years. A mechanistic explanation for these long-lasting cognitive effects is still lacking and previous animal models have not explored this effect. Here, we combined repeat calcium imaging of the same population of hundreds of hippocampal CA1 neurons for three months along with two behavioral tasks to assess retrograde and anterograde memory loss using a reported mouse model of cerebroventricular transfer of patients' CSF antibodies. We measured how memory-related neuronal activity is affected by the presence of NMDAR antibodies during the induction of the model and its long-lasting recovery. In addition, we developed a computational model that provides a mechanistic explanation for the long-term antibody-mediated impairment of memory. The findings show that the presence of antibodies leads to an increase of CA1 neuronal firing rate, resulting in a reduction of the amount of information encoded by these cells. Furthermore, the antibodies cause a degradation of the hippocampal neuronal response stability over time, providing a neural correlate of memory dysfunction. All these neuronal alterations span the 3 months of recordings, and in some cases beyond the last recording point. The computational model shows that a reduction of NMDAR is sufficient to cause the changes observed in neuronal activity, including the different involvement of excitatory and inhibitory inputs to CA1 neurons. Altogether, we show that the antibody-mediated reduction of NMDAR leads to long-term changes in hippocampal neuronal activity which extend far beyond the antibody clearance, providing a mechanism that can account for the cognitive deficits observed in the protracted recovery of patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transcriptional diversity in synaptic gene sets is sufficient to discriminate cortical neuronal identity</a></h4>

              
                Synapse diversity has been described from different perspectives, ranging from the specific neurotransmitters released, to their diverse biophysical properties and proteome profiles. However, synapse diversity at the transcriptional level has not been systematically identified across all synapse populations in the brain. To quantify postsynaptic and identify specific synaptic features of neuronal cell types we combined the SynGO (Synaptic Gene Ontology) database with single-cell RNA sequencing data of the mouse neocortex. We show that cell types can be discriminated by synaptic genes alone with the same power as all genes. The cell type discriminatory power is not equally distributed across synaptic genes as we could identify functional categories and synaptic compartments with greater cell type specific expression. Synaptic genes, and specific SynGO categories, belonged to three different types of gene modules: gradient expression over all cell types, gradient expression in selected cell types and cell class- or type-specific profiles. This data provides a deeper understanding of synapse diversity in the neocortex and identifies potential markers to selectively identify synapses from specific neuronal populations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brief temporal perturbations in somatosensory reafference disrupt perceptual and neural attenuation and increase supplementary motor-cerebellar connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Intrinsic delays in sensory feedback can be detrimental for motor control. As a compensation strategy, the brain predicts the sensory consequences of movement via a forward model on the basis of a copy of the motor command. Using these predictions, the brain attenuates the somatosensory reafference to facilitate the processing of exafferent information. Theoretically, this predictive attenuation gets disrupted by (even minimal) temporal errors between the predicted and the actual reafference, but direct evidence for such disruption is lacking since previous neuroimaging studies contrasted conditions of nondelayed reafferent input with exafferent one. Here, we combined psychophysics with functional magnetic resonance imaging to test whether subtle perturbations in the timing of somatosensory reafference disrupt its predictive processing. Twenty-eight participants generated touches on their left index finger by tapping a sensor with their right index finger. The touches on the left index finger were delivered at the time of the two fingers contact or with a 100 ms delay. We found that such brief temporal perturbations disrupted the attenuation of the somatosensory reafference both at the perceptual and neural level, leading to greater somatosensory and cerebellar responses and weaker somatosensory connectivity with the cerebellum proportionally to perceptual changes. Moreover, we observed increased connectivity of the supplementary motor area with the cerebellum during the perturbations. We interpret these effects as the failure of the forward model to predictively attenuate the delayed somatosensory reafference and the return of the prediction error to the motor centers, respectively.

	<p>Rationale: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of several sites, such as the thalamus, has been shown to reduce seizure frequency and interictal epileptiform activity in patients with refractory epilepsy. Recent findings have demonstrated that the insula is part of the &amp;amp;lsquo;rich club&amp;amp;rsquo; of highly connected brain regions. This pilot study investigated short-term effects of high-frequency (HF) insular DBS on interictal epileptiform discharge (IED) rate in patients with refractory epilepsy. Methods: Six patients with drug-resistant epilepsy undergoing an intracranial electroencephalographic study received two sets of 10 min continuous 150 Hz HF-DBS of the insula. For each patient, epileptiform activity was analyzed for a total of 80 min, starting 20 min prior to stimulation set 1 (S1), and ending 20 min after stimulation set 2 (S2). All IEDs were identified and classified according to their anatomic localization by a board-certified epileptologist. The IED rate during the 20 min preceding S1 served as a baseline for comparison with IED rate during S1, S2 and post-stimulation periods. Results: HF-DBS of the anterior insula (aINS) was performed in a patient with an aINS epileptic focus (patient 1). HF-DBS of the posterior insula (pINS) was performed in two patients with a pINS epileptic focus (patients 2 and 4), in one patient with an aINS focus (patient 3), and in two non-insular patients (patients 5 and 6). The total IED (irrespective of their location) rate significantly decreased (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) in two patients (patients 1 and 2) during the stimulation period, whereas it significantly increased (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) in one patient (patient 6); there was no change in the other three patients. Looking at subsets of spike localization, HF-DBS of the aINS significantly reduced aINS and orbitofrontal IEDs in patient 1 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01), while HF-DBS of the pINS had an effect on pINS IEDs (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) in both patients with a pINS focus; there was no significant effect of HF-DBS of the insula on IEDs in temporal or other frontal regions. Conclusion: Short-term HF-DBS of the insula had heterogeneous effects on the IED rate. Further work is required to examine factors underlying these heterogeneous effects, such as stimulation frequency, location of IEDs and subregions of the insula stimulated.</p>

	<p>Hyperacusis (decreased sound tolerance) is a prevalent complaint. Yet, to date, no research has qualitatively evaluated the types of problems experienced by adults with hyperacusis. Our service evaluation aims to determine the hyperacusis-related problem domains reported by patients and the degree to which these domains were reported together. Retrospective analysis was conducted on an anonymised clinical dataset from 306 patients who attended a UK tinnitus and hyperacusis treatment centre between 1994 and 2017. Conventional content analysis was used to categorise responses to the question &amp;amp;lsquo;Why is hyperacusis a problem?&amp;amp;rsquo; into domains which were then subjected to a cluster analysis. Twenty-five problem domains were identified, of which 12 were further classified into three overarching categories. &amp;amp;lsquo;Fear&amp;amp;rsquo;, &amp;amp;lsquo;Reduced quality of life&amp;amp;rsquo; and &amp;amp;lsquo;Physical reaction to sound&amp;amp;rsquo; were most frequently reported problems. Cluster analysis revealed that &amp;amp;lsquo;Sleep difficulties&amp;amp;rsquo; and &amp;amp;lsquo;Despondency&amp;amp;rsquo;, were commonly reported together. Adults with hyperacusis face many challenges in their everyday lives. The nature of these problems indicates the need to develop complex interventions and assessments to aid management of hyperacusis. Current hyperacusis questionnaires may be useful in identifying some problem domains, but further assessment thorough patient interviews is required to fully explore all potential problems and make informed decisions about treatment.</p>

	<p>Background: Nowadays, controversy exists regarding the stage of cognitive decline and/or dementia where voting capacity is diminished. Aim: To evaluate whether general cognitive status in advancing age predicts voting capacity in its specific aspects. Methods: The study sample comprised 391 people: 88 cognitively healthy older adults (CH), 150 people with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and 153 people with Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease dementia (ADD). The assessment included CAT-V for the voting capacity and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) for general cognitive ability. ANOVAs and ROC curves were the tools of statistical analysis towards (a) indicating under which MMSE rate participants are incapable of voting and (b) whether the CAT-V total score can discriminate people with dementia (PwADD) from people without dementia (PwtD). Results: Out of the six CAT-V questions, one question was associated with a low MMSE cutoff score (19.50), having excellent sensitivity (92.5%) and specificity (77.20%), whilst the other five questions presented a higher MMSE cutoff score, with a good sensitivity (78.4% to 87.6%) and specificity (75.3% to 81.7%), indicating that voting difficulties are associated with cognitive status. Secondarily, the total CAT-V score discriminates PwADD from PwtD of 51&amp;amp;ndash;65 years (sensitivity 93.2%/specificity 100%&amp;amp;mdash;excellent), PwADD from PwtD of 66&amp;amp;ndash;75 years (sensitivity 73.3%/specificity 97.1%&amp;amp;mdash;good), PwADD from PwtD of 76&amp;amp;ndash;85 years (sensitivity 92.2%/specificity 64.7%&amp;amp;mdash;good), whilst for 86&amp;amp;ndash;95 years, a cutoff of 9.5 resulted in perfect sensitivity and specificity (100%). Conclusion: According to MMSE, PwADD have no full voting competence, whilst PwtD seem to have intact voting capacity. The calculated cut-off scores indicate that only people who score more than 28 points on the MMSE have voting capacity.</p>

	<p>Purpose: Retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells are highly specialized neural cells with several functions essential for vision. Progressive deterioration of RPE cells in elderly individuals can result in visual impairment and, ultimately, blinding disease. While human embryonic stem cell-derived RPE cell (hESC-RPE) growth conditions are generally harsher than those of cell lines, the subretinal transplantation of hESC-RPE is being clinically explored as a strategy to recover the damaged retina and improve vision. The cell-adhesion ability of the support is required for RPE transplantation, where pre-polarized cells can maintain specific functions on the scaffold. This work examined four typical biodegradable hydrogels as supports for hESC-RPE growth. Methods: Four biodegradable hydrogels were examined: gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA), hyaluronic acid methacryloyl (HAMA), alginate, and fibrin hydrogels. ARPE-19 and hESC-RPE cells were seeded onto the hydrogels separately, and the ability of these supports to facilitate adherence, proliferation, and homogeneous distribution of differentiated hESC-RPE cells was investigated. Furthermore, the hydrogel&amp;amp;rsquo;s subretinal bio-compatibility was assessed in vivo. Results: We showed that ARPE-19 and hESC-RPE cells adhered and proliferated only on the fibrin support. The monolayer formed when cells reached confluency, demonstrating the polygonal semblance, and revealing actin filaments that moved along the cytoplasm. The expression of tight junction proteins at cell interfaces on the 14th day of seeding demonstrated the barrier function of epithelial cells on polymeric surfaces and the interaction between cells. Moreover, the expression of proteins crucial for retinal functions and matrix production was positively affected by fibrin, with an increment of PEDF. Our in vivo investigation with fibrin hydrogels revealed high short-term subretinal biocompatibility. Conclusions: The research of stem cell-based cell therapy for retinal degenerative diseases is more complicated than that of cell lines. Our results showed that fibrin is a suitable scaffold for hESC-RPE transplantation, which could be a new grafting material for tissue engineering RPE cells.</p>

	<p>Purpose: This study aimed to detect differences in post-exercise brain activity between the left and right paddlers due to exercise by analyzing the resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) power spectrum before and after exercise. Methods: Twenty-one right paddlers and twenty-two left paddlers completed a 1 km all-out test on a dragon boat ergometer, and their heart rate and exercise time were recorded. EEG signals were collected from superficial brain layers before and after exercise; then, the EEG power spectrum was extracted and compared in different frequency bands. In addition, the degree of lateralization in each brain region was assessed by the asymmetry index. Results: There was no significant difference in the power spectrum values and asymmetry indices between the left and right paddlers before rowing (p &amp;amp;#707; 0.05). However, after rowing, the left-paddlers group had significantly higher spectral power values in &amp;amp;theta; and &amp;amp;alpha; bands than the right-paddlers group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), and brain lateralization in both groups of athletes occurred mainly in the ipsilateral hemisphere of the frontal and central regions. Conclusion: The 1 km of rowing induced more brain activation in the left paddlers, and both left and right paddlers showed functional aggregation of hemispheric lateralization.</p>

	<p>The training of mental health professionals is an important component of suicide-prevention programs. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in different Italian regions to evaluate knowledge of, and attitudes toward, suicide as well as the experience of a patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s suicide or a suicide attempt in early career psychiatrists (ECPs) and trainees (N = 338). The Suicide Knowledge and Skills Questionnaire and the Impact of a Patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s Suicide on Professional and Personal Lives scale were administered. Furthermore, symptoms of intrusion, avoidance, and arousal were examined through the Impact of Event Scale in ECPs and trainees who had experienced the suicide of a patient or a suicide attempt. Participants with training were more confident in the clinical management of suicide-risk patients. The group with experience of a patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s suicide reported more suicide skills except for support and supervision. Finally, the participants who reported a patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s suicide presented a more conservative patient selection, difficulties in relationships, loss of self-esteem, dreams linked to suicide, intrusive thoughts of suicide, guilt, and anger. Our results show that knowledge of, and attitudes toward, suicide are essential in the management of suicide-risk patients.</p>

	<p>Adults commonly struggle with perceiving and recognizing the sounds and words of a second language (L2), especially when the L2 sounds do not have a counterpart in the learner&amp;amp;rsquo;s first language (L1). We examined how L1 Mandarin L2 English speakers learned pseudo English words within a cross-situational word learning (CSWL) task previously presented to monolingual English and bilingual Mandarin-English speakers. CSWL is ambiguous because participants are not provided with direct mappings of words and object referents. Rather, learners discern word-object correspondences through tracking multiple co-occurrences across learning trials. The monolinguals and bilinguals tested in previous studies showed lower performance for pseudo words that formed vowel minimal pairs (e.g., /dit/-/d&amp;amp;#618;t/) than pseudo word which formed consonant minimal pairs (e.g., /b&amp;amp;#596;n/-/p&amp;amp;#596;n/) or non-minimal pairs which differed in all segments (e.g., /b&amp;amp;#596;n/-/dit/). In contrast, L1 Mandarin L2 English listeners struggled to learn all word pairs. We explain this seemingly contradicting finding by considering the multiplicity of acoustic cues in the stimuli presented to all participant groups. Stimuli were produced in infant-directed-speech (IDS) in order to compare performance by children and adults and because previous research had shown that IDS enhances L1 and L2 acquisition. We propose that the suprasegmental pitch variation in the vowels typical of IDS stimuli might be perceived as lexical tone distinctions for tonal language speakers who cannot fully inhibit their L1 activation, resulting in high lexical competition and diminished learning during an ambiguous word learning task. Our results are in line with the Second Language Linguistic Perception (L2LP) model which proposes that fine-grained acoustic information from multiple sources and the ability to switch between language modes affects non-native phonetic and lexical development.</p>

	<p>Previous intermodulation (IM) studies have employed two (or more) temporal modulations of a stimulus, with different local elements of the stimulus being modulated by different frequencies. Brain activities of IM obtained mainly from electroencephalograms (EEG) have been analyzed in the frequency domain. As a powerful tool, IM, which can provide a direct and objective physiological measure of neural interaction, has emerged as a promising method to decipher neural interactions in visual perception, and reveal the underlying different perceptual processing levels. In this review, we summarize the recent applications of IM in visual perception, detail the protocols and types of IM, and extend its utility and potential applications to the multisensory domain. We propose that using IM could prevail in partially revealing the potential hierarchical processing of multisensory information and contribute to a deeper understanding of the underlying brain dynamics.</p>

                TBK1 is a serine-threonine protein kinase that has been linked to a number of diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. Reproducible research on TBK1 has been hampered by the lack of well characterized antibodies. In this study, we characterized 11 commercial antibodies for TBK1 for use in immunoblot, immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation, using an isogeneic knock-out cell line as a control. We identify antibodies that appear specific for all three applications but invite the readers to interpret the present findings based on their own scientific expertise and use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibody for their specific needs.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Factors influencing COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and hesitancy among pharmacy students in Bangladesh: a cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In the wake of COVID-19 prevention, a growing attention has been devoted to administering vaccines among various sub-group populations including community health care providers. As a community health worker pharmacists and pharmacy students played a crucial role in patient-centered services for managing COVID-19. Examining pharmacy students’ vaccine acceptance intent has great potential in understanding how pharmacists’ perception impacts community people. This study investigated COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among pharmacy students in Bangladesh and identified the potential factors associated with their vaccine acceptance and hesitancy. Methods: An anonymous questionnaire was deployed online using Google forms in English and conveniently sent to 1190 pharmacy students at different universities between 15th October 2021 and 15th December 2021. The convenience sampling consisted of 1034 student pharmacists (response rate 86.9%) who participated in this study. Binary logistic regressions and Chi-squared test were used for rationalizing the study objectives. Results: The pooled COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rate was 908 (87.8%; 95% CI 85.8─87.8) among student pharmacists while 29.6% (95% CI 25.4─33.9) admitted the willingness to pay (WTP) for a COVID-19 vaccine. Out of 12 vital predictive factors, “safety,” “efficacy,” and “trust” had the strongest significant and positive association with vaccine acceptance (p=0.000). The logistic analysis also revealed that “communication” and “information sufficiency” had a significant positive association with vaccine acceptance (p=0.035 and 0.038, respectively) among student pharmacists. Although the odds of accepting the COVID-19 vaccine were found to be 1.1; an insignificant association between gender and vaccine acceptance was observed in the Chi-squared test. Conclusions: The prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine apprehension will reduce if vaccine-related information becomes more publicly available. Ensuring easy access to scientific information with evidence-based and tailored communication would enhance vaccine acceptance among pharmacy students. Implementation of multidisciplinary educational intervention would support the health care students to achieve adequate knowledge on vaccination consequences.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Safety, quality, and nutritional aspect of smoked barracuda fish [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Barracuda fish has a superior nutritional content, so it can be utilized as raw material for smoked fish products. The smoking method most commonly applied in Indonesia is traditional smoking. The traditional smoking process implemented commercially in Indonesia still uses simple equipment and sanitation is typically not monitored. Traditional smoking used at high temperatures can cause contamination of the products, such as with chemicals and microbes. Liquid smoke can be used to overcome these disadvantages. The study aimed to evaluate the nutritional, chemical, and microbial content of fresh and smoked barracuda processed using different smoking methods, namely traditional and liquid smoke. Methods: Barracuda fish were smoked using different smoking methods, traditional and liquid smoke. The traditional method used a simple smoking furnace, while the liquid smoke method was carried out by immersing the fish in a 5% liquid smoke solution. Then, the smoked barracuda were analyzed with various methods, such as proximate, heavy metals, histamine, benzo[a]pyrene, and total microbes (TPC). Data was analyzed using ANOVA at significance level (p < 0.05) followed by Duncan’s test models using SPSS v.16. Results: Smoked fish treated with liquid smoke had a lower value of Arsenic heavy metal (As), at 0.73 mg/kg compared to the traditional method at 1.93 mg/kg; no histamine and carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) compounds were detected, namely benzo[a]pyrene; and liquid smoked fish can inhibit the growth of bacteria which can be seen from total bacteria value of 4.6 x 10 colonies/g Conclusions: Smoked fish processed using a liquid smoke was safer for consumption by the consumer.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: An unusual case of small bowel volvulus due to appendicitis associated with pneumatosis intestinalis: Review of the literature [version 2; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Pneumatosis cystoid intestinalis is a rare disease reported in the literature affecting 0.03% of the population. It has a variety of causes and its manifestation may change widely. It usually presents as a marginal finding resulting from various gastrointestinal pathologies. In the acute complicated form of pneumatosis intestinalis, management is challenging for physicians and surgeons. We present a case of a 60-year-old patient who was admitted to our surgical department with a symptomatology suggestive of small bowel occlusion. Computed tomography demonstrated ileal volvulus associated with parietal signs suffering and pneumoperitoneum. An emergent exploratory laparoscopy followed by conversion was performed demonstrating segmental ileal pneumatosis intestinalis secondary to a small bowel volvulus due to an inflammatory appendix wrapping around the distal ileum. Further, detorsion, retrograde draining, and appendectomy were performed because there were no signs of necrosis and the appendix was pathological. The postoperative course was uneventful. This case is exceedingly rare in the literature, because it was featured by the ileal volvulus due to appendicitis.This case report emphasizes the importance of surgical procedures in the management of symptomatic pneumatosis intestinalis associated to an acute abdomen.

The benefits and computational constraints have made IoT systems attractive to cyber-attacks. One way to mitigate these attacks is to detect them. In this study, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) has been conducted to analyze the role of incremental machine learning in achieving lightweight intrusion detection for IoT systems. The study analyzed existing incremental machine learning approaches used in designing intrusion detection systems for IoT ecosystems, emphasizing the incremental methods used in detecting intrusions, the datasets used to evaluate these methods, and how the method achieves lightweight status. The SLR outlined the contributions of each study, focusing on their strengths and gaps, the datasets used, and the incremental machine learning model used. This study revealed that incremental learning approaches in detecting intrusion in IoT systems are in their infant stage. Over 12 years, from 2010 to 2022, a total of twenty-one (21) studies were carried out in IDSs using incremental machine learning, with eight (8) studies carried out in IoT systems. In addition to reviewing the literature, we offer suggestions for improving existing solutions and achieving lightweight IDS for IoT systems. We also discussed some problems with making lightweight IDS for IoT systems and areas where more research could be done in the future.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Integration of the CA2 region in the hippocampal network during epileptogenesis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The CA2 pyramidal cells are mostly resistant to cell death in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) with hippocampal sclerosis, but they are aberrantly integrated into the epileptic hippocampal network via mossy fiber sprouting. Furthermore, they show increased excitability in vitro in hippocampal slices obtained from human MTLE specimens or animal epilepsy models. Although these changes promote CA2 to contribute to epileptic activity (EA) in vivo, the role of CA2 in the epileptic network within and beyond the sclerotic hippocampus is still unclear. We used the intrahippocampal kainate mouse model for MTLE, which recapitulates most features of the human disease including pharmacoresistant epileptic seizures and hippocampal sclerosis, with preservation of dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells and CA2 pyramidal cells. In vivo recordings with electrodes in CA2 and the DG showed that EA occurs at high coincidence between the ipsilateral DG and CA2 and current source density analysis of silicon probe recordings in dorsal ipsilateral CA2 revealed CA2 as a local source of EA. Cell-specific viral tracing in Amigo2-icreERT2 mice confirmed the preservation of the axonal projection from ipsilateral CA2 pyramidal cells to contralateral CA2 under epileptic conditions and indeed, EA propagated from ipsi- to contralateral CA2 with increasing likelihood with time after KA injection, but always at lower intensity than within the ipsilateral hippocampus. Furthermore, we show that CA2 presents with local theta oscillations and like the DG, shows a pathological reduction of theta frequency already from 2 days after KA onward. The early changes in activity might be facilitated by the loss of glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (<i>Gad67</i>) mRNA-expressing interneurons directly after the initial <i>status epilepticus</i> in ipsi- but not contralateral CA2. Together, our data highlight CA2 as an active player in the epileptic network and with its contralateral connections as one possible router of aberrant activity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Staining ability of herbal tea preparations on a nano-filled composite restorative material – an in-vitro study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Discoloration of tooth-colored restorations due to various factors is one of the principal causes behind the failure of aesthetics. There has been an surge in the consumption of herbal beverages in recent times and the dietary factors play a potential role in the discoloration tooth-coloured restorations. This study was done to juxtapose the staining ability of green tea (GT), moringa tea (MT), and hibiscus tea (HT) on a nano-filled composite restorative material. Methods: The study was conducted in-vitro on composite samples prepared using moulds. 112 discs were prepared from FiltekTM Z350XT composite using a brass mould lined with mylar strips. Samples were divided into GT, MT, HT, and artificial saliva (AS) groups and immersed in freshly prepared beverages for 15 minutes each day for 45 days. Digital reflectance spectrophotometer was utilized to record color at baseline, 30, and 45 days. Repeated-measures ANOVA with a post-hoc Bonferroni test was used to compare groups within each group. ANOVA with a post-hoc Games Howell test was used to compare mean differences in ΔE among the groups. Results: Maximum discoloration was observed in the GT, followed by HT and MT, with the least being in the AS group at the end of 30 and 45 days (P<0.001 and P<0.001) respectively. Conclusions: The universal nano-filled composite material showed clinically detectable discoloration when exposed to Green Tea, Hibiscus Tea, and Moringa Tea which increased with time. Herbal beverages have the potential to cause discoloration of the composite resin which is often the choice of material for anterior aesthetic restorations.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effect of planting density on root biomass and distribution, and soil organic carbon stock of Acacia decurrens stands in Northwestern Ethiopia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The expanding Acacia decurrens woodlots in Northwestern Ethiopia is recognized for carbon storage via root biomass and soil organic carbon (SOC) enhancement but its planting densities have varied considerably. This study evaluated the effect of planting density on the root biomass, SOC stock, and vertical distributions in the stands. Methods: Five planting densities (0.5 m x 0.5 m, 0.75 m x 0.75 m, 1 m x 1 m, 1.25 m x 1.25 m, and 1.5 m x 1.5 m) were replicated four times with randomized complete block design. Soil core (6.67 cm diameter) and pit (900 cm2 area) methods were used to collect fine and coarse root samples within 0–50 cm soil depth (having five soil layers in 10 cm intervals), respectively. Fine root biomass samples were classified as live and dead (necromass) and further as tree and herbaceous root. All root biomass samples were washed, oven-dried, weighed, and standardized into gram per meter square (g m-2) for root biomass comparisons for each planting density and soil depth, then summed up for 0–50 cm depth as a total root biomass. The vertical distributions of fine and coarse root biomass at each depth were expressed as a percentage (in decimal) of the total root biomass (0–50 cm). Conclusions: Planting density had significant effects on root biomass, SOC stock, and root distributions (P < 0.05) but inconsistent for the percentage of SOC stock at all soil layers except at 40-50 cm. Planting A. decurrens with high density is recommended to increase root biomass, SOC, and percentage of roots in deep soil layers. Further study is suggested for the effects of stand age on root biomass dynamics and SOC stock with large scale.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Mimics of Pediatric Small Vessel Primary Angiitis of the Central Nervous System</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Small vessel primary angiitis of the central nervous system is a rare and often severe disease characterized by central nervous system-restricted inflammatory vasculitis on histopathology. Diagnosis requires brain biopsy for confirmation and is suggested prior to starting immunotherapy when feasible. However, emerging evidence suggests that other neuroinflammatory conditions may have a clinical and radiographic phenotype that mimics small vessel primary angiitis, at times with overlapping pathologic features as well. Such diagnoses, including myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease and central nervous system-restricted hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, can be non-invasively diagnosed with serum antibody or genetic testing that would prompt different monitoring and treatment paradigms. To determine the ultimate diagnosis of patients who were suspected prior to biopsy to have small vessel primary angiitis, we reviewed the clinical, radiographic, and pathological features of a cohort of patients at a single center undergoing brain biopsy for non-oncologic indications.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Clinical data were retrospectively extracted from the medical record. Pathology and neuroimaging review was conducted.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 21 patients over a 19-year time-period, of whom 14 (66.7%) were ultimately diagnosed with entities other than small vessel primary angiitis that would have obviated the need for brain biopsy. Diagnoses included anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody associated disease (n = 9), central nervous system-restricted hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (n = 3), anti-GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor encephalitis (n = 1), and Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (n = 1).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study highlights the importance of pursuing now readily available non-invasive testing for mimicking diagnoses before performing a brain biopsy for suspected small vessel primary angiitis of the central nervous system. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Effect of Mobile Stroke Unit Dispatch in all Patients with Acute Stroke or TIA</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine the effect of additional mobile stroke unit (MSU) dispatch on functional outcomes among the full spectrum of stroke patients, regardless of subtype or potential contraindications to reperfusion therapies.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used data from the nonrandomized Berlin-based B_PROUD study (02/2017 to 05/2019), in which MSUs were dispatched based solely on availability, and the linked B-SPATIAL stroke registry. All patients with final stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) diagnoses were eligible. The intervention under study was the additional dispatch of an MSU, an emergency physician-staffed ambulance equipped to provide prehospital imaging and thrombolytic treatment, compared to conventional ambulance alone. The primary outcome was the 3-month modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score, and the co-primary outcome was a 3-tiered disability scale. We identified confounders using directed acyclic graphs and obtained adjusted effect estimates using inverse probability of treatment weighting.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>MSUs were dispatched to 1,125 patients (mean age: 74 years, 46.5% female), while for 1,141 patients only conventional ambulances were dispatched (75 years, 49.9% female). After confounding adjustment, MSU dispatch was associated with more favorable 3-month mRS scores (common odds ratio [cOR] = 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.71–0.94). No statistically significant association was found with the co-primary outcome (cOR = 0.86; 9% CI: 0.72–1.01) or 7-day mortality (OR = 0.94; 95% CI: 0.59–1.48).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>When considering the entire population of stroke/TIA patients, MSU dispatch improved 3-month functional outcomes without evidence of compromised safety. Our results are relevant for decision-makers since stroke subtype and treatment eligibility are unknown at time of dispatch. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                At preterm birth, the retina is incompletely vascularized. Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is initiated by the postnatal suppression of physiological retinal vascular development that would normally occur in utero. As the neural retina slowly matures, increasing metabolic demand including in the peripheral avascular retina, leads to signals for compensatory but pathological neovascularization. Currently, only late neovascular ROP is treated. ROP could be prevented by promoting normal vascular growth. Early perinatal metabolic dysregulation is a strong but understudied risk factor for ROP and other long-term sequelae of preterm birth. We will discuss the metabolic and oxygen needs of retina, current treatments, and potential interventions to promote normal vessel growth including control of postnatal hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia and hyperoxia-induced retinal metabolic alterations. Early supplementation of missing nutrients and growth factors and control of supplemental oxygen promotes physiological retinal development. We will discuss the current knowledge gap in retinal metabolism after preterm birth.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Comparative genomics reveals insight into the evolutionary origin of massively scrambled genomes</a></h4>

              
                Ciliates are microbial eukaryotes that undergo extensive programmed genome rearrangement, a natural genome editing process that converts long germline chromosomes into smaller gene-rich somatic chromosomes. Three well-studied ciliates include <i>Oxytricha trifallax</i>, <i>Tetrahymena thermophila</i> and <i>Paramecium tetraurelia</i>, but only the <i>Oxytricha</i> lineage has a massively scrambled genome, whose assembly during development requires hundreds of thousands of precise programmed DNA joining events, representing the most complex genome dynamics of any known organism. Here we study the emergence of such complex genomes by examining the origin and evolution of discontinuous and scrambled genes in the <i>Oxytricha</i> lineage. This study compares six genomes from three species, the germline and somatic genomes for <i>Euplotes woodruffi</i>, <i>Tetmemena sp.</i>, and the model ciliate <i>Oxytricha trifallax</i>. To complement existing data, we sequenced, assembled and annotated the germline and somatic genomes of <i>Euplotes woodruffi</i>, which provides an outgroup, and the germline genome of <i>Tetmemena sp..</i> We find that the germline genome of <i>Tetmemena</i> is as massively scrambled and interrupted as <i>Oxytricha's</i> : 13.6% of its gene loci require programmed translocations and/or inversions, with some genes requiring hundreds of precise gene editing events during development. This study revealed that the earlier-diverged spirotrich, <i>E. woodruffi</i>, also has a scrambled genome, but only roughly half as many loci (7.3%) are scrambled. Furthermore, its scrambled genes are less complex, together supporting the position of <i>Euplotes</i> as a possible evolutionary intermediate in this lineage, in the process of accumulating complex evolutionary genome rearrangements, all of which require extensive repair to assemble functional coding regions. Comparative analysis also reveals that scrambled loci are often associated with local duplications, supporting a gradual model for the origin of complex, scrambled genomes via many small events of DNA duplication and decay.

                The auto-inhibited, super-relaxed (SRX) state of cardiac myosin is thought to be crucial for regulating contraction, relaxation, and energy conservation in the heart. We used single ATP turnover experiments to demonstrate that a dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) mutation (E525K) in human beta-cardiac myosin increases the fraction of myosin heads in the SRX state (with slow ATP turnover), especially in physiological ionic strength conditions. We also utilized FRET between a C-terminal GFP tag on the myosin tail and Cy3ATP bound to the active site of the motor domain to estimate the fraction of heads in the closed, interacting-heads motif (IHM); we found a strong correlation between the IHM and SRX state. Negative stain electron microscopy and 2D class averaging of the construct demonstrated that the E525K mutation increased the fraction of molecules adopting the IHM. Overall, our results demonstrate that the E525K DCM mutation may reduce muscle force and power by stabilizing the auto-inhibited SRX state. Our studies also provide direct evidence for a correlation between the SRX biochemical state and the IHM structural state in cardiac muscle myosin. Furthermore, the E525 residue may be implicated in crucial electrostatic interactions that modulate this conserved, auto-inhibited conformation of myosin.

                <i>N6-</i>methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modification impacts mRNA fate primarily via reader proteins, which dictate processes in development, stress, and disease. Yet little is known about m6A function in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, which occurs solely during early meiosis. Here we perform a multifaceted analysis of the m6A reader protein Pho92/Mrb1. Cross-linking immunoprecipitation analysis reveals that Pho92 associates with the 3’end of meiotic mRNAs in both an m6A-dependent and independent manner. Within cells, Pho92 transitions from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and associates with translating ribosomes. In the nucleus Pho92 associates with target loci through its interaction with transcriptional elongator Paf1C. Functionally, we show that Pho92 promotes and links protein synthesis to mRNA decay. As such, the Pho92-mediated m6A-mRNA decay is contingent on active translation and the CCR4-NOT complex. We propose that the m6A reader Pho92 is loaded co-transcriptionally to facilitate protein synthesis and subsequent decay of m6A modified transcripts, and thereby promotes meiosis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">EROS is a selective chaperone regulating the phagocyte NADPH oxidase and purinergic signalling</a></h4>

              
                EROS (Essential for Reactive Oxygen Species) protein is indispensable for expression of gp91<i>phox</i>, the catalytic core of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase. EROS deficiency in humans is a novel cause of the severe immunodeficiency, chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), but its mechanism of action was unknown until now. We elucidate the role of EROS, showing it acts at the earliest stages of gp91<i>phox</i> maturation. It binds the immature 58kDa gp91<i>phox</i> directly, preventing gp91<i>phox</i> degradation and allowing glycosylation via the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) machinery and the incorporation of the heme prosthetic groups essential for catalysis. EROS also regulates the purine receptors P2X7 and P2X1 through direct interactions and P2X7 is almost absent in EROS deficient mouse and human primary cells. Accordingly, lack of murine EROS results in markedly abnormal P2X7 signalling, inflammasome activation and T cell responses. The loss of both ROS and P2X7 signalling leads to resistance to influenza infection in mice. Our work identifies EROS as a highly selective chaperone for key proteins in innate and adaptive immunity and a rheostat for immunity to infection. It has profound implications for our understanding of immune physiology, ROS dysregulation and possibly gene therapy.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Nucleotide-level linkage of transcriptional elongation and polyadenylation</a></h4>

              
                Alternative polyadenylation yields many mRNA isoforms whose 3' termini occur disproportionately in clusters within 3' UTRs. Previously, we showed that profiles of poly(A) site usage are regulated by the rate of transcriptional elongation by RNA polymerase (Pol) II (Geisberg et., 2020). Pol II derivatives with slow elongation rates confer an upstream-shifted poly(A) profile, whereas fast Pol II strains confer a downstream-shifted poly(A) profile. Within yeast isoform clusters, these shifts occur steadily from one isoform to the next across nucleotide distances. In contrast, the shift between clusters from the last isoform of one cluster to the first isoform of the next - is much less pronounced, even over large distances. GC content in a region 13-30 nt downstream from isoform clusters correlates with their sensitivity to Pol II elongation rate. In human cells, the upstream shift caused by a slow Pol II mutant also occurs continuously at the nucleotide level within clusters, but not between them. Pol II occupancy increases just downstream of the most speed-sensitive poly(A) sites, suggesting a linkage between reduced elongation rate and cluster formation. These observations suggest that 1) Pol II elongation speed affects the nucleotide-level dwell time allowing polyadenylation to occur, 2) poly(A) site clusters are linked to the local elongation rate and hence do not arise simply by intrinsically imprecise cleavage and polyadenylation of the RNA substrate, 3) DNA sequence elements can affect Pol II elongation and poly(A) profiles, and 4) the cleavage/polyadenylation and Pol II elongation complexes are spatially, and perhaps physically, coupled so that polyadenylation occurs rapidly upon emergence of the nascent RNA from the Pol II elongation complex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">TDCS modulates working memory maintenance processes in healthy individuals</a></h4>

              
                BackgroundThe effects of tDCS at the prefrontal cortex are often investigated using cognitive paradigms, particularly working memory tasks. However, the neural basis for the neuromodulatory cognitive effects of tDCS, including which subprocesses are affected by stimulation, is not completely understood.

AimsWe investigated the effects of tDCS on working memory task-related spectral activity during and after tDCS to gain better insights into the neurophysiological changes associated with stimulation.

MethodsWe reanalysed data from 100 healthy participants grouped by allocation to receive either Sham (0 mA, 0.016 mA, and 0.034 mA) or Active (1 mA or 2 mA) stimulation during a 3-back task. Electroencephalography (EEG) data was used to analyse event-related spectral power in frequency bands associated with working memory performance.

ResultsFrontal theta event-related synchronisation (ERS) was significantly reduced post-tDCS in the active group. Participants receiving active tDCS had slower response times following tDCS compared to Sham, suggesting interference with practice effects associated with task repetition. Theta ERS was not significantly correlated with response times or accuracy.

ConclusionstDCS reduced frontal theta ERS post-stimulation, suggesting a selective disruption to working memory cognitive control and maintenance processes. These findings suggest that tDCS selectively affects specific subprocesses during working memory, which may explain heterogenous behavioural effects.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Model-free decision making resists improved instructions and is enhanced by stimulus-response associations</a></h4>

              
                Human behaviour is driven by two types of processes running in parallel: goal-directed and habitual, each supported by different computational-learning mechanisms, model-free and model-based respectively. In model-free strategies, stimulus-response associations are strengthened when actions are followed by a reward and weakened otherwise. In model-based learning, previous to selecting an action, the current values of the different possible actions are computed based on a detailed model of the environment. Previous research with the two-stage task suggests that participants behavior usually shows a mixture of both strategies. But, interestingly, a recent study by da Silva and Hare (2020) found that participants deploy a purely model-based behavior when they are given detailed instructions about the structure of the task. In the present study, we reproduce this essential experiment using a larger sample size (N=59). However, our results do not suggest a sole model-based behaviour, but rather a hybrid one. Furthermore, an additional experiment shows that slight changes in the task, like a consistent stimulus-response mapping, can encourage reliance on model-free strategies, even if participants are presented with improved instructions. This suggests that the model-free marker, as measured by the two-stage task, is related to S-R learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Gamma-Protocadherins regulate filopodia self-recognition and dynamics to drivedendrite self-avoidance</a></h4>

              
                Neurons form cell type-specific morphologies that are shaped by molecular cues and their cellular events governing dendrite growth. One growth rule is distributing dendrites uniformly within a neurons territory by avoiding sibling or  self branches. In mammalian neurons, dendrite self-avoidance is regulated by the clustered Protocadherins (cPcdhs), a large family of recognition molecules. Genetic and molecular studies suggest that the cPcdhs mediate homophilic recognition and repulsion between self-dendrites but this model has not been tested through direct investigation of self-avoidance during development. Here we performed live imaging and 4D quantifications of dendrite morphogenesis to define the cPcdh-dependent mechanisms of self-avoidance. We focused on the mouse retinal starburst amacrine cell (SAC), which requires the gamma-Pcdhs (Pcdhgs) and self/non-self recognition to establish a stereotypic radial morphology while permitting dendritic interactions with neighboring SACs. Through morphogenesis, SACs extend a transient population of dynamic filopodia that fill the growing arbor and contact nearby self-dendrites. Compared to non-self-contacting filopodia, self-contacting events have longer lifetimes and a subset persists as filopodia bridges. In the absence of the Pcdhgs, non-self-contacting filopodia dynamics are unaffected but self-contact-induced retractions are significantly diminished. Filopodia bridges accumulate, leading to the bundling of dendritic processes and disruption to the arbor shape. By tracking dendrite self-avoidance in real-time, our findings demonstrate that the {gamma}-Pcdhs selectively mediate contact-induced retractions upon filopodia self-recognition. Our results also illustrate how self-avoidance shapes the stochastic and space-filling behaviors of filopodia for robust dendritic pattern formation in mammalian neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural correlates of probabilistic information processing in gesture-speech integration</a></h4>

              
                How information of different modalities (e.g., speech and gesture) frame into a unified one remains unclear in the neurobiology of language. Leveraging the information-theoretic complexity metrics of entropy and mutual information (MI) to quantify gestures and speech, the present event-related potentials and chronometric double-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) study investigated the neural processes during probabilistic gesture-speech integration. In the early processing stage, we found a positive correlation of P1 amplitude with speech entropy and a negative correlation of N1-P2 amplitude with gesture entropy, while the TMS disruption effect of posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG) was negatively correlated with speech entropy. In the lexico-semantic processing stage, we observed a negative correlation of N400 amplitude with both gesture entropy and gesture-speech MI, a negative correlation of late positive component amplitude with speech entropy, together with correlations of the TMS interruption effect of inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) with gesture entropy, speech entropy and their MI. Our findings suggest a probabilistically updated lexical representation that was dynamically framed by top-down gesture constrain, bottom-up speech encoding and their interplay. A 5-step process in the pMTG-IFG-pMTG neural circuit is hypothesized for probabilistic gesture-speech processing, which promises a better understanding of the predictive multisensory language processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Structure-Function Dynamics of Engineered, Modular Neuronal Networks with Controllable Afferent-Efferent Connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Microfluidic devices interfaced with microelectrode arrays have in recent years emerged as powerful platforms for studying and manipulating in vitro neuronal networks at the micro- and mesoscale. By segregating neuronal populations using microchannels only permissible to axons, neuronal networks can be designed to mimic the highly organized and modular topology of neuronal assemblies in the brain. In vivo, the development of such neuronal assemblies is tightly orchestrated by reciprocal, dynamic structure-function relationships shaped by an interplay between intrinsic neuronal self-organizing properties and spatiotemporally regulated chemical and physical guidance cues. Engineered neuronal networks represent reductionist paradigms that can help recapitulate such dynamics in vitro. However, little is known about how the underlying topological features of such engineered neuronal networks contribute to their functional profile. To start addressing this question, a key parameter is control of afferent or efferent connectivity within the engineered network. In this study, we show that a microfluidic device featuring axon guiding channels with geometrical constraints inspired by a Tesla valve effectively promotes unidirectional axonal outgrowth between neuronal nodes, thereby enabling us to control afferent connectivity. We verified this by applying designer viruses to fluorescently label the neurons to visualise the structure of the networks, combined with extracellular electrophysiological recordings using embedded nanoporous microelectrodes to study the functional dynamics of these networks during maturation. We furthermore show that electrical stimulations of the networks induce signals selectively transmitted in a feedforward fashion between the neuronal populations. This model system has the potential to provide novel insights into the development, topological organization, and neuroplasticity mechanisms of neuronal assemblies at the micro- and mesoscale in healthy and perturbed conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Temporal characteristics of gamma rhythm constrain properties of noise in an inhibition-stabilized network model</a></h4>

              
                Gamma rhythm refers to oscillatory neural activity between 30-80 Hz, often induced in visual cortex by presentation of stimuli such as iso-luminant hues or gratings. Further, the power and peak frequency of gamma depend on the properties of the stimulus such as size and contrast. Gamma also has a typical arch shape, with a narrow trough and a broad peak, which can be replicated by a self-oscillating Wilson-Cowan (WC) model operating in an appropriate regime. However, oscillations in this model are infinitely long, unlike physiological gamma that occurs in short bursts. Further, unlike the model, gamma is faster after stimulus onset and slows down over time. Here, we first characterized gamma burst duration in LFP data recorded from two monkeys while they viewed full screen iso-luminant hues. We then added different types of noise in the inputs to the WC model and tested how that affected duration and temporal dynamics of gamma. While the model failed with the often-used Poisson noise, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) noise applied to both the excitatory and inhibitory populations in the WC model replicated the duration and slowing of gamma, and also replicated the shape and stimulus dependencies. Therefore, temporal dynamics of gamma oscillations put constraints on the type and properties of underlying neural noise.

                Transsynaptic tracing methods are crucial tools in studying neural circuits. Although a couple of anterograde tracing methods and a targeted retrograde tool have been developed in Drosophila melanogaster, there is still need for an unbiased, user-friendly, and flexible retrograde tracing system. Here we describe retro-Tango, a method for transsynaptic, retrograde circuit tracing and manipulation in Drosophila. In this genetically encoded system, a ligand-receptor interaction at the synapse triggers an intracellular signaling cascade that results in reporter gene expression in presynaptic neurons. Importantly, panneuronal expression of the elements of the cascade renders this method versatile, enabling its use not only to test hypotheses but also to generate them. We validate retro-Tango in various circuits and benchmark it by comparing our findings with the electron microscopy reconstruction of the Drosophila hemibrain. Our experiments establish retro-Tango as a key method for circuit tracing in neuroscience research.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Quantifying the distribution of feature values over data represented in arbitrary dimensional spaces</a></h4>

              
                BackgroundIdentifying the structured distribution (or lack thereof) of a given feature over a point cloud is a general research question. In the neuroscience field, this problem arises while investigating representations over neural manifolds (e.g., spatial coding), in the analysis of neurophysiological signals (e.g., auditory coding) or in anatomical image segmentation.

New methodWe introduce the Structure Index (SI) as a graph-based topological metric to quantify the distribution of feature values projected over data in arbitrary D-dimensional spaces (neurons, time stamps, pixels). The SI is defined from the overlapping distribution of data points sharing similar feature values in a given neighborhood.

ResultsUsing model data clouds we show how the SI provides quantification of the degree of local versus global organization of feature distribution. SI can be applied to both scalar and vectorial features permitting quantification of the relative contribution of related variables. When applied to experimental studies of head-direction cells, it is able to retrieve consistent feature structure from both the high- and low-dimensional representations. Finally, we provide two general-purpose examples (sound and image categorization), to illustrate the potential application to arbitrary dimensional spaces.

Comparison with existing methodsMost methods for quantifying structure depend on cluster analysis, which are suboptimal for continuous features and non-discrete data clouds. SI unbiasedly quantifies structure from continuous data in any dimensional space.

ConclusionsThe method provides versatile applications in the neuroscience and data science fields

HighlightsO_LIThe Structure Index is a graph-based topological metric
C_LIO_LIIt quantifies the distribution of feature values in arbitrary dimensional spaces
C_LIO_LIIt can be applied to both scalar and vectorial features
C_LIO_LIWhen applied to the head-direction neural system, it extracts concordant information from high- and low-dimensional representations

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Large-scale signal and noise correlations configure multi-task coding in human brain networks</a></h4>

              
                The brain is a complex system with dynamic network changes. Prior studies in theoretical neuroscience have demonstrated that state-dependent neural correlations can be understood from a neural coding framework. These so-called noise correlations - the trial-to-trial or moment-to-moment co-variability - can be interpreted only if the underlying signal correlation - the similarity of task selectivity between pairs of neural units - is known. While the impact of these correlations on task coding have been widely investigated in local spiking circuits, it remains unclear how this coding framework applies to large-scale brain networks. Here we investigate the relationship between large-scale noise correlations and their underlying signal correlations in a multi-task human fMRI dataset. We found that state-dependent noise correlation changes do not typically align in the same direction as their underlying signal correlation, suggesting that 1) trial-by-trial noise is typically reduced between similarly tuned regions, and 2) stimulus-driven activity does not linearly superimpose atop the networks underlying background activity. Crucially, we discovered that noise correlations that changed in the opposite direction as their signal correlation (i.e., anti-aligned correlations) improved the information coding of these brain regions. In contrast, noise correlation changes that were aligned with their signal correlation did not. These aligned noise correlations were primarily correlation increases, which have been commonly (yet incorrectly) assumed to increase information communication between brain regions in human neuroimaging studies. These findings illustrate that state-dependent noise correlations contribute to the information coding of functional brain networks, but interpretation of these correlation changes requires knowledge of the underlying signal correlations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The RNA Binding proteome of axonal mRNAs in sympathetic neurons</a></h4>

              
                BackgroundNeurons are morphologically complex cells that rely on the compartmentalization of protein expression to develop and maintain their cytoarchitecture. Targeting of RNA transcripts to axons is one of the mechanisms that allows rapid local translation of proteins in response to extracellular signals. 3 untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNA are non-coding sequences that play a critical role in determining transcript localisation and translation by interacting with specific RNA binding proteins (RBPs). However, how 3UTRs contribute to mRNA metabolism and the nature of RBP complexes responsible for these functions remain elusive.

ResultsWe performed 3 end sequencing of RNA isolated from axons and cell bodies of sympathetic neurons exposed to either Nerve Growth factor (NGF) or Neurotrophin 3 (NT3). NGF and NT3 are growth factors essential for sympathetic neuron development that act through distinct signalling mechanisms. Whereas NT3 is thought to act only locally, NGF signals back from axons to the cell bodies. We discovered that both NGF and NT3 affect transcription and alternative polyadenylation and induce the localisation of specific 3UTR isoforms to axons. The finding that many transcripts with short 3UTR were detected only in axons suggest that these may undergo local post-transcriptional remodelling. The integration of our data with CLIP-sequencing data revealed that long 3UTR isoforms associate with RBP complexes in the nucleus, and once in axons, regulate cytoplasmic 3 UTR isoform cleavage into shorter isoform.

ConclusionsOur findings shed new light on the complex interplay between nuclear polyadenylation, mRNA localisation and local 3UTR remodelling in developing neurons.

                Although the thalamus is supposed to be involved in reinforcement-based decision-making, there is no direct evidence regarding the involvement of this subcortical structure in humans. To fill this gap, we leveraged rare intra-thalamic electrophysiological recordings in patients and found that temporally structured thalamic oscillations encode key learning signals. Our findings also provide neural insight into the computational mechanisms of action inhibition in punishment avoidance learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Interactions between circuit architecture and plasticity in a closed-loop system</a></h4>

              
                Determining the sites of plasticity underlying changes in neural activity and behavior is critical for understanding mechanisms of learning. Identifying such sites from neural recording data can be challenging due to feedback pathways that impede reasoning about cause and effect. We studied interactions between feedback, neural activity, and plasticity in the context of a closed-loop motor learning task for which there is disagreement about the loci and directions of plasticity. We constructed a set of models that differed in the strength of their recurrent feedback. Despite these differences, each model successfully fit a large set of neural and behavioral data. However, the patterns of plasticity predicted by the models fundamentally differed, with the sign of plasticity at a key site changing from depression to potentiation as feedback strength increased. Guided by our analysis, we suggest how such models can be experimentally disambiguated. Our results address a long-standing debate regarding cerebellum-dependent motor learning and demonstrate how learning-related changes in neural activity can appear to contradict the sign of the underlying plasticity when feedback is present.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multiscale Effects of Excitatory-Inhibitory Homeostasis in Lesioned Cortical Networks: A Computational Study</a></h4>

              
                Stroke-related disruptions in functional connectivity (FC) often spread beyond lesioned areas and, given the localized nature of lesions, it is unclear how the recovery of FC is orchestrated on a global scale. Since recovery is accompanied by long-term changes in excitability, we propose excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) homeostasis as a driving mechanism. We present a large-scale model of the neocortex, with synaptic scaling of local inhibition, showing how E-I homeostasis can drive the post-lesion restoration of FC and linking it to changes in excitability. We show that functional networks could reorganize to recover disrupted modularity and small-worldness, but not network dynamics, suggesting the need to consider forms of plasticity beyond synaptic scaling of inhibition. On average, we observed widespread increases in excitability, with the emergence of complex lesion-dependent patterns related to biomarkers of relevant side effects of stroke, such as epilepsy, depression and chronic pain. In summary, our results show that the effects of E-I homeostasis extend beyond local E-I balance, driving the restoration of global properties of FC, and relating to post-stroke symptomatology. Therefore, we suggest the framework of E-I homeostasis as a relevant theoretical foundation for the study of stroke recovery and for understanding the emergence of meaningful features of FC from local dynamics.

The dataset can also be used for optimizing preprocessing methods for simultaneously collected imaging data. The dataset includes simultaneously collected recordings from 22 individuals (ages: 23-51) across various visual and naturalistic stimuli. In addition, physiological, eye tracking, electrocardiography, and cognitive and behavioral data were collected along with this neuroimaging data. Visual tasks include a flickering checkerboard that was collected outside and inside the MRI scanner (EEG-only) and simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings. Simultaneous recordings also included rest, the visual paradigm Inscapes, and several short video movies representing naturalistic stimuli. We present this dataset as part of an effort to provide open-access data with the goal of increasing the opportunity for discoveries and understanding of the human brain and evaluating the correlation between electrical brain activity and blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals.

                The advent of three-dimensional histological methods has advanced studies of cellular-resolution anatomy of the brain. The use of whole-mount staining and tissue clearing has advanced systems-level identification of cells underlying brain functions in mouse models. However, application of these methods to studies of human brains has been difficult due to their structural variability and the lack of standardized quantitative metrics. Here we report a rapid and scalable staining/imaging technique, termed mFISH3D, that enables single-cell-resolution imaging of mRNAs of more than ten genes in a large mammalian brain. To apply mFISH3D to postmortem human cerebral cortex, we have reconstructed morphogenic tracks of cortical growth, and used the tracks to provide a framework for quantitative assessment of cytoarchitecture. The workflow enabled the objective quantification of biological heterogeneity among cortical regions. We propose these techniques for standardization of 3D histology of the human cortex to provide reproducible measurements of cell-type-specific neuroanatomy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Integration of optic flow into the sky compass network in the brain of the desert locust</a></h4>

              
                Flexible orientation through any environment requires a sense of current relative heading that is updated based on self-motion. Global external cues originating from the sky or the earth's magnetic field and local cues provide a reference frame for the sense of direction. Locally, optic flow may inform about turning maneuvers, travel speed and covered distance. The central complex in the insect brain is associated with orientation behavior and largely acts as a navigation center. Visual information from global celestial cues and local landmarks are integrated in the central complex to form an internal representation of current heading. However, it is largely unclear which neurons integrate optic flow in the central-complex network. We recorded intracellularly from neurons in the locust central complex while presenting lateral grating patterns that simulated translational and rotational motion to identify these sites of integration. Certain types of central complex neurons were sensitive to visual self-motion independent of the type and direction of simulated motion. Columnar neurons innervating the noduli, paired central-complex substructures, were tuned to the direction of simulated horizontal turns. Modelling the connectivity of these neurons with a system of proposed compass neurons can account for rotation-direction specific shifts in the activity profile in the central complex corresponding to turn direction. Our model is similar but not identical to the mechanisms proposed for angular velocity integration in the navigation compass of the fly Drosophila.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Poly ADP-Ribose Signaling is Dysregulated in Huntington Disease Patients</a></h4>

              
                Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant genetic neurodegenerative disease caused by a CAG expansion in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene, translating to an expanded polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin (HTT) protein. Age at disease onset is correlated to CAG repeat length, but varies by decades between individuals with identical repeat lengths. Genome-wide association studies link HD modification to DNA repair and mitochondrial health pathways. Recent clinical studies show elevated DNA damage in HD, even at the premanifest stage of disease. One of the major DNA repair nodes influencing neurodegenerative disease is the PARP pathway. Accumulation of poly ADP-ribose (PAR), produced by PARP1 and PARP2, has been implicated in the pathology of Alzheimers and Parkinsons diseases, as well as autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia. We report that HD mutation carriers have lower cerebrospinal fluid PAR levels than healthy controls, starting at the premanifest stage. Patient-derived fibroblasts have reduced PARP1/2 activity and elevated DNA damage, while elevated PAR levels are only revealed upon inhibition of PAR degradation. These phenotypes are rescued by moderate huntingtin level reduction via the huntingtin-lowering splice modulator drug, LMI070 (Branaplam). As a direct mechanism, we have defined a PAR-binding motif in huntingtin, detected huntingtin complexed with PARylated proteins in human cells during stress, and localized huntingtin to mitotic chromosomes upon inhibition of PAR degradation. Direct huntingtin PAR binding was measured by fluorescence polarization and visualized by atomic force microscopy. These results provide insight into a very early molecular mechanism of HD, suggesting possible targets in HD to design early preventive therapies.

                Puberty is a key event in adolescent development that involves significant, hormone-driven changes to many aspects of physiology including the brain. Understanding how the brain responds during this time period is important for evaluating neuronal developments that affect mental health throughout adolescence and the adult lifespan. This study examines diffusion MRI scans from the cross-sectional ABCD Study baseline cohort, a large multi-site study containing thousands of participants, to describe the relationship between pubertal development and brain microstructure. Using advanced, 3-tissue constrained spherical deconvolution methods, this study is able to describe multiple tissue compartments beyond only white matter (WM) axonal qualities. After controlling for age, sex, brain volume, subject handedness, scanning site, and sibling relationships, we observe a positive relationship between an isotropic, intracellular diffusion signal fraction and pubertal development across a majority of regions of interest (ROIs) in the WM skeleton. We also observe regional effects from an intracellular anisotropic signal fraction compartment and extracellular isotropic free water-like compartment in several ROIs. This work suggests that changes during pubertal development elicit a complex response from brain tissue that cannot be completely described by traditional methods focusing only on WM axonal properties. This work brings in vivo human neuroimaging studies more into line with work performed on animal models, which describe an interaction between increased myelination, neurogenesis, angiogenesis, and glial cell proliferation in response to pubertal hormones.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Activity-regulated gene expression across cell types of the mouse hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Activity-regulated gene (ARG) expression patterns in the hippocampus (HPC) regulate synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory, and are linked to both risk and treatment response for many neuropsychiatric disorders. The HPC contains discrete classes of neurons with specialized functions, but cell type-specific activity-regulated transcriptional programs are not well characterized. Here, we used single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) in a mouse model of acute electroconvulsive seizures (ECS) to identify cell type-specific molecular signatures associated with induced activity in HPC neurons. We used unsupervised clustering and a priori marker genes to computationally annotate 15,990 high-quality HPC neuronal nuclei from N=4 mice across all major HPC subregions and neuron types. Activity-induced transcriptomic responses were divergent across neuron populations, with dentate granule cells being particularly responsive to activity. Differential expression analysis identified both upregulated and downregulated cell type-specific gene sets in neurons following ECS. Within these gene sets, we identified enrichment of pathways associated with varying biological processes such as synapse organization, cellular signaling, and transcriptional regulation. Finally, we used matrix factorization to reveal continuous gene expression patterns differentially associated with cell type, ECS, and biological processes. This work provides a rich resource for interrogating activity-regulated transcriptional responses in HPC neurons at single-nuclei resolution in the context of ECS, which can provide biological insight into the roles of defined neuronal subtypes in HPC function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hierarchical Modular Structure of the Drosophila Connectome</a></h4>

              
                The structure of neural circuitry plays a crucial role in brain function. Previous studies of brain organization generally had to trade off between coarse descriptions at a large scale and fine descriptions on a small scale. Researchers have now reconstructed tens to hundreds of thousands of neurons at synaptic resolution, enabling investigations into the interplay between global, modular organization, and cell type-specific wiring. Analyzing data of this scale, however, presents unique challenges. To address this problem we applied novel community detection methods to analyze the synapse-level reconstruction of an adult fruit fly brain containing over 20 thousand neurons and 10 million synapses. Using a machine-learning algorithm, we find the most densely connected communities of neurons by maximizing a generalized modularity density measure. We resolve the community structure at a range of scales, from large (on the order of thousands of neurons) to small (on the order of tens of neurons). We find that the network is organized hierarchically and larger-scale communities are composed of smaller-scale structures. Our methods identify well-known features of the fly brain, including its sensory pathways. Moreover, focusing on specific brain regions, we are able to identify subnetworks with distinct connectivity types. For example, manual efforts have identified layered structures in the fan-shaped body. Our methods not only automatically recover this layered structure, but also resolve finer connectivity patterns to downstream and upstream areas. We also find a novel modular organization of the superior neuropil, with distinct clusters of upstream and downstream brain regions dividing the neuropil into several pathways. These methods show that the fine-scale, local network reconstruction made possible by modern experimental methods are sufficiently detailed to identify the organization of the brain across scales, and enable novel predictions about the structure and function of its parts.

                Arousal and awareness are two components of consciousness whose the neural mechanisms remain unclear. Spontaneous increases of global (brain-wide) blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal has been found to be sensitive to changes in arousal. By contrasting BOLD datasets with altered arousal levels, we found that the activation of ventral posterolateral nucleus (VPL) decreased during transient increase in the global signal (top 17% data) in low arousal and awareness states (non-rapid eye movement sleep and anesthesia) as compared to wakefulness, and even in eye-closed (compared with eyes-open) in healthy awake-states, while this activation remained unchanged in patients with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome characterized by high arousal without awareness. These results demonstrate that co-activation of the VPL and global activity is critical to arousal, but not to awareness.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Characterization of spatiotemporal dynamics in EEG data during picture naming with optical flow patterns</a></h4>

              
                We present an analysis of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the oscillations in the electric potential that arises from neural activity. Depending on the frequency and phase of oscillations, these dynamics can be characterized as standing waves or as out-of-phase and modulated waves, which represent a combination of standing and moving waves. We characterize these dynamics as optical flow patterns, in terms of sources, sinks, spirals and saddles. Analytical and numerical solutions are compared with real EEG data acquired during a picture-naming task. Analytical approximation of standing waves allows us to establish some properties of pattern location and number. Namely, sources and sinks have mainly the same location, while saddles are located between them. The number of saddles correlates with the sum of all the other patterns. These properties are confirmed in both the simulated and real EEG data.

                Developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) are a group of rare childhood disorders characterized by severe epilepsy and related cognitive deficits. Numerous DEE genes have been discovered thanks to advances in genomic diagnosis, yet putative molecular links between these disorders are not known. CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD, DEE2) is one of the most common forms of genetic epilepsy; it is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the brain-enriched kinase CDKL5. To elucidate CDKL5 function, we looked for CDKL5 substrates using a SILAC based phosphoproteomic screen. We identified the voltage-gated Ca2+ channel Cav2.3 (encoded by CACNA1E) as a novel physiological target of CDKL5 in mice and humans. Recombinant channel electrophysiology and interdisciplinary characterization of Cav2.3 phosphomutant mice revealed that the loss of Cav2.3 phosphorylation leads to channel gain-of-function via slower channel inactivation and enhanced acetylcholine-induced stimulation, resulting in increased neuronal excitability. These changes in Cav2.3 closely resemble those described for gain-of-function point-mutations in CACNA1E that cause DEE69, a disorder sharing clinical features with CDD. Our results show that these two single-gene disorders are mechanistically related. We suggest that CDD is partly a channelopathy with Cav2.3 gain-of-function, thus Cav2.3 inhibition could be therapeutic in these DEEs.

HIGHLIGHTS- CDKL5 phosphorylates Cav2.3 at Ser15 and reduces channel inactivation time
- Loss of CDKL5 causes Cav2.3 gain-of-function, mimicking pathological CACNA1E mutations
- Hippocampal neurons from Cav2.3 S15A mutant mice have an enhanced excitability response to cholinergic stimulation
- A common molecular mechanism connects CDKL5 and CACNA1E epileptic encephalopathies

                Cognitive decline and hallucinations are common and debilitating non-motor symptoms, occurring during later phases of Parkinson's disease (PD). Minor hallucinations (MH), appear at early phases and have been suggested to predict cognitive impairment in PD, however, this has not been well-established by clinical research. Here, we investigated whether non-demented PD patients with MH show altered brain oscillations and whether such MH-related electrophysiological changes are associated with cognitive impairments that increase over time. Combining model-driven EEG analysis with neuropsychiatric and neuropsychological examinations in 75 PD patients, we reveal enhanced frontal theta oscillations in PD patients suffering from MH and link these oscillatory changes with lower cognitive frontal-subcortical functions. Neuropsychological follow-up examinations five years later confirmed MH-specific theta oscillations and revealed a stronger decline in frontal-subcortical functions in MH-patients with stronger frontal theta alterations, defining an MH and theta oscillation-based early marker of a cognitive decline in PD

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain criticality predicts individual synchronization levels in humans</a></h4>

              
                Moderate levels of synchronization of neuronal oscillations are essential for healthy brain dynamics. Synchronization levels exhibit large inter-individual variability the origins of which are unknown. Neuronal systems have been postulated to operate near a critical transition point or in an extended regime between disorder (subcritical) and order (supercritical phase) characterized by moderate synchronization and emergent power-law long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs). We investigated whether inter-individual variability in synchronization levels is explained by the individual position along the critical regime by analyzing magnetoencephalography (MEG) and intra-cerebral stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) human resting-state data. Here we show that variability in synchronization levels exhibits a positive linear and quadratic relationships with LRTCs in healthy participants and brain areas. In the epileptogenic zone this correlation was negative. These results show that variability in synchronization levels is regulated by the individual position along an extended critical-like regime, with healthy brain areas tending to operate in its subcritical and epileptogenic areas in its supercritical side.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Using deep convolutional neural networks to test why human face recognition works the way it does</a></h4>

              
                Human face recognition is highly accurate, and exhibits a number of distinctive and well documented behavioral "signatures" such as the use of a characteristic representational space, the disproportionate performance cost when stimuli are presented upside down, and the drop in accuracy for faces from races the participant is less familiar with. These and other phenomena have long been taken as evidence that face recognition is "special". But why does human face perception exhibit these properties in the first place? Here we use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to test the hypothesis that all of these signatures of human face perception result from optimization for the task of face recognition. Indeed, as predicted by this hypothesis, these phenomena are all found in CNNs trained on face recognition, but not in CNNs trained on object recognition, even when the amount of face experience is matched. To test whether these signatures are in principle specific to faces, we optimized a CNN on car discrimination and tested it on upright and inverted car images. As for face perception, the car-trained network showed a drop in performance for inverted versus upright cars. Similarly, CNNs trained only on inverted faces produce an inverted inversion effect. These findings show that the behavioral signatures of human face perception reflect and are well explained as the result of optimization for the task of face recognition, and that the nature of the computations underlying this task may not be so "special" after all.

	<p>In neuropsychological evaluation, verbal fluency is a crucial measure of cognitive function, but this measure requires standardized and normative data for use. The present study aimed to obtain validation and normative data for the verbal fluency task in the Peruvian population, with participants ranging from 6 to 94 years and varying in age, educational level, and sex. We recruited 2602 healthy individuals and used linear regression analysis to determine the effect of age, sex, and educational level. We also evaluated internal consistency between categories and phonological tasks with Cronbach&amp;amp;rsquo;s alpha and Pearson&amp;amp;rsquo;s correlation analysis and calculated test-retest reliability after three months. We found significant effects of age, educational level, and sex on phonological and semantic fluency. Participants with more than 12 years of education had the highest scores overall. Regarding age, middle-aged participants (between 31 and 40 years old) had the highest scores; scores gradually decreased outside of this age range. Regarding sex, men performed better than women. These results will increase the ability of clinicians to precisely determine the degree to which verbal fluency is affected in patients of different ages and educational levels.</p>

	<p>Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonists are a class of medications that act as antagonists of the CGRP receptor or ligand. They can be divided into monoclonal antibodies and non-peptide small molecules, also known as gepants. CGRP antagonists were the first oral agents specifically designed to prevent migraines. The second generation of gepants includes rimegepant (BHV-3000, BMS-927711), ubrogepant (MK-1602), and atogepant (AGN-241689, MK-8031). Zavegepant (BHV-3500, BMS-742413) belongs to the third generation of gepants characterized by different administration routes. The chemical and pharmacological properties of this new generation of gepants were calculated. The clinical trials showed that the new generation of CGRP antagonists is effective for the acute and/or preventive treatment of migraines. No increased mortality risks were observed to be associated with the second- and third-generation gepants. Moreover, the majority of the serious adverse events reported probably occurred unrelated to the medications. Interesting facts about gepants were highlighted, such as potency, hepatotoxicity, concomitant use with monoclonal antibodies targeting the CGRP, comparative analysis with triptans, and the &amp;amp;ldquo;acute and preventive&amp;amp;rdquo; treatment of migraine. Further studies should include an elderly population and compare the medications inside this class and with triptans. There are still concerns regarding the long-term side effects of these medications, such as chronic vascular hemodynamic impairment. Meanwhile, careful pharmacovigilance and safety monitoring should be performed in the clinical practice use of gepants.</p>

	<p>Glymphatic dysfunction has been linked to cognitive decline in several neurodegenerative diseases. In cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD), the mechanism of white matter hyperintensities (WMH)-related cognitive impairment (CI) is still under investigation. The diffusion tensor image (DTI) analysis along the perivascular space (ALPS) method has been considered to be a reliable parameter to evaluate glymphatic function. Therefore, we applied the ALPS-index to determine the influence of glymphatic function on CI in CSVD. In total, 137 CSVD patients (normal cognitive group, mild CI group, and dementia group) and 52 normal controls were included in this study. The ALPS-index was calculated based on the DTI. Correlation analyses and mediation analysis were conducted to examine the relationship between glymphatic function and cognition. Remarkable differences in the ALPS-index were observed between subjects with and without CI. The ALPS-index was negatively correlated with age, WMH volume, and general cognitive function in all CSVD patients. In the mild CI group, the ALPS-index was independently positively related to episodic memory, and mediated the relationship between WMH volume and episodic memory. In conclusion, the ALPS-index is a potential marker for early recognition of CI in CSVD. Glymphatic dysfunction mediates the relationship between WMH and CI in CSVD.</p>

	<p>Purpose: Neuroinflammation often initiates iron overload in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders. Chemokine-driven neuroinflammation is required for central sensitization and chronic allodynia following fractures, but specific molecular modulations are elusive. This present study explored whether hydrogen-rich saline, as one potent anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical, could alleviate fracture-caused allodynia by suppressing chemokine CXCL1 expression and iron overload. Methods: A mouse model of tibial fracture with intramedullary pinning was employed for establishing chronic allodynia. Three applications of hydrogen-rich saline (1, 5 or 10 mL/kg) were administrated intraperitoneally on a daily basis from days 4 to 6 following fractures. Spinal CXCL1 and its receptor CXCR2 levels, transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) expression and iron concentration were examined. Recombinant CXCL1, a selective CXCR2 antagonist and an iron chelator were used for verification of mechanisms. Results: Repetitive injections of hydrogen-rich saline (5 and 10 mL/kg but not 1 mL/kg) prevent fracture-caused mechanical allodynia and cold allodynia in a dose-dependent manner. Single exposure to hydrogen-rich saline (10 mL/kg) on day 14 after orthopedic surgeries controls the established persistent fracture allodynia. Furthermore, hydrogen-rich saline therapy reduces spinal CXCL1/CXCR2 over-expression and TfR1-mediated iron accumulation in fracture mice. Spinal CXCR2 antagonism impairs allodynia and iron overload following fracture surgery. Intrathecal delivery of recombinant CXCL1 induces acute allodynia and spinal iron overload, which is reversed by hydrogen-rich saline. Moreover, iron chelation alleviates exogenous CXCL1-induced acute pain behaviors. Conclusions: These findings identify that hydrogen-rich saline confers protection against fracture-caused chronic allodynia via spinal down-modulation of CXCL1-dependent TfR1-mediated iron accumulation in mice.</p>

	<p>Older adults exhibit deficits in episodic memory tasks, which have often been attributed to encoding or retrieval deficits, with little attention to consolidation mechanisms. More recently, researchers have attempted to measure consolidation in the context of a behavioral experiment using the wakeful rest paradigm (i.e., a brief, quiet period of minimal stimulation, which facilitates memory performance, compared to a distractor task). Critically, older adults might not produce this effect, given established age differences in other episodic memory processes and mind-wandering. In three experiments, we directly compared younger and older adults in modified versions of the wakeful rest paradigm. Critically, we utilized incidental encoding procedures (all experiments) and abstract shape stimuli (in Experiment 3) to limit the possibility of retrieval practice or maintenance rehearsal as potential confounding mechanisms in producing the wakeful rest effect. Wakeful rest reliably and equally benefited recall of incidentally encoded words in both younger and older adults. In contrast, wakeful rest had no benefit for standard accuracy measures of recognition performance in verbal stimuli, although there was an effect in response latencies for non-verbal stimuli. Overall, these results suggest that the benefits of wakeful rest on episodic retrieval are preserved across age groups, and hence support age-independence in potential consolidation mechanisms as measured by wakeful rest. Further, these benefits do not appear to be dependent on the intentionality of encoding or variations in distractor task types. Finally, the lack of wakeful rest benefits on recognition performance might be driven by theoretical constraints on the effect or methodological limitations of recognition memory testing in the current paradigm.</p>

	<p>The open-face design of the Leksell Vantage frame provides many advantages. However, its more rigid, contoured design offers less flexibility than other frames. This is especially true for posterior fossa approaches. This study explores whether these limitations can be overcome by tailored frame placement using a virtual planning approach. The posterior fossa was accessed in ten patients using the Leksell Vantage frame. Frame placement was planned with the Brainlab Elements software, including a phantom-based (virtual) pre-operative planning approach. A biopsy was performed in all patients; in four, additional laser ablation surgery was performed. The accuracy of virtual frame placement was compared to actual frame placement. The posterior approach was feasible in all patients. In one case, the trajectory had to be adjusted; in another, the trajectory was switched from a right- to a left-sided approach. Both cases showed large deviations from the initially planned frame placement. A histopathological diagnosis was achieved in all patients. The new Leksell Vantage frame can be used to safely target the posterior fossa with a high diagnostic success rate and accuracy. Frame placement needs to be well-planned and executed. This can be facilitated using specific software solutions as demonstrated.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A short-term prospective study to evaluate the clinical performance of endosseous zirconia implants [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Endosseous zirconia implants have been established as an alternative to conventional titanium implants, especially in the aesthetic zone. This pilot study aimed to evaluate the outcome of rehabilitation with zirconia implants, in a subset of the Indian population, involving varying clinical scenarios. Methods: A total of 10 one-piece zirconia implants were placed in seven patients requiring rehabilitation of missing teeth. The survival rate and marginal bone levels were evaluated at six months and 12 months following implant placement. Results: Five implants were placed in the maxilla and five in the mandible, including well-healed sites, extraction sockets, a single cantilever in the lower anterior region, and a full-arch rehabilitation. During the observation period, two early implant failures were noted resulting in a survival rate of 80%. Mean marginal bone loss of 0.73mm was seen one year following implant placement, with maximum bone loss occurring in the first six months. Conclusion: The results of this study encourage the use of endosseous zirconia implants in diverse clinical scenarios with careful case selection. However, long-term studies are needed to further validate these findings.

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Visual accuracy is consistently shown to be modulated around the time of the action execution. The neural underpinning of this motor-induced modulation of visual perception is still unclear. Here, we investigate with EEG whether it is related to the readiness potential, an event-related potential (ERP) linked to motor preparation. Across 18 human participants, the magnitude of visual modulation following a voluntary button press was found to correlate with the readiness potential amplitude measured during visual discrimination. Participants&rsquo; amplitude of the readiness potential in a purely motor-task was also found to correlate with the extent of the motor-induced modulation of visual perception in the visuomotor task. These results provide strong evidence that perceptual changes close to action execution are associated with motor preparation processes and that this mechanism is independent of task contingencies. Further, our findings suggest that the readiness potential provides a fingerprint of individual visuomotor interaction.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Hyperactivation of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) by p25, contributes to neuroinflammation causing neurodegeneration in Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD) and Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. However, the mechanism by which Cdk5 induces neuroinflammation in the PD brain is largely unexplored. Here, we show that Cdk5 phosphorylates cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) at Thr-268 and Ser-505 sites lead to its activation and generation of eicosanoid products. Mutational studies using site-directed mutagenesis and molecular simulations show that the architecture of the protein changes on each single-point mutation. Interestingly, double mutations also led to a severe decline in the activity of cPLA2 and to the disruption of its translocation to the plasma membrane. Further, the brain lysates of transgenic PD mouse models show hyperactivation of Cdk5, resulting in enhanced phosphorylation of Thr-268 and Ser-505 of cPLA2 and its heightened activity, confirming the findings observed in the cell culture model of PD. These phosphorylation sites of cPLA2 and Cdk5 could be explored as the future therapeutic targets against neuroinflammation in PD. Further, conjoint transcriptomic analysis of the publicly available human PD datasets strengthens the hypothesis that genes of the arachidonic acid, prostaglandin synthesis, and inflammatory pathways are significantly upregulated in the case of PD patients compared with that of healthy control subjects.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>A significant proportion of the human neurotypical population exhibits some degree of sensory eye dominance (SED), referring to the brain&rsquo;s preferential processing of one eye&rsquo;s input versus another. The neural substrates underlying this functional imbalance are not well known. Here, we investigated the relationship between visual white matter tract properties and SED in the human neurotypical population. Observers&rsquo; performance on two commonly used dichoptic tasks were used to index SED, along with performance on a third task to address a functional implication of binocular imbalance: stereovision. We show that diffusivity metrics of the optic radiations (ORs) well predict behavioral SED metrics. We found no relationship between SED and stereosensitivity. Our data suggest that SED is not simply reflected by gray matter structural and functional alterations, as often suggested, but relates, at least in part to the microstructural properties of thalamocortical white matter.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Shisa7-Dependent Regulation of GABAA Receptor Single-Channel Gating Kinetics</a></h4>

              
                <p>GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptors (GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs) mediate the majority of fast inhibitory transmission throughout the brain. Although it is widely known that pore-forming subunits critically determine receptor function, it is unclear whether their single-channel properties are modulated by GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R-associated transmembrane proteins. We previously identified Shisa7 as a GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R auxiliary subunit that modulates the trafficking, pharmacology, and deactivation properties of these receptors. However, whether Shisa7 also regulates GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R single-channel properties has yet to be determined. Here, we performed single-channel recordings of &alpha;2&beta;32L GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs cotransfected with Shisa7 in HEK293T cells and found that while Shisa7 does not change channel slope conductance, it reduced the frequency of receptor openings. Importantly, Shisa7 modulates GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R gating by decreasing the duration and open probability within bursts. Through kinetic analysis of individual dwell time components, activation modeling, and macroscopic simulations, we demonstrate that Shisa7 accelerates GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R deactivation by governing the time spent between close and open states during gating. Together, our data provide a mechanistic basis for how Shisa7 controls GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R gating and reveal for the first time that GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R single-channel properties can be modulated by an auxiliary subunit. These findings shed light on processes that shape the temporal dynamics of GABAergic transmission.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Although GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor (GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R) single-channel properties are largely determined by pore-forming subunits, it remains unknown whether they are also controlled by GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R-associated transmembrane proteins. Here, we show that Shisa7, a recently identified GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R auxiliary subunit, modulates GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R activation by altering single-channel burst kinetics. These results reveal that Shisa7 primarily decreases the duration and open probability of receptor burst activity during gating, leading to accelerated GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R deactivation. These experiments are the first to assess the gating properties of GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs in the presence of an auxiliary subunit and provides a kinetic basis for how Shisa7 modifies temporal attributes of GABAergic transmission at the single-channel level.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Preserved Motility after Neonatal Dopaminergic Lesion Relates to Hyperexcitability of Direct Pathway Medium Spiny Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>In Parkinson's disease patients and rodent models, dopaminergic neuron loss (DAN) results in severe motor disabilities. In contrast, general motility is preserved after early postnatal DAN loss in rodents. Here we used mice of both sexes to show that the preserved motility observed after early DAN loss depends on functional changes taking place in medium spiny neurons (MSN) of the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) that belong to the direct pathway (dMSN). Previous animal model studies showed that adult loss of dopaminergic input depresses dMSN response to cortical input, which likely contributes to Parkinson's disease motor impairments. However, the response of DMS-dMSN to their preferred medial PFC input is preserved after neonatal DAN loss as shown by <I>in vivo</I> studies. Moreover, their response to inputs from adjacent cortical areas is increased, resulting in reduced cortical inputs selectivity. Additional <I>ex vivo</I> studies show that membrane excitability increases in dMSN. Furthermore, chemogenetic inhibition of DMS-dMSN has a more marked inhibitory effect on general motility in lesioned mice than in their control littermates, indicating that expression of normal levels of locomotion and general motility depend on dMSN activity after early DAN loss. Contrastingly, DMS-dMSN inhibition did not ameliorate a characteristic phenotype of the DAN-lesioned animals in a marble burying task demanding higher behavioral control. Thus, increased dMSN excitability likely promoting changes in corticostriatal functional connectivity may contribute to the distinctive behavioral phenotype emerging after developmental DAN loss, with implications for our understanding of the age-dependent effects of forebrain dopamine depletion and neurodevelopment disorders.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The loss of striatal dopamine in the adult brain leads to life-threatening motor impairments. However, general motility remains largely unaffected after its early postnatal loss. Here, we show that the high responsiveness to cortical input of striatal neurons belonging to the direct basal ganglia pathway, crucial for proper motor functioning, is preserved after early dopamine neuron loss, in parallel with an increase in these cells' membrane excitability. Chemogenetic inhibition studies show that the preserved motility depends on this direct pathway hyperexcitability/hyperconnectivity, while other phenotypes characteristic of this condition remained unaltered despite the dMSN inhibition. This insight has implications for our understanding of the mechanism underlying the behavioral impairments observed in neuropsychiatric conditions linked to early dopaminergic hypofunction.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Single Nuclei Analyses Reveal Transcriptional Profiles and Marker Genes for Diverse Supraspinal Populations</a></h4>

              
                <p>The mammalian brain contains numerous neurons distributed across forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain that project axons to the lower spinal cord and work in concert to control movement and achieve homeostasis. Extensive work has mapped the anatomic location of supraspinal cell types and continues to establish specific physiological functions. The patterns of gene expression that typify and distinguish these disparate populations, however, are mostly unknown. Here, using adult mice of mixed sex, we combined retrograde labeling of supraspinal cell nuclei with fluorescence-activated nuclei sorting and single-nuclei RNA sequencing analyses to transcriptionally profile neurons that project axons from the brain to lumbar spinal cord. We identified 14 transcriptionally distinct cell types and used a combination of established and newly identified marker genes to assign an anatomic location to each. To validate the putative marker genes, we visualized selected transcripts and confirmed selective expression within lumbar-projecting neurons in discrete supraspinal regions. Finally, we illustrate the potential utility of these data by examining the expression of transcription factors that distinguish different supraspinal cell types and by surveying the expression of receptors for growth and guidance cues that may be present in the spinal cord. Collectively, these data establish transcriptional differences between anatomically defined supraspinal populations, identify a new set of marker genes of use in future experiments, and provide insight into potential differences in cellular and physiological activity across the supraspinal connectome.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The brain communicates with the body through a wide variety of neuronal populations with distinct functions and differential sensitivity to damage and disease. We have used single-nuclei RNA sequencing technology to distinguish patterns of gene expression within a diverse set of neurons that project axons from the mouse brain to the lumbar spinal cord. The results reveal transcriptional differences between populations previously defined on the basis of anatomy, provide new marker genes to facilitate rapid identification of cell type in future work, and suggest distinct responsiveness of different supraspinal populations to external growth and guidance cues.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Circadian Regulation of the Rod Contribution to Mesopic Vision in Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>At intermediate (mesopic) light levels, rods and cones are both active and can contribute to vision. This presents a challenge to the retina because the visual responses originating with rods and cones are distinct, yet their visual responses must be seamlessly combined. The current study aimed to establish how the circadian clock regulates rod and/or cone vision in these conditions, given the strong time-of-day change in the reliance on each photoreceptor. Visual responses were recorded in the retina and visual thalamus of anaesthetized male mice at distinct circadian time points, and the method of receptor silent substitution was used to selectively stimulate different photoreceptor types. With stimuli designed to only activate rods, responses in the mesopic range were highly rhythmic and peaked in amplitude in the subjective night. This rhythm was abolished following intravitreal injection of the gap junction blocker meclofenamic acid, consistent with a circadian variation in the strength of electrical coupling of photoreceptors. In contrast, responses to stimuli designed to only activate cones were arrhythmic within the mesopic to photopic range when adapted to the background irradiance. The outcome was that combined rod-plus-cone responses showed a stable contrast-response relationship across mesopic-photopic backgrounds in the circadian day, whereas at night, responses were significantly amplified at lower light levels. These data support the idea that the circadian clock is a key regulator of vision, in this case defining the relative amplitude of rod/cone vision across the mesopic transition according to time of day.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Although the importance of circadian clocks in regulating vision has been long recognized, less is known about how the clock shapes vision in conditions where both rods and cones are active (mesopic conditions). Here, the novel approach of receptor silent substitution has been applied to trace rod and cone visual responses in mice across the circadian cycle and has identified pronounced rhythms in rod, but not cone, vision. This has the effect of boosting responses in dimmer backgrounds at night at the cost of impaired contrast&ndash;response stability across the mesopic to photopic range. Thus, the circadian clock drives anticipatory changes in the relative contribution of rods versus cones to vision, which match the prevailing visual environment.</p>

                <p>Two structurally connected brain regions are more likely to interact, with the lengths of the structural bundles, their widths, myelination, and the topology of the structural connectome influencing the timing of the interactions. We introduce an <I>in vivo</I> approach for measuring functional delays across the whole brain in humans (of either sex) using magneto/electroencephalography (MEG/EEG) and integrating them with the structural bundles. The resulting topochronic map of the functional delays/velocities shows that larger bundles have faster velocities. We estimated the topochronic map in multiple sclerosis patients, who have damaged myelin sheaths, and controls, demonstrating greater delays in patients across the network and that structurally lesioned tracts were slowed down more than unaffected ones. We provide a novel framework for estimating functional transmission delays <I>in vivo</I> at the single-subject and single-tract level.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This article provides a straightforward way to estimate patient-specific delays and conduction velocities in the CNS, at the individual level, in healthy and diseased subjects. To do so, it uses a principled way to merge magnetoencephalography (MEG)/electroencephalography (EEG) and tractography.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Evidence of Serial Dependence from Decoding of Visual Evoked Potentials</a></h4>

              
                <p>It is well known that recent sensory experience influences perception, recently demonstrated by a phenomenon termed "serial dependence." However, its underlying neural mechanisms are poorly understood. We measured ERP responses to pairs of stimuli presented randomly to the left or right hemifield. Seventeen male and female adults judged whether the upper or lower half of the grating had higher spatial frequency, independent of the horizontal position of the grating. This design allowed us to trace the memory signal modulating task performance and also the implicit memory signal associated with hemispheric position. Using classification techniques, we decoded the position of the current and previous stimuli and the response from voltage scalp distributions of the current trial. Classification of previous responses reached full significance only 700 ms after presentation of the current stimulus, consistent with retrieval of an activity-silent memory trace. Cross-condition classification accuracy of past responses (trained on current responses) correlated with the strength of serial dependence effects of individual participants. Overall, our data provide evidence for a silent memory signal that can be decoded from the EEG potential, which interacts with the neural processing of the current stimulus. This silent memory signal could be the physiological substrate subserving at least one type of serial dependence.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The neurophysiological underpinnings of how past perceptual experience affects current perception are poorly understood. Here, we show that recent experience is reactivated when a new stimulus is presented and that the strength of this reactivation correlates with serial biases in individual participants, suggesting that serial dependence is established on the basis of a silent memory signal.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">How Does Literacy Affect Speech Processing? Not by Enhancing Cortical Responses to Speech, But by Promoting Connectivity of Acoustic-Phonetic and Graphomotor Cortices</a></h4>

              
                <p>Previous research suggests that literacy, specifically learning alphabetic letter-to-phoneme mappings, modifies online speech processing and enhances brain responses, as indexed by the BOLD, to speech in auditory areas associated with phonological processing (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B7">Dehaene et al., 2010</cross-ref>). However, alphabets are not the only orthographic systems in use in the world, and hundreds of millions of individuals speak languages that are not written using alphabets. In order to make claims that literacy per se has broad and general consequences for brain responses to speech, one must seek confirmatory evidence from nonalphabetic literacy. To this end, we conducted a longitudinal fMRI study in India probing the effect of literacy in Devanagari, an abubgida, on functional connectivity and cerebral responses to speech in 91 variously literate Hindi-speaking male and female human participants. Twenty-two completely illiterate participants underwent 6 months of reading and writing training. Devanagari literacy increases functional connectivity between acoustic-phonetic and graphomotor brain areas, but we find no evidence that literacy changes brain responses to speech, either in cross-sectional or longitudinal analyses. These findings shows that a dramatic reconfiguration of the neurofunctional substrates of online speech processing may not be a universal result of learning to read, and suggest that the influence of writing on speech processing should also be investigated.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> It is widely claimed that a consequence of being able to read is enhanced auditory processing of speech, reflected by increased cortical responses in areas associated with phonological processing. Here we find no relationship between literacy and the magnitude of brain response to speech stimuli in individuals who speak Hindi, which is written using a nonalphabetic script, Devanagari, an abugida. We propose that the exact nature of the script under examination must be considered before making sweeping claims about the consequences of literacy for the brain. Further, we find evidence that literacy enhances functional connectivity between auditory processing areas and graphomotor areas, suggesting a mechanism whereby learning to write might influence speech perception.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Distinct Roles of Dopamine Receptor Subtypes in the Nucleus Accumbens during Itch Signal Processing</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopaminergic neurons, which are well known for their central roles in reward and motivation-related behaviors, have been shown to participate in itch processing via their projection to the nucleus accumbens (NAc). However, the functional roles of different dopamine receptor subtypes in subregions of the NAc during itch processing remain unknown. With pharmacological approaches, we found that the blockade of dopamine D1 receptors (D1R), but not dopamine D2 receptors (D2R), in the lateral shell (LaSh) of the NAc impaired pruritogen-induced scratching behavior in male mice. In contrast, pharmacological activation of D2R in both the LaSh and medial shell (MeSh) of the NAc attenuated the scratching behavior induced by pruritogens. Consistently, we found that dopamine release, as detected by a dopamine sensor, was elevated in the LaSh rather than the MeSh of the NAc at the onset of scratching behavior. Furthermore, the elevation of dopamine release in the LaSh of the NAc persisted even though itch-relieving behavior was blocked, suggesting that the dopamine signal in the NAc LaSh represents a motivational component of itch processing. Our study revealed different dynamics of dopamine release that target neurons expressing two dopamine receptors subtypes within different subregions of the NAc, and emphasized that D1R in the LaSh of the NAc is important in itch signal processing.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Dopamine has been implicated in itch signal processing. However, the mechanism underlying the functional role of dopamine in itch processing remains largely unknown. Here, we examined the role of dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) and D2R in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell during pruritogen-induced scratching behavior. We demonstrated that D1R in the NAc lateral shell (LaSh) play an important role in motivating itch-induced scratching behavior, while activation of D2R would terminate scratching behavior. Our study revealed the diverse functional roles of dopamine signals in the NAc shell during itch processing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Updating Contextual Sensory Expectations for Adaptive Behavior</a></h4>

              
                <p>The brain has the extraordinary capacity to construct predictive models of the environment by internalizing statistical regularities in the sensory inputs. The resulting sensory expectations shape how we perceive and react to the world; at the neural level, this relates to decreased neural responses to expected than unexpected stimuli ("expectation suppression"). Crucially, expectations may need revision as context changes. However, existing research has often neglected this issue. Further, it is unclear whether contextual revisions apply selectively to expectations relevant to the task at hand, hence serving adaptive behavior. The present fMRI study examined how contextual visual expectations spread throughout the cortical hierarchy as we update our beliefs. We created a volatile environment: two alternating contexts contained different sequences of object images, thereby producing context-dependent expectations that needed revision when the context changed. Human participants of both sexes attended a training session before scanning to learn the contextual sequences. The fMRI experiment then tested for the emergence of contextual expectation suppression in two separate tasks, respectively, with task-relevant and task-irrelevant expectations. Effects of contextual expectation emerged progressively across the cortical hierarchy as participants attuned themselves to the context: expectation suppression appeared first in the insula, inferior frontal gyrus, and posterior parietal cortex, followed by the ventral visual stream, up to early visual cortex. This applied selectively to task-relevant expectations. Together, the present results suggest that an insular and frontoparietal executive control network may guide the flexible deployment of contextual sensory expectations for adaptive behavior in our complex and dynamic world.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The world is structured by statistical regularities, which we use to predict the future. This is often accompanied by suppressed neural responses to expected compared with unexpected events ("expectation suppression"). Crucially, the world is also highly volatile and context-dependent: expected events may become unexpected when the context changes, thus raising the crucial need for belief updating. However, this issue has generally been neglected. By setting up a volatile environment, we show that expectation suppression emerges first in executive control regions, followed by relevant sensory areas, only when observers use their expectations to optimize behavior. This provides surprising yet clear evidence on how the brain controls the updating of sensory expectations for adaptive behavior in our ever-changing world.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Age-Related Learning and Working Memory Impairment in the Common Marmoset</a></h4>

              
                <p>Aging is the greatest risk factor for the development of neurodegenerative diseases, yet we still do not understand how the aging process leads to pathologic vulnerability. The research community has relied heavily on mouse models, but the considerable anatomic, physiological, and cognitive differences between mice and humans limit their translational relevance. Ultimately, these barriers necessitate the development of novel aging models. As a nonhuman primate (NHP), the common marmoset (<I>Callithrix jacchus</I>) shares many features in common with humans and yet has a significantly shorter lifespan (10 years) than other primates, making it ideally suited to longitudinal studies of aging. Our objective was to evaluate the marmoset as a model of age-related cognitive impairment. To do this, we used the Delayed Recognition Span Task (DRST) to characterize age-related changes in working memory capacity in a cohort of sixteen marmosets, of both sexes, varying in age from young adult to geriatric. These monkeys performed thousands of trials over periods of time ranging up to 50% of their adult lifespan. To our knowledge, this represents the most thorough cognitive profiling of any marmoset aging study conducted to date. By analyzing individual learning curves, we found that aged animals exhibited delayed onset of learning, slowed learning rate after onset, and decreased asymptotic working memory performance. These findings are not accounted for by age-related impairments in motor speed and motivation. This work firmly establishes the marmoset as a model of age-related cognitive impairment.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Understanding the normal aging process is fundamental to identifying therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases for which aging is the biggest risk factor. Historically, the aging field has relied on animal models that differ markedly from humans, constraining translatability. Here, we firmly establish a short-lived nonhuman primate (NHP), the common marmoset, as a key model of age-related cognitive impairment. We demonstrate, through continuous testing over a substantial portion of the adult marmoset lifespan, that aging is associated with both impaired learning and working memory capacity, unaccounted for by age-related changes in motor speed and motivation. Characterizing individual cognitive aging trajectories reveals inherent heterogeneity, which could lead to earlier identification of the onset of impairment, and extended timelines during which therapeutics are effective.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The SYNGAP1 3'UTR Variant in ALS Patients Causes Aberrant SYNGAP1 Splicing and Dendritic Spine Loss by Recruiting HNRNPK</a></h4>

              
                <p>Fused in sarcoma (FUS) is a pathogenic RNA-binding protein in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We previously reported that FUS stabilizes Synaptic Ras-GTPase activating protein 1 (<I>Syngap1</I>) mRNA at its 3' untranslated region (UTR) and maintains spine maturation. To elucidate the pathologic roles of this mechanism in ALS patients, we identified the <I>SYNGAP1</I> 3'UTR variant rs149438267 in seven (four males and three females) out of 807 ALS patients at the FUS binding site from a multicenter cohort in Japan. Human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived motor neurons with the <I>SYNGAP1</I> variant showed aberrant splicing, increased isoform &alpha;1 levels, and decreased isoform  levels, which caused dendritic spine loss. Moreover, the <I>SYNGAP1</I> variant excessively recruited FUS and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (HNRNPK), and antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) blocking HNRNPK altered aberrant splicing and ameliorated dendritic spine loss. These data suggest that excessive recruitment of RNA-binding proteins, especially HNRNPK, as well as changes in <I>SYNGAP1</I> isoforms, are crucial for spine formation in motor neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> It is not yet known which RNAs cause the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Modulation of Hippocampal Network Oscillation by PICK1-Dependent Cell Surface Expression of mGlu3 Receptors</a></h4>

              
                <p>Metabotropic glutamate receptor Type 3 (mGlu3) controls the sleep/wake architecture, which plays a role in the glutamatergic pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Interestingly, mGlu3 receptor expression is decreased in the brain of schizophrenic patients. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms regulating mGlu3 receptors at the cell membrane. Subcellular receptor localization is strongly dependent on protein&ndash;protein interactions. Here we show that mGlu3 interacts with PICK1 and that this scaffolding protein is important for mGlu3 surface expression and function in hippocampal primary cultures. Disruption of their interaction via an mGlu3 C-terminal mimicking peptide or an inhibitor of the PDZ domain of PICK1 altered the functional expression of mGlu3 receptors in neurons. We next investigated the impact of disrupting the mGlu3-PICK1 interaction on hippocampal theta oscillations <I>in vitro</I> and <I>in vivo</I> in WT male mice. We found a decreased frequency of theta oscillations in organotypic hippocampal slices, similar to what was previously observed in mGlu3 KO mice. In addition, hippocampal theta power was reduced during rapid eye movement sleep, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and wake states after intraventricular administration of the mGlu3 C-terminal mimicking peptide. Targeting the mGlu3-PICK1 complex could thus be relevant to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Dysregulation of the glutamatergic system might play a role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Metabotropic glutamate receptors Type 3 (mGlu3) have been proposed as potential targets for schizophrenia. Understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating mGlu3 receptor at the cell membrane is critical toward comprehending how their dysfunction contributes to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Here we describe that the binding of the signaling and scaffolding protein PICK1 to mGlu3 receptors is important for their localization and physiological functions. The identification of new proteins that associate specifically to mGlu3 receptors will advance our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms associated with their targeting and function and ultimately might provide new therapeutic strategies to counter these psychiatric conditions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Evaluation of clinical, histology, TNF-α, and collagen expressions on oral ulcer in rats after treatment with areca nut and chrysanthemum oral gel [version 5; peer review: 1 approved, 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Areca nut (Areca catechu Linn.) is the seed of the fruit of the oriental palm that is commonly used among Southeast Asian communities. Chrysanthemum (Dendrathema grandiflora) is a flowering plant originating from East Asia and dominantly grows in China. Both of these plants have strong antioxidant activities. To investigate the mechanism of their wound healing activities, we prepared areca nut and chrysanthemum polyethylene oral gel and performed several in vivo assays using Sprague–Dawley rats. Methods: Sprague–Dawley rats were divided into six groups: Negative control group (rats with base gel treatment), positive control group (rats treated with triamcinolone acetonide), F1 (treatment with 20% areca nut:80% chrysanthemum), F2 (treatment with 50% areca nut:50% chrysanthemum), F3 (treatment with 80% areca nut:20% chrysanthemum), and normal group (without ulcer and treatment). Traumatic ulcers were performed on the buccal mucosa of all experimental animals that received topical oral gel and triamcinolone acetonide twice a day for seven days. The clinical and histological characteristics were analyzed and scored. Results: During the six days, the ulcerated area receded linearly over time and was completely cicatrized in F2, F3, and the positive control group (Dependent t-test, p<0.05). There were significant increases in body weight in F2 and positive control groups. There were no significant differences between groups in histology examination (Kruskal Wallis test, p<0.05). The moderate score of TNF-α levels was seen in F2 and positive control groups (ANOVA/Tukey test, p<0.05). In the collagenases assay, a high concentration of areca nut (F3) induced the abundance of collagen during the ulcer healing process. Conclusions: The combination of areca nut and chrysanthemum extract in the oral gel can optimize the healing of traumatic oral ulcers in Sprague-Dawley rats through the increase of TNF-α and collagen deposition.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Inglämnlagare - a tool for restructuring Swedish site data for statistical analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This paper presents a new software tool, Inglämnlagare, developed to be open-source, that restructures information about ancient remains in Sweden for analysis. The background is a new version of the ancient sites database, the Historic Environment Record, curated by the Swedish National Heritage Board, that was launched in 2018 with a new database model that structures the information differently compared to previous versions. Methods: The program, written in Python programming language, has multicore support in order to improve performance for large files and uses regular expressions to extract information about individual features of composite sites. Such features, together with their summed amount, are written as new individual fields to a comma-separated value file. The program is delivered as a source script file that can be executed in any Python environment. Use cases: As an example of use, a case study of exploring graves of rectangular shape found within Sweden is provided. The use case also describes the different steps involved in preparing the data in QGIS to run the program, as well as some methods to efficiently analyse and visualize the output. Conclusions: Inglämnlagare will make more information from the Swedish record of ancient sites accessible for research and can be used to explore different content of the record more efficiently than previously possible. While the tool is written specifically for this dataset it also provides an example of how open-source tools can be used for data wrangling making information designed for a specific purpose, such as online dissemination, appropriate for analysis.

                Background: Food and kitchen hygiene are necessary conditions for safe food and prevent foodborne illnesses. The objective of this study was to identify the factors associated with caregivers’ knowledge of kitchen hygiene in San Juan de Lurigancho (SJL). Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. We surveyed 250 mothers at comedores populares (a sort of community kitchens which are very popular in Lima) and who were part of mothers' clubs in the areas of Huascar V and San Pablo, in SJL in Lima. The sample was selected through non-probability convenience sampling. A questionnaire with three dimensions (cleanliness, storage and contamination of children) was administered. Results: On average, in Huascar and San Pablo, most caregivers were the children’s mothers (93.2%); most of the caregivers were between 21 and 30 years old (54%); they had secondary level of education (70.4%); they were living in free union with their partners (69.2%); they were mainly housewives (80.4%); their houses were constructed with materials different from brick and cement (68.4%); and their houses had a bare floor (70.0%). They did not have drinking water in the kitchen (88.4%); they did not use a gas stove (88.4%), a refrigerator (50.0%), a radio (82.0%), or a microwave (16.4%). A good level of knowledge of food hygiene was found in 63.2% of caregivers. No predictive capacity of the assessed sociodemographic characteristics on the level of knowledge of kitchen hygiene was identified. Conclusions: This study determined that the assessed sociodemographic variables were not significantly associated with the level of knowledge about kitchen hygiene. It is necessary to improve mothers' knowledge about the handling and consumption of spoiled food and their effect on children's health.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The “Rotten” matter in A Farewell to Arms: An Ecological Gothic reading [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                This article uncovers the gothic tropes manifest in the “rotten” food, human bodies, landscapes, and rain in Ernest Hemingway’s A Farewell to Arms through an eco-gothic perspective. It demonstrates how the rotten food, the disjointed bodies, the broken landscapes, and the gothic rain can be viewed in the novel as counter-narratives against the narratives of war, the military, and modern medicine. The first part of this article suggests interpreting war as a form of cannibalism by exploring the representations of rotten food and the connection between eating and killing. Next, the author focuses on how the body is fragmented both metaphorically and literally by the discourse of war, the military, and medical science. The third part uncovers the non-anthropocentric consciousness embedded within the protagonist’s narrative, followed by the gothicizing and romanticization of nature in the fourth section. Here, the protagonist’s linking of the human body to the natural landscape, the descriptions of the gothic rain, and the romanticized snow—all these, as the author argues, can be interpreted as a collective resistance against industrial, anthropocentric warfare.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Micronutrients in Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                About 10 to 20% of reported pregnancies have complications like spontaneous abortion (SA), preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB), and fetal growth restriction (FGR);  60% are attributed to maternal nutritional alterations. Multiple micronutrients (MMN) are supplemented in the antenatal period, but no proper validation/guidelines are available regarding dosing/time, the need for initiation, and the duration of supplementation. Studies have reported adverse pregnancy complications related to the overuse/unwanted use of multiple micronutrient supplementations during pregnancy. Identifying the exact population requiring supplementation is necessary to prevent its abuse. This article attempts to review the impacts of micronutrient deficiency/supplementation in cases of SA, FGR, and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), preterm delivery and PE.  The study used a literature search using PubMed, Google Scholar, Mendeley, and Scopus Databases using search words pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), fetal growth restriction (FGR), preterm delivery, preeclampsia (PE) or “adverse pregnancy” associated with minerals, micronutrients, or supplementation. The review also considered in-house literature databases, a single-window search at Kasturba Medical College (KMC) Health sciences library, MAHE (Manipal Academy of Higher Education). The figures included in the study were created by Biorender.com. Micronutrients play multiple roles during pregnancy and fetoplacental growth stimulating growth hormone secretion, Lysyl oxidase (LOX), involved in the crosslinking between collagen and elastin in the amniotic membrane, downregulation of interleukin (IL)-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-4, IL-6, Il-10, IL-12, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and several chemokines involved in hypertension, immune-inflammatory pathways, attenuate insulin resistance a structural development of neurons and glia. Over-supplementation has led to complications such as spontaneous abortion and gestational diabetes mellitus. Since there is a lack of standardization concerning micronutrient supplementation during pregnancy, there is a need for  systematic study related to the role of micronutrients during each trimester of pregnancy to optimize its supplementation and to prevent hazards associated with its abuse.

Background <p>Following rapidly rising COVID-19 case numbers, England entered a national lockdown on 6 January 2021, with staged relaxations of restrictions from 8 March 2021 onwards.</p> Aim <p>We characterise how the lockdown and subsequent easing of restrictions affected trends in SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence.</p> Methods <p>On average, risk of infection is proportional to infection prevalence. The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study is a repeat cross-sectional study of over 98,000 people every round (rounds approximately monthly) that estimates infection prevalence in England. We used Bayesian P-splines to estimate prevalence and the time-varying reproduction number (<i>R</i><sub>t</sub>) nationally, regionally and by age group from round 8 (beginning 6 January 2021) to round 13 (ending 12 July 2021) of REACT-1. As a comparator, a separate segmented-exponential model was used to quantify the impact on <i>R</i><sub>t</sub> of each relaxation of restrictions.</p> Results <p>Following an initial plateau of 1.54% until mid-January, infection prevalence decreased until 13 May when it reached a minimum of 0.09%, before increasing until the end of the study to 0.76%. Following the first easing of restrictions, which included schools reopening, the reproduction number <i>R</i><sub>t</sub> increased by 82% (55%, 108%), but then decreased by 61% (82%, 53%) at the second easing of restrictions, which was timed to match the Easter school holidays. Following further relaxations of restrictions, the observed <i>R</i><sub>t</sub> increased steadily, though the increase due to these restrictions being relaxed was offset by the effects of vaccination and also affected by the rapid rise of Delta. There was a high degree of synchrony in the temporal patterns of prevalence between regions and age groups.</p> Conclusion <p>High-resolution prevalence data fitted to P-splines allowed us to show that the lockdown was effective at reducing risk of infection with school holidays/closures playing a significant part.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Humans combine value learning and hypothesis testing strategically in multi-dimensional probabilistic reward learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mingyu Song, Persis A. Baah, Ming Bo Cai, Yael Niv</p>

Realistic and complex decision tasks often allow for many possible solutions. How do we find the correct one? Introspection suggests a process of trying out solutions one after the other until success. However, such methodical serial testing may be too slow, especially in environments with noisy feedback. Alternatively, the underlying learning process may involve implicit reinforcement learning that learns about many possibilities in parallel. Here we designed a multi-dimensional probabilistic active-learning task tailored to study how people learn to solve such complex problems. Participants configured three-dimensional stimuli by selecting features for each dimension and received probabilistic reward feedback. We manipulated task complexity by changing how many feature dimensions were relevant to maximizing reward, as well as whether this information was provided to the participants. To investigate how participants learn the task, we examined models of serial hypothesis testing, feature-based reinforcement learning, and combinations of the two strategies. Model comparison revealed evidence for hypothesis testing that relies on reinforcement-learning when selecting what hypothesis to test. The extent to which participants engaged in hypothesis testing depended on the instructed task complexity: people tended to serially test hypotheses when instructed that there were fewer relevant dimensions, and relied more on gradual and parallel learning of feature values when the task was more complex. This demonstrates a strategic use of task information to balance the costs and benefits of the two methods of learning.
