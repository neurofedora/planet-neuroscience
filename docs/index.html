              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">NF1 regulates mesenchymal glioblastoma plasticity and aggressiveness through the AP-1 transcription factor FOSL1</a></h4>

              
                The molecular basis underlying glioblastoma (GBM) heterogeneity and plasticity is not fully understood. Using transcriptomic data of human patient-derived brain tumor stem cell lines (BTSCs), classified based on GBM-intrinsic signatures, we identify the AP-1 transcription factor <i>FOSL1</i> as a key regulator of the mesenchymal (MES) subtype. We provide a mechanistic basis to the role of the neurofibromatosis type 1 gene (<i>NF1</i>), a negative regulator of the RAS/MAPK pathway, in GBM mesenchymal transformation through the modulation of <i>FOSL1</i> expression. Depletion of <i>FOSL1</i> in <i>NF1</i>-mutant human BTSCs and <i>Kras</i>-mutant mouse neural stem cells results in loss of the mesenchymal gene signature and reduction in stem cell properties and in vivo tumorigenic potential. Our data demonstrate that <i>FOSL1</i> controls GBM plasticity and aggressiveness in response to <i>NF1</i> alterations.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Activation of estrogen receptors is thought to modulate cognitive function in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and striatum by affecting both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission. The entorhinal cortex is a major source of cortical sensory and associational input to the hippocampus, but it is unclear whether either estrogens or progestogens may modulate cognitive function through effects on synaptic transmission in the entorhinal cortex. This study assessed the effects of the brief application of either 17-β estradiol (E2) or progesterone on excitatory glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the female rat entorhinal cortex in vitro. Rats were ovariectomized on postnatal day (PD) 63 and also received subdermal E2 implants to maintain constant low levels of circulating E2 on par with estrus. Electrophysiological recordings from brain slices were obtained between PD70 and PD86, and field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) reflecting the activation of the superficial layers of the entorhinal cortex were evoked by the stimulation of layer I afferents. The application of E2 (10 nM) for 20 min resulted in a small increase in the amplitude of fEPSPs that reversed during the 30-min washout period. The application of the ERα agonist propylpyrazoletriol (PPT) (100 nM) or the β agonist DPN (1 μM) did not significantly affect synaptic responses. However, the application of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor-1 (GPER1) agonist G1 (100 nM) induced a reversible increase in fEPSP amplitude similar to that induced by E2. Furthermore, the potentiation of responses induced by G1 was blocked by the GPER1 antagonist G15 (1 μM). Application of progesterone (100 nM) or its metabolite allopregnanolone (1 μM) did not significantly affect synaptic responses. The potentiation of synaptic transmission in the entorhinal cortex induced by the activation of GPER1 receptors may contribute to the modulation of cognitive function in female rats.</p>

                Background: The cytokines interferon gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin-10 (IL-10) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF- α) play an important role in malaria infection. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of malaria and to evaluate cytokine responses to malaria infection in patients from the East Nile locality of Khartoum State. Methods: This study was carried out from May to July 2018 in the East Nile Locality, Khartoum State. Blood samples were collected from 384 randomly selected patients for blood film analysis. Of these, 39 were selected for cytokine level analysis (10 control and 29 patient samples), determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Results: The malaria prevalence rate among 384 patients was 18.5%. Plasmodium falciparum was the most prevalent (13%), while the prevalence of Plasmodium vivax was 4.6%. The rate of mixed infection was 0.8%. There was a higher prevalence rate (22.7%) in males than females (15.6%). However, we found no significant correlation between cytokine levels and parasitemia in the study group. Nevertheless, our study demonstrated a significant correlation between cytokine levels and recurrent infections. Conclusions: Together, our data show that malaria remains a public health problem in East Nile locality with a high prevalence. Additionally, serum levels of IFN- γ and TNF- α were significantly higher in malaria-infected individuals compared to non-infecting individuals and cytokine levels were found to be correlated with recurrent malaria infection.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The impact of vitamin D supplementation on peripheral neuropathy in a sample of Egyptian prediabetic individuals [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Vitamin D deficiency is seen more frequently in diabetic patients with distal symmetrical polyneuropathy. Unfortunately, there is a shortage of data concerning prediabetic individuals with peripheral neuropathy (PN). Therefore, we aimed to study the association of vitamin D deficiency with PN severity and to determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on PN in prediabetics. Methods: A case-control study was conducted consisting of 178 prediabetic individuals recruited from the outpatient department of the National Institute of Diabetes and Endocrinology, Cairo, Egypt. All patients were screened for PN using clinical examination and Douleur Neuropathique 4 diagnostic questionnaire (DN4). They were divided into 89 patients with and 89 patients without PN (group A and B). Group A was assessed for neuropathic severity using the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ). In addition, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, ionized calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone (PTH), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting blood glucose (FBG), 2-hour post 75g glucose (2h-75g glucose) and lipid profile were measured. Prediabetic patients with PN were given vitamin D3 200.000 IU IM monthly for three months. After three months, clinical assessment, DN4, SF-MPQ and all laboratory measures were repeated. Results: Vitamin D level was negatively correlated with neuropathy score and severity (r = -0.65, -0.47, p <0.001) among group A. Moreover, vitamin D level was an independent predictor of neuropathic severity (odds ratio -0.18, 95% CI -0.33 -0.03, P ≤ 0.05). Supplementation of vitamin D resulted in a highly significant improvement in glycemic parameters and lipid profile, p ≤ 0.001. Interestingly, neuropathy score and severity before vitamin D supplementation were (6.4 ± 1.6 and 28.3 ± 7.2) and after became (2.5 ± 0.9 and 17 ± 6.3, p ≤ 0.001). Conclusion: Vitamin D deficiency is an independent risk factor for PN. Correction of vitamin D deficiency improves glycemic parameters, PN score and severity.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Left Ventricular Function Recovery After Coronary Revascularization and Medical Therapy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD) with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is rising, but the optimal treatment remains unclear. The present study aims to investigate the impact of revascularization (coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)) and medical therapy (MT) on LVEF recovery in patients with CAD and LVEF ≤ 40%. Methods: All clinical studies which reported LVEF in patients with CAD and LVEF ≤ 40% undergoing either revascularization or MT were included. A systematic literature search up to May 11, 2017 was performed on MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library in Ovid. Studies were assessed for eligibility and data were extracted by independent reviewers in duplicate with disagreements resolved by a third reviewer. Bias assessment was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Random effect meta-analysis was performed on included studies. The primary outcome was change in LVEF after intervention as compared to baseline. Results: 83 cohort studies with a total of 7,157 patients were included. We observed a statistically significant increase in LVEF following revascularization with CABG (MD 7.76; 95% CI: 6.81 to 8.70; p<0.00001; I2=99%) and PCI (MD 6.70; 95% CI: 4.71 to 8.70; p<0.00001; I2=94%) but not after MT (MD 4.06; 95% CI: -2.12 to 10.24; p=0.20; I2=98%). Conclusion: In patients with CAD and LVEF ≤ 40%, revascularization leads to LVEF recovery as compared to MT. There is continued need for RCT level evidence to enable optimization of treatment selection in this difficult population.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Chlorpyrifos and other pesticide exposure and suspected developmental delay in children aged under 5 years: a case-control study in Phitsanulok, Thailand [version 4; peer review: 1 approved, 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Developmental delay among children under 5 years of age is a serious global public health problem and much research has been carried out to find potential causes. Pesticides - especially organophosphates - are suspected to be one of the main causes of the problem.  This study aimed to investigate the association between pesticide use by the mother during pregnancy and preschool children development using a case-control study. Methods: Data on prenatal and postnatal pesticide exposure of 442 children with suspected developmental delay, and 413 controls with normal development were included for analysis. The children were matched for gender, age, and residency. Data on pesticide exposure were collected via interview with the mother, and data on pregnancy outcomes abstracted from hospital records.   Results: Chlorpyrifos exposure significantly increased the risk of developmental delay with an odds ratio (OR) of 3.71 (95% CI 1.03-13.36) for ever use of the pesticide, and an OR of 5.92 (95% CI 1.01-34.68) for postnatal exposure (p <0.05). Some other pesticides also had a positive association with developmental delay but none were statistically significant (p <0.05). Those pesticides were insecticide, fungicide, herbicide, and molluscicide. Individual pesticides with a positive association were glyphosate, paraquat, butachlor, methyl parathion (pholidon), savin, methomyl, endosulfan, carbosulfan, methamidophos, monochrotofos, mancozeb, and bordeaumixture. Conclusions: This case-control study found that chlorpyrifos and some other pesticide exposure during pregnancy was positively associated with developmental delay in children aged under 5 years. Further research should be conducted to better understand this potential effect of pesticides on child neurodevelopment, and the public - especially those who plan to have families - should be informed.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Why are feasibility studies accessing routinely collected health data? A systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Feasibility trials are often undertaken to determine whether a larger randomised controlled trial (RCT) is achievable. In a recent review, 15 feasibility trials accessed routinely collected health data (RCHD) from UK national databases and registries. This paper looks at attributes of these trials and the reasons why they accessed RCHD.  Methods: We extracted data from all publicly available sources for the 15 feasibility studies found in a previous review of trials successfully accessing RCHD in the UK between 2013–2018 for the purpose of informing or supplementing participant data. We extracted trial characteristics, the registry accessed, and the way the RCHD was used.  Results: The 15 feasibility RCTs were conducted in a variety of disease areas, and were generally small (median sample size 100, range 41–4061) and individually randomised (60%, 9/15). The primary trial outcome was predominantly administrative (non-clinical) (80%, 12/15) such as feasibility of patient recruitment. They were more likely to recruit from secondary care (67%, 10/15) settings than primary (33%, 5/15).  NHS Digital was the most commonly accessed registry (33% (5/15)) with SAIL databank (20% (3/15)), electronic Data Research and Innovation Service (eDRIS) and Paediatric Intensive Care Audit Network (PICANET) (each 13% 2/15) also being accessed. Where the information was clear, the trials used RCHD for data collection during the trial (47%, 7/15), follow-up after the trial (27%, 4/15) and recruitment (13%, 2/15).  Conclusions: Between 2013 and 2018, 15 feasibility trials successfully accessed UK RCHD. Feasibility trials would benefit, as with other trials, from guidance on reporting the use of RCHD in protocols and publications.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Regional disparities in postnatal care among mothers aged 15-49 years old: An analysis of the Indonesian Demographic and Health Survey 2017 [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In Indonesia, maternal mortality remains high, significantly 61.59% occur in the postnatal period. Postnatal care (PNC) provision is a critical intervention between six hours and 42 days after childbirth and is the primary strategy to reduce maternal mortality rates. However, underutilisation of PNC in Indonesia still remains high, and limited studies have shown the regional disparities of PNC in Indonesia. Methods: This study aims to explore the gaps between regions in PNC service for mothers who have had live births during the last five years in Indonesia. This study was a secondary data analysis study using the Indonesian Demographic and Health Survey (IDHS) in 2017. A total of 13,901 mothers aged 15-49 years having had live births within five years were included. Chi-squared test and binary logistic regression were performed to determine regional disparities in PNC. Results: Results indicated that the prevalence of PNC service utilisation among mothers aged 15-49 years was 70.94%. However, regional gaps in the utilisation of PNC service were indicated. Mothers in the Central of Indonesia have used PNC services 2.54 times compared to mothers in the Eastern of Indonesia (OR = 2.54; 95% CI = 1.77-3.65, p<0.001). Apart from the region, other variables have a positive relationship with PNC service, including wealth quintile, accessibility health facilities, age of children, childbirth order, mother's education, maternal occupation, spouse's age, and spouse's education. Conclusion: The results suggest the need for national policy focuses on service equality, accessible, and reliable implementation to improve postnatal care utilisation among mothers to achieve the maximum results for the Indonesian Universal Health Coverage plan.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Non-commercial pharmaceutical R&D: what do neglected diseases suggest about costs and efficiency? [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The past two decades have witnessed significant growth in non-commercial research and development (R&D) initiatives, particularly for neglected diseases, but there is limited understanding of the ways in which they compare with commercial R&D. This study analyses costs, timelines, and attrition rates of non-commercial R&D across multiple initiatives and how they compare to commercial R&D. Methods: This is a mixed-method, observational, descriptive, and analytic study. We contacted 48 non-commercial R&D initiatives and received either quantitative and/or qualitative data from 13 organizations. We used the Portfolio to Impact (P2I) model’s estimates of average costs, timelines, and attrition rates for commercial R&D, while noting that P2I cost estimates are far lower than some previous findings in the literature. Results: The quantitative data suggested that the costs and timelines per candidate per phase (from preclinical through Phase 3) of non-commercial R&D for new chemical entities are largely in line with commercial averages. The quantitative data was insufficient to compare attrition rates. The qualitative data identified more reasons why non-commercial R&D costs would be lower than commercial R&D, timelines would be longer, and attrition rates would be equivalent or higher, though the data does not allow for estimating the magnitude of these effects. Conclusions: The quantitative data suggest that costs and timelines per candidate per phase were largely in line with (lower-end estimates of) commercial averages. We were unable to draw conclusions on overall efficiency, however, due to insufficient data on attrition rates. Given that non-commercial R&D is a nascent area of research with limited data available, this study contributes to the literature by generating hypotheses for further testing against a larger sample of quantitative data. It also offers a range of explanatory factors for further exploration regarding how non-commercial and commercial R&D may differ in costs and efficiency.

                An interesting and valuable discussion has arisen from our recent article (Lachenmeier et al., 2020) and we are pleased to have the opportunity to expand on the various points we made. Equally important, we wish to correct several important misunderstandings that were made by Kruse and Beitzke (2020) on behalf of the European Industrial Hemp Association (EIHA) that possibly contributed to their concerns about the validity of our data, toxicological assessment and conclusions regarding regulatory status of cannabidiol (CBD) products. First and foremost, our study did only assess the risk of psychotropic Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) without inclusion of non-psychotropic Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA). Secondly, as this article will discuss in more detail, there is ample evidence for adverse effects of CBD products, not only in paediatric patients, but also in adult users of over-the-counter CBD products (including inadvertent “high” effects). Thirdly, the exposure and risk assessment was conducted using up-to-date guidelines according to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR). And finally, the current legal situation in the European Union, without approval of any hemp extract-containing product according to the Novel Food regulation, actually allows blanket statements that all such products are illegal on the market, and this indeed would imply a general ban on the use and marketing of such products as food or food ingredients until such an approval has been granted. We hope that this reassures the F1000Research readership regarding the validity of our results and conclusions. We are pleased, though, that the EIHA has acknowledged the fact that there are non-compliant CBD products available, but according to our data these are a substantial fraction of the market.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">An uncertainty-based model of the effects of fixation on choice</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Zhi-Wei Li, Wei Ji Ma</p>

When people view a consumable item for a longer amount of time, they choose it more frequently; this also seems to be the direction of causality. The leading model of this effect is a drift-diffusion model with a fixation-based attentional bias. Here, we propose an explicitly Bayesian account for the same data. This account is based on the notion that the brain builds a posterior belief over the value of an item in the same way it would over a sensory variable. As the agent gathers evidence about the item from sensory observations and from retrieved memories, the posterior distribution narrows. We further postulate that the utility of an item is a weighted sum of the posterior mean and the negative posterior standard deviation, with the latter accounting for risk aversion. Fixating for longer can increase or decrease the posterior mean, but will inevitably lower the posterior standard deviation. This model fits the data better than the original attentional drift-diffusion model but worse than a variant with a collapsing bound. We discuss the often overlooked technical challenges in fitting models simultaneously to choice and response time data in the absence of an analytical expression. Our results hopefully contribute to emerging accounts of valuation as an inference process.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A strategy for mapping biophysical to abstract neuronal network models applied to primary visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Anton V. Chizhov, Lyle J. Graham</p>

A fundamental challenge for the theoretical study of neuronal networks is to make the link between complex biophysical models based directly on experimental data, to progressively simpler mathematical models that allow the derivation of general operating principles. We present a strategy that successively maps a relatively detailed biophysical population model, comprising conductance-based Hodgkin-Huxley type neuron models with connectivity rules derived from anatomical data, to various representations with fewer parameters, finishing with a firing rate network model that permits analysis. We apply this methodology to primary visual cortex of higher mammals, focusing on the functional property of stimulus orientation selectivity of receptive fields of individual neurons. The mapping produces compact expressions for the parameters of the abstract model that clearly identify the impact of specific electrophysiological and anatomical parameters on the analytical results, in particular as manifested by specific functional signatures of visual cortex, including input-output sharpening, conductance invariance, virtual rotation and the tilt after effect. Importantly, qualitative differences between model behaviours point out consequences of various simplifications. The strategy may be applied to other neuronal systems with appropriate modifications.

                <p>by Kathryn E. Mangold, Wei Wang, Eric K. Johnson, Druv Bhagavan, Jonathan D. Moreno, Jeanne M. Nerbonne, Jonathan R. Silva</p>

Markov models of ion channel dynamics have evolved as experimental advances have improved our understanding of channel function. Past studies have examined limited sets of various topologies for Markov models of channel dynamics. We present a systematic method for identification of all possible Markov model topologies using experimental data for two types of native voltage-gated ion channel currents: mouse atrial sodium currents and human left ventricular fast transient outward potassium currents. Successful models identified with this approach have certain characteristics in common, suggesting that aspects of the model topology are determined by the experimental data. Incorporating these channel models into cell and tissue simulations to assess model performance within protocols that were not used for training provided validation and further narrowing of the number of acceptable models. The success of this approach suggests a channel model creation pipeline may be feasible where the structure of the model is not specified <i>a priori</i>.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Large-scale simulations of biological cell sorting driven by differential adhesion follow diffusion-limited domain coalescence regime</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Marc Durand</p>

Cell sorting, whereby a heterogeneous cell mixture segregates and forms distinct homogeneous tissues, is one of the main collective cell behaviors at work during development. Although differences in interfacial energies are recognized to be a possible driving source for cell sorting, no clear consensus has emerged on the kinetic law of cell sorting driven by differential adhesion. Using a modified Cellular Potts Model algorithm that allows for efficient simulations while preserving the connectivity of cells, we numerically explore cell-sorting dynamics over very large scales in space and time. For a binary mixture of cells surrounded by a medium, increase of domain size follows a power-law with exponent <i>n</i> = 1/4 independently of the mixture ratio, revealing that the kinetics is dominated by the diffusion and coalescence of rounded domains. We compare these results with recent numerical studies on cell sorting, and discuss the importance of algorithmic differences as well as boundary conditions on the observed scaling.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Molecular docking and dynamic simulation of conserved B cell epitope of SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein Indonesian isolates: an immunoinformatic approach [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: An immunoinformatic approach may be useful to investigate the conserved region in the spike glycoprotein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Indonesia isolates. The aim of this study was to investigate Indonesian SARS-CoV-2 isolates based on B cell epitopes by targeting the conserved regions in the spike glycoprotein to trigger increased multi-variant virus neutralization and memory response for the development of vaccine seed candidates. Methods: SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein gene sequences originating from Indonesia were compared with Wuhan (China), the United Kingdom, South Africa, India, the United States, and Brazil isolates obtained from the NCBI and GISAID databases. The recognition of antigens was carried out directly using B cells through the B cell receptor (BCR). An indirect B cell activation by Cluster of Differentiation (CD)4+ T cells and major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-II was predicted through the binding with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) based on IC50 value. In addition, vaccine allergenicity and toxicity were investigated. During the molecular complex examination, the 3D peptide structure was investigated and the lowest amount of energy formed when the vaccine candidate peptide bound to BCR and MHC-II was calculated. Results: As a result, the spike glycoprotein sequences of Indonesian SARS-CoV-2 isolates had conserved regions which were very similar to reference countries such as China, the United Kingdom, South Africa, India, the United States, and Brazil. Conclusion: It was predicted that the conserved regions could be identified as the epitope of B and T CD4+ cells that produced the peptides for vaccine candidate with antigenic, non-allergen, and non-toxic properties.

                Background: Vaccine hesitancy (VH) has been identified by the World Health Organization as one among the top ten threats to global public health. There is limited literature regarding VH from developing countries like India. Methods: In this facility based cross-sectional study, 172 mothers of under-five children were assessed regarding VH using the parental attitude towards childhood vaccination questionnaire (PACV). Results: The prevalence of VH was 3.4% (n=6). Only 7.6% (n=13) of the study participants had ever refused vaccination for their child and the most common reason cited for their refusal was that they thought it was not safe (n=6). Government health facilities was the place of routine immunization for 60.5% (n=104) participants. Health care providers (n =79, 46%) were the major source of information regarding vaccines. Conclusions: Our study highlights the presence of very low prevalence of VH in Mangalore compared to similar studies from India and other parts of the world. The limited number of participants had refused vaccination due to concerns related to vaccine safety.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A pragmatic trial of online interactive webtools for teaching biostatistics to first-year medical students: a constructivism-informed approach [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Statistical reasoning is an important clinical skill that informs evidence-based medicine and is desirable for 21st century practice. Yet many physicians struggle to apply biostatistical techniques correctly, potentially undermining patient care decision-making and adversely affecting outcomes. The overarching concepts of foundational biostatistics and probabilistic reasoning can be challenging to teach and hard for students to internalize given time constraints, lack of intrinsic motivation, and varied pre-existing knowledge or cognitive schema. We investigated how supplemental, interactive online webtools affected first-year medical students’ learning of sensitivity, specificity, negative/positive predictive values, and prevalence. Methods: Online webtool design was informed by constructivism and sought to have learners 1) build conceptual representations by connecting new information to existing knowledge, 2) interact with primary sources of biostatistical data, and 3) begin with whole concepts then explore component parts. A total of 59 students were assigned randomly to two cohorts that had access to the webtools before or after in-class teaching; an additional 35 students had no access and served as the control cohort. Access metrics, summative exam scores, prior knowledge measurements, and qualitative data on learners’ experiences from three focus groups (n = 6/group) were collected. Results: Mean exam scores were 87.5 ± 10.8%, 90.7 ± 11.2%, and 88.9 7 ±12.9% for the before, after, and control cohorts (p = 0.49). Students repeatedly accessed the online webtools: mean access was 4.3 (± 2.6) (before) and 2.6 (± 1.5) (after). Qualitative data showed the webtools facilitated learning in a time-efficient manner. Conclusions: Online interactive webtools facilitated a constructivism-informed learning model and were found by first-year medical student to supplement and enhance their learning experience without detracting from established biostatistical teaching or negatively affecting summative assessment outcomes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Conceptual design of smart multi-farm produce dehydrator using a low-cost programmable logic controller and raspberry pi [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Acceptable food processing techniques require the removal of water contents from the crop or food sample without destroying the nutritional qualities of the food sample. This poses a strict requirement on the dehydrator or oven that will be used in the dehydrating techniques to have the ability to control both temperature and humidity of its drying chamber. Methods: This work centres on how an autonomous multi-farm produce dehydrator that can also serve as an oven can be designed with a raspberry pi and a low-cost programmable logic controller (PLC). The dehydrator gives the users the flexibility to control both the drying chamber’s temperature and humidity from its web interface via a mobile device or the dehydrator’s HMI. Heat energy from the Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) is used so that the dehydrator can be readily available for commercial or industrial use.  The small electricity required to power the electronics devices is obtained from the hybrid power solution with an electric energy source from either the mains electricity supply or solar.. The design was tested by creating an operation profile from the proposed web application for the dehydrator. The operation trend was analysed from the web application’s Trendlines page. Results: The report showed that both the temperature and humidity of the dehydrator could be controlled, and access to historical operation data will give insight to the user on how to create a better operation profile. Conclusion: The setup described in this work, when implemented was able to produce a dehydrator/oven whose temperature and humidity can be perfectly controlled and its generated heat is evenly distributed in its drying chamber to ensure efficient and effective drying techniques use in crop preservation and food processing.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Pulsed administration for physiological estrogen replacement in mice [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Estrogens are important regulators of body physiology and have major effects on metabolism, bone, the immune- and central nervous systems. The specific mechanisms underlying the effects of estrogens on various cells, tissues and organs are unclear and mouse models constitute a powerful experimental tool to define the physiological and pathological properties of estrogens. Menopause can be mimicked in animal models by surgical removal of the ovaries and replacement therapy with 17β-estradiol in ovariectomized (OVX) mice is a common technique used to determine specific effects of the hormone. However, these studies are complicated by the non-monotonic dose-response of estradiol, when given as therapy. Increased knowledge of how to distribute estradiol in terms of solvent, dose, and administration frequency, is required in order to accurately mimic physiological conditions in studies where estradiol treatment is performed. In this study, mice were OVX and treated with physiological doses of 17β-estradiol-3-benzoate (E2) dissolved in miglyol or PBS. Subcutaneous injections were performed every 4 days to resemble the estrus cycle in mice. Results show that OVX induces an osteoporotic phenotype, fat accumulation and impairment of the locomotor ability, as expected. Pulsed administration of physiological doses of E2 dissolved in miglyol rescues the phenotypes induced by OVX. However, when E2 is dissolved in PBS the effects are less pronounced, possibly due to rapid wash out of the steroid.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Early detection of macrovascular complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus in Medan, North Sumatera, Indonesia: A cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Macrovascular complications occur very frequently in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with a high mortality rate, due to the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD), such as stroke, atherosclerosis acceleration, and atrial fibrillation. T2DM is a significant risk factor for CVD and has become the leading cause of death. The purpose of this study was to detect the early risk of macrovascular complications by using the ankle brachial index (ABI) as a marker. Methods: This study was an analytic study with a cross-sectional approach. The study population was patients with T2DM from several primary health care centers in Medan. In total, 89 subjects who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were recruited with consecutive sampling. ABI was determined as the ratio of systolic blood pressure in the brachial artery to the posterior tibial artery after the subjects had been relaxed and felt comfortable in a supine position. Examination of vitamin D and lipid profile was derived from examination of venous blood.  Data were processed using SPSS and analyzed with one-way ANOVA. Results: The study found that there was a relationship between LDL-C, triglyceride, and vitamin D (25OH-D) based on the ABI (p > 0.05). Conclusions: ABI can be used for an early detection of macrovascular complications. Apart from being easy to perform, ABI was non-invasive. Some other risk factors that can also be used to assess complications and have relationships with ABI were LDL-C, triglyceride, and vitamin D (25OH-D). Complications in T2DM patients can be prevented with reasonable blood sugar control and lifestyle changes. Education and motivation need to be given to patients so that they become more independent in controlling their disease and improving their quality of life.

                Early marriage practices undermine girls’ autonomy and seriously affect their physical and mental wellbeing. Monitoring the trends and understanding the drivers is essential in intervening against early marriage. However, many studies on early marriage in Ethiopia are cross-sectional, focusing only on the magnitude at a single point in time. Hence, we extracted data of girls of 10-17 years from Kersa Health and Demographic Surveillance System (Kersa HDSS) database for the period of 2008–2018 in order to examine the trends of early marriage. In this data note we provide the details of a research database of 24,452 girls in the age group of 10-17 years. The extracted data include date of marriage and the girls’ socio-demographic variables. Other variables considered to be potentially associated with timing of marriage were also extracted. The purpose of this publication is to describe the dataset for external researchers who may be interested in making use of it as a secondary use of their routinely collected data. This dataset is available at   https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.15034812.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Comparison of cell size, chlorophyll fluorescence and cadmium (Cd2+) bioaccumulation between wild-type and mutant strains of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii upon exposure to Cd2 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Heavy metal contamination presents a constant threat to biological systems. Simultaneously, heavy metals have become one of the major contaminants in the aquatic ecosystems. In this regard, the investigation of heavy metal-tolerance genes in algae is relevant. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a unicellular green alga, and an excellent model organism used in heavy metal studies. In C. reinhardtii, a novel gene designated as Cia7, was hypothesized to play a role in heavy metal homeostasis due to CIA7’s conserved cysteine-residue motif. This study compared two strains of C. reinhardtii, cc4425, the wild-type with the functional CIA7 protein and cc5013, the mutant strain with the disrupted cia7- gene. The hypothesis was that the expression of Cia7 contributes to an increased cadmium (Cd)-tolerance in C. reinhardtii. The Cd-tolerance would be described by physiological markers of microalgae health, and by intracellular accumulation of the metal. Methods: The objectives of this study were (1) to compare chlorophyll fluorescence and cell size in cc4425 and cc5013 exposed to Cd2+, and (2) to compare Cd2+ bioaccumulation in cc4425 and cc5013 strains in different growth media. Flow cytometry, and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) analysis were performed. Results: There was no significant statistical difference in Cd2+ bioaccumulation between the two strains, cc4425 and cc5013, regardless of growth media. However, a statistically significant difference in Cd2+ bioaccumulation (p<0.0001) was determined between the media (with acetate and without acetate).  The cia7- mutant, cc5013 was found to be more susceptible to a Cd2+-induced decrease in chlorophyll fluorescence and had a reduced cell size compared to cc4425, the wild-type strain. Conclusions: These observed differences between the strains suggest that CIA7’s biological activity could play a direct or indirect role in increasing Cd tolerance in C. reinhardtii.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">DNase treatment prevents CSF block in early experimental pneumococcal meningitis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p><i>S. pneumoniae</i> is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis, a disease that, despite treatment with antibiotics, still is associated with a high mortality and morbidity worldwide. Diffuse brain swelling is a leading cause of morbidity in <i>S. pneumoniae</i> meningitis. We hypothesized that neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) disrupt CSF transport by the glymphatic system and contribute to edema formation in <i>S. pneumoniae</i> meningitis.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used DNase I treatment to disrupt NETs and then assessed glymphatic function by cisterna magna injections of CSF tracers in a rat model of <i>S. pneumoniae</i> meningitis.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Our analysis showed that CSF influx into the brain parenchyma, as well as CSF drainage to the cervical lymph nodes, were significantly reduced in the rat model of <i>S. pneumoniae</i> meningitis. Degrading neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) by DNase treatment restored glymphatic transport and eliminated the increase in brain weight in the rats. In contrast, first-line antibiotic treatment had no such effect on restoring fluid dynamics.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study suggests that CSF accumulation is responsible for cerebral edema formation and identifies the glymphatic system and NETs as possible new treatment targets in <i>S. pneumoniae</i> meningitis.</p>

                Most SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are based on the spike antigen alone, and it is unknown if including other viral antigens improves protection. Dangi et al. show that combining a spike vaccine with a nucleocapsid vaccine improves the control of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, warranting the inclusion of nucleocapsid in next-generation SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.

                Natural killer (NK) cells are essential for early protection against virus infection, and must metabolically adapt to the energy demands of activation. Here, we found upregulation of the metabolic adaptor hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is a feature of mouse NK cells during murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection <i>in vivo</i>. HIF-1 α -deficient NK cells failed to control viral load, causing increased morbidity. No defects were found in effector functions of HIF-1α KO NK cells however, their numbers were significantly reduced. Loss of HIF-1 α did not affect NK cell proliferation during <i>in vivo</i> infection and <i>in vitro</i> cytokine stimulation. Instead, we found HIF-1α -deficient NK cells showed increased expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim and glucose metabolism was impaired during cytokine stimulation <i>in vitro</i>. Similarly, during MCMV infection HIF-1α -deficient NK cells upregulated Bim and had increased caspase activity. Thus, NK cells require HIF-1α-dependent metabolic functions to repress Bim expression and sustain cell numbers for an optimal virus response.

                Peripheral and intraspinal feedback is required to shape and update the output of spinal networks that execute motor behavior. We report that lumbar dI2 spinal interneurons in chicks receive synaptic input from afferents and premotor neurons. These interneurons innervate contralateral premotor networks in the lumbar and brachial spinal cord, and their ascending projections innervate the cerebellum. These findings suggest that dI2 neurons function as interneurons in local lumbar circuits, are involved in lumbo-brachial coupling, and that part of them deliver peripheral and intraspinal feedback to the cerebellum. Silencing of dI2 neurons leads to destabilized stepping in P8 hatchlings, with occasional collapses, variable step profiles and a wide-base walking gait, suggesting that dI2 neurons may contribute to the stabilization of the bipedal gait.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Spatially patterned excitatory neuron subtypes and projections of the claustrum</a></h4>

              
                The claustrum is a functionally and structurally complex brain region, whose very spatial extent remains debated. Histochemical-based approaches typically treat the claustrum as a relatively narrow anatomical region that primarily projects to the neocortex, whereas circuit-based approaches can suggest a broader claustrum region containing projections to the neocortex and other regions. Here, in the mouse, we took a bottom-up and cell-type-specific approach to complement and possibly unite these seemingly disparate conclusions. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing, we found that the claustrum comprises two excitatory neuron subtypes that are differentiable from the surrounding cortex. Multicolor retrograde tracing in conjunction with 12-channel multiplexed in situ hybridization revealed a core-shell spatial arrangement of these subtypes, as well as differential downstream targets. Thus, the claustrum comprises excitatory neuron subtypes with distinct molecular and projection properties, whose spatial patterns reflect the narrower and broader claustral extents debated in previous research. This subtype-specific heterogeneity likely shapes the functional complexity of the claustrum.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A CTP-dependent gating mechanism enables ParB spreading on DNA</a></h4>

              
                Proper chromosome segregation is essential in all living organisms. The ParA-ParB-<i>parS</i> system is widely employed for chromosome segregation in bacteria. Previously, we showed that <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i> ParB requires cytidine triphosphate to escape the nucleation site <i>parS</i> and spread by sliding to the neighboring DNA (Jalal et al., 2020). Here, we provide the structural basis for this transition from nucleation to spreading by solving co-crystal structures of a C-terminal domain truncated <i>C. crescentus</i> ParB with <i>parS</i> and with a CTP analog. Nucleating ParB is an open clamp, in which <i>parS</i> is captured at the DNA-binding domain (the DNA-gate). Upon binding CTP, the N-terminal domain (NTD) self-dimerizes to close the NTD-gate of the clamp. The DNA-gate also closes, thus driving <i>parS</i> into a compartment between the DNA-gate and the C-terminal domain. CTP hydrolysis and/or the release of hydrolytic products are likely associated with reopening of the gates to release DNA and recycle ParB. Overall, we suggest a CTP-operated gating mechanism that regulates ParB nucleation, spreading, and recycling.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Single-cell RNA analysis identifies pre-migratory neural crest cells expressing markers of differentiated derivatives</a></h4>

              
                The neural crest is a migratory population of stem-like cells that contribute to multiple traits including the bones of the skull, peripheral nervous system, and pigment. How neural crest cells differentiate into diverse cell types is a fundamental question in the study of vertebrate biology. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize transcriptional changes associated with neural crest cell development in the zebrafish trunk during the early stages of migration. We show that neural crest cells are transcriptionally diverse and identify pre-migratory populations already expressing genes associated with differentiated derivatives, specifically in the xanthophore lineage. Further, we identify a population of Rohon–Beard neurons in the data. The data presented identify novel genetic markers for multiple trunk neural crest cell populations and Rohon–Beard neurons providing insight into previously uncharacterized genes critical for vertebrate development.

                Diversity within microglia, the resident brain immune cells, is reported. Whether microglial subsets constitute different subtypes with intrinsic properties and unique functions has not been fully elucidated. Here, we describe a microglial subtype characterized by the expression of the enzyme Arginase-1, i.e. Arg1+microglia, which is found predominantly in the cholinergic neuron-rich forebrain region during early postnatal development. Arg1+ microglia are frequently observed in close apposition to neurons and exhibit a distinct molecular signature including upregulation of genes such as Apoe, Clec7a, Igf1, Lgals3 and Mgl2. Arg1-knockout in microglia results in a deficient cholinergic innervation along with impaired dendritic spine maturation in the hippocampus where cholinergic neurons project, impaired long-term potentiation and cognitive behavioural deficiencies in female mice. Our results expand on microglia diversity and provide insights into distinctive spatiotemporal functions exerted by microglial subtypes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Adolescent development of multiscale cortical wiring and functional connectivity in the human connectome</a></h4>

              
                Adolescence is a time of profound changes in the structural wiring of the brain and maturation of large-scale functional interactions. Here, we analyzed structural and functional brain network development in an accelerated longitudinal cohort spanning 14-25 years (n = 199). Core to our work was an advanced model of cortical wiring that incorporates multimodal MRI features of (i) cortico-cortical proximity, (ii) microstructural similarity, and (iii) diffusion tractography. Longitudinal analyses assessing age-related changes in cortical wiring during adolescence identified increases in cortical wiring within attention and default-mode networks, as well as between transmodal and attention, and sensory and limbic networks, indicative of a continued differentiation of cortico-cortical structural networks. Cortical wiring changes were statistically independent from age-related cortical thinning seen in the same subjects. Conversely, resting-state functional MRI analysis in the same subjects indicated an increasing segregation of sensory and transmodal systems during adolescence, with age-related reductions in their functional connectivity alongside with an increase in structural wiring distance. Our findings provide new insights into adolescent brain network development, illustrating how the maturation of structural wiring interacts with the development of macroscale network function.

                We previously identified Transmembrane and Coiled-Coil 2 (TMCC2) as a protein that forms complexes with both apolipoprotein E (apoE) and the amyloid protein precursor (APP) and which displayed differential affinity for apoE isoforms apoE3 and apoE4. Here we have for the first time examined TMCC2 in the human brain and found that it is affected by APOE genotype and brain region. We further observed that TMCC2 associates with the pathology of Alzheimer's disease in dense core and neuritic plaques. TMCC2 is therefore positioned to mediate impacts of apoE4 on Alzheimer's disease pathology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The cytokine receptor Fn14 regulates neuronal transcription during development and brain function in the adult</a></h4>

              
                Cytokine signaling between microglia and neurons is required for synapse elimination during brain development, but the mechanisms by which neurons respond to microglia-derived cytokines remain to be fully defined. Here, we demonstrate that microglia are necessary for sensory experience-dependent synapse elimination in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of the mouse, a process previously shown to be mediated by the microglia-derived cytokine TWEAK and its neuronal receptor Fn14. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing in mice lacking Fn14 or TWEAK at the height of experience-dependent refinement revealed that TWEAK-Fn14 signaling coordinates robust programs of gene expression in excitatory thalamocortical neurons of the dLGN. Gene targets of TWEAK and Fn14 are enriched for regulators of synapse and chromatin remodeling, suggesting that TWEAK-Fn14 signaling coordinates neuronal transcription to promote circuit refinement and epigenomic maturation in response to experience. We further find that Fn14 expression is not restricted to the dLGN but extends to other brain regions as well, both during development and in the adult. Consistent with the expression of Fn14 outside of the visual system, Fn14 knockout mice show significant impairments in multiple tests of memory task proficiency. At baseline, loss of Fn14 does not affect macroscopic neural activity measured by electroencephalogram recordings in vivo. However, mice lacking Fn14 displayed worse seizure outcomes and were less likely to survive when seizures were pharmacologically induced. Thus, TWEAK-Fn14 signaling coordinates neuronal transcription during development and contributes to cognitive function in the adult. Taken together, these data reveal that molecular pathways associated with inflammation in the periphery can coordinate with sensory experience to shape neural connectivity across the lifespan.

	<p>With the development of intensive care technology, the number of patients who survive acute severe brain injury has increased significantly. At present, it is difficult to diagnose the patients with disorders of consciousness (DOCs) because motor responses in these patients may be very limited and inconsistent. Electrophysiological criteria, such as event-related potentials or motor imagery, have also been studied to establish a diagnosis and prognosis based on command-following or active paradigms. However, the use of such task-based techniques in DOC patients is methodologically complex and requires careful analysis and interpretation. The present paper focuses on the analysis of sleep patterns for the evaluation of DOC and its relationships with diagnosis and prognosis outcomes. We discuss the concepts of sleep patterns in patients suffering from DOC, identification of this challenging population, and the prognostic value of sleep. The available literature on individuals in an unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) or minimally conscious state (MCS) following traumatic or nontraumatic severe brain injury is reviewed. We can distinguish patients with different levels of consciousness by studying sleep patients with DOC. Most MCS patients have sleep and wake alternations, sleep spindles and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, while UWS patients have few EEG changes. A large number of sleep spindles and organized sleep–wake patterns predict better clinical outcomes. It is expected that this review will promote our understanding of sleep EEG in DOC.</p>

	<p>This perspective piece reviews the clinical condition of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is currently increasing due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and recent research illustrating how olfaction is being incorporated into virtual reality (VR) platforms. I then discuss the latest work examining the potential of olfactory virtual reality (OVR) for the treatment of PTSD. From this foundation I suggest novel ways in which OVR may be implemented in PTSD therapy and harnessed for preventing the development of PTSD. Perceptual and chemical features of olfaction that should be considered in OVR applications are also discussed.</p>

	<p>The memory-guided saccade task requires the remembrance of a peripheral target location, whilst inhibiting the urge to make a saccade ahead of an auditory cue. The literature has explored the endophenotypic deficits associated with differences in target laterality, but less is known about target amplitude. The data presented came from Crawford et al. (1995), employing a memory-guided saccade task among neuroleptically medicated and non-medicated patients with schizophrenia (n = 31, n = 12), neuroleptically medicated and non-medicated bipolar affective disorder (n = 12, n = 17), and neurotypical controls (n = 30). The current analyses explore the relationships between memory-guided saccades toward targets with different eccentricities (7.5° and 15°), the discernible behaviour exhibited amongst diagnostic groups, and cohorts distinguished based on psychotic symptomatology. Saccade gain control and final eye position were reduced among medicated-schizophrenia patients. These metrics were reduced further among targets with greater amplitudes (15°), indicating greater deficit. The medicated cohort exhibited reduced gain control and final eye positions in both amplitudes compared to the non-medicated cohort, with deficits markedly observed for the furthest targets. No group differences in symptomatology (positive and negative) were reported, however, a greater deficit was observed toward the larger amplitude. This suggests that within the memory-guided saccade paradigm, diagnostic classification is more prominent in characterising disparities in saccade performance than symptomatology.</p>

	<p>Cerebral palsy (CP) diagnosis is historically late, at between 12 and 24 months. We aimed to determine diagnosis age, fidelity to recommended tests and acceptability to parents and referrers of an early diagnosis clinic to implement a recent evidence-based clinical guideline for the early diagnosis of CP. A prospective observational case series of infants &amp;amp;lt;12 months with detectable risks for CP attending our clinic was completed with data analysed cross-sectionally. Infants had a high risk of CP diagnosis at a mean age of 4.4 (standard deviation [SD] 2.3) months and CP diagnosis at 8.5 [4.1] months. Of the 109 infants seen, 57% had a diagnosis of CP or high risk of CP, showing high specificity to our inclusion criteria. Parent and referrer acceptability of the clinic was high. Paediatricians had the highest rate of referral (39%) followed by allied health (31%), primary carer (14%) and other health workers (16%). Fidelity to the guideline was also high. All infants referred &amp;amp;lt;5 mths had the General Movements Assessment (GMA) and all except one had the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE) administered. N = 92 (84%) of infants seen had neuroimaging, including n = 53 (49%) who had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), showing recommended tests are feasible. Referral to CP-specific interventions was at 4.7 [3.0] months, sometimes before referral to clinic. Clinicians can be confident CP can be diagnosed well under 12 months using recommended tools. This clinic model is acceptable to parents and referrers and supports access to CP-specific early interventions when they are likely to be most effective.</p>

                Hyperbolic disc embedding and k-core percolation reveal the core structure of the functional connectivity on resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI). Inter-voxel relations were visualized on embedded hyperbolic discs, and their core composition was traced using k-core percolation. Using rsfMRI data of 180 normal adults from the Human Connectome Project database, scale-free intervoxel connectivity represented by IC-voxels composition, while visualized on hyperbolic discs using [S]1/[H]2 model, showed the expected change of the largest component decreasing its size on k-core percolation eventually yielding the core structures of individuals. This kmax-core voxels-ICs composition revealed such stereotypes of individuals as visual network dominant, default mode network dominant, and distributed patterns. Characteristic core structures of resting-state brain connectivity of normal subjects disclosed the distributed or asymmetric contribution of voxels to the kmax-core, which suggests the hierarchical dominance of certain IC subnetworks characteristic to subgroups of individuals at rest.

                Hyperventilation reliably provokes seizures in patients diagnosed with absence epilepsy. Despite this predictable patient response, the mechanisms that enable hyperventilation to powerfully activate absence seizure-generating circuits remain entirely unknown. Using the WAG/Rij rat, an established rodent model of absence epilepsy, we demonstrate that absence seizures are highly sensitive to arterial carbon dioxide, suggesting that seizure-generating circuits are sensitive to pH. Moreover, hyperventilation consistently activated neurons within the intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus, a structure implicated in seizure generation. We show that intralaminar thalamus also contains pH-sensitive neurons. Collectively, these observations suggest that hyperventilation activates pH-sensitive neurons of the intralaminar nuclei to provoke absence seizures.

                Progressive physiological changes in the hippocampal dentate gyrus circuits following traumatic brain injury contribute to temporal evolution of neurological sequelae. Although early posttraumatic changes in dentate synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA currents have been reported, whether they evolve over time and remain distinct between the two projection neuron classes, granule cells and semilunar granule cells, has not been evaluated. We examined changes in tonic GABA currents and spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) and in dentate projection neurons one and three month after moderate concussive fluid percussion injury (FPI) in adolescent rats. Granule cell tonic GABA current amplitude remained elevated up to one month after FPI, but decreased to levels comparable to age-matched controls by three months postinjury. Granule cell sIPSC frequency, which we previously reported to be increased one week after FPI, remained higher than in age-matched controls at one month and was significantly reduced three months after FPI. In contrast to the early decrease, tonic GABA current amplitude and sIPSC frequency in semilunar granule cell was not different from controls three months after FPI. The switch in granule cell inhibitory inputs from early increase to subsequent decrease could contribute to the delayed emergence of cognitive deficits and seizure susceptibility after brain injury.

                The perception of two (or more) simultaneous musical notes, depending on their pitch interval(s), could be broadly categorized as consonant or dissonant. Previous studies have suggested that musicians and non-musicians adopt different strategies when discerning music intervals: the frequency ratio (perfect fifth or tritone) for the former, and frequency differences (e.g., roughness vs. non-roughness) for the latter. To extend and replicate this previous finding, in this follow-up study we reran the ElectroEncephaloGraphy (EEG) experiment, and separately collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of the same protocol. The behavioral results replicated our previous findings that musicians used pitch intervals and nonmusicians roughness for consonant judgments. And the ERP amplitude differences between groups in both frequency ratio and frequency differences were primarily around N1 and P2 periods along the midline channels. The fMRI results, with the joint analyses by univariate, multivariate, and connectivity approaches, further reinforce the involvement of midline and related-brain regions in consonant/dissonance judgments. Additional representational similarity analysis (or RSA), and the final spatio-temporal searchlight RSA (or ss-RSA), jointly combined the fMRI-EEG into the same representational space, providing final support on the neural substrates of neurophysiological signatures. Together, these analyses not just exemplify the importance of replication, that musicians rely more on top-down knowledge for consonance/dissonance perception; but also demonstrate the advantages of multiple analyses in constraining the findings from both EEG and fMRI.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spatio-temporally efficient coding assigns functions to hierarchical structures of the visual system</a></h4>

              
                Hierarchical structures constitute a wide array of brain areas, including the visual system. One of the important questions regarding visual hierarchical structures is to identify computational principles for assigning functions that represent the external world to hierarchical structures of the visual system. Given that visual hierarchical structures contain both bottom-up and top-down pathways, the derived principles should encompass these bidirectional pathways. However, existing principles such as predictive coding do not provide an effective principle for bidirectional pathways. Therefore, we propose a novel computational principle for visual hierarchical structures as spatio-temporally efficient coding underscored by the efficient use of given resources in both neural activity space and processing time. This coding principle optimises bidirectional predictions over hierarchical structures by simultaneously minimising temporally differences in neural responses and maximising entropy in neural representations. Simulations demonstrated that the proposed spatio-temporally efficient coding was able to assign the function of appropriate neural representations of natural visual scenes to visual hierarchical structures. Furthermore, spatio-temporally efficient coding was able to predict well-known phenomena, including deviations in neural responses to unfamiliar inputs and bias in preferred orientations. Our proposed spatio-temporally efficient coding may facilitate deeper mechanistic understanding of the computational processes of hierarchical brain structures.

                Individual heterogeneity within societies provides opportunities to test hypotheses about adaptive neural investment in the context of group cooperation. Here we explore neural investment in defense specialist soldiers of the eusocial stingless bee (Tetragonisca angustula) which are age sub-specialized on distinct defense tasks, and have an overall higher lifetime task repertoire than other sterile workers within the colony. Consistent with predicted behavioral demands, soldiers had higher relative visual (optic lobe) investment than non-soldiers but only during the period when they were performing the most visually demanding defense task (hovering guarding). As soldiers aged into the less visually demanding task of standing guarding this difference disappeared. Neural investment was otherwise similar across all colony members. Despite having larger task repertoires, soldiers had similar absolute brain size and smaller relative brain size compared to other workers, meaning that lifetime task repertoire size was a poor predictor of brain size. Together, our results are consistent with the specialized but flexible defense strategies of this species, broadening our understanding of how neurobiology mediates age and morphological task specialization in highly cooperative societies.

                Exaggerated arousal and dysregulated emotion-memory interactions are key pathological dysregulations that accompany the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Current treatments for PTSD are of moderate efficacy and preventing the dysregulations already during exposure to threatening events may attenuate the development of PTSD-symptomatology. The present proof-of-concept study examined the potential of a single dose of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) antagonist losartan (LT) to attenuate the mnemonic advantage of threatening stimuli and the underlying neural mechanism. In a preregistered double-blind, between-subject, placebo-controlled pharmaco-fMRI study we combined an emotional subsequent memory paradigm with LT (n=29) or placebo treatment (n=30) and a surprise memory test after 24h washout. LT generally improved memory performance and abolished emotional memory enhancement for negative yet not positive material while emotional experience during encoding remained intact. LT further suppressed the hippocampus activity during encoding of subsequently remembered negative stimuli and abolished the positive association between higher activity in this region and subsequent better memory for negative material observed under placebo. On the network level LT reduced coupling between the hippocampus and the basolateral amygdala during successful encoding of negative stimuli. Overall, our findings suggest that LT has the potential to selectively attenuate memory formation for negative yet not positive information by decreasing hippocampus activity and its functional coupling strength with the left amygdala. These findings suggest a promising potential of LT to prevent preferential encoding and remembering of negative events, a mechanism that could prevent the emotion-memory dysregulations underlying the development of PTSD-symptomatology.

                The anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN), a central node in a complex memory system, process spatial and temporal memory. Here, we show that ATN lesions do not affect acquisition of a simple odour discrimination or a simple object discrimination in a runway apparatus. The same procedures were used to test learning of an arbitrary association between non-spatial object-odour pairings (A+X or B+Y were rewarded; but not A+Y or B+X). If ATN lesions recapitulate hippocampal function, specifically CA1 function, then they should disrupt acquisition only when an explicit delay (i.e., a 10-second trace) is inserted between the odour and object. Acquisition was completely abolished by ATN lesions, irrespective of the presence of the temporal trace, and despite extensive training (50x12-trial sessions). Faster acquisition with the 10-second trace was found in the sham-lesion rats. During recall, 5 days after criterion, sham rats but not ATN-lesion rats showed elevated Zif268 expression in hippocampal CA1 for the trace compared to no-trace condition; both sham and lesion rats tested in the trace condition showed increased IEG expression in the superficial layers of the prefrontal cortex and retrosplenial cortex. ATN lesions markedly reduced Zif268 expression in the prefrontal cortex and retrosplenial cortex. This is the first evidence that ATN lesions impair non-spatial paired-associate tasks. The findings suggest that the ATN influence memory beyond time and space, and constitute a critical neural structure for learning arbitrary associations even in the task version that is not disrupted by hippocampal lesions.

                Human vision is still largely unexplained. Computer vision made impressive progress on this front, but it is unclear to what extent artificial neural networks approximate human brain strategies. Here, we confirm this gap by testing how biological and artificial systems encode object-scene contextual regularities in natural images. Both systems represent these regularities, but the underlying information processing is markedly different. In human vision, objects and backgrounds are represented separately, with rich domain-specific representations characterizing human visual cortex. Interaction between these components occurs downstream in frontoparietal areas. Conversely, neural networks represent image components in a single entangled representation revealing reduced object-segregation abilities and impoverished domain-specific object spaces. These results show the uniqueness of human vision that allows understanding that images are not just a collection of features and points to the need for developing neural network models with a similar richness of representational content.

                Angelman Syndrome (AS) is a genetic neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by developmental delay, lack of speech, seizures, intellectual disability, and walking and balance disorders. Recently, motor ability became an interesting outcome measure in AS, as it is broad including ataxia, hypotonia, delayed and abnormal walking and postural movements and affects nearly every individual with AS. We predict that gait presents a strong opportunity for rigorous, reliable, and quantitative metrics with direct translation to evaluate pharmacological, dietary, and genetic therapies. Numerous motoric deficits have been identified clinically. In this study, we used an innovative, automated gait analysis as well as gold standard motor behavioral assays to further delineate components of motor, coordination, balance, and gait impairments in an AS mouse model across development. Our study demonstrated marked global motoric deficits in AS mice, corroborating many previous reports. Uniquely, this is the first report of nuanced and pertinent aberrations in quantitative spatial and temporal components of gait between AS and wildtype littermate controls, that are analogous in AS individuals. These metrics were followed longitudinally to observe the progression of maladaptive gait in AS, a clinical phenotype. This has not been reported previously and contributes a substantial novel metric for therapeutic development. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the robust translational value in the study of nuanced motor outcomes, i.e., gait, for AS, as well as similar genetic syndromes, in the endeavor of therapeutic screening.

                Scientific studies often require assessment of similarity between ordered sets of values. Each set, containing one value for every dimension or class of data, can be conveniently represented as a vector. The commonly used metrics for vector similarity include angle-based metrics, such as cosine similarity or Pearson correlation, which compare the relative patterns of values, and distance-based metrics, such as the Euclidean distance, which compare the magnitudes of values. Here we evaluate a newly proposed metric, pairwise relative distance (PRED), which considers both relative patterns and magnitudes to provide a single measure of vector similarity. PRED essentially reveals whether the vectors are so similar that their values across the classes are separable. By comparing PRED to other common metrics in a variety of applications, we show that PRED provides a stable chance level irrespective of the number of classes, is invariant to global translation and scaling operations on data, has high dynamic range and low variability in handling noisy data, and can handle multi-dimensional data, as in the case of vectors containing temporal or population responses for each class. We also found that PRED can be adapted to function as a reliable metric of class separability even for datasets that lack the vector structure and simply contain multiple values for each class.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rapid fluctuations in functional connectivity of cortical networks encode spontaneous behavior</a></h4>

              
                Experimental work across a variety of species has demonstrated that spontaneously generated behaviors are robustly coupled to variation in neural activity within the cerebral cortex. Indeed, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data suggest that functional connectivity in cortical networks varies across distinct behavioral states, providing for the dynamic reorganization of patterned activity. However, these studies generally lack the temporal resolution to establish links between cortical signals and the continuously varying fluctuations in spontaneous behavior typically observed in awake animals. Here, we took advantage of recent developments in wide-field, mesoscopic calcium imaging to monitor neural activity across the neocortex of awake mice. Applying a novel approach to quantifying time-varying functional connectivity, we show that spontaneous behaviors are more accurately represented by fast changes in the correlational structure versus the magnitude of large-scale network activity. Moreover, dynamic functional connectivity reveals subnetworks that are not predicted by traditional anatomical atlas-based parcellation of the cortex. These results provide insight into how behavioral information is represented across the mammalian neocortex and demonstrate a new analytical framework for investigating time-varying functional connectivity in neural networks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Group-level inference of information-based measures for the analyses of cognitive brain networks from neurophysiological data</a></h4>

              
                The reproducibility crisis in neuroimaging and in particular in the case of underpowered studies has introduced doubts on our ability to reproduce, replicate and generalize findings. As a response, we have seen the emergence of suggested guidelines and principles for neuroscientists known as Good Scientific Practice for conducting more reliable research. Still, every study remains almost unique in its combination of analytical and statistical approaches. While it is understandable considering the diversity of designs and brain data recording, it also represents a striking point against reproducibility. Here, we propose a non-parametric permutation-based statistical framework, primarily designed for neurophysiological data, in order to perform group-level inferences on non-negative measures of information encompassing metrics from information-theory, machine-learning or measures of distances. The framework supports both fixed- and random-effect models to adapt to inter-individuals and inter-sessions variability. Using numerical simulations, we compared the accuity in ground-truth retrieving of both group models, such as test- and cluster-wise corrections for multiple comparisons. We then reproduced and extended existing results using both spatially uniform MEG and non-uniform intracranial neurophysiological data. We showed how the framework can be used to extract stereotypical task- and behavior-related effects across the population covering scales from the local level of brain regions, inter-areal functional connectivity to measures summarizing network properties. We also present a open-source Python toolbox called Frites that includes all of the methods used here, from functional connectivity estimations to the extraction of cognitive brain networks. Taken together, we believe that this framework deserves careful attention as its robustness and flexibility could be the starting point toward the uniformization of statistical approaches.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Effects Of Video Games On Executive Control, Aggression and Gaming Motivation</a></h4>

              
                With the advancements of computer technology and accessible internet, playing video games has become immensely popular across all age groups. Increasing research talks about the cognitive benefits of Video Games. At the same time, video games are stereotyped as an activity for the lazy and unproductive. Within this backdrop, our study aims to understand the effect of video games on Executive control (Visual Scanning and Visual Perception), Aggression, and Gaming Motivation. Twenty non-gamers were selected and divided into two groups: Action Video Game Players (AVGP) and Non-Action Video Game Players NAVGP). We used two computerized tests: Gabor Orientation Identification Test and Visual Scanning Test (to assess visual perception and visual scanning, respectively) and two questionnaires (to assess aggression and gaming motivation). We found an improvement in visual perception as well as visual scanning following video game training in AVGPs. Interestingly, aggression did not increase with an increase in video game exposure. We also found insignificant changes in gaming motivation after the training, except for self-gratification motives. Cognitive improvements do not relate to action video games alone, but non-action video games also show promising results to enhance cognition. With better timed and controlled training with video games, aggression as a prospective consequence of video game exposure can also be controlled. We propose targeted video game training as an approach to enhance cognition in non-gamers.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Clock genes Period1 and Period2 in the hippocampal CA1 mediate depression-like behaviors and rapid antidepressant response</a></h4>

              
                Accumulated reports have indicated that circadian rhythm is closely related to the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder (MDD). Recently, adenosine has been identified to modulate circadian clock via adenosine A1 and A2A receptor signaling pathways. Cyclic AMP-response element binding protein (CREB) is a convergent point that plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of depression and is a downstream molecule of adenosine A1 receptor signaling pathway as an endpoint that can regulate the expression of circadian genes Period1 (Per1) and Period2 (Per2). However, whether Per mediates the development of MDD via CREB has not been elucidated. We used chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) to induce depression-like behaviors and found that it could induce decrease in p-CREB and PER1 levels in the hippocampal CA1 region in rats. Both depression-like behaviors and the decreased protein levels could be rapidly rescued by the administration of adenosine A1 receptor agonist 2-Choro-N6-cyclopentyladenosine (CCPA). Furthermore, knockdown of Per1 in hippocampal CA1 region could also induce depression-like behaviors, which could also be rescued by CCPA. Interestingly, Per2 knockdown in hippocampal CA1 region resulted in potential antidepressant-like effect. In addition, knockout of CRE sequence in the promoter regions of either Per1 or Per2 led to depression-like behaviors, which could not be rescued by CCPA. These results indicated that clock genes Per1 and Per2 play critical roles in the pathophysiology of depression and CRE sequences in the promoter regions of Per1 and Per2 may be a critical antidepressant target.

	<p>Fibromyalgia is related to central sensitization syndrome (CSS) and is associated with chronic pain and a decrease in general health. The aim of this study was to explore how changes in brain patterns of female fibromyalgia patients are shaped by neurofeedback therapy and how it affects pain perception and general health. A quasi-experimental study with pre- and post-tests was carried out with 37 female fibromyalgia patients referred by the Pain Unit of the National Health Service of Spain. The method involved applying a sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) protocol to monitor changes in brain waves under different conditions, taking pre-/post-test measurements of perceived pain, general health and the impact on fibromyalgia. Measures included the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire Revised (FIQR), the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) and EEG (SMR, theta waves). During therapy, the SMR/theta wave ratio increased significantly and after application of therapy, significant results were observed for the FIQR, VAS and GHQ-28. In conclusion, neurofeedback therapy increases the SMR/theta wave ratio in fibromyalgia, helping to maintain a balance between brain functions. This is associated with the activation of inhibitory processes, which is related to the perceived improvement of pain in fibromyalgia patients.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Subthalamic and pallidal stimulations in patients with Parkinson’s disease: common and dissociable connections</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The subthalamic nucleus (STN) and internal globus pallidus (GPi) are the most effective targets in deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, the common and specific effects on brain connectivity of stimulating the two nuclei remain unclear.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients with PD receiving STN-DBS (n=27, six women, mean age 64.8 years) or GPi-DBS (n=28, thirteen women, mean age 64.6 years) were recruited for resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess the effects of STN-DBS and GPi-DBS on brain functional dynamics.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The functional connectivity both between the somatosensory-motor cortices and thalamus, and between the somatosensory-motor cortices and cerebellum decreased in the DBS-on state compared with the off state (<i>p</i>&lt;0.05). The changes in thalamocortical connectivity correlated with DBS-induced motor improvement (<i>p</i>&lt;0.05) and were negatively correlated with the normalized intersection volume of tissues activated at both DBS targets (<i>p</i>&lt;0.05). STN-DBS modulated functional connectivity among a wider range of brain areas than GPi-DBS (<i>p</i>=0.009). Notably, only STN-DBS affected connectivity between the postcentral gyrus and cerebellar vermis (<i>p</i>&lt;0.001) and between the somatomotor and visual networks (<i>p</i>&lt;0.001).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings highlight common alterations in the motor pathway and its relationship with the motor improvement induced by both STN- and GPi-DBS. The effects on cortico-cerebellar and somatomotor-visual functional connectivity differed between groups, suggesting differentiated neural modulation of the two target sites. Our results provide mechanistic insight and yield the potential to refine target selection strategies for focal brain stimulation in PD.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">7T MRI Differetiates Remyelinated from Demyelinated Multiple Sclerosis Lesions</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To noninvasively assess myelin status in chronic white matter lesions of multiple sclerosis (MS), we developed and evaluated a simple classification scheme based on T1 relaxation time maps derived from 7-tesla postmortem and in vivo MRI.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Using the MP2RAGE MRI sequence, we classified 36 lesions from 4 postmortem MS brains as “long-T1,” “short-T1,” and “mixed-T1” by visual comparison to neocortex. Within these groups, we compared T1 times to histologically derived measures of myelin and axons. We performed similar analysis of 235 chronic lesions with known date of onset in 25 MS cases in vivo and in a validation cohort of 222 lesions from 66 MS cases, investigating associations with clinical and radiological outcomes.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Postmortem, lesions classified qualitatively as long-T1, short-T1, and mixed-T1 corresponded to fully demyelinated, fully remyelinated, and mixed demyelinated/remyelinated lesions, respectively (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.001). Demyelination (rather than axon loss) dominantly contributed to initial T1 prolongation. We observed lesions with similar characteristics in vivo, allowing manual classification with substantial interrater and excellent intrarater reliability. Short-T1 lesions were most common in the deep white matter, whereas long-T1 and mixed-T1 lesions were prevalent in the juxtacortical and periventricular white matter (p = 0.02) and were much more likely to have paramagnetic rims suggesting chronic inflammation (p &lt; 0.001). Older age at the time of lesion formation portended less remyelination (<i>p</i> = 0.007).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>7-tesla T1 mapping with MP2RAGE, a clinically available MRI method, allows qualitative and quantitative classification of chronic MS lesions according to myelin content, rendering straightforward the tracking of lesional myelination changes over time.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">FLARIM v2.0, an improved method to quantify transcript-ribosome interactions in vivo in the adult Drosophila brain</a></h4>

              
                Neural injury triggers striking immune reactions from glial cells, including significant transcriptional and morphological changes, but it is unclear how these events are coordinated to mount an effective immune response. Here, we present a new variant of the Fluorescence assay to detect ribosome interactions with mRNA (FLARIM), which we term FLARIM v2.0, to visualize single immune gene transcripts and association with ribosomes in glia responding to neurodegeneration. Specifically, using an in vivo axotomy assay in Drosophila, we show that matrix metalloproteinase-1 (Mmp-1) mRNAs and associated ribosomes are detected in distal processes of reactive glia where they are actively engulfing degenerating axonal material, suggesting that local translation is an important component of the glial immune response to axotomy. This work also validates our enhanced FLARIM assay as a promising tool to investigate mechanisms of mRNA transport and translation in a wide range of in vitro and in vivo paradigms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical hyperexcitability drives dying forward ALS symptoms and pathology in mice</a></h4>

              
                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive fatal disorder caused by degeneration of motor neurons in the cortex and spinal cord. The origin of ALS in the central nervous system is unclear, however cortical hyperexcitability appears as an early and intrinsic feature of ALS and has been linked to degeneration of spinal motor neurons via a dying-forward mechanism. Here, we implement chemogenetics to validate the dying forward hypothesis of ALS in mice. We show that chronic hyperexcitability of corticomotoneurons induced by excitatory chemogenetics results in motor symptoms and core neuropathological hallmarks of ALS, including corticomotoneuron loss, corticospinal tract degeneration and reactive gliosis. Importantly, corticomotoneuron loss was sufficient to drive degeneration of spinal motor neurons and neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), associated with cytoplasmic TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology. These findings establish a cortical origin of ALS mediated by neuronal hyperexcitability, consistent with a dying forward mechanism of neurodegeneration.

                Gli1 expressing neural stem cells, in the subventricular zone of the adult mammalian brain, respond to demyelination injury by differentiating into oligodendrocytes. We have identified Gpnmb as a novel regulator of oligodendrogenesis in Gli1 neural stem cells, whose expression is induced by TGF{beta}1 signaling via Gli1, in response to a demyelinating injury. Upregulation of Gpnmb further activates the TGF{beta}1 pathway by increasing the expression of the TGF{beta}1 binding receptor subunit, TGF{beta}R2. Thus the TGF{beta}1[-&gt;]Gli1[-&gt;]Gpnmb[-&gt;]TGF{beta}R2 signaling pathway forms a feed forward loop for sustained activation of TGF{beta}1 signaling in Gli1 neural stem cells, resulting in inhibition of their differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes following demyelination.

	<p>Along with deficits in spatial cognition, a decline in body-related information is observed in aging and is thought to contribute to impairments in navigation, memory, and space perception. According to the embodied cognition theories, bodily and environmental information play a crucial role in defining cognitive representations. Thanks to the possibility to involve body-related information, manipulate environmental stimuli, and add multisensory cues, virtual reality is one of the best candidates for spatial memory rehabilitation in aging for its embodied potential. However, current virtual neurorehabilitation solutions for aging and neurodegenerative diseases are in their infancy. Here, we discuss three concepts that could be used to improve embodied representations of the space with virtual reality. The virtual bodily representation is the combination of idiothetic information involved during virtual navigation thanks to input/output devices; the spatial affordances are environmental or symbolic elements used by the individual to act in the virtual environment; finally, the virtual enactment effect is the enhancement on spatial memory provided by actively (cognitively and/or bodily) interacting with the virtual space and its elements. Theoretical and empirical findings will be presented to propose innovative rehabilitative solutions in aging for spatial memory and navigation.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Sustained axonal degeneration may play a critical role in prolonged disorder of consciousness (DOCs) pathophysiology. We evaluated levels of neurofilament light chain (NFL), an axonal injury marker, in patients with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) and in the minimally conscious state (MCS) after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (HIBI). (2) Methods: This prospective multicenter blinded study involved 70 patients with prolonged DOC and 70 sex-/age-matched healthy controls. Serum NFL levels were evaluated at 1–3 and 6 months post-injury and compared with those of controls. NFL levels were compared by DOC severity (UWS vs. MCS) and etiology (TBI vs. HIBI). (3) Results: Patients’ serum NFL levels were significantly higher than those of controls at 1–3 and 6 months post-injury (medians, 1729 and 426 vs. 90 pg/mL; both p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). NFL levels were higher in patients with UWS than in those in MCS at 1–3 months post-injury (p = 0.008) and in patients with HIBI than in those with TBI at 6 months post-injury (p = 0.037). (4) Conclusions: Patients with prolonged DOC present sustained axonal degeneration that is affected differently over time by brain injury severity and etiology.</p>

                <p>Fire plays a dominant role in deforestation, particularly in the tropics, but the relative extent of transformations and influence of fire frequency on eventual forest loss remain unclear. Here, we analyze the frequency of fire and its influence on postfire forest trajectories between 2001 and 2018. We account for ~1.1% of Latin American forests burnt in 2002&ndash;2003 (8,465,850 ha). Although 40.1% of forests (3,393,250 ha) burned only once, by 2018, ~48% of the evergreen forests converted to other, primarily grass-dominated uses. While greater fire frequency yielded more transformation, our results reveal the staggering impact of even a single fire. Increasing fire frequency imposes greater risks of irreversible forest loss, transforming forests into ecosystems increasingly vulnerable to degradation. Reversing this trend is indispensable to both mitigate and adapt to climate change globally. As climate change transforms fire regimes across the region, key actions are needed to conserve Latin American forests.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Efferocytosis fuels malignant pleural effusion through TIMP1</a></h4>

              
                <p>Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) results from the capacity of several human cancers to metastasize to the pleural cavity. No effective treatments are currently available, reflecting our insufficient understanding of the basic mechanisms leading to MPE progression. Here, we found that efferocytosis through the receptor tyrosine kinases AXL and MERTK led to the production of interleukin-10 (IL-10) by four distinct pleural cavity macrophage (M) subpopulations characterized by different metabolic states and cell chemotaxis properties. In turn, IL-10 acts on dendritic cells (DCs) inducing the production of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP1). Genetic ablation of <I>Axl</I> and <I>Mertk</I> in Ms or IL-10 receptor in DCs or <I>Timp1</I> substantially reduced MPE progression. Our results delineate an inflammatory cascade&mdash;from the clearance of apoptotic cells by Ms, to production of IL-10, to induction of TIMP1 in DCs&mdash;that facilitates MPE progression. This inflammatory cascade offers a series of therapeutic targets for MPE.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">How social learning amplifies moral outrage expression in online social networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>Moral outrage shapes fundamental aspects of social life and is now widespread in online social networks. Here, we show how social learning processes amplify online moral outrage expressions over time. In two preregistered observational studies on Twitter (7331 users and 12.7 million total tweets) and two preregistered behavioral experiments (<I>N</I> = 240), we find that positive social feedback for outrage expressions increases the likelihood of future outrage expressions, consistent with principles of reinforcement learning. In addition, users conform their outrage expressions to the expressive norms of their social networks, suggesting norm learning also guides online outrage expressions. Norm learning overshadows reinforcement learning when normative information is readily observable: in ideologically extreme networks, where outrage expression is more common, users are less sensitive to social feedback when deciding whether to express outrage. Our findings highlight how platform design interacts with human learning mechanisms to affect moral discourse in digital public spaces.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Dating correlated microlayers in oxalate accretions from rock art shelters: New archives of paleoenvironments and human activity</a></h4>

              
                <p>Oxalate-rich mineral accretions, often found in rock shelters around the world, offer important opportunities for radiocarbon dating of associated rock art. Here, sample characterization and chemical pretreatment techniques are used to characterize the accretions, prescreen for evidence of open-system behavior, and address potential contamination. The results provide stratigraphically consistent sequences of radiocarbon dates in millimeter-scale laminated accretions, demonstrating their reliability for dating rock art, particularly symbolic markings commonly engraved into these relatively soft deposits. The age sequences are also consistent with correlations between distinctive patterns in the layer sequences visible in shelters up to 90 km apart in the Kimberley region of northwestern Australia, suggesting their synchronized formation is not entirely shelter specific but broadly controlled by variations in regional environmental conditions. Consequently, these accretions also offer potential as paleoenvironmental archives, with radiocarbon dating of layers in nine accretions indicating four, approximately synchronous growth intervals covering the past 43 ka.</p>

                <p>Beneficial microorganisms for corals (BMCs) ameliorate environmental stress, but whether they can prevent mortality and the underlying host response mechanisms remains elusive. Here, we conducted omics analyses on the coral <I>Mussismilia hispida</I> exposed to bleaching conditions in a long-term mesocosm experiment and inoculated with a selected BMC consortium or a saline solution placebo. All corals were affected by heat stress, but the observed "post-heat stress disorder" was mitigated by BMCs, signified by patterns of dimethylsulfoniopropionate degradation, lipid maintenance, and coral host transcriptional reprogramming of cellular restructuration, repair, stress protection, and immune genes, concomitant with a 40% survival rate increase and stable photosynthetic performance by the endosymbiotic algae. This study provides insights into the responses that underlie probiotic host manipulation. We demonstrate that BMCs trigger a dynamic microbiome restructuring process that instigates genetic and metabolic alterations in the coral host that eventually mitigate coral bleaching and mortality.</p>

                <p>Spin-based silicon quantum electronic circuits offer a scalable platform for quantum computation, combining the manufacturability of semiconductor devices with the long coherence times afforded by spins in silicon. Advancing from current few-qubit devices to silicon quantum processors with upward of a million qubits, as required for fault-tolerant operation, presents several unique challenges, one of the most demanding being the ability to deliver microwave signals for large-scale qubit control. Here, we demonstrate a potential solution to this problem by using a three-dimensional dielectric resonator to broadcast a global microwave signal across a quantum nanoelectronic circuit. Critically, this technique uses only a single microwave source and is capable of delivering control signals to millions of qubits simultaneously. We show that the global field can be used to perform spin resonance of single electrons confined in a silicon double quantum dot device, establishing the feasibility of this approach for scalable spin qubit control.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Nanodissected elastically loaded clathrin lattices relax to increased curvature</a></h4>

              
                <p>Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is the major endocytosis pathway for the specific internalization of large compounds, growth factors, and receptors. Formation of internalized vesicles from the flat plasma membrane is accompanied by maturation of cytoplasmic clathrin coats. How clathrin coats mature and the mechanistic role of clathrin coats are still largely unknown. Maturation models proposed clathrin coats to mature at constant radius or constant area, driven by molecular actions or elastic energy. Here, combining high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) imaging, HS-AFM nanodissection, and elasticity theory, we show that clathrin lattices deviating from the intrinsic curvature of clathrin form elastically loaded assemblies. Upon nanodissection of the clathrin network, the stored elastic energy in these lattices drives lattice relaxation to accommodate an ideal area-curvature ratio toward the formation of closed clathrin-coated vesicles. Our work supports that the release of elastic energy stored in curvature-frustrated clathrin lattices could play a major role in CME.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">A two-step strategy for delivering particles to targets hidden within microfabricated porous media</a></h4>

              
                <p>The delivery of small particles into porous environments remains highly challenging because of the low permeability to the fluids that carry these colloids. Even more challenging is that the specific location of targets in the porous environment usually is not known and cannot be determined from the outside. Here, we demonstrate a two-step strategy to deliver suspended colloids to targets that are "hidden" within closed porous media. The first step serves to automatically convert any hidden targets into soluto-inertial "beacons," capable of sustaining long-lived solute outfluxes. The second step introduces the deliverable objects, which are designed to autonomously migrate against the solute fluxes emitted by the targets, thereby following chemical trails that lead to the target. Experimental and theoretical demonstrations of the strategy lay out the design elements required for the solute and the deliverable objects, suggesting routes to delivering colloidal objects to hidden targets in various environments and technologies.</p>

                <p>In recent years, lanthanum aluminate/strontium titanate (LAO/STO) heterointerfaces have been used to create a growing family of nanoelectronic devices based on nanoscale control of LAO/STO metal-to-insulator transition. The properties of these devices are wide-ranging, but they are restricted by nature of the underlying thick STO substrate. Here, single-crystal freestanding membranes based on LAO/STO heterostructures were fabricated, which can be directly integrated with other materials via van der Waals stacking. The key properties of LAO/STO are preserved when LAO/STO membranes are formed. Conductive atomic force microscope lithography is shown to successfully create reversible patterns of nanoscale conducting regions, which survive to millikelvin temperatures. The ability to form reconfigurable conducting nanostructures on LAO/STO membranes opens opportunities to integrate a variety of nanoelectronics with silicon-based architectures and flexible, magnetic, or superconducting materials.</p>

The present report shows that prebiotic oxidation of &alpha;-hydroxy carboxylates can be achieved by UV photolysis of a simple geochemical species (HS<sup>&ndash;</sup>), which leads to &alpha;-oxo carboxylates that feature in the Krebs cycle and glyoxylate shunt. Further reaction of these products leads to almost all intermediates of the Krebs cycle proper, succinate semialdehyde bypass, and glyoxylate shunt. Fumarate, the missing Krebs cycle component, and the required &alpha;-hydroxy carboxylates can be provided by a highly related hydrogen cyanide chemistry, which also provides precursors for amino acids, nucleotides, and phospholipids.</p>

This uses parallel Bayesian optimization to selectively acquire energy and property data, generating the same levels of insight at a fraction of the computational cost. We use this approach to obtain a two orders of magnitude speedup on an ESF study that focused on the discovery of molecular crystals for methane capture, saving more than 500,000 central processing unit hours from the original protocol. By accelerating the acquisition of insight from ESF maps, we pave the way for the use of these maps in automated ultrahigh-throughput screening pipelines by greatly reducing the opportunity risk associated with the choice of system to calculate.</p>

                <p>The recruitment of Unc-51-like kinase and TANK-binding kinase 1 complexes is essential for Nuclear dot protein 52-mediated selective autophagy and relies on the specific association of NDP52, RB1-inducible coiled-coil protein 1, and Nak-associated protein 1 (5-azacytidine-induced protein 2, AZI2). However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive. Here, we find that except for the NDP52 SKIP carboxyl homology (SKICH)/RB1CC1 coiled-coil interaction, the LC3-interacting region of NDP52 can directly interact with the RB1CC1 Claw domain, as that of NAP1 FIP200-binding region (FIR). The determined crystal structures of NDP52 SKICH/RB1CC1 complex, NAP1 FIR/RB1CC1 complex, and the related NAP1 FIR/Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor-associated protein complex not only elucidate the molecular bases underpinning the interactions of RB1CC1 with NDP52 and NAP1 but also reveal that RB1CC1 Claw and Autophagy-related protein 8 family proteins are competitive in binding to NAP1 and NDP52. Overall, our findings provide mechanistic insights into the interactions of NDP52, NAP1 with RB1CC1 and ATG8 family proteins.</p>

                <p>The year 2020 brought unimaginable challenges in public health, with the confluence of the COVID-19 pandemic and wildfires across the western United States. Wildfires produce high levels of fine particulate matter (PM<SUB>2.5</SUB>). Recent studies reported that short-term exposure to PM<SUB>2.5</SUB> is associated with increased risk of COVID-19 cases and deaths. We acquired and linked publicly available daily data on PM<SUB>2.5</SUB>, the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths, and other confounders for 92 western U.S. counties that were affected by the 2020 wildfires. We estimated the association between short-term exposure to PM<SUB>2.5</SUB> during the wildfires and the epidemiological dynamics of COVID-19 cases and deaths. We adjusted for several time-varying confounding factors (e.g., weather, seasonality, long-term trends, mobility, and population size). We found strong evidence that wildfires amplified the effect of short-term exposure to PM<SUB>2.5</SUB> on COVID-19 cases and deaths, although with substantial heterogeneity across counties.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Chronic, Episodic Nicotine Alters Hypoglossal Motor Neuron Function at a Critical Developmental Time Point in Neonatal Rats</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Developmental nicotine exposure (DNE), alters brainstem neurons that control breathing, including hypoglossal motor neurons (XIIMNs), which innervate the tongue. Here, we tested the hypothesis that chronic, episodic DNE (eDNE), which mimics nicotine replacement therapies such as e-cigarettes or nicotine gum, alters the function of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), XIIMN intrinsic properties, and tongue muscle function <I>in vivo</I> similar to what we have observed with a chronic, sustained exposure model. We delivered nicotine to pregnant Sprague Dawley rats through drinking water and studied pups of either sex in two age groups: postnatal day (P)1&ndash;P5 and P10&ndash;P12, which encompasses a critical period in brain development. At P1&ndash;P5, eDNE was associated with delayed recovery of nAChRs from desensitization; however, there were no changes in the magnitude of desensitization, XIIMN intrinsic properties, or tongue muscle function <I>in vivo.</I> By P10&ndash;P12, eDNE XIIMNs had lower peak firing frequencies in response to depolarizing current injection, larger delayed rectifier potassium currents, and continued to exhibit delayed nAChR recovery. Moreover, this age group exhibited a blunted and delayed tongue muscle response to nasal occlusion <I>in vivo</I>, indicating that changes to XIIMN intrinsic properties is an important mechanism behind this effect, as it is not produced by altered nAChR function alone. Together, these results show that eDNE alters XIIMNs and tongue muscle function during a critical period in brain development and that the specific effects of chronic nicotine exposure may be pattern dependent.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Interplay between COVID-19 vaccines and social measures for ending the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The development and authorization of COVID-19 vaccines has provided the clearest path forward to eliminate community spread and thus end the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. However, the limited pace at which the vaccine can be administered motivates the question, to what extent must we continue to adhere to social intervention measures such as mask wearing and social distancing? Methods: We develop a mathematical model of COVID-19 spread incorporating both vaccine dynamics and socio-epidemiological parameters. We use this model to study two important measures of disease control and eradication, the effective reproductive number Rt and the peak intensive care unit (ICU) caseload, over three key parameters: social measure adherence, vaccination rate, and vaccination coverage. Results: Our results suggest that, due to the slow pace of vaccine administration, social measures must be maintained by a large proportion of the population until a sufficient proportion of the population becomes vaccinated for the pandemic to be eradicated. By contrast, with reduced adherence to social measures, hospital ICU cases will greatly exceed capacity, resulting in increased avoidable loss of life. We then investigate the threat of localized outbreaks in low-vaccinated populations that have removed all social intervention mandates, and show that such populations could remain highly susceptible to major outbreaks particularly in the face of more easily transmissible variants.  Conclusions: These findings highlight the complex interplay involved between vaccination and social protective measures, and indicate the practical importance of continuing with extant social measures while vaccines are scaled up to allow the development of the herd immunity needed to end or control SARS-CoV-2 sustainably.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Autosomal recessive human thymidine kinase 2 (<i>TK2</i>) mutations cause TK2 deficiency, which typically manifests as a progressive and fatal mitochondrial myopathy in infants and children. Treatment with pyrimidine deoxynucleosides deoxycytidine and thymidine ameliorates mitochondrial defects and extends the lifespan of <i>Tk2</i> knock-in mouse (Tk2<sup>KI</sup>) and compassionate use deoxynucleoside therapy in TK2 deficient patients have shown promising indications of efficacy. To augment therapy for Tk2 deficiency, we assessed gene therapy alone and in combination with deoxynucleoside therapy in Tk2<sup>KI</sup> mice.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We generated pAAVsc CB6 PI vectors containing human TK2 cDNA (<i>TK2</i>). Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-<i>TK2</i> was administered to Tk2<sup>KI</sup>, which were serially assessed for weight, motor functions, and survival as well as biochemical functions in tissues. AAV-<i>TK2</i> treated mice were further treated with deoxynucleosides.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>AAV9 delivery of human TK2 cDNA to Tk2<sup>KI</sup> mice efficiently rescued Tk2 activity in all the tissues tested except the kidneys, delayed disease onset, and increased lifespan. Sequential treatment of Tk2<sup>KI</sup> mice with AAV9 first followed by AAV2 at different ages allowed us to reduce the viral dose while further prolonging the lifespan. Furthermore, addition of deoxycytidine and deoxythymidine supplementation to AAV9 + AAV2 treated Tk2<sup>KI</sup> mice dramatically improved mtDNA copy numbers in the liver and kidneys, animal growth, and lifespan.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our data indicate that AAV-<i>TK2</i> gene therapy as well as combination deoxynucleoside and gene therapies is more effective in Tk2<sup>KI</sup> mice than pharmacological alone. Thus, combination of gene therapy with substrate enhancement is a promising therapeutic approach for TK2 deficiency and potentially other metabolic disorders. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

                <p>The global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has contributed to more than 163 million confirmed infections and 3.3 million deaths worldwide. The severity of the pandemic has led to an unprecedented effort to develop multiple effective vaccines. Due to excellent safety and efficacy data from clinical trials, several vaccines were approved. We report a case series of postvaccinal encephalitis in temporal correlation to vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCov-19. The diagnostic criteria for possible autoimmune encephalitis were fulfilled. Our patients responded well to immunosuppressive therapy with corticosteroids. The incidence has been estimated to be approximately 8 per 10 million vaccine doses. Complication of postvaccinal encephalitis after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination still appear to be very rare, but need to be diagnosed and treated adequately. Large pooled data from observational epidemiologic studies are necessary to verify causality. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

                <p>by Kshitij Dwivedi, Michael F. Bonner, Radoslaw Martin Cichy, Gemma Roig</p>

The human visual cortex enables visual perception through a cascade of hierarchical computations in cortical regions with distinct functionalities. Here, we introduce an AI-driven approach to discover the functional mapping of the visual cortex. We related human brain responses to scene images measured with functional MRI (fMRI) systematically to a diverse set of deep neural networks (DNNs) optimized to perform different scene perception tasks. We found a structured mapping between DNN tasks and brain regions along the ventral and dorsal visual streams. Low-level visual tasks mapped onto early brain regions, 3-dimensional scene perception tasks mapped onto the dorsal stream, and semantic tasks mapped onto the ventral stream. This mapping was of high fidelity, with more than 60% of the explainable variance in nine key regions being explained. Together, our results provide a novel functional mapping of the human visual cortex and demonstrate the power of the computational approach.

                <p>by Stefan Allmann, Marion Wargnies, Nicolas Plazolles, Edern Cahoreau, Marc Biran, Pauline Morand, Erika Pineda, Hanna Kulyk, Corinne Asencio, Oriana Villafraz, Loïc Rivière, Emmanuel Tetaud, Brice Rotureau, Arnaud Mourier, Jean-Charles Portais, Frédéric Bringaud</p>

Microorganisms must make the right choice for nutrient consumption to adapt to their changing environment. As a consequence, bacteria and yeasts have developed regulatory mechanisms involving nutrient sensing and signaling, known as “catabolite repression,” allowing redirection of cell metabolism to maximize the consumption of an energy-efficient carbon source. Here, we report a new mechanism named “metabolic contest” for regulating the use of carbon sources without nutrient sensing and signaling. <i>Trypanosoma brucei</i> is a unicellular eukaryote transmitted by tsetse flies and causing human African trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness. We showed that, in contrast to most microorganisms, the insect stages of this parasite developed a preference for glycerol over glucose, with glucose consumption beginning after the depletion of glycerol present in the medium. This “metabolic contest” depends on the combination of 3 conditions: (i) the sequestration of both metabolic pathways in the same subcellular compartment, here in the peroxisomal-related organelles named glycosomes; (ii) the competition for the same substrate, here ATP, with the first enzymatic step of the glycerol and glucose metabolic pathways both being ATP-dependent (glycerol kinase and hexokinase, respectively); and (iii) an unbalanced activity between the competing enzymes, here the glycerol kinase activity being approximately 80-fold higher than the hexokinase activity. As predicted by our model, an approximately 50-fold down-regulation of the GK expression abolished the preference for glycerol over glucose, with glucose and glycerol being metabolized concomitantly. In theory, a metabolic contest could be found in any organism provided that the 3 conditions listed above are met.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Methods and guidance on conducting, reporting, publishing and appraising living systematic reviews: a scoping review protocol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The living systematic review (LSR) approach is based on an ongoing surveillance of the literature and continual updating. A few guidance documents address the conduct, reporting, publishing and appraisal of systematic reviews (SRs), but the methodology described is either not up-to date or not suitable for LSRs and misses additional LSR-specific considerations. The objective of this scoping review is to systematically collate methodological literature and guidance on how to conduct, report, publish and appraise the quality of LSRs. The scoping review will allow the mapping of the existing evidence on the topic to support LSRs authors seeking guidance and identify related gaps.  Methods: To achieve our objectives, we will conduct a scoping review to survey and evaluate existing evidence, using the standard scoping review methodology. We will search MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane using the OVID interface. The search strategy was developed by a researcher experienced in developing literature search strategies with the help of an information specialist. As for searching grey literature, we will seek existing guidelines and handbooks on LSRs from organizations that conduct evidence syntheses using the Lens.org website. Two review authors will extract and catalogue the study data on LSR methodological aspects into a standardized and pilot-tested data extraction form. The main categories will reflect proposed methods for (i) conducting LSRs, (ii) reporting of LSRs, (iii) publishing and (iv) appraising the quality of LSRs. Data synthesis and conclusion: By collecting these data from methodological surveys and papers, as well as existing guidance documents and handbooks on LSRs, we might identify specific issues and components lacking within current LSR methodology. Thus, the systematically obtained findings of the scoping review could be used as basis for the revision of existing methods tools on LSR, for instance a PRISMA statement extension for LSRs.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Exploring the growth process of successors in long-lived small and medium-sized manufacturing companies: a qualitative study [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Japan is the world's largest country in terms of the number of long-lived companies, the majority of which are family-owned small and medium-sized enterprises. On the other hand, many business owners will be retiring without successors, and the closure of these small and medium enterprises may have a significant impact on the future economy. The purpose of this study is to explore the growth process of successors in long-lived small and medium-sized manufacturing companies so that potential successors can know what they will experience as managers and be prepared for the future, and professionals who support successors can be provided with information on the growth process of successors to provide appropriate support. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with six successors of small and medium-sized manufacturing companies that are more than half a century old. Their answers were analyzed using the modified grounded theory approach to construct a hypothetical model. Results: In total, 46 concepts, four categories, 17 subcategories, and one core category with an analysis result diagram were formed. The diagram shows the successors gained confidence in management through the dilemma between autonomy and constraint in the early stage of succession, which was found in previous research. Following the initial stage, the successors responded to the crisis caused by market constraints such as being stuck in a new market, unreasonable treatment from customers, and created autonomous strategies in their businesses. Conclusions: By experiencing repetitive crises, the successors tend to acquire new perspectives toward the naturally occurring crises. This change of premise by the successors is considered as the process of double-loop learning. Relationships inside and outside the company influence the generation of this viewpoint. From a long-term perspective, a sense of unity with employees, stable employment, and the pursuit of enjoyment constitute the successors' values in this model.

                The airways of people with cystic fibrosis (CF) are often chronically colonised with a diverse array of bacterial and fungal species. However, little is known about the relative partitioning of species between the planktonic and biofilm modes of growth in the airways. Existing in vivo and in vitro models of CF airway infection are ill-suited for the long-term recapitulation of mixed microbial communities. Here we describe a simple, in vitro continuous-flow model for the cultivation of polymicrobial biofilms and planktonic cultures on different substrata. Our data provide evidence for inter-species antagonism and synergism in biofilm ecology. We further show that the type of substratum on which the biofilms grow has a profound influence on their species composition. This happens without any major alteration in the composition of the surrounding steady-state planktonic community. Our experimentally-tractable model enables the systematic study of planktonic and biofilm communities under conditions that are nutritionally reminiscent of the CF airway microenvironment, something not possible using any existing in vivo models of CF airway infection.

     alt="The effects of orexin-A and orexin receptors on anxiety- and depression-related behaviors in a male rat model of post-traumatic stress disorder"/>
<p>SPS rats exhibited enhanced levels of anxiety, reduced exploratory activities, and anhedonia. SPS reduced the expression levels of orexin-A in the hypothalamus and increased the expression levels of OX1R in the mPFC. Moreover, the intracerebroventricular administration of orexin-A alleviated anxiety-like behaviors, improved the reduction of locomotor activity in SPS rats, and partly restored OX1R levels in the mPFC. Therefore, the orexin system plays a role in the anxiety- and depression-related symptoms observed in PTSD.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Orexin neurons play an important role in stress-related mental disorders including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Anxiety- and depression-related symptoms commonly occur in combination with PTSD. However, the role of the orexin system in mediating alterations in these affective symptoms remains unclear. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is implicated in both cognitive and emotional processing. In the present study, we investigated anxiety- and depression-related behavioral changes using the elevated plus maze (EPM), the sucrose preference test (SPT), and the open field (OF) test in male rats with single prolonged stress (SPS) induced-PTSD. The expression of orexin-A in the hypothalamus and orexin receptors (OX1R and OX2R) in the mPFC was detected and quantified by immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). We found that the SPS rats exhibited enhanced levels of anxiety, reduced exploratory activities, and anhedonia. Furthermore, SPS resulted in reductions in the expression of orexin-A in the hypothalamus and the increased expression of OX1R in the mPFC. The intracerebroventricular administration of orexin-A alleviated behavioral changes in SPS rats and partly restored the increased levels of OX1R in the mPFC. These results suggest that the orexin system plays a role in the anxiety- and depression-related symptoms observed in PTSD.</p>

     alt="Morphometric Analysis of Astrocytes in Vocal Production Circuits of Common Marmoset (Callithrix jacchus)"/>
<p>In the common marmoset, detailed morphological analysis of 3D-reconstructed astrocytes residing in vocal production circuits revealed that, in general, cortical astrocytes are structurally more complex than those residing within midbrain regions.  We hypothesize that this morphological complexity of cortical astrocytes reflects their function in providing neuronal support or modulation of vocalization.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Astrocytes, the star-shaped glial cells, are the most abundant non-neuronal cell population in the Central Nervous System (CNS). They play a key role in modulating activities of neural networks, including those involved in complex motor behaviors. Common marmosets (<i>Callithrix jacchus)</i>, the most vocal non-human primate (NHP) have been used to study the physiology of vocalization and social vocal production. However, the neural circuitry involved in vocal production is not fully understood. In addition, even less is known about the involvement of astrocytes in this circuit. To understand the role that astrocytes may play in the complex behavior of vocalization, the initial step maybe to study their structural properties in the cortical and subcortical regions that are known to be involved in vocalization. Here, in common marmoset, we identify all astrocytic subtypes seen in other primate’s brains, including intralaminar astrocytes. In addition, we reveal detailed structural characteristics of astrocytes and perform morphometric analysis of astrocytes residing in the cortex and midbrain regions that are associated with vocal production. We found that cortical astrocytes in these regions illustrate a higher level of complexity when compared to those in the midbrain. We hypothesize that this complexity that is expressed in cortical astrocytes may reflect their functions to meet the metabolic/structural needs of these regions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Cyclic fatigue resistance of four different nickel-titanium instruments in an artificial canal [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: The objective of this study was to measure the number of cycles to fracture of four continuous or reciprocating rotary nickel-titanium instruments in different materials. Methods: A total of 40 nickel-titanium instruments were used for the present study. Instruments were divided into four groups (n=10): group 1, Revo-S SU; group 2, ProTaper Next X2; group 3, Reciproc R25; group 4, WaveOne Gold Primary. An artificial stainless-steel was used to test the cyclic fatigue of the instruments. The instruments were introduced into the stainless-steel canal, one at a time, until they reached the other end, then they were rotated inside the canal without in-out motion. The time from the beginning of instrument rotation until the occurrence of breakage was recorded. The number of rotated cycles to fracture of the instrument were calculated based on the revolutions per minute (rpm) of each instrument and the recorded rotated time. The mean number of cycles to fracture and standard deviations were calculated and statistically analysed. Results: The number of cycles to fracture of the Revo-S SU was the lowest, and that of the WaveOne Gold Primary was highest. Scanning electronic microscope images of fracture surfaces revealed the characteristics of fatigue. Conclusions: The number of cycles to fracture of the reciprocating WaveOne Gold Primary system was the highest amongst the tested instruments.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Empowering young immigrant girls in Canada through the ‘Girls’ Voices’ Curriculum: A qualitative study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Gender inequality is a global issue. In Canada, 70% of women experience some form of inequality in their lifetime. Immigrant adolescents in Canada make up a substantial proportion of newcomers, and immigrant girls face the threat of subjugation and oppression, which has a significant impact on their health, development, and economic outcomes as well as gender inequality. Research on girls’ empowerment and resilience-building programs and interventions is virtually nonexistent. In this project, we implemented the ‘Girls’ Voices’ Curriculum. The aim of this project was to engage and empower South Asian (SA) immigrant adolescent girls and to promote gender equality in Canada. Methods: This study utilized a qualitative descriptive design. Pre- and post-curriculum implementation focus group discussions were conducted. Results: A total of 16 adolescent girls ranging from 11 to 18 years of age participated in this study. The participants described challenges many young girls face in relation to gender inequality such as gender discrimination, gendered stereotyping, barriers to education, etc. The ‘Girls’ Voices’ Curriculum allowed participants to highlight and reflect on the various problems faced by SA immigrant adolescents in their communities. The participants learned to examine these challenges through a variety of engaging activities to identify their root cause, effects and propose solutions to bring long-lasting change. The curriculum equipped them with useful tools such as decision-makers maps and advocacy skills to educate decision-makers by creating and delivering powerful messages influenced by personal stories and evidence-based literature.  Conclusion: The study provided significant insight into understanding the diverse challenges encountered by SA immigrant adolescent girls in Canada and linking them to the effectiveness of the ‘Girls’ Voices’ Curriculum. The girl-focused development programs that emphasize developing self-confidence, communication skills, problem-solving skills, and decision making are effective in empowering the socially deprived adolescent girls locally and in the global context.

                Microglial cells perform a plethora of functions in the central nervous system (CNS), involving them in brain development, maintenance of homeostasis in adulthood, and CNS diseases. Significant technical advancements have prompted the development of novel systems adapted to analyze microglia with increasing specificity and intricacy. The advent of single-cell technologies combined with targeted mouse models has been decisive in deciphering microglia heterogeneity and dissecting microglial functions. However sophisticated these tools have become, clear limitations remain. Understanding their pitfalls and advantages ensures their correct application. Therefore, we provide a guide to the cutting-edge methods currently available to dissect microglial biology.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Patterns of within-host genetic diversity in SARS-CoV-2</a></h4>

              
                Monitoring the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reconstructing transmission chains has become a major public health focus for many governments around the world. The modest mutation rate and rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 prevents the reconstruction of transmission chains from consensus genome sequences, but within-host genetic diversity could theoretically help identify close contacts. Here we describe the patterns of within-host diversity in 1181 SARS-CoV-2 samples sequenced to high depth in duplicate. 95.1% of samples show within-host mutations at detectable allele frequencies. Analyses of the mutational spectra revealed strong strand asymmetries suggestive of damage or RNA editing of the plus strand, rather than replication errors, dominating the accumulation of mutations during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Within- and between-host diversity show strong purifying selection, particularly against nonsense mutations. Recurrent within-host mutations, many of which coincide with known phylogenetic homoplasies, display a spectrum and patterns of purifying selection more suggestive of mutational hotspots than recombination or convergent evolution. While allele frequencies suggest that most samples result from infection by a single lineage, we identify multiple putative examples of co-infection. Integrating these results into an epidemiological inference framework, we find that while sharing of within-host variants between samples could help the reconstruction of transmission chains, mutational hotspots and rare cases of superinfection can confound these analyses.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Intracellular functions and motile properties of bi-directional kinesin-5 Cin8 are regulated by neck linker docking</a></h4>

              
                In this study, we analyzed intracellular functions and motile properties of neck-linker (NL) variants of the bi-directional <i>S. cerevisiae</i> kinesin-5 motor, Cin8. We also examined – by modeling – the configuration of H-bonds during NL docking. Decreasing the number of stabilizing H-bonds resulted in partially functional variants, as long as a conserved backbone H-bond at the N-latch position (proposed to stabilize the docked conformation of the NL) remained intact. Elimination of this conserved H-bond resulted in production of a non-functional Cin8 variant. Surprisingly, additional H-bond stabilization of the N-latch position, generated by replacement of the NL of Cin8 by sequences of the plus-end directed kinesin-5 Eg5, also produced a nonfunctional variant. In that variant, a single replacement of N-latch asparagine with glycine, as present in Cin8, eliminated the additional H-bond stabilization and rescued the functional defects. We conclude that exact N-latch stabilization during NL docking is critical for the function of bi-directional kinesin-5 Cin8.

                Climate change is dramatically changing ecosystem composition and productivity, leading scientists to consider the best approaches to map natural resistance and foster ecosystem resilience in the face of these changes. Here we present results from a large-scale experimental assessment of coral bleaching resistance, a critical trait for coral population persistence as oceans warm, in 221 colonies of the coral <i>Acropora hyacinthus</i> across 37 reefs in Palau. We find that bleaching resistant individuals inhabit most reefs but are found more often in warmer microhabitats. Our survey also found wide variation in symbiont concentration among colonies, and that colonies with lower symbiont load tended to be more bleaching resistant. By contrast, our data show that low symbiont load comes at the cost of lower growth rate, a tradeoff that may operate widely among corals across environments. Corals with high bleaching resistance have been suggested as a source for habitat restoration or selective breeding in order to increase coral reef resilience to climate change. Our maps show where these resilience corals can be found, but the existence of tradeoffs with heat resistance may suggest caution in unilateral use of this one trait in restoration.

                Cytoplasmic lipid droplets are highly dynamic storage organelles that are critical for cellular lipid homeostasis. While the molecular details of lipid droplet dynamics are a very active area of investigation, this work has been primarily performed in cultured cells. Taking advantage of the powerful transgenic and <i>in vivo </i>imaging opportunities available in zebrafish, we built a suite of tools to study lipid droplets in real-time from the subcellular to the whole organism level. Fluorescently tagging the lipid-droplet-associated proteins, perilipin 2 and perilipin 3, in the endogenous loci permits visualization of lipid droplets in the intestine, liver, and adipose tissue. Using these tools, we found that perilipin 3 is rapidly loaded on intestinal lipid droplets following a high-fat meal and later replaced by perilipin 2. These powerful new tools will facilitate studies on the role of lipid droplets in different tissues, under different genetic and physiological manipulations, and in a variety of human disease models.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Rad53 checkpoint kinase regulation of DNA replication fork rate via Mrc1 phosphorylation</a></h4>

              
                The Rad53 DNA checkpoint protein kinase plays multiple roles in the budding yeast cell response to DNA replication stress. Key amongst these is its enigmatic role in safeguarding DNA replication forks. Using DNA replication reactions reconstituted with purified proteins, we show Rad53 phosphorylation of Sld3/7 or Dbf4-dependent kinase blocks replication initiation whilst phosphorylation of Mrc1 or Mcm10 slows elongation. Mrc1 phosphorylation is necessary and sufficient to slow replication forks in complete reactions; Mcm10 phosphorylation can also slow replication forks, but only in the absence of unphosphorylated Mrc1. Mrc1 stimulates the unwinding rate of the replicative helicase, CMG, and Rad53 phosphorylation of Mrc1 prevents this. We show that a phosphorylation-mimicking Mrc1 mutant cannot stimulate replication <i>in vitro</i> and partially rescues the sensitivity of a <i>rad53</i> null mutant to genotoxic stress <i>in vivo</i>. Our results show that Rad53 protects replication forks in part by antagonising Mrc1 stimulation of CMG unwinding.

                Neuronal cell fate determinants establish the identities of neurons by controlling gene expression to regulate neuronal morphology and synaptic connectivity. However, it is not understood if neuronal cell fate determinants have postmitotic functions in synapse pattern formation. Here we identify a novel role for UNC-4 homeobox protein and its corepressor UNC-37/Groucho, in tiled synaptic patterning of the cholinergic motor neurons in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. We show that <i>unc-4</i> is not required during neurogenesis but is required in the postmitotic neurons for proper synapse patterning. In contrast, <i>unc-37</i> is required in both developing and postmitotic neurons. The synaptic tiling defects of <i>unc-4</i> mutants are suppressed by <i>bar-1/β-catenin</i> mutation, which positively regulates the expression of <i>ceh-12/HB9</i>. Ectopic <i>ceh-12</i> expression partly underlies the synaptic tiling defects of <i>unc-4</i> and <i>unc-37</i> mutants. Our results reveal a novel postmitotic role of neuronal cell fate determinants in synapse pattern formation through inhibiting the canonical Wnt signaling pathway.

                The Patch-seq approach is a powerful variation of the patch-clamp technique that allows for the combined electrophysiological, morphological, and transcriptomic characterization of individual neurons. To generate Patch-seq datasets at scale, we identified and refined key factors that contribute to the efficient collection of high-quality data. We developed patch-clamp electrophysiology software with analysis functions specifically designed to automate acquisition with online quality control. We recognized the importance of extracting the nucleus for transcriptomic success and maximizing membrane integrity during nucleus extraction for morphology success. The protocol is generalizable to different species and brain regions, as demonstrated by capturing multimodal data from human and macaque brain slices. The protocol, analysis and acquisition software are compiled at https://github.com/AllenInstitute/patchseqtools. This resource can be used by individual labs to generate data across diverse mammalian species and that is compatible with large publicly available Patch-seq datasets.

                Sleep spindles are major oscillatory components of Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) sleep, reflecting hyperpolarization-rebound sequences of thalamocortical neurons, the inhibition of which is caused by the NREM-dependent activation of GABAergic neurons in the reticular thalamic nucleus. Reports suggest a link between sleep spindles and several forms of interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) which are considered as expressions of pathological off-line neural plasticity in the central nervous system. Here we investigated the relationship between thalamic sleep spindles, IEDs and ripples in the anterior and mediodorsal nuclei (ANT and MD) of epilepsy patients. Whole-night LFP from the ANT and MD were co-registered with scalp EEG/polysomnography by using externalized leads in 15 epilepsy patients undergoing Deep Brain Stimulation protocol. Slow (~12 Hz) and fast (~14 Hz) sleep spindles were present in the human ANT and MD. Roughly, one third of thalamic sleep spindles were associated with IEDs or ripples. Both IED- and ripple-associated spindles were longer than pure spindles. IED-associated thalamic sleep spindles were characterized by broadband increase in thalamic and cortical activity, both below and above the spindle frequency range, whereas ripple-associated thalamic spindles exceeded pure spindles in terms of 80-200 Hz thalamic, but not cortical activity as indicated by time-frequency analysis. These result show that thalamic spindles coupled with IEDs are reflected at the scalp slow and beta-gamma oscillation as well. IED density during sleep spindles in the MD, but not in the ANT was identified as correlates of years spent with epilepsy, whereas no signs of pathological processes were correlated with measures of ripple and spindle association. Furthermore, the density of ripple-associated sleep spindles in the ANT showed a positive correlation with general intelligence. Our findings indicate the complex and multifaceted role of the human thalamus in sleep spindle-related physiological and pathological neural plasticity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Phase-locking patterns underlying effective communication in exact firing rate models of neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Macroscopic oscillations in the brain have been observed to be involved in many cognitive tasks but their role is not completely understood. One of the suggested functions of the oscillations is to dynamically modulate communication between neural circuits. The Communication Through Coherence (CTC) theory establishes that oscillations reflect rhythmic changes in excitability of the neuronal populations. Thus, populations need to be properly phase-locked so that input volleys arrive at the peaks of excitability of the receiving population to communicate effectively. Here, we present a modeling study to explore synchronization between neuronal circuits connected with unidirectional projections. We consider an Excitatory-Inhibitory (E-I) network of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons modeling a Pyramidal-Interneuronal Network Gamma (PING) rhythm. The network receives an external periodic input from either one or two sources, simulating the inputs from other oscillating neural groups. We use recently developed mean-field models which provide an exact description of the macroscopic activity of the spiking network. This low-dimensional mean field model allows us to use tools from bifurcation theory to identify the phase-locked states between the input and the target population as a function of the amplitude, frequency and coherence of the inputs. We identify the conditions for optimal phaselocking and selective communication. We find that inputs with high coherence can entrain the network for a wider range of frequencies. Besides, faster oscillatory inputs than the intrinsic network gamma cycle show more effective communication than inputs with similar frequency. Our analysis further shows that the entrainment of the network by inputs with higher frequency is more robust to distractors, thus giving them an advantage to entrain the network. Finally, we show that pulsatile inputs can switch between attended inputs in selective attention.

Author summaryOscillations are ubiquitous in the brain and are involved in several cognitive tasks but their role is not completely understood. The Communication Through Coherence theory proposes that background oscillations in the brain regulate the information flow between neural populations. The oscillators that are properly phase-locked so that inputs arrive at the peaks of excitability of the receiving population communicate effectively. In this paper, we study the emerging phase-locking patterns of a network generating PING oscillations under external periodic forcing, simulating the oscillatory input from other neural groups. We identify the conditions for optimal phase-locking and selective communication. Namely, we find that inputs with higher frequency and coherence have an adavantage to entrain the network and we quantify how robust are to distractors. Furthermore, we show how selective attention can be implemented by means of phase locking and we show that pulsatile inputs can switch between attended inputs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The diazepam binding inhibitors modulation of the GABA-A receptor is subunit-dependent</a></h4>

              
                First synthesized in the 1950s, benzodiazepines are widely prescribed drugs that exert their anxiolytic, sedative and anticonvulsant actions by binding to GABA-A receptors, the main inhibitory ligand-gated ion channel in the brain. Scientists have long theorized that there exists an endogenous benzodiazepine, or endozepine, in the brain. While there is indirect evidence suggesting a peptide, the diazepam binding inhibitor, is capable of modulating the GABA-A receptor, direct evidence of the modulatory effects of the diazepam binding inhibitor is limited.

Here we take a reductionist approach to understand how purified diazepam binding inhibitor interacts with and affects GABA-A receptor activity. We used two-electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology to study how the effects of diazepam binding inhibitor vary with GABA-A receptor subunit composition, and found that GABA-evoked currents from 3-containing GABA-A receptors are weakly inhibited by the diazepam binding inhibitor, while currents from 5-containing receptors are positively modulated. We also used in silico protein-protein docking to visualize potential diazepam binding inhibitor/GABA-A receptor interactions that revealed diazepam binding inhibitor bound at the benzodiazepine /{gamma} binding site interface, which provides a structural framework for understanding diazepam binding inhibitor effects on GABA-A receptors. Our results provide novel insights into mechanisms underlying how the diazepam binding inhibitor modulates GABA-mediated inhibition in the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The temporal dynamics of the Stroop effect from childhood to young and older adulthood</a></h4>

              
                It is well admitted that children and older adults tend to show longer response latencies at the Stroop task than young adults. The present study aims at clarifying the rational of such changes from childhood to adulthood and in ageing by comparing the impacted cognitive processes across age groups. More precisely, the aim was to clarify if all processes take more time to be executed, hence implying that longer latencies rely mainly on processing speed or if an additional process lengthens the resolution of the conflict in children and/or older adults. To this aim we recorded brain electrical activity using EEG in school-age children, young and older adults while they performed a classic verbal Stroop task. To decompose the signal in the underlying brain networks, we used microstates analyses and compared congruent, incongruent and neutral trials across the three age-groups. Behaviorally, children and older adults presented longer latencies and larger Stroop effects relative to young adults. The microstates results showed that children tend to present different brain configurations compared to both adult groups, even though some brain configurations remained identical among the three groups. In particular, additional brain networks were involved in children to perform the Stroop task, which party account for the longer latencies in this group. By contrast, in aging the results favor the general slowing hypothesis rather than a decline in a specific process since all involved brain networks were similar in the two adult groups but slowed down in the older one.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An approximate stochastic optimal control framework to simulate nonlinear neuromusculoskeletal models in the presence of noise</a></h4>

              
                Optimal control simulations have shown that both musculoskeletal dynamics and physiological noise are important determinants of movement. However, due to the limited efficiency of available computational tools, deterministic simulations of movement focus on accurately modelling the musculoskeletal system while neglecting physiological noise, and stochastic simulations account for noise while simplifying the dynamics. We took advantage of recent approaches where stochastic optimal control problems are approximated using deterministic optimal control problems, which can be solved efficiently using direct collocation. We were thus able to extend predictions of stochastic optimal control as a theory of motor coordination to include muscle coordination and movement patterns emerging from non-linear musculoskeletal dynamics. In stochastic optimal control simulations of human standing balance, we demonstrated that the inclusion of muscle dynamics can predict muscle co-contraction as minimal effort strategy that complements sensorimotor feedback control in the presence of sensory noise. In simulations of reaching, we demonstrated that nonlinear multi-segment musculoskeletal dynamics enables complex perturbed and unperturbed reach trajectories under a variety of task conditions to be predicted. In both behaviors, we demonstrated how interactions between task constraint, sensory noise, and the intrinsic properties of muscle influence optimal muscle coordination patterns, including muscle co-contraction, and the resulting movement trajectories. Our approach enables a true minimum effort solution to be identified as task constraints, such as movement accuracy, can be explicitly imposed, rather than being approximated using penalty terms in the cost function. Our approximate stochastic optimal control framework predicts complex features, not captured by previous simulation approaches, providing a generalizable and valuable tool to study how musculoskeletal dynamics and physiological noise may alter neural control of movement in both healthy and pathological movements.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Drosophila nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits and their native interactions with insecticidal peptide toxins</a></h4>

              
                Drosophila nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are ligand-gated ion channels that present a target for insecticides. However, a better understanding of receptor subunit composition is needed for effective design of insecticides. Peptide neurotoxins are known to block nAChRs by binding to its target subunits. To facilitate the analysis of nAChRs we used a CRISPR/Cas9 strategy to generate null alleles for all ten nAChR subunit genes. We studied interactions of nAChR subunits with peptide neurotoxins by larval injections and styrene maleic acid lipid particles (SMALPs) pull-down assays. For the null alleles we determined the effects of -Bungarotoxin (-Btx) and {omega}-Hexatoxin-Hv1a (Hv1a) administration, identifying potential receptor subunits implicated in the binding of these toxins. We employed pull-down assays to confirm -Btx interactions with the D5, D6, D7 subunits. Finally, we report the localization of fluorescent tagged endogenous D6 during nervous system development. Taken together this study elucidates native Drosophila nAChR subunit interactions with insecticidal peptide toxins.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neuronal cholesterol synthesis is essential for repair of chronically demyelinated lesions in mice</a></h4>

              
                Astrocyte-derived cholesterol supports brain cells under physiological conditions. However, in demyelinating lesions, astrocytes downregulate cholesterol synthesis and the cholesterol that is essential for remyelination has to originate from other cellular sources. Here, we show that repair following acute versus chronic demyelination involves distinct processes. In particular, we found that in chronic myelin disease, when recycling of lipids is often defective, de novo neuronal cholesterol synthesis is critical for regeneration. By gene expression profiling, genetic loss of function experiments and comprehensive phenotyping, we provide evidence that neurons increase cholesterol synthesis in chronic myelin disease models and MS patients. In mouse models, neuronal cholesterol facilitated remyelination specifically by triggering OPC proliferation. Our data contribute to the understanding of disease progression and have implications for therapeutic strategies in MS patients.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Learning from the path not taken: Sensory prediction errors are sufficient for implicit adaptation of withheld movements</a></h4>

              
                Current theories of motor control emphasize forward models as a critical component of the brains motor execution and learning networks. These internal models are thought to predict the consequences of movement before sensory feedback from these movements can reach the brain, allowing for smooth, continuous online motor performance and for the computation of prediction errors that drive implicit motor learning. Taking this framework to its logical extreme, we tested the hypothesis that movements are not necessary for the generation of predictions, the computation of prediction errors, and implicit motor adaptation. Human participants were cued to move a computer mouse to a visually displayed target and were subsequently cued to withhold those movements on a subset of trials. Visual errors displayed on both trials with and without movements to the target induced single-trial learning. Furthermore, learning on trials without movements persisted when accompanying movement trials were never paired with errors and when movement and sensory feedback trajectories were decoupled. These data provide compelling evidence supporting an internal model framework in which forward models generate sensory predictions independent of the generation of movements.

HIGHLIGHTSO_LIThe brain can learn to update movements that are not performed, representing a mechanism for learning based only on movement planning and sensory expectation.
C_LIO_LISupports a fundamental role for prediction in adaptation.
C_LIO_LIProvides further support for the role of forward models in predictive motor control.
