<p>One of the essential aspects of power system planning is generation expansion
planning (GEP). The purpose of GEP is to enhance construction planning and
reduce the costs of installing different types of power plants. This paper
proposes a method based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) for GEP in the presence of
wind power plants. Since it is desired to integrate the maximum possible wind
power production in GEP, the constraints for incorporating different levels of
wind energy in power generation are investigated comprehensively. This will
allow obtaining the maximum reasonable amount of wind penetration in the
network. Besides, due to the existence of different wind regimes, the
penetration of strong and weak wind on GEP is assessed. The results show that
the maximum utilization of wind power generation capacity could increase the
exploitation of more robust wind regimes. Considering the growth of the wind
farm industry and the cost reduction for building wind power plants, the
sensitivity of GEP to the variations of this cost is investigated. The results
further indicate that for a 10% reduction in the initial investment cost of
wind power plants, the proposed model estimates that the overall cost will be
minimized.

<p>Despite recent progress in robot learning, it still remains a challenge to
program a robot to deal with open-ended object manipulation tasks. One approach
that was recently used to autonomously generate a repertoire of diverse skills
is a novelty based Quality-Diversity~(QD) algorithm. However, as most
evolutionary algorithms, QD suffers from sample-inefficiency and, thus, it is
challenging to apply it in real-world scenarios. This paper tackles this
problem by integrating a neural network that predicts the behavior of the
perturbed parameters into a novelty based QD algorithm. In the proposed
Model-based Quality-Diversity search (M-QD), the network is trained
concurrently to the repertoire and is used to avoid executing unpromising
actions in the novelty search process. Furthermore, it is used to adapt the
skills of the final repertoire in order to generalize the skills to different
scenarios. Our experiments show that enhancing a QD algorithm with such a
forward model improves the sample-efficiency and performance of the
evolutionary process and the skill adaptation.

<p>Neural network applications generally benefit from larger-sized models, but
for current speech enhancement models, larger scale networks often suffer from
decreased robustness to the variety of real-world use cases beyond what is
encountered in training data. We introduce several innovations that lead to
better large neural networks for speech enhancement. The novel PoCoNet
architecture is a convolutional neural network that, with the use of
frequency-positional embeddings, is able to more efficiently build
frequency-dependent features in the early layers. A semi-supervised method
helps increase the amount of conversational training data by pre-enhancing
noisy datasets, improving performance on real recordings. A new loss function
biased towards preserving speech quality helps the optimization better match
human perceptual opinions on speech quality. Ablation experiments and objective
and human opinion metrics show the benefits of the proposed improvements.

<p>Understanding the activity of large populations of neurons is difficult due
to the combinatorial complexity of possible cell-cell interactions. To reduce
the complexity, coarse-graining had been previously applied to experimental
neural recordings, which showed over two decades of scaling in free energy,
activity variance, eigenvalue spectra, and correlation time, hinting that the
mouse hippocampus operates in a critical regime. We model the experiment by
simulating conditionally independent binary neurons coupled to a small number
of long-timescale stochastic fields and then replicating the coarse-graining
procedure and analysis. This reproduces the experimentally-observed scalings,
suggesting that they may arise from coupling the neural population activity to
latent dynamic stimuli. Further, parameter sweeps for our model suggest that
emergence of scaling requires most of the cells in a population to couple to
the latent stimuli, predicting that even the celebrated place cells must also
respond to non-place stimuli.

<p>Creativity, or the ability to produce new useful ideas, is commonly
associated to the human being, but there are many other examples in nature
where this phenomenon can be observed. Inspired by this fact, in engineering
and particularly in computational sciences, many different models have been
developed to tackle a number of problems. Music, a form of art broadly present
along the human history, is the main field addressed in this thesis, taking
advantage of the kind of ideas that bring diversity and creativity to nature
and computation. We present Melomics, an algorithmic composition method based
on evolutionary search, with a genetic encoding of the solutions that are
interpreted in a complex developmental process that leads to music in standard
formats. This bioinspired compositional system has exhibited a highly creative
power and versatility to produce music of different type, which in many
occasions has proven to be indistinguishable from the music made by human
composers. The system also has enabled the emergence of a set of completely
novel applications: from effective tools that help anyone to easily obtain the
precise music they need, to radically new uses like adaptive music for therapy,
amusement or many other purposes. It is clear to us that there is yet much
research to be done in this field and that countless and new unimaginable uses
will derive from it.

<p>Advances in deep learning have led to state-of-the-art performance across a
multitude of speech recognition tasks. Nevertheless, the widespread deployment
of deep neural networks for on-device speech recognition remains a challenge,
particularly in edge scenarios where the memory and computing resources are
highly constrained (e.g., low-power embedded devices) or where the memory and
computing budget dedicated to speech recognition is low (e.g., mobile devices
performing numerous tasks besides speech recognition). In this study, we
introduce the concept of attention condensers for building low-footprint,
highly-efficient deep neural networks for on-device speech recognition on the
edge. More specifically, an attention condenser is a self-attention mechanism
that learns and produces a condensed embedding characterizing joint local and
cross-channel activation relationships, and performs adaptive activation
recalibration accordingly for selective concentration. To illustrate its
efficacy, we introduce TinySpeech, low-precision deep neural networks
comprising largely of attention condensers tailored for on-device speech
recognition using a machine-driven design exploration strategy. Experimental
results on the Google Speech Commands benchmark dataset for limited-vocabulary
speech recognition showed that TinySpeech networks achieved significantly lower
architectural complexity (as much as $207\times$ fewer parameters) and lower
computational complexity (as much as $21\times$ fewer multiply-add operations)
when compared to previous deep neural networks in research literature. These
results not only demonstrate the efficacy of attention condensers for building
highly efficient deep neural networks for on-device speech recognition, but
also illuminate its potential for accelerating deep learning on the edge and
empowering a wide range of TinyML applications.

<p>The main power of artificial intelligence is not in modeling what we already
know, but in creating solutions that are new. Such solutions exist in extremely
large, high-dimensional, and complex search spaces. Population-based search
techniques, i.e. variants of evolutionary computation, are well suited to
finding them. These techniques make it possible to find creative solutions to
practical problems in the real world, making creative AI through evolutionary
computation the likely "next deep learning."

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11325">Effect of Diverse Recoding of Granule Cells on Optokinetic Response in A Cerebellar Ring Network with Synaptic Plasticity. (arXiv:2003.11325v4 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</a></h4>

<p>We consider a cerebellar ring network for the optokinetic response (OKR), and
investigate the effect of diverse recoding of granule (GR) cells on OKR by
varying the connection probability $p_c$ from Golgi to GR cells. For an optimal
value of $p_c^*~(=0.06)$, individual GR cells exhibit diverse spiking patterns
which are in-phase, anti-phase, or complex out-of-phase with respect to their
population-averaged firing activity. Then, these diversely-recoded signals via
parallel fibers (PFs) from GR cells are effectively depressed by the
error-teaching signals via climbing fibers from the inferior olive which are
also in-phase ones. Synaptic weights at in-phase PF-Purkinje cell (PC) synapses
of active GR cells are strongly depressed via strong long-term depression
(LTD), while those at anti-phase and complex out-of-phase PF-PC synapses are
weakly depressed through weak LTD. This kind of "effective" depression (i.e.,
strong/weak LTD) at the PF-PC synapses causes a big modulation in firings of
PCs, which then exert effective inhibitory coordination on the vestibular
nucleus (VN) neuron (which evokes OKR). For the firing of the VN neuron, the
learning gain degree ${\cal{L}}_g$, corresponding to the modulation gain ratio,
increases with increasing the learning cycle, and it saturates at about the
300th cycle. By varying $p_c$ from $p_c^*$, we find that a plot of saturated
learning gain degree ${\cal L}_g^*$ versus $p_c$ forms a bell-shaped curve with
a peak at $p_c^*$ (where the diversity degree in spiking patterns of GR cells
is also maximum). Consequently, the more diverse in recoding of GR cells, the
more effective in motor learning for the OKR adaptation.

<p>Diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) have historically been among the most difficult to treat using conventional pharmacological approaches. This is due to a confluence of factors, including the limited regenerative capacity and overall complexity of the brain, problems associated with repeated drug administration, and difficulties delivering drugs across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Viral-mediated gene transfer represents an attractive alternative for the delivery of therapeutic cargo to the nervous system. Crucially, it usually requires only a single injection, whether that be a gene replacement strategy for an inherited disorder or the delivery of a genome- or epigenome-modifying construct for treatment of CNS diseases and disorders. It is thus understandable that considerable effort has been put towards the development of improved vector systems for gene transfer into the CNS. Different viral vectors are of course tailored to their specific applications, but they generally should share several key properties. The ideal viral vector incorporates a high-packaging capacity, efficient gene transfer paired with robust and sustained expression, lack of oncogenicity, toxicity and pathogenicity, and scalable manufacturing for clinical applications. In this review, we will devote attention to viral vectors derived from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (lentiviral vectors; LVs) and adeno-associated virus (AAVs). The high interest in these viral delivery systems vectors is due to: (i) robust delivery and long-lasting expression; (ii) efficient transduction into postmitotic cells, including the brain; (iii) low immunogenicity and toxicity; and (iv) compatibility with advanced manufacturing techniques. Here, we will outline basic aspects of LV and AAV biology, particularly focusing on approaches and techniques aiming to enhance viral safety. We will also allocate a significant portion of this review to the development and use of LVs and AAVs for delivery into the CNS, with a focus on the genome and epigenome-editing tools based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas 9) and the development of novel strategies for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs).</p>

<p>Proinflammatory cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a multifunctional cytokine and has been found involved in many neurological diseases such as Alzheimer disease (AD), epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis. Previous studies have shown that MIF is expressed in neocortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, cerebellum, and spinal cord in adult mice. It is expressed by astrocytes and activates microglias in neuroinflammation. Further studies have shown that MIF is detected in moss fibers of dentate granule cells and in apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons in adult hippocampus. Only NeuroD-positive immature granule neurons but not NeuN-positive mature neurons express MIF. These findings led us eager to know the exact role of MIF in the development of hippocampus. Therefore, we systematically checked the spatial and temporal expression pattern of MIF and characterized MIF-positive cells in hippocampus from mice aged from postnatal day 0 (P0) to 3 months. Our results showed that the lowest level of MIF protein occurred at P7 and mif mRNA increased from P0, reached a peak at P7, and stably expressed until P30 before declining dramatically at 3 months. MIF was localized in fibers of GFAP- and BLBP-positive radial glial precursor cells in dentate gyrus (DG). DCX-expressing newly generated neurons were MIF-negative. Inhibition of MIF by MIF antagonist S, R-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4, 5-dihydro-5-isoxazole acetic acid methyl ester (ISO-1) reduced BrdU-positive cells. Interestingly, MIF was expressed by NeuN-positive GABAergic interneurons including parvalbumin-and Reelin-expressing cells in the DG. Neither NeuN-positive granule cells nor NeuN-positive pyramidal neurons expressed MIF. In transgenic mice, POMC-EGFP–positive immature dentate granule cells and Thy1-EGFP–positive mature granule cells were MIF-negative. Treatment of neuronal cultures with ISO-1 inhibited neurite outgrowth. Therefore, we conclude that MIF might be important for feature maintenance of neural stem cells and neurite outgrowth during hippocampal development.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00138">Gut Metabolite TMAO Induces Synaptic Plasticity Deficits by Promoting Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress</a></h4>

<p>Dysbiosis of gut microbiota is strongly associated with metabolic diseases including diabetes mellitus, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. Recent studies indicate that Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a gut microbe-dependent metabolite is implicated in the development of age-related cognitive decline. However, the mechanisms of the impact of TMAO on neuronal function has not been elucidated. In the current study, we investigated the relationship between TMAO and deficits in synaptic plasticity in an Alzheimer’s model (3×Tg-AD) and insulin resistance (Leptin deficient db/db) mouse by measuring plasma and brain levels of TMAO. We observed increased TMAO levels in the plasma and brain of both db/db and 3×Tg-AD mice in comparison to wild-type mice. Besides, TMAO levels further increased as mice progressed in age. Deficits in synaptic plasticity, in the form of reduced long-term potentiation (LTP), were noted in both groups of mice in comparison to wild-type mice. To further explore the impact of TMAO on neuronal function, we utilized an ex-vivo model by incubating wild-type hippocampal brain slices with TMAO and found impaired synaptic transmission. We observed that TMAO induced the PERK-EIF2α-ER stress signaling axis in TMAO treated ex-vivo slices as well as in both db/db and 3×Tg-AD mice. Lastly, we also observed altered presynaptic and reduced postsynaptic receptor expression. Our findings suggest that TMAO may induce deficits in synaptic plasticity through the ER stress-mediated PERK signaling pathway. Our results offer novel insight into the mechanism by which TMAO may induce cognitive deficits by promoting ER stress and identifies potential targets for therapeutic intervention.</p>

<p>The ionotropic ATP-gated P2X7 receptor is an important contributor to inflammatory signaling cascades via the release of Interleukin-1β, as well as having roles in cell death, neuronal plasticity and the release of neurotransmitters. Accordingly, there is interest in targeting the P2X7 receptor for the treatment of epilepsy. However, the signaling pathways downstream of P2X7 receptor activation remain incompletely understood. Notably, recent studies showed that P2X7 receptor expression is controlled, in part, by microRNAs (miRNAs). Here, we explored P2X7 receptor-dependent microRNA expression by comparing microRNA expression profiles of wild-type (wt) and P2X7 receptor knockout mice before and after status epilepticus. Genome-wide microRNA profiling was performed using hippocampi from wt and P2X7 receptor knockout mice following status epilepticus induced by intra-amygdala kainic acid. This revealed that the genetic deletion of the P2X7 receptor results in distinct patterns of microRNA expression. Specifically, we found that in vehicle-injected control mice, the lack of the P2X7 receptor resulted in the up-regulation of 50 microRNAs and down-regulation of 35 microRNAs. Post-status epilepticus, P2X7 receptor deficiency led to the up-regulation of 44 microRNAs while 13 microRNAs were down-regulated. Moreover, there was only limited overlap among identified P2X7 receptor-dependent microRNAs between control conditions and post-status epilepticus, suggesting that the P2X7 receptor regulates the expression of different microRNAs during normal physiology and pathology. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that genes targeted by P2X7 receptor-dependent microRNAs were particularly overrepresented in pathways involved in intracellular signaling, inflammation, and cell death; processes that have been repeatedly associated with P2X7 receptor activation. Moreover, whereas genes involved in signaling pathways and inflammation were common among up- and down-regulated P2X7 receptor-dependent microRNAs during physiological and pathological conditions, genes associated with cell death seemed to be restricted to up-regulated microRNAs during both physiological conditions and post-status epilepticus. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the P2X7 receptor impacts on the expression profile of microRNAs in the brain, thereby possibly contributing to both the maintenance of normal cellular homeostasis and pathological processes.</p>

<p>Reaching and grasping is an essential part of everybody’s life, it allows meaningful interaction with the environment and is key to independent lifestyle. Recent electroencephalogram (EEG)-based studies have already shown that neural correlates of natural reach-and-grasp actions can be identified in the EEG. However, it is still in question whether these results obtained in a laboratory environment can make the transition to mobile applicable EEG systems for home use. In the current study, we investigated whether EEG-based correlates of natural reach-and-grasp actions can be successfully identified and decoded using mobile EEG systems, namely the water-based EEG-Versatile<sup>TM</sup> system and the dry-electrodes EEG-Hero<sup>TM</sup> headset. In addition, we also analyzed gel-based recordings obtained in a laboratory environment (g.USBamp/g.Ladybird, gold standard), which followed the same experimental parameters. For each recording system, 15 study participants performed 80 self-initiated reach-and-grasp actions toward a glass (palmar grasp) and a spoon (lateral grasp). Our results confirmed that EEG-based correlates of reach-and-grasp actions can be successfully identified using these mobile systems. In a single-trial multiclass-based decoding approach, which incorporated both movement conditions and rest, we could show that the low frequency time domain (LFTD) correlates were also decodable. Grand average peak accuracy calculated on unseen test data yielded for the water-based electrode system 62.3% (9.2% STD), whereas for the dry-electrodes headset reached 56.4% (8% STD). For the gel-based electrode system 61.3% (8.6% STD) could be achieved. To foster and promote further investigations in the field of EEG-based movement decoding, as well as to allow the interested community to make their own conclusions, we provide all datasets publicly available in the BNCI Horizon 2020 database (http://bnci-horizon-2020.eu/database/data-sets).</p>

Background<p>High-tension glaucoma (HTG) is the most common type of primary open angle glaucoma and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is the major risk factor of the disease. The aim of this study was to assess alterations in resting-state visual networks in patients with HTG and investigate the effect of elevated IOP on the visual networks.</p>Methods<p>T1-weighted and resting-state functional MRI images were acquired from 36 HTG patients (aged 49.22 ± 15.26 years) and 20 healthy controls (aged 49.90 ± 5.62 years). Group independent component analysis (ICA) was utilized to evaluate altered functional connectivity (FC) in resting-state visual networks between HTG patients and healthy controls. Pearson correlation analysis between mean IOP and altered FCs in the visual networks was performed.</p>Results<p>ICA demonstrated decreased FCs in HTG group in the left calcarine cortex of the lateral visual network, in the bilateral lingual gyrus of the medial visual network and in the bilateral lingual gyrus of the occipital visual network compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, correlation analysis revealed negative correlation between mean IOP and altered FC within the lateral visual network.</p>Conclusion<p>The results suggested reduced FCs between primary and higher visual cortices in HTG brain. The IOP elevation might be responsible for the functional alterations in the visual networks.</p>

Background<p>There is a unique nucleus (CSF-contacting nucleus) in the brain of rat. It has been demonstrated in our previous research. The extraordinary feature of this nucleus is that it is not connected to any parenchymal organ but to the CSF. In primates, however, the presence or absence of this nucleus has not been proven. Confirmation of the presence of this nucleus in primates will provide the structural basis for brain-CSF communication and help to understand the neurohumoral regulatory mechanisms in humans.</p>Methods<p>The tracer cholera toxin B subunit conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (CB-HRP) was injected into the CSF in the lateral ventricle (LV) of primate rhesus monkeys. After 48 h, the monkeys were perfused and the brain was dissected out, and sectioned for CB-HRP staining. The CB-HRP positive structures were observed under confocal and electron microscopy. The three-dimensional (3D) structure of the CB-HRP positive neurons cluster was reconstructed by computer software.</p>Results<p>(1) CB-HRP labeling is confined within the ventricle, but not leakage into the brain parenchyma. (2) From the midbrain inferior colliculus superior border plane ventral to the aqueduct to the upper part of the fourth ventricle (4V) floor, a large number of CB-HRP positive neurons are consistently located, form a cluster, and are symmetrically located on both sides of the midline. (3) 3D reconstruction shows that the CB-HRP positive neurons cluster in the monkey brain occupies certain space. The rostral part is large and caudal part is thin appearing a “rivet”-like shape. (4) Under electron microscopy, the CB-HRP positive neurons show different types of synaptic connections with the non-CSF-contacting structures in the brain. Some of the processes stretch directly into the ventricle cavity.</p>Conclusion<p>Same as we did in rats, the CSF-contacting nucleus is also existed in the primate brain parenchyma. We also recommend listing it as the XIII pair of cranial nucleus, which is specialized in the communications between the brain and the CSF. It is significant to the completing of innervation in the organism.</p>

<p>Purpose: Individuals with presbycusis often show deficits in cognitive function, however, the exact neurophysiological mechanisms are not well understood. This study explored the alterations in intra- and inter-network functional connectivity (FC) of multiple networks in presbycusis patients, and further correlated FC with cognitive assessment scores to assess their ability to predict cognitive impairment.</p><p>Methods: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) was performed in 40 presbycusis patients and 40 matched controls, and 12 resting-state networks (RSNs) were identified by independent component analysis (ICA) approach. A two-sample t-test was carried out to detect the intra-network FC differences, and functional network connectivity (FNC) was calculated to compare the inter-network FC differences. Pearson or Spearman correlation analysis was subsequently used to explore the correlation between altered FC and cognitive assessment scores.</p><p>Results: Our study demonstrated that patients with presbycusis showed significantly decreased FC in the subcortical limbic network (scLN), default mode network (DMN), executive control network (ECN), and attention network (AN) compared with the control group. Moreover, the connectivity for scLN-AUN (auditory network) and VN (visual network)-DMN were found significantly increased while AN-DMN was found significantly decreased in presbycusis patients. Ultimately, this study revealed the intra- and inter-network alterations associated with some cognitive assessment scores.</p><p>Conclusion: This study observed intra- and inter-network FC alterations in presbycusis patients, and investigated that presbycusis can lead to abnormal connectivity of RSNs and plasticity compensation mechanism, which may be the basis of cognitive impairment, suggesting that FNC can be used to predict potential cognitive impairment in their early stage.</p>

<p>The aging of the brain is a well-investigated topic, but existing analyses have mainly focused on Caucasian samples. To investigate brain aging in East Asians, we measured cortical and subcortical volumes from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of 1,008 cognitively normal elderly Koreans from the Gwangju Alzheimer’s and Related Dementia cohort and 342 Caucasians from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. To determine whether the aging effect varies with ethnicity and sex, beta coefficients of age and confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated in each ethnicity–sex group using a bootstrap method and a regression analysis using the relative volume to intracranial volume as predicted. The betas or aging slopes largely were not significantly different between ethnicity and sex groups in most types of brain structures. However, ethnic differences between the two female groups were found in the brain, most cortical regions, and a few subcortical regions. Ethnic differences in brain aging are likely due in large part to genetic factors; thus, we compared carriers and non-carriers of a gene relevant to longevity and neurodegenerative diseases, such as apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4. The regions with ethnic differences in women also showed significant differences between Korean APOE ε4 non-carriers and Caucasian APOE ε4 carriers. Furthermore, Caucasian women showed significant APOE ε4 effects in the largest number of regions. These results illustrate that much of the ethnic differences in females may be explained by synergistic effects of ethnic background and APOE ε4 carrier status. Our results suggest that sex-dependent differences of aging between ethnic backgrounds may be due to ethnicity-dependent effects of genetic risk factors, such as APOE ε4. We also presented the normative information on volume estimates of the brain structures of the elderly Korean people in the subdivided age groups. This normative information of the aging brain stratified by ethnicity provides the age-related reference ranges quantified to replace visual judgment and facilitate precise clinical decision-making.</p>

<p>Background: Gray matter (GM) alterations in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) have been demonstrated in many neuroimaging studies using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). However, the inconsistent findings between studies cannot be applied to clinical practice as a neuroimaging biomarker. We performed a meta-analysis of VBM studies at a whole-brain level to investigate GM differences between PD patients with and without RBD.</p><p>Methods: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science from inception to November 2019 to identify eligible VBM studies. We adopted the latest Seed-based d Mapping with Permutation of Subject Images technique to quantitatively estimate the difference of regional GM volume between PD patients with and without RBD.</p><p>Results: We included five studies comprising 105 PD patients with RBD and 140 PD patients without RBD. The pooled meta-analysis revealed that PD patients with RBD showed a significant reduction of GM volume in the right superior temporal gyrus (STG) compared with those without RBD. This result was confirmed to be robust by the jackknife sensitivity analysis.</p><p>Conclusion: Our finding shows significantly and robustly reduced GM volume in the right STG in PD patients with RBD, preliminarily suggesting the association of GM atrophy in this brain region with the occurrence of RBD in PD patients.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59470">Male-predominant galanin mediates androgen-dependent aggressive chases in medaka</a></h4>

Recent studies in mice demonstrate that a subset of neurons in the medial preoptic area (MPOA) that express galanin play crucial roles in regulating parental behavior in both sexes. However, little information is available on the function of galanin in social behaviors in other species. Here, we report that, in medaka, a subset of MPOA galanin neurons occurred nearly exclusively in males, resulting from testicular androgen stimulation. Galanin-deficient medaka showed a greatly reduced incidence of male–male aggressive chases. Furthermore, while treatment of female medaka with androgen induced male-typical aggressive acts, galanin deficiency in these females attenuated the effect of androgen on chases. Given their male-biased and androgen-dependent nature, the subset of MPOA galanin neurons most likely mediate androgen-dependent male–male chases. Histological studies further suggested that variability in the projection targets of the MPOA galanin neurons may account for the species-dependent functional differences in these evolutionarily conserved neural substrates.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58731">Alterations of specific cortical GABAergic circuits underlie abnormal network activity in a mouse model of Down syndrome</a></h4>

Down syndrome (DS) results in various degrees of cognitive deficits. In DS mouse models, recovery of behavioral and neurophysiological deficits using GABA<sub>A</sub>R antagonists led to hypothesize an excessive activity of inhibitory circuits in this condition. Nonetheless, whether over-inhibition is present in DS and whether this is due to specific alterations of distinct GABAergic circuits is unknown. In the prefrontal cortex of Ts65Dn mice (a well-established DS model), we found that the dendritic synaptic inhibitory loop formed by somatostatin-positive Martinotti cells (MCs) and pyramidal neurons (PNs) was strongly enhanced, with no alteration in their excitability. Conversely, perisomatic inhibition from parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneurons was unaltered, but PV cells of DS mice lost their classical fast-spiking phenotype and exhibited increased excitability. These microcircuit alterations resulted in reduced pyramidal-neuron firing and increased phase locking to cognitive-relevant network oscillations <i>in vivo</i>. These results define important synaptic and circuit mechanisms underlying cognitive dysfunctions in DS.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58654">Changing how we evaluate research is difficult, but not impossible</a></h4>

The San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) was published in 2013 and described how funding agencies, institutions, publishers, organizations that supply metrics, and individual researchers could better evaluate the outputs of scientific research. Since then DORA has evolved into an active initiative that gives practical advice to institutions on new ways to assess and evaluate research. This article outlines a framework for driving institutional change that was developed at a meeting convened by DORA and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. The framework has four broad goals: understanding the obstacles to changes in the way research is assessed; experimenting with different approaches; creating a shared vision when revising existing policies and practices; and communicating that vision on campus and beyond.

Impaired fear extinction is one of the hallmark symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The roles of CaMKII have been not extensively studied in fear extinction and LTD. Here, we found PTSD susceptible mice exhibited significant up-regulation of CaMKII in the lateral amygdala (LA). Consistently, increasing CaMKII in LA profoundly not only caused PTSD-like symptoms such as impaired fear extinction and anxiety-like behaviors, but also attenuated NMDAR-dependent LTD at thalamo-LA synapses, reduced GluA1-Ser845/Ser831 dephosphorylation and AMPAR internalization. Suppressing the elevated CaMKII to normal level could completely reverse both PTSD-like symptoms and the impairments in LTD, GluA1-Ser845/Ser831 dephosphorylation, and AMPAR internalization. Intriguingly, deficits in AMPAR internalization and GluA1-Ser845/Ser831 dephosphorylation were detected not only after impaired fear extinction, but also after attenuated LTD Our results demonstrate for the first time GluA1-Ser845/Ser831 dephosphorylation and AMPAR internalization are molecular links between LTD and fear extinction, and suggest CaMKII may be a potential molecular determinant of PTSD.

Categorical judgments of otherwise identical phonemes are biased toward hearing words (i.e., "Ganong effect") suggesting lexical context influences perception of even basic speech primitives. Lexical biasing could manifest via late stage post-perceptual mechanisms related to decision or alternatively, top-down linguistic inference which acts on early perceptual coding. Here, we exploited the temporal sensitivity of EEG to resolve the spatiotemporal dynamics of these context-related influences on speech categorization. Listeners rapidly classified sounds from a /gi/ - /ki/ gradient presented in opposing word-nonword contexts (GIFT-kift vs. giss-KISS), designed to bias perception toward lexical items. Phonetic perception shifted toward the direction of words, establishing a robust Ganong effect behaviorally. ERPs revealed a neural analog of lexical biasing emerging within ~200 ms. Source analyses uncovered a distributed neural network supporting the Ganong including middle temporal gyrus (MTG), inferior parietal lobe (IPL), and middle frontal cortex. Yet, among Ganong-sensitive regions, only left MTG and IPL predicted behavioral susceptibility to lexical influence. Our findings confirm lexical status rapidly constrains sub-lexical categorical representations for speech within several hundred milliseconds but likely does so outside the purview of canonical "auditory-linguistic" brain areas.

Several past studies have shown that attention and perception can depend upon the phase of ongoing neural oscillations at stimulus onset. Here, we extend this idea to the memory domain. We tested the hypothesis that ongoing fluctuations in neural activity have an impact on memory encoding using a picture paired-associates task to gauge episodic memory performance. Experiment 1 capitalized on the principle of phase reset. We tested if subsequent memory performance fluctuates rhythmically, time-locked to a reset cue presented before the to-be-remembered pairs. We found indication that behavioral performance was periodically and selectively modulated at theta frequency (~4 Hz). In Experiment 2 we focused on prestimulus ongoing activity using scalp EEG recorded while participants performed the pair-associate task. We analyzed subsequent memory performance as a function of theta and alpha activity around the presentation of the to-be-remembered pairs. The results of the pre-registered analyses, using large electrode clusters and generic spectral ranges, returned null results of prestimulus phase-behavior correlation. However, we found that post-stimulus theta-power modulations in left frontal scalp predicted subsequent memory performance. This post-stimulus effect in theta power was used to guide a post-hoc prestimulus phase analysis, narrowed down to more precise scalp location and frequency. This analysis returned a correlation between prestimulus theta phase and subsequent memory. Altogether, these results suggest that the prestimulus theta activity at encoding has an impact on later memory performance.

DYT1 dystonia is a hereditary neurological disease caused by a heterozygous mutation in torsin A (TOR1A). While animal models provide insights into disease mechanisms, significant species-dependent differences exist since mice with the identical heterozygous mutation fail to show pathology. Here, we model DYT1 by using human patient-derived motor neurons. These neurons with the heterozygous TOR1A mutation show markedly thickened nuclear lamina, disrupted nuclear morphology, and impaired nucleocytoplasmic transport, whereas they lack the perinuclear blebs that are often observed in animal models. Importantly, we further uncover that the nuclear lamina protein LMNB1 is specifically dysregulated in expression and subcellular localization. LMNB1 downregulation can largely ameliorate all the cellular defects in DYT1 motor neurons. These results reveal the value of disease modeling with human neurons and provide novel molecular mechanisms underlying DYT1 dystonia and potentially other neurological diseases with impaired nucleocytoplasmic transport.

Spontaneous bursts of electrical activity in the developing auditory system arise within the cochlea prior to hearing onset and propagate through future sound processing circuits of the brain to promote maturation of auditory neurons. Studies in isolated cochleae revealed that this intrinsically generated activity is initiated by ATP release from inner supporting cells (ISCs), resulting in activation of purinergic autoreceptors, K+ efflux and subsequent depolarization of inner hair cells (IHCs). However, little is known about when this activity emerges or whether different mechanisms underlie distinct stages of development. Here we show that spontaneous electrical activity in mouse cochlea emerges within ISCs during the late embryonic period, preceding the onset of spontaneous correlated activity in IHCs and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), which begins at birth and follows a base to apex developmental gradient. At all developmental stages, pharmacological inhibition of P2Y1 metabotropic purinergic receptors dramatically reduced spontaneous activity in these three cell types. Moreover, in vivo imaging within the inferior colliculus of awake mice revealed that auditory neurons within future isofrequency zones exhibit coordinated neural activity at birth. The frequency of these discrete bursts increased progressively during the postnatal prehearing period, yet remained dependent on P2RY1. Analysis of mice with disrupted cholinergic signaling in the cochlea, indicate that this input modulates, rather than initiates, spontaneous activity before hearing onset. Thus, the auditory system uses a consistent mechanism involving ATP release from ISCs and activation of purinergic autoreceptors to elicit coordinated excitation of neurons that will process similar frequencies of sound.

Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) has been hypothesized to coordinate cross-frequency interactions of neuronal activity in the brain. However, little is known about the distribution of PAC across the human brain and the frequencies involved. Furthermore, it remains unclear to what extend PAC may reflect spurious cross-frequency coupling induced by physiological artifacts or rhythmic non-sinusoidal signals with higher harmonics. Here, we combined MEG, source-reconstruction and different measures of cross-frequency coupling to systematically characterize PAC across the resting human brain. We show that cross-frequency measures of phase-amplitude, phase-phase, and amplitude-amplitude coupling are all sensitive to signals with higher harmonics. In conjunction, these measures allow to distinguish harmonic and non- harmonic PAC. Based on these insights, we found no evidence for non-harmonic PAC in resting-state MEG. Instead, we found cortically and spectrally wide-spread PAC driven by harmonic signals. Furthermore, we show how physiological artifacts and spectral leakage cause spurious PAC across wide frequency ranges. Our result clarify how different measures of cross-frequency interactions can be combined to characterize PAC and cast doubt on the presence of prominent non-harmonic phase-amplitude coupling in human resting-state MEG.

Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is often caused by an adenine to guanine mutation at m.3243 (m.3243A&gt;G) of the MT-TL1 gene (tRNAleu(UUR)). To understand how this mutation affects the nervous system, we differentiated human induced-pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into excitatory neurons with normal (low heteroplasmy) and impaired (high heteroplasmy) mitochondrial function from MELAS patients with the m.3243A&gt;G mutation. We combined micro-electrode array (MEA) measurements with RNA sequencing (MEA-seq) and found that the m.3243A&gt;G mutation affects expression of genes involved in mitochondrial respiration- and presynaptic function, as well as non-cell autonomous processes in co-cultured astrocytes. Finally, we show that the clinical II stage drug sonlicromanol (KH176) improved neuronal network activity in a patient-specific manner when treatment is initiated early in development. This was intricately linked with changes in the neural transcriptome. Overall, MEA-seq is a powerful approach to identify mechanisms underlying the m.3243A&gt;G mutation and to study the effect of pharmacological interventions in iPSC-derived neurons.

Diaphanous (DIAPH) 3 is a member of the formin proteins that have the capacity to nucleate and elongate actin filaments and therefore, to remodel the cytoskeleton. DIAPH3 is essential for cytokinesis as its dysfunction impairs the contractile ring and produces multinucleated cells. Here, we report that DIAPH3 localizes at the centrosome during mitosis and regulates the assembly and polarity of the mitotic spindle. DIAPH3-deficient cells display disorganized cytoskeleton, multipolar spindles, and supernumerary centrosomes. DIAPH3-deficiency disrupts the expression and/or stability of microtubule-associated proteins SPAG5 and KNSTRN. SPAG5 and DIAPH3 have similar expression patterns in the developing brain and overlapping subcellular localization during mitosis. Knockdown of SPAG5 phenocopies the DIAPH3 deficiency, whereas its overexpression rescues the DIAH3 phenotype. Conditional inactivation of Diaph3 in the cerebral cortex profoundly disrupts neurogenesis depleting cortical progenitors and neurons; and leading to cortical malformation and autistic-like behavior. Our data uncover uncharacterized functions of DIAPH3 and provide evidence that this protein belongs to a molecular toolbox that links microtubule dynamics during mitosis to aneuploidy, cell death, fate determination defects, and cortical malformation.

Objectives: The last years there has been significant interest in attempting to recover the temporal envelope of a speech signal from the neural response to investigate neural speech processing. The research focus is now broadening from neural speech processing in normal-hearing listeners towards hearing-impaired listeners. When testing hearing-impaired listeners speech has to be amplified to resemble the effect of a hearing aid and compensate peripheral hearing loss. Until today, it is not known with certainty how or if neural speech tracking is influenced by sound amplification. As these higher intensities could influence the outcome, we investigated the influence of stimulus intensity on neural speech tracking. Design: We recorded the electroencephalogram (EEG) of 20 normal-hearing participants while they listened to a narrated story. The story was presented at intensities from 10 to 80~dB~A. To investigate the brain responses, we analyzed neural tracking of the speech envelope by reconstructing the envelope from EEG using a linear decoder and by correlating the reconstructed with the actual envelope. We investigated the delta (0.5-4 Hz) and the theta (4-8 Hz) band for each intensity. We also investigated the latencies and amplitudes of the responses in more detail using temporal response functions which are the estimated linear response functions between the stimulus envelope and the EEG. Results: Neural envelope tracking is dependent on stimulus intensity in both the TRF and envelope reconstruction analysis. However, provided that the decoder is applied on data of the same stimulus intensity as it was trained on, envelope reconstruction is robust to stimulus intensity. In addition, neural envelope tracking in the delta (but not theta) band seems to relate to speech intelligibility. Similar to the linear decoder analysis, TRF amplitudes and latencies are dependent on stimulus intensity: The amplitude of peak 1 (30-50 ms) increases and the latency of peak 2 (140-160 ms) decreases with increasing stimulus intensity. Conclusion: Although brain responses are influenced by stimulus intensity, neural envelope tracking is robust to stimulus intensity when using the same intensity to test and train the decoder. Therefore we can assume that intensity is not a confound when testing hearing-impaired participants with amplified speech using the linear decoder approach. In addition, neural envelope tracking in the delta band appears to be correlated with speech intelligibility, showing the potential of neural envelope tracking as an objective measure of speech intelligibility.

A central question in neuroscience is how cognition and consciousness arise from human brain activity. Here, we decompose cortical dynamics of resting-state functional MRI into their constituent elements: the harmonics of the human connectome. Mapping a wide spectrum of consciousness onto these elementary brain states reveals a generalisable connectome harmonic signature of loss of consciousness, whether due to anaesthesia or severe brain injury. Remarkably, its mirror-reversed image corresponds to the harmonic signature of the psychedelic state induced by ketamine or LSD, identifying meaningful relationships between neurobiology, brain function, and conscious experience. The repertoire of connectome harmonics further provides a fine-tuned indicator of level of consciousness, sensitive to differences in anaesthetic dose and clinically relevant sub-categories of patients with disorders of consciousness. Overall, we reveal that the emergence of consciousness from human brain dynamics follows the same universal principles shared by a multitude of physical and biological phenomena: the mathematics of harmonic modes.

BackgroundHeart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback has a beneficial impact on perceived stress and emotion regulation. However, its impact on brain function is still unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of an 8-week HRV-biofeedback intervention on functional brain connectivity in healthy subjects.

MethodsHRV biofeedback was carried out in five sessions per week, including four at home and one in our lab. A control group played jump nrun games instead of the training. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was conducted before and after the intervention in both groups. To compute resting state functional connectivity (RSFC), we defined regions of interest in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) and a total of 260 independent anatomical regions for network-based analysis. Changes of RSFC of the VMPFC to other brain regions were compared between groups. Temporal changes of HRV during the resting state recording were correlated to dynamic functional connectivity of the VMPFC.

ResultsFirst, we corroborated the role of the VMPFC in cardiac autonomic regulation. We found that temporal changes of HRV were correlated to dynamic changes of prefrontal connectivity, especially to the middle cingulate cortex, left anterior insula, right amygdala, supplementary motor area, dorsal and ventral lateral prefrontal regions. The biofeedback group showed a drop in heart rate by 5.5 beats/min and an increased RMSSD as a measure of HRV by 10.1ms (33%) after the intervention. Functional connectivity of the VMPFC increased mainly to the right anterior insula, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex after biofeedback intervention when compared to changes in the control group. Network-based statistic showed that biofeedback had an influence on a broad functional network of brain regions.

ConclusionOur results show that increased vagal modulation induced by HRV-biofeedback is accompanied by changes in functional brain connectivity during resting state.

<p>by Chen Hu, Philippe Domenech, Mathias Pessiglione</p>

Standard neuroeconomic decision theory assumes that choice is based on a value comparison process, independent from how information about alternative options is collected. Here, we investigate the opposite intuition that preferences are dynamically shaped as options are sampled, through iterative covert pairwise comparisons. Our model builds on two lines of research, one suggesting that a natural frame of comparison for the brain is between default and alternative options, the other suggesting that comparisons spread preferences between options. We therefore assumed that during sequential option sampling, people would 1) covertly compare every new alternative to the current best and 2) update their values such that the winning (losing) option receives a positive (negative) bonus. We confronted this “covert pairwise comparison” model to models derived from standard decision theory and from known memory effects. Our model provided the best account of human choice behavior in a novel task where participants (n = 92 in total) had to browse through a sequence of items (food, music or movie) of variable length and ultimately select their favorite option. Consistently, the order of option presentation, which was manipulated by design, had a significant influence on the eventual choice: the best option was more likely to be chosen when it came earlier in the sequence, because it won more covert comparisons (hence a greater total bonus). Our study provides a mechanistic understanding of how the option sampling process shapes economic preference, which should be integrated into decision theory.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Vlknqot9jVc" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/MrGQspFPUS8/article">Rapid evolution of the primate larynx?</a></h4>

Tissue vibrations in the larynx produce most sounds that comprise vocal communication in mammals. Larynx morphology is thus predicted to be a key target for selection, particularly in species with highly developed vocal communication systems. Here, we present a novel database of digitally modeled scanned larynges from 55 different mammalian species, representing a wide range of body sizes in the primate and carnivoran orders. Using phylogenetic comparative methods, we demonstrate that the primate larynx has evolved more rapidly than the carnivoran larynx, resulting in a pattern of larger size and increased deviation from expected allometry with body size. These results imply fundamental differences between primates and carnivorans in the balance of selective forces that constrain larynx size and highlight an evolutionary flexibility in primates that may help explain why we have developed complex and diverse uses of the vocal organ for communication.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/MrGQspFPUS8" width="1" />

Zinc starvation in mycobacteria leads to remodeling of ribosomes, in which multiple ribosomal (r-) proteins containing the zinc-binding CXXC motif are replaced by their motif-free paralogues, collectively called C− r-proteins. We previously reported that the 70S C− ribosome is exclusively targeted for hibernation by mycobacterial-specific protein Y (Mpy), which binds...<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/ZuIECDNdqMA" width="1" />

<p>Working Memory is the brain module that holds and manipulates information
online. In this work, we design a hybrid model in which a simple feed-forward
network is coupled to a balanced random network via a read-write vector called
the interface vector. First, we consider some simple memory binding tasks in
which the output is set to be a copy of the given input and a selective
sequence of previous inputs online. Next, we design a more complex binding task
based on a cue that encodes binding relations. The important result is that our
dual-component model of working memory shows good performance with learning
restricted to the feed-forward component only. Here we take advantage of the
random network property without learning. To our knowledge, this is the first
time that random networks as a flexible memory is shown to play an important
role in online binding tasks. We may interpret our results as a candidate model
of working memory in which the feed-forward network learns to interact with the
temporary storage random network as an attentional-controlling executive
system.

<p>Automatic industrial scheduling, aiming at optimizing the sequence of jobs
over limited resources, is widely needed in manufacturing industries. However,
existing scheduling systems heavily rely on heuristic algorithms, which either
generate ineffective solutions or compute inefficiently when job scale
increases. Thus, it is of great importance to develop new large-scale
algorithms that are not only efficient and effective, but also capable of
satisfying complex constraints in practice. In this paper, we propose a Bilevel
Deep reinforcement learning Scheduler, \textit{BDS}, in which the higher level
is responsible for exploring an initial global sequence, whereas the lower
level is aiming at exploitation for partial sequence refinements, and the two
levels are connected by a sliding-window sampling mechanism. In the
implementation, a Double Deep Q Network (DDQN) is used in the upper level and
Graph Pointer Network (GPN) lies within the lower level. After the theoretical
guarantee for the convergence of BDS, we evaluate it in an industrial automatic
warehouse scenario, with job number up to $5000$ in each production line. It is
shown that our proposed BDS significantly outperforms two most used heuristics,
three strong deep networks, and another bilevel baseline approach. In
particular, compared with the most used greedy-based heuristic algorithm in
real world which takes nearly an hour, our BDS can decrease the makespan by
27.5\%, 28.6\% and 22.1\% for 3 largest datasets respectively, with
computational time less than 200 seconds.

<p>In the past decades, the rapid growth of computer and database technologies
has led to the rapid growth of large-scale datasets. On the other hand, data
mining applications with high dimensional datasets that require high speed and
accuracy are rapidly increasing. An important issue with these applications is
the curse of dimensionality, where the number of features is much higher than
the number of patterns. One of the dimensionality reduction approaches is
feature selection that can increase the accuracy of the data mining task and
reduce its computational complexity. The feature selection method aims at
selecting a subset of features with the lowest inner similarity and highest
relevancy to the target class. It reduces the dimensionality of the data by
eliminating irrelevant, redundant, or noisy data. In this paper, a comparative
analysis of different feature selection methods is presented, and a general
categorization of these methods is performed. Moreover, in this paper,
state-of-the-art swarm intelligence are studied, and the recent feature
selection methods based on these algorithms are reviewed. Furthermore, the
strengths and weaknesses of the different studied swarm intelligence-based
feature selection methods are evaluated.

<p>This paper has two purposes. One is to demonstrate contextuality analysis of
systems of epistemic random variables. The other is to evaluate the performance
of a new, hierarchical version of the measure of (non)contextuality introduced
in earlier publications. As objects of analysis we use impossible figures of
the kind created by the Penroses and Escher. We make no assumptions as to how
an impossible figure is perceived, taking it instead as a fixed physical object
allowing one of several deterministic descriptions. Systems of epistemic random
variables are obtained by probabilistically mixing these deterministic systems.
This probabilistic mixture reflects our uncertainty or lack of knowledge rather
than random variability in the frequentist sense.

<p>Dynamic optimisation occurs in a variety of real-world problems. To tackle
these problems, evolutionary algorithms have been extensively used due to their
effectiveness and minimum design effort. However, for dynamic problems, extra
mechanisms are required on top of standard evolutionary algorithms. Among them,
diversity mechanisms have proven to be competitive in handling dynamism, and
recently, the use of neural networks have become popular for this purpose.
Considering the complexity of using neural networks in the process compared to
simple diversity mechanisms, we investigate whether they are competitive and
the possibility of integrating them to improve the results. However, for a fair
comparison, we need to consider the same time budget for each algorithm. Thus,
instead of the usual number of fitness evaluations as the measure for the
available time between changes, we use wall clock timing. The results show the
significance of the improvement when integrating the neural network and
diversity mechanisms depends on the type and the frequency of changes.
Moreover, we observe that for differential evolution, having a proper diversity
in population when using neural networks plays a key role in the neural
network's ability to improve the results.

<p>In the picture-word interference paradigm, participants name pictures while
ignoring a written or spoken distractor word. Naming times to the pictures are
slowed down by the presence of the distractor word. Various properties of the
distractor modulate this slow down, for example naming times are shorter with
frequent vs. infrequent distractors. Building on this line of research, the
present study investigates in more detail the impact of distractor and target
word properties on picture naming times. We report the results of several
Bayesian meta-analyses, based on 35 datasets. The aim of the first analysis was
to obtain an estimation of the size of the distractor frequency effect, and of
its precision, in typical picture-word interference experiments where this
variable is not manipulated. The analysis shows that a one-unit increase in log
frequency results in response times to the pictures decreasing by about 4ms
(95% Credible Interval: [-6, -2]). With the second and third analyses, we show
that after accounting for the effect of frequency, two variables known to
influence processing times in visual word processing tasks also influence
picture naming times: distractor length and orthographic neighborhood. Finally,
we found that distractor word frequency and target word frequency interact; the
effect of distractor frequency decreases as the frequency of the target word
increases. We discuss the theoretical and methodological implications of these
findings, as well as the importance of obtaining high-precision estimates of
experimental effects.

a single input-dependent matrix as its only nonlinearity. The mathematical
simplicity of this architecture allows a detailed analysis of its behaviour,
providing robustness guarantees via Lipschitz bounds. Despite its simplicity, a
single matrix exponential layer already provides universal approximation

<p>Databases of directed- and weighted- connectivity for mouse, macaque and
marmoset monkeys, have recently become available and begun to be used to build
dynamical models. A hierarchical organization can be defined based on laminar
patterns of cortical connections, possibly improved by thalamocortical
projections. A large-scale model of the macaque cortex endowed with a laminar
structure accounts for layer-dependent and frequency-modulated interplays
between bottom-up and top-down processes. Signal propagation in a version of
the model with spiking neurons displays a threshold of stimulus amplitude for
the activity to gain access to the prefrontal cortex, reminiscent of the
ignition phenomenon associated with conscious perception. These two examples
illustrate how connectomics may inform theory leading to discoveries.
Computational modeling raises open questions for future empirical research, in
a back-and-forth collaboration of experimentalists and theorists.

<p>In this paper a randomness evaluation of a block cipher for secure image
communication is presented. The GFHT cipher is a genetic algorithm, that
combines gene fusion (GF) and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) both inspired from
antibiotic resistance in bacteria. The symmetric encryption key is generated by
four pairs of chromosomes with multi-layer random sequences. The encryption
starts by a GF of the principal key-agent in a single block, then HGT performs
obfuscation where the genes are pixels and the chromosomes are the rows and
columns. A Salt extracted from the image hash-value is used to implement
one-time pad (OTP) scheme, hence a modification of one pixel generates a
different encryption key without changing the main passphrase or key.
Therefore, an extreme avalanche effect of 99% is achieved. Randomness
evaluation based on random matrix theory, power spectral density, avalanche
effect, 2D auto-correlation, pixels randomness tests and chi-square hypotheses
testing show that encrypted images adopt the statistical behavior of uniform
white noise; hence validating the theoretical model by experimental results.
Moreover, performance comparison with chaos-genetic ciphers shows the merit of
the GFHT algorithm.

<p>Bio-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs), operating with asynchronous
binary signals (or spikes) distributed over time, can potentially lead to
greater computational efficiency on event-driven hardware. The state-of-the-art
SNNs suffer from high inference latency, resulting from inefficient input
encoding, and sub-optimal settings of the neuron parameters (firing threshold,
and membrane leak). We propose DIET-SNN, a low latency deep spiking network
that is trained with gradient descent to optimize the membrane leak and the
firing threshold along with other network parameters (weights). The membrane
leak and threshold for each layer of the SNN are optimized with end-to-end
backpropagation to achieve competitive accuracy at reduced latency. The analog
pixel values of an image are directly applied to the input layer of DIET-SNN
without the need to convert to spike-train. The information is converted into
spikes in the first convolutional layer where leaky-integrate-and-fire (LIF)
neurons integrate the weighted inputs and generate an output spike when the
membrane potential crosses the trained firing threshold. The trained membrane
leak controls the flow of input information and attenuates irrelevant inputs to
increase the activation sparsity in the convolutional and linear layers of the
network. The reduced latency combined with high activation sparsity provides
large improvements in computational efficiency. We evaluate DIET-SNN on image
classification tasks from CIFAR and ImageNet datasets on VGG and ResNet
architectures. We achieve top-1 accuracy of 66.52% with 25 timesteps (inference
latency) on the ImageNet dataset with 3.1X less compute energy than an
equivalent standard ANN. Additionally, DIET-SNN performs 5-100X faster
inference compared to other state-of-the-art SNN models.

<p>In recent years the field of genetic programming has made significant
advances towards automatic programming. Research and development of
contemporary program synthesis methods, such as PushGP and Grammar Guided
Genetic Programming, can produce programs that solve problems typically
assigned in introductory academic settings. These problems focus on a narrow,
predetermined set of simple data structures, basic control flow patterns, and
primitive, non-overlapping data types (without, for example, inheritance or
composite types). Few, if any, genetic programming methods for program
synthesis have convincingly demonstrated the capability of synthesizing
programs that use arbitrary data types, data structures, and specifications
that are drawn from existing codebases. In this paper, we introduce Code
Building Genetic Programming (CBGP) as a framework within which this can be
done, by leveraging programming language features such as reflection and
first-class specifications. CBGP produces a computational graph that can be
executed or translated into source code of a host language. To demonstrate the
novel capabilities of CBGP, we present results on new benchmarks that use
non-primitive, polymorphic data types as well as some standard program
synthesis benchmarks.

<p>Much has been said about the fusion of bio-inspired optimization algorithms
and Deep Learning models for several purposes: from the discovery of network
topologies and hyper-parametric configurations with improved performance for a
given task, to the optimization of the model's parameters as a replacement for
gradient-based solvers. Indeed, the literature is rich in proposals showcasing
the application of assorted nature-inspired approaches for these tasks. In this
work we comprehensively review and critically examine contributions made so far
based on three axes, each addressing a fundamental question in this research
avenue: a) optimization and taxonomy (Why?), including a historical
perspective, definitions of optimization problems in Deep Learning, and a
taxonomy associated with an in-depth analysis of the literature, b) critical
methodological analysis (How?), which together with two case studies, allows us
to address learned lessons and recommendations for good practices following the
analysis of the literature, and c) challenges and new directions of research
(What can be done, and what for?). In summary, three axes - optimization and
taxonomy, critical analysis, and challenges - which outline a complete vision
of a merger of two technologies drawing up an exciting future for this area of
fusion research.

<p>GPUs are used for training, inference, and tuning the machine learning
models. However, Deep Neural Network (DNN) vary widely in their ability to
exploit the full power of high-performance GPUs. Spatial sharing of GPU enables
multiplexing several DNNs on the GPU and can improve GPU utilization, thus
improving throughput and lowering latency. DNN models given just the right
amount of GPU resources can still provide low inference latency, just as much
as dedicating all of the GPU for their inference task. An approach to improve
DNN inference is tuning of the DNN model. Autotuning frameworks find the
optimal low-level implementation for a certain target device based on the
trained machine learning model, thus reducing the DNN's inference latency and
increasing inference throughput. We observe an interdependency between the
tuned model and its inference latency. A DNN model tuned with specific GPU
resources provides the best inference latency when inferred with close to the
same amount of GPU resources. While a model tuned with the maximum amount of
the GPU's resources has poorer inference latency once the GPU resources are
limited for inference. On the other hand, a model tuned with an appropriate
amount of GPU resources still achieves good inference latency across a wide
range of GPU resource availability. We explore the causes that impact the
tuning of a model at different amounts of GPU resources. We present many
techniques to maximize resource utilization and improve tuning performance. We
enable controlled spatial sharing of GPU to multiplex several tuning
applications on the GPU. We scale the tuning server instances and shard the
tuning model across multiple client instances for concurrent tuning of
different operators of a model, achieving better GPU multiplexing. With our
improvements, we decrease DNN autotuning time by up to 75 percent and increase
throughput by a factor of 5.

<p>The selection of features is an essential data preprocessing stage in data
mining. The core principle of feature selection seems to be to pick a subset of
possible features by excluding features with almost no predictive information
as well as highly associated redundant features. In the past several years, a
variety of meta-heuristic methods were introduced to eliminate redundant and
irrelevant features as much as possible from high-dimensional datasets. Among
the main disadvantages of present meta-heuristic based approaches is that they
are often neglecting the correlation between a set of selected features. In
this article, for the purpose of feature selection, the authors propose a
genetic algorithm based on community detection, which functions in three steps.
The feature similarities are calculated in the first step. The features are
classified by community detection algorithms into clusters throughout the
second step. In the third step, features are picked by a genetic algorithm with
a new community-based repair operation. Nine benchmark classification problems
were analyzed in terms of the performance of the presented approach. Also, the
authors have compared the efficiency of the proposed approach with the findings
from four available algorithms for feature selection. The findings indicate
that the new approach continuously yields improved classification accuracy.

<p>This paper proposes a novel Extended Particle Swarm Optimization model (EPSO)
that potentially enhances the search process of PSO for optimization problem.
Evidently, gene expression profiles are significantly important measurement
factor in molecular biology that is used in medical diagnosis of cancer types.
The challenge to certain classification methodologies for gene expression
profiles lies in the thousands of features recorded for each sample. A modified
Wrapper feature selection model is applied with the aim of addressing the gene
classification challenge by replacing its randomness approach with EPSO and PSO
respectively. EPSO is initializing the random size of the population and
dividing them into two groups in order to promote the exploration and reduce
the probability of falling in stagnation. Experimentally, EPSO has required
less processing time to select the optimal features (average of 62.14 sec) than
PSO (average of 95.72 sec). Furthermore, EPSO accuracy has provided better
classification results (start from 54% to 100%) than PSO (start from 52% to
96%).

<p>Humans flexibly solve new problems that differ qualitatively from those they
were trained on. This ability to generalize is supported by learned concepts
that capture structure common across different problems. Here we develop a
naturalistic drawing task to study how humans rapidly acquire structured prior
knowledge. The task requires drawing visual objects that share underlying
structure, based on a set of composable geometric rules. We show that people
spontaneously learn abstract drawing procedures that support generalization,
and propose a model of how learners can discover these reusable drawing
programs. Trained in the same setting as humans, and constrained to produce
efficient motor actions, this model discovers new drawing routines that
transfer to test objects and resemble learned features of human sequences.
These results suggest that two principles guiding motor program induction in
the model - abstraction (general programs that ignore object-specific details)
and compositionality (recombining previously learned programs) - are key for
explaining how humans learn structured internal representations that guide
flexible reasoning and learning.

<p>Current expectations from training deep learning models with gradient-based
methods include: 1) transparency; 2) high convergence rates; 3) high inductive
biases. While the state-of-art methods with adaptive learning rate schedules
are fast, they still fail to meet the other two requirements. We suggest
reconsidering neural network models in terms of single-species population
dynamics where adaptation comes naturally from open-ended processes of "growth"
and "harvesting". We show that the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with two
balanced pre-defined values of per capita growth and harvesting rates
outperform the most common adaptive gradient methods in all of the three
requirements.

simple visual patterns composed of horizontal and vertical bars sensed by a
Dynamic Vision Sensor, using a local spike-based plasticity rule. During
recognition, the network classifies the pattern's identity while at the same
time estimating its location and scale. We build on previous work that used
learning with neuromorphic hardware in the loop and demonstrate that the
proposed network can properly operate with on-chip learning, demonstrating a
complete neuromorphic pattern learning and recognition setup. Our results show
that the network is robust against noise on the input (no accuracy drop when
adding 130% noise) and against up to 20% noise in the neuron parameters.

<p>Nowadays we witness a miniaturisation trend in the semiconductor industry
backed up by groundbreaking discoveries and designs in nanoscale
characterisation and fabrication. To facilitate the trend and produce ever
smaller, faster and cheaper computing devices, the size of nanoelectronic
devices is now reaching the scale of atoms or molecules - a technical goal
undoubtedly demanding for novel devices. Following the trend, we explore an
unconventional route of implementing a reservoir computing on a single protein
molecule and introduce neuromorphic connectivity with a small-world networking
property. We have chosen Izhikevich spiking neurons as elementary processors,
corresponding to the atoms of verotoxin protein, and its molecule as a
'hardware' architecture of the communication networks connecting the
processors. We apply on a single readout layer various training methods in a
supervised fashion to investigate whether the molecular structured Reservoir
Computing (RC) system is capable to deal with machine learning benchmarks. We
start with the Remote Supervised Method, based on
Spike-Timing-Dependent-Plasticity, and carry on with linear regression and
scaled conjugate gradient back-propagation training methods. The RC network is
evaluated as a proof-of-concept on the handwritten digit images from the MNIST
dataset and demonstrates acceptable classification accuracy in comparison with
other similar approaches.

<p>Although deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved fantastic success in
various scenarios, it's difficult to employ DNNs on many systems with limited
resources due to their high energy consumption. It's well known that spiking
neural networks (SNNs) are attracting more attention due to the capability of
energy-efficient computing. Recently many works focus on converting DNNs into
SNNs with little accuracy degradation in image classification on MNIST,
CIFAR-10/100. However, few studies on shortening latency, and spike-based
modules of more challenging tasks on complex datasets. In this paper, we focus
on the similarity matching method of deep spike features and present a first
spike-based Siamese network for object tracking called SiamSNN. Specifically,
we propose a hybrid spiking similarity matching method with membrane potential
and time step to evaluate the response map between exemplar and candidate
images, with the same function as correlation layer in SiamFC. Then we present
a coding scheme for utilizing temporal information of spike trains, and
implement it in output spiking layers to improve the performance and shorten
the latency. Our experiments show that SiamSNN achieves short latency and low
precision loss of the original SiamFC on the tracking datasets OTB-2013,
OTB-2015 and VOT2016. Moreover, SiamSNN achieves real-time (50 FPS) and
extremely low energy consumption on TrueNorth.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10882">A Quantized Representation of Intertemporal Choice in the Brain. (arXiv:2002.10882v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</a></h4>

<p>Value [4][5] is typically modeled using a continuous representation (i.e., a
Real number). A discrete representation of value has recently been postulated
[6]. A quantized representation of probability in the brain was also posited
and supported by experimental data [7]. Value and probability are inter-related
via Prospect Theory [4][5]. In this paper, we hypothesize that intertemporal
choices may also be quantized. For example, people may treat (or discount) 16
days indifferently to 17 days. To test this, we analyzed an intertemporal task
by using 2 novel models: quantized hyperbolic discounting, and quantized
exponential discounting. Our work here is a re-examination of the behavioral
data previously collected for an fMRI study [8]. Both quantized hyperbolic and
quantized exponential models were compared using AIC and BIC tests. We found
that 13/20 participants were best fit to the quantized exponential model, while
the remaining 7/20 were best fit to the quantized hyperbolic model. Overall,
15/20 participants were best fit to models with a 5-bit precision (i.e., 2^5 =
32 steps). In conclusion, regardless of hyperbolic or exponential, quantized
versions of these models are better fit to the experimental data than their
continuous forms. We finally outline some potential applications of our
findings.

<p>There is an ongoing debate as to whether ketamine anesthesia suppresses neurophysiologic complexity at doses sufficient for surgical anesthesia, with previous human studies reporting surrogates of both suppressed and preserved levels of cortical complexity. However, these studies have not assessed cortical dynamics in higher gamma frequencies, which have previously been demonstrated to correlate with the level of consciousness during anesthesia. In this study, we used Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZc) to characterize frontal and parietal electroencephalographic complexity (0.5–175 Hz, 0.5–55 Hz, 65–175 Hz) before, during, and after ketamine or propofol anesthesia in the rat. To control for the potential influence of spectral changes in complexity estimation, LZc was normalized with phase-shuffled surrogate data. We demonstrate that ketamine and propofol anesthesia were characterized by a significant reduction in broadband (0.5–175 Hz) LZc. Further analysis showed that while the reduction of LZc during ketamine anesthesia was significant in 65–175 Hz range, during propofol anesthesia, a significant decrease was observed in 0.5–55 Hz bandwidth. LZc in broadband and 0.5–55 Hz range showed a significant increase during emergence from ketamine anesthesia. Phase-shuffled normalized LZc revealed that (1) decrease in complexity during ketamine and propofol anesthesia—not increase in complexity during emergence—were dissociable from the influence of spectral changes, and (2) reduced LZc during ketamine anesthesia was present across all three bandwidths. Ketamine anesthesia was characterized by reduced complexity in high gamma bandwidth, as reflected in both raw and phase-shuffled normalized LZc, which suggests that reduced high gamma complexity is a neurophysiological feature of ketamine anesthesia.</p>

<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that results in social-communication impairments, as well as restricted and repetitive behaviors. Moreover, ASD is more prevalent in males, with a male to female ratio of 4 to 1. Although the underlying etiology of ASD is generally unknown, recent advances in genome sequencing have facilitated the identification of a host of associated genes. Among these, synaptic proteins such as cell adhesion molecules have been strongly linked with ASD. Interestingly, many large genome sequencing studies exclude sex chromosomes, which leads to a shift in focus toward autosomal genes as targets for ASD research. However, there are many genes on the X chromosome that encode synaptic proteins, including strong candidate genes. Here, we review findings regarding two members of the neuroligin (NLGN) family of postsynaptic adhesion molecules, NLGN3 and NLGN4. Neuroligins have multiple isoforms (NLGN1-4), which are both autosomal and sex-linked. The sex-linked genes, NLGN3 and NLGN4, are both on the X chromosome and were among the first few genes to be linked with ASD and intellectual disability (ID). In addition, there is a less studied human neuroligin on the Y chromosome, NLGN4Y, which forms an X-Y pair with NLGN4X. We will discuss recent findings of these neuroligin isoforms regarding function at the synapse in both rodent models and human-derived differentiated neurons, and highlight the exciting challenges moving forward to a better understanding of ASD/ID.</p>

<p>The presynaptic compartment of the chemical synapse is a small, yet extremely complex structure. Considering its size, most methods of optical microscopy are not able to resolve its nanoarchitecture and dynamics. Thus, its ultrastructure could only be studied by electron microscopy. In the last decade, new methods of optical superresolution microscopy have emerged allowing the study of cellular structures and processes at the nanometer scale. While this is a welcome addition to the experimental arsenal, it has necessitated careful analysis and interpretation to ensure the data obtained remains artifact-free. In this article we review the application of nanoscopic techniques to the study of the synapse and the progress made over the last decade with a particular focus on the presynapse. We find to our surprise that progress has been limited, calling for imaging techniques and probes that allow dense labeling, multiplexing, longer imaging times, higher temporal resolution, while at least maintaining the spatial resolution achieved thus far.</p>

<p>A GWAS study recently demonstrated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human GLRB gene of individuals with a prevalence for agoraphobia. GLRB encodes the glycine receptor (GlyRs) β subunit. The identified SNPs are localized within the gene flanking regions (3′ and 5′ UTRs) and intronic regions. It was suggested that these nucleotide polymorphisms modify GlyRs expression and phenotypic behavior in humans contributing to an anxiety phenotype as a mild form of hyperekplexia. Hyperekplexia is a human neuromotor disorder with massive startle phenotypes due to mutations in genes encoding GlyRs subunits. GLRA1 mutations have been more commonly observed than GLRB mutations. If an anxiety phenotype contributes to the hyperekplexia disease pattern has not been investigated yet. Here, we compared two mouse models harboring either a mutation in the murine Glra1 or Glrb gene with regard to anxiety and startle phenotypes. Homozygous spasmodic animals carrying a Glra1 point mutation (alanine 52 to serine) displayed abnormally enhanced startle responses. Moreover, spasmodic mice exhibited significant changes in fear-related behaviors (freezing, rearing and time spent on back) analyzed during the startle paradigm, even in a neutral context. Spastic mice exhibit reduced expression levels of the full-length GlyRs β subunit due to aberrant splicing of the Glrb gene. Heterozygous animals appear normal without an obvious behavioral phenotype and thus might reflect the human situation analyzed in the GWAS study on agoraphobia and startle. In contrast to spasmodic mice, heterozygous spastic animals revealed no startle phenotype in a neutral as well as a conditioning context. Other mechanisms such as a modulatory function of the GlyRs β subunit within glycinergic circuits in neuronal networks important for fear and fear-related behavior may exist. Possibly, in human additional changes in fear and fear-related circuits either due to gene-gene interactions e.g., with GLRA1 genes or epigenetic factors are necessary to create the agoraphobia and in particular the startle phenotype.</p>

<p>Loss of vestibular function is known to cause spatial memory deficits and hippocampal dysfunction, in terms of impaired place cell firing and abnormal theta rhythm. Based on these results, it has been of interest to determine whether vestibular loss also affects the development and maintenance of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus. This article summarizes and critically reviews the studies of hippocampal LTP following a vestibular loss and its relationship to NMDA receptor expression, that have been published to date. Although the available in vitro studies indicate that unilateral vestibular loss (UVL) results in reduced hippocampal field potentials in CA1 and the dentate gyrus (DG), the in vivo studies involving bilateral vestibular loss (BVL) do not. This may be due to the differences between UVL and BVL or it could be a result of in vitro/in vivo differences. One in vitro study reported a decrease in LTP in hippocampal slices following UVL; however, the two available in vivo studies have reported different results: either no effect or an increase in EPSP/Population Spike (ES) potentiation. This discrepancy may be due to the different high-frequency stimulation (HFS) paradigms used to induce LTP. The increased ES potentiation following BVL may be related to an increase in synaptic NMDA receptors, possibly increasing the flow of vestibular input coming into CA1, with a loss of selectivity. This might cause increased excitability and synaptic noise, which might lead to a degradation of spatial learning and memory.</p>

Background<p>The precise physiopathological association between the courses of neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remains unclear. This study sought to comprehensively investigate the distribution characteristics of gray matter atrophy in middle-aged T2DM patients with newly diagnosed mild cognitive impairment (MCI).</p>Methods<p>Four groups, including 28 patients with early-onset MCI, 28 patients with T2DM, 28 T2DM patients with early-onset MCI (T2DM-MCI), and 28 age-, sex-, and education-matched healthy controls underwent three-dimensional high-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging. Cortical and subcortical gray matter volumes were calculated, and a structural covariance method was used to evaluate the morphological relationships within the default mode network (DMN).</p>Results<p>Overlapped and unique cortical/subcortical gray matter atrophy was found in patients with MCI, T2DM and T2DM-MCI in our study, and patients with T2DM-MCI showed lower volumes in several areas than patients with MCI or T2DM. Volume loss in subcortical areas (including the thalamus, putamen, and hippocampus), but not in cortical areas, was related to cognitive impairment in patients with MCI and T2DM-MCI. No associations between biochemical measurements and volumetric reductions were found. Furthermore, patients with MCI and those with T2DM-MCI showed disrupted structural connectivity within the DMN.</p>Conclusion<p>These findings provide further evidence that T2DM may exacerbate atrophy of specific gray matter regions, which may be primarily associated with MCI. Impairments in gray matter volume related to T2DM or MCI are independent of cardiovascular risk factors, and subcortical atrophy may play a more pivotal role in cognitive impairment than cortical alterations in patients with MCI and T2DM-MCI. The enhanced structural connectivity within the DMN in patients with T2DM-MCI may suggest a compensatory mechanism for the chronic neurodegeneration.</p>

<p>Background and Purpose: Diabetes mellitus increases stroke incidence and mortality and hampers functional recovery after stroke. Fingolimod has been shown to improve neurofunctional recovery and reduce brain infarction after ischemic injury in mice without comorbidities. In this work, we investigated the effects of fingolimod in diabetic mice after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO).</p><p>Methods: Hyperglycemia was induced by a single bolus streptozotocin injection. Adult male ICR mice (n = 86) underwent 1-h tMCAO surgery and received intraperitoneal injection of fingolimod (1 mg/kg) or vehicle immediately after reperfusion. Clark neurological score, brain infarction and edema, blood–brain barrier (BBB) integrity, apoptosis, and inflammation were evaluated at 24 h after tMCAO.</p><p>Results: Fingolimod treatment reduced the number of infiltrated inflammatory cells and lowered the mRNA level of Tnfα. It also increased the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax. However, fingolimod significantly aggravated brain edema and reduced the expression levels of tight junction proteins ZO-1 and Occludin. The negative impacts of fingolimod on BBB integrity outweighed its beneficial effects in anti-inflammation, which resulted in the lack of improvement in endpoint outcomes at 24 h after tMCAO.</p><p>Conclusion: Caution should be taken in considering the acute treatment using fingolimod for ischemic stroke with diabetes comorbidity.</p>

<p>The concept of adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) has been widely accepted, and a large number of studies have been performed in rodents using modern experimental techniques, which have clarified the nature and developmental processes of adult neural stem/progenitor cells, the functions of AHN, such as memory and learning, and its association with neural diseases. However, a fundamental problem is that it remains unclear as to what extent AHN actually occurs in humans. The answer to this is indispensable when physiological and pathological functions of human AHN are deduced from studies of rodent AHN, but there are controversial data on the extent of human AHN. In this review, studies on AHN performed in rodents and humans will be briefly reviewed, followed by a discussion of the studies in non-human primates. Then, how data of rodent and non-human primate AHN should be applied for understanding human AHN will be discussed.</p>

<p>Mammalian brains consist of 10s of millions to 100s of billions of neurons operating at millisecond time scales, of which current recording techniques only capture a tiny fraction. Recording techniques capable of sampling neural activity at high spatiotemporal resolution have been difficult to scale. The most intensively studied mammalian neuronal networks, such as the neocortex, show a layered architecture, where the optimal recording technology samples densely over large areas. However, the need for application-specific designs as well as the mismatch between the three-dimensional architecture of the brain and largely two-dimensional microfabrication techniques profoundly limits both neurophysiological research and neural prosthetics. Here, we discuss a novel strategy for scalable neuronal recording by combining bundles of glass-ensheathed microwires with large-scale amplifier arrays derived from high-density CMOS in vitro MEA systems or high-speed infrared cameras. High signal-to-noise ratio (&lt;25 μV RMS noise floor, SNR up to 25) is achieved due to the high conductivity of core metals in glass-ensheathed microwires allowing for ultrathin metal cores (down to &lt;1 μm) and negligible stray capacitance. Multi-step electrochemical modification of the tip enables ultra-low access impedance with minimal geometric area, which is largely independent of the core diameter. We show that the microwire size can be reduced to virtually eliminate damage to the blood-brain-barrier upon insertion and we demonstrate that microwire arrays can stably record single-unit activity. Combining microwire bundles and CMOS arrays allows for a highly scalable neuronal recording approach, linking the progress in electrical neuronal recordings to the rapid progress in silicon microfabrication. The modular design of the system allows for custom arrangement of recording sites. Our approach of employing bundles of minimally invasive, highly insulated and functionalized microwires to extend a two-dimensional CMOS architecture into the 3rd dimension can be translated to other CMOS arrays, such as electrical stimulation devices.</p>

<p>Gliomas are the most common primary brain cancers. In recent years, IDH mutation and 1p/19q codeletion have been suggested as biomarkers for the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of gliomas. However, these biomarkers are only effective for a part of glioma patients, and thus more biomarkers are still emergently needed. Recently, an electrochemical communication between normal neurons and glioma cells by neuro-glioma synapse has been reported. Moreover, it was discovered that breast-to-brain metastasis tumor cells have pseudo synapses with neurons, and these synapses were indicated to promote tumor progression and metastasis. Based on the above observations, we first curated a panel of 17 synapse-related genes and then proposed a metric, synapse score to quantify the “stemness” for each sample of 12 glioma gene expression datasets from TCGA, CGGA, and GEO. Strikingly, synapse score showed excellent predictive ability for the prognosis, diagnosis, and grading of gliomas. Moreover, being compared with the two established biomarkers, IDH mutation and 1p/19q codeletion, synapse score demonstrated independent and better predictive performance. In conclusion, this study proposed a quantitative method, synapse score, as an efficient biomarker for monitoring gliomas.</p>

<p>Animal behavior is regulated by environmental stimuli and is shaped by the activity of neural networks, underscoring the importance of assessing the morpho-functional properties of different populations of cells in freely behaving animals. In recent years, a number of optical tools have been developed to monitor and modulate neuronal and glial activity at the protein, cellular, or network level and have opened up new avenues for studying brain function in freely behaving animals. Tools such as genetically encoded sensors and actuators are now commonly used for studying brain activity and function through their expression in different neuronal ensembles. In parallel, microscopy has also made major progress over the last decades. The advent of miniature microscopes (mini-microscopes also called mini-endoscopes) has become a method of choice for studying brain activity at the cellular and network levels in different brain regions of freely behaving mice. This technique also allows for longitudinal investigations while animals carrying the microscope on their head are performing behavioral tasks. In this review, we will discuss mini-endoscopic imaging and the advantages that these devices offer to research. We will also discuss current limitations of and potential future improvements in mini-endoscopic imaging.</p>

<p>This study presents the integration of a passive brain-computer interface (pBCI) and cognitive modeling as a method to trace pilots’ perception and processing of auditory alerts and messages during operations. Missing alerts on the flight deck can result in out-of-the-loop problems that can lead to accidents. By tracing pilots’ perception and responses to alerts, cognitive assistance can be provided based on individual needs to ensure they maintain adequate situation awareness. Data from 24 participating aircrew in a simulated flight study that included multiple alerts and air traffic control messages in single pilot setup are presented. A classifier was trained to identify pilots’ neurophysiological reactions to alerts and messages from participants’ electroencephalogram (EEG). A neuroadaptive ACT-R model using EEG data was compared to a conventional normative model regarding accuracy in representing individual pilots. Results show that passive BCI can distinguish between alerts that are processed by the pilot as task-relevant or irrelevant in the cockpit based on the recorded EEG. The neuroadaptive model’s integration of this data resulted in significantly higher performance of 87% overall accuracy in representing individual pilots’ responses to alerts and messages compared to 72% accuracy of a normative model that did not consider EEG data. We conclude that neuroadaptive technology allows for implicit measurement and tracing of pilots’ perception and processing of alerts on the flight deck. Careful handling of uncertainties inherent to passive BCI and cognitive modeling shows how the representation of pilot cognitive states can be improved iteratively for providing assistance.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00790">Electroencephalographic Cross-Frequency Coupling as a Sign of Disease Progression in Patients With Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Pilot Study</a></h4>

<p>Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) refers to mild objective cognitive deficits and is associated with the later development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, not all patients with MCI convert to AD. EEG spectral power has shown promise as a marker of progression, but brain oscillations in different frequencies are not isolated entities. Coupling between different frequency bands, so-called cross-frequency coupling (CFC), has been associated with memory function and may further contribute to our understanding of what characterizes patients with MCI who progress to AD. In the current study, we wanted to investigate the changes in gamma/theta CFC in patients with AD and MCI compared to HC and in patients with pMCI compared to patients with sMCI. Furthermore, we wanted to investigate the association with cognitive test scores. EEGs were included at baseline for 15 patients with AD, 25 patients with MCI, and 36 older HC, and the participants were followed for up to 3 years. To investigate CFC, we calculated the modulation index (MI), which has been shown to be less affected by noisy data compared to other techniques. We found that patients with pMCI showed a significantly lower global gamma/theta CFC compared to patients with sMCI. In addition, global gamma/theta CFC was significantly correlated with Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination (ACE) score (p-value = 0.030, rho = 0.527). Although not significant, patients with AD and MCI showed a lower gamma/theta CFC compared to HC. These findings suggest that gamma/theta CFC is important for proper cognitive functioning and that a decrease in gamma/theta CFC in patients with MCI may be a sign of progression. Gamma/theta CFC may therefore serve as a progression marker in MCI, but larger studies are needed to validate these findings.</p>

<p>Intrinsically photosensitive melanopsin retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs) are crucial for non-image forming functions of the eye, including the photoentrainment of circadian rhythms and the regulation of the pupillary light reflex (PLR). Chromatic pupillometry, using light stimuli at different wavelengths, makes possible the isolation of the contribution of rods, cones, and mRGCs to the PLR. In particular, post-illumination pupil response (PIPR) is the most reliable pupil metric of mRGC function. We have previously described, in post-mortem investigations of AD retinas, a loss of mRGCs, and in the remaining mRGCs, we demonstrated extensive morphological abnormalities. We noted dendrite varicosities, patchy distribution of melanopsin, and reduced dendrite arborization. In this study, we evaluated, with chromatic pupillometry, the PLR in a cohort of mild-moderate AD patients compared to controls. AD and controls also underwent an extensive ophthalmological evaluation. In our AD cohort, PIPR did not significantly differ from controls, even though we observed a higher variability in the AD group and 5/26 showed PIPR values outside the 2 SD from the control mean values. Moreover, we found a significant difference between AD and controls in terms of rod-mediated transient PLR amplitude. These results suggest that in the early stage of AD there are PLR abnormalities that may reflect a pathology affecting mRGC dendrites before involving the mRGC cell body. Further studies, including AD cases with more severe and longer disease duration, are needed to further explore this hypothesis.</p>

<p>The restoration of a useful visual sense in a profoundly blind person by direct electrical stimulation of the visual cortex has been a subject of study for many years. However, the field of cortically based sight restoration has made few advances in the last few decades, and many problems remain. In this context, the scientific and technological problems associated with safe and effective communication with the brain are very complex, and there are still many unresolved issues delaying its development. In this work, we review some of the biological and technical issues that still remain to be solved, including long-term biotolerability, the number of electrodes required to provide useful vision, and the delivery of information to the implants. Furthermore, we emphasize the possible role of the neuroplastic changes that follow vision loss in the success of this approach. We propose that increased collaborations among clinicians, basic researchers, and neural engineers will enhance our ability to send meaningful information to the brain and restore a limited but useful sense of vision to many blind individuals.</p>

<p>At present, a healthy diet appears to be one of the suitable strategies in slowing down cognitive decline in the process of aging. A number of evidence-based studies confirm its efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness. The aim of this mini review is to evaluate and describe recent randomized clinical and cohort studies exploring the effect of healthy diet on cognitive performance among healthy seniors, as well as to update the existing information on this research issue. For these reasons, the authors reviewed full-text, peer-reviewed journal articles written in English and available in Web of Science and PubMed between September 2017 and February 2020. Altogether nine original studies were detected. The results indicate that healthy diet and healthy diet components generally have a positive impact on the enhancement of cognitive functions. Furthermore, the findings reveal that dietary patterns, as well as single nutrients might have a significant effect on specific cognitive domains, such as memory in general, episodic memory, or processing speed. It also seems that a strict adherence to the dietary patterns and a higher diet variety have a more significant effect on the improvement of cognitive functions. Nevertheless, there seem to be gender differences in dietary behavior. More recently, personalized dietary interventions started to be used in delaying cognitive decline among healthy seniors. Therefore, more randomized control trials or N-of-1 trials should be performed in this research area in order to detect the most suitable dietary pattern or nutrients, which would, together with other modifiable lifestyle factors, contribute to the improvement of quality of life of the aging population.</p>

<p>When people talk, they gesture. Gesture is a fundamental component of language that contributes meaningful and unique information to a spoken message and reflects the speaker’s underlying knowledge and experiences. Theoretical perspectives of speech and gesture propose that they share a common conceptual origin and have a tightly integrated relationship, overlapping in time, meaning, and function to enrich the communicative context. We review a robust literature from the field of psychology documenting the benefits of gesture for communication for both speakers and listeners, as well as its important cognitive functions for organizing spoken language, and facilitating problem-solving, learning, and memory. Despite this evidence, gesture has been relatively understudied in populations with neurogenic communication disorders. While few studies have examined the rehabilitative potential of gesture in these populations, others have ignored gesture entirely or even discouraged its use. We review the literature characterizing gesture production and its role in intervention for people with aphasia, as well as describe the much sparser literature on gesture in cognitive communication disorders including right hemisphere damage, traumatic brain injury, and Alzheimer’s disease. The neuroanatomical and behavioral profiles of these patient populations provide a unique opportunity to test theories of the relationship of speech and gesture and advance our understanding of their neural correlates. This review highlights several gaps in the field of communication disorders which may serve as a bridge for applying the psychological literature of gesture to the study of language disorders. Such future work would benefit from considering theoretical perspectives of gesture and using more rigorous and quantitative empirical methods in its approaches. We discuss implications for leveraging gesture to explore its untapped potential in understanding and rehabilitating neurogenic communication disorders.</p>

<p>Neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson’s (PD) and Huntington’s disease (HD) are characterized by a selective detrimental impact on neurons in a specific brain area. Currently, these diseases have no cures, although some promising trials of therapies that may be able to slow the loss of brain cells are underway. Cell therapy is distinguished by its potential to replace cells to compensate for those lost to the degenerative process and has shown a great potential to replace degenerated neurons in animal models and in clinical trials in PD and HD patients. Fetal-derived neural progenitor cells, embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells are the main cell sources that have been tested in cell therapy approaches. Furthermore, new strategies are emerging, such as the use of adult stem cells, encapsulated cell lines releasing trophic factors or cell-free products, containing an enriched secretome, which have shown beneficial preclinical outcomes. One of the major challenges for these potential new treatments is to overcome the host immune response to the transplanted cells. Immune rejection can cause significant alterations in transplanted and endogenous tissue and requires immunosuppressive drugs that may produce adverse effects. T-, B-lymphocytes and microglia have been recognized as the main effectors in striatal graft rejection. This review aims to summarize the preclinical and clinical studies of cell therapies in PD and HD. In addition, the precautions and strategies to ensure the highest quality of cell grafts, the lowest risk during transplantation and the reduction of a possible immune rejection will be outlined. Altogether, the wide-ranging possibilities of advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs) could make therapeutic treatment of these incurable diseases possible in the near future.</p>

<p>Dominant, missense mutations in the widely and constitutively expressed GARS1 gene cause peripheral neuropathy that usually begins in adolescence and principally impacts the upper limbs. Caused by a toxic gain-of-function in the encoded glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GlyRS) enzyme, the neuropathology appears to be independent of the canonical role of GlyRS in aminoacylation. Patients display progressive, life-long weakness and wasting of muscles in hands followed by feet, with frequently associated deficits in sensation. When dysfunction is observed in motor and sensory nerves, there is a diagnosis of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2D (CMT2D), or distal hereditary motor neuropathy type V if the symptoms are purely motor. The cause of this varied sensory involvement remains unresolved, as are the pathomechanisms underlying the selective neurodegeneration characteristic of the disease. We have previously identified in CMT2D mice that neuropathy-causing Gars mutations perturb sensory neuron fate and permit mutant GlyRS to aberrantly interact with neurotrophin receptors (Trks). Here, we extend this work by interrogating further the anatomy and function of the CMT2D sensory nervous system in mutant Gars mice, obtaining several key results: (1) sensory pathology is restricted to neurons innervating the hindlimbs; (2) perturbation of sensory development is not common to all mouse models of neuromuscular disease; (3) in vitro axonal transport of signaling endosomes is not impaired in afferent neurons of all CMT2D mouse models; and (4) Gars expression is selectively elevated in a subset of sensory neurons and linked to sensory developmental defects. These findings highlight the importance of comparative neurological assessment in mouse models of disease and shed light on key proposed neuropathogenic mechanisms in GARS1-linked neuropathy.</p>

<p>Levodopa (L-DOPA) treatment is the main gold-standard therapy for Parkinson disease (PD). Besides good antiparkinsonian effects, prolonged use of this drug is associated to the development of involuntary movements known as L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID). L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia is linked to a sensitization of dopamine (DA) D1 receptors located on spiny projection neurons (SPNs) of the dorsal striatum. Several evidences have shown that the emergence of LID can be related to striatal D1/cAMP/PKA/DARPP-32 and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) pathway overactivation associated to aberrant N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor function. In addition, within striatum, ERK1/2 is also able to modulate in a D1 receptor-dependent manner the activity of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway under DA depletion and L-DOPA therapy. Consistently, increased mTORC1 signaling appears during chronic administration of L-DOPA and shows a high correlation with the severity of dyskinesia. Furthermore, the abnormal activation of the D1/PKA/DARPP-32 cascade is paralleled by increased phosphorylation of the GluA1 subunit of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor at the PKA Ser845 site. The GluA1 promotes excitatory AMPA receptor-mediated transmission and may be implicated in the alterations found at the corticostriatal synapses of dyskinetic animals. In our study, we investigated the role of mTORC1 pathway activation in modulating bidirectional striatal synaptic plasticity in L-DOPA-treated parkinsonian rats. Inhibition of mTORC1 by coadministration of rapamycin to L-DOPA was able to limit the magnitude of LID expression, accounting for a therapeutic effect of this drug. In particular, behavioral data showed that, in L-DOPA-treated rats, rapamycin administration induced a selective decrease of distinct components of abnormal involuntary movements (i.e., axial and orolingual dyskinesia). Furthermore, ex vivo patch clamp and intracellular recordings of SPNs revealed that pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1 also resulted associated with a physiological bidirectional plasticity, when compared to dyskinetic rats treated with L-DOPA alone. This study uncovers the important role of mTORC1 inhibition to prevent the loss of striatal bidirectional plasticity under chronic L-DOPA treatment in rodent models of PD.</p>

Conditioned taste aversion (CTA) is a form of one-trial learning dependent on basolateral amygdala projection neurons (BLApn). Its underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. RNAseq from BLApn identified changes in multiple candidate learning-related transcripts including the expected immediate early gene <i>Fos</i> and <i>Stk11</i>, a master kinase of the AMP-related kinase pathway with important roles in growth, metabolism and development, but not previously implicated in learning. Deletion of <i>Stk11</i> in BLApn blocked memory prior to training, but not following it and increased neuronal excitability. Conversely, BLApn had reduced excitability following CTA. BLApn knockout of a second learning-related gene, <i>Fos</i>, also increased excitability and impaired learning. Independently increasing BLApn excitability chemogenetically during CTA also impaired memory. STK11 and C-FOS activation were independent of one another. These data suggest key roles for <i>Stk11</i> and <i>Fos</i> in CTA long-term memory formation, dependent at least partly through convergent action on BLApn intrinsic excitability.

The myokine irisin facilitates muscle-bone crosstalk and skeletal remodeling in part by its action on osteoblasts and osteocytes. In the current study we investigated whether irisin also directly regulates osteoclasts. <i>In vitro,</i> irisin (2-10 ng/mL) increased osteoclast differentiation in C57BL/6J mouse bone marrow progenitors; this increase was blocked by a neutralizing antibody to integrin α<sub>V</sub>β<sub>5</sub>. Irisin also increased bone resorption on several substrates <i>in situ</i>. RNAseq revealed differential gene expression induced by irisin including upregulation of markers for osteoclast differentiation and resorption, as well as osteoblast-stimulating 'clastokines'. Forced expression of the irisin precursor <i>Fndc5</i> in transgenic C57BL/6J mice resulted in low bone mass at three ages, and greater <i>in vitro</i> osteoclastogenesis from <i>Fndc5</i>-transgenic bone marrow progenitors. This work demonstrates that irisin acts directly on osteoclast progenitors to increase differentiation and promote bone resorption, supporting the tenet that irisin not only stimulates bone remodeling but may also be an important counter-regulatory hormone.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57763">MARCH8 inhibits viral infection by two different mechanisms</a></h4>

Membrane-associated RING-CH 8 (MARCH8) inhibits infection with both HIV-1 and vesicular stomatitis virus G-glycoprotein (VSV-G)-pseudotyped viruses by reducing virion incorporation of envelope glycoproteins. The molecular mechanisms by which MARCH8 targets envelope glycoproteins remain unknown. Here, we show two different mechanisms by which MARCH8 inhibits viral infection. Viruses pseudotyped with the VSV-G mutant, in which cytoplasmic lysine residues were mutated, were insensitive to the inhibitory effect of MARCH8, whereas those with a similar lysine mutant of HIV-1 Env remained sensitive to it. Indeed, the wild-type VSV-G, but not its lysine mutant, was ubiquitinated by MARCH8. Furthermore, the MARCH8 mutant, which had a disrupted cytoplasmic tyrosine motif that is critical for intracellular protein sorting, did not inhibit HIV-1 Env-mediated infection, while it still impaired infection by VSV-G-pseudotyped viruses. Overall, we conclude that MARCH8 reduces viral infectivity by downregulating envelope glycoproteins through two different mechanisms mediated by a ubiquitination-dependent or tyrosine motif-dependent pathway.

Yeast Sfh5 is an unusual member of the Sec14-like phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (PITP) family. Whereas PITPs are defined by their abilities to transfer phosphatidylinositol between membranes in vitro, and to stimulate phosphoinositide signaling in vivo, Sfh5 does not exhibit these activities. Rather, Sfh5 is a redox-active penta-coordinate high spin Fe<sup>III</sup> hemoprotein with an unusual heme-binding arrangement that involves a co-axial tyrosine/histidine coordination strategy and a complex electronic structure connecting the open shell iron <i>d</i>-orbitals with three aromatic ring systems. That Sfh5 is not a PITP is supported by demonstrations that heme is not a readily exchangeable ligand, and that phosphatidylinositol-exchange activity is resuscitated in heme binding-deficient Sfh5 mutants. The collective data identify Sfh5 as the prototype of a new class of fungal hemoproteins, and emphasize the versatility of the Sec14-fold as scaffold for translating the binding of chemically distinct ligands to the control of diverse sets of cellular activities.

The representation of position in the mammalian brain is distributed across multiple neural populations. Grid cell modules in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) express activity patterns that span a low-dimensional manifold which remains stable across different environments. In contrast, the activity patterns of hippocampal place cells span distinct low-dimensional manifolds in different environments. It is unknown how these multiple representations of position are coordinated. Here we develop a theory of joint attractor dynamics in the hippocampus and the MEC. We show that the system exhibits a coordinated, joint representation of position across multiple environments, consistent with global remapping in place cells and grid cells. In addition, our model accounts for recent experimental observations that lack a mechanistic explanation: variability in the firing rate of single grid cells across firing fields, and artificial remapping of place cells under depolarization, but not under hyperpolarization, of layer II stellate cells of the MEC.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55421">Caterpillar-induced rice volatiles provide enemy-free space for the offspring of the brown planthopper</a></h4>

Plants typically release large quantities of volatiles in response to herbivory by insects. This benefits the plants by, for instance, attracting the natural enemies of the herbivores. We show that the brown planthopper (BPH) has cleverly turned this around by exploiting herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) that provide safe havens for its offspring. BPH females preferentially oviposit on rice plants already infested by the rice striped stem borer (SSB), which are avoided by the egg parasitoid <i>Anagrus nilaparvatae</i>, the most important natural enemy of BPH. Using synthetic versions of volatiles identified from plants infested by BPH and/or SSB, we demonstrate the role of HIPVs in these interactions. Moreover, greenhouse and field cage experiments confirm the adaptiveness of the BPH oviposition strategy, resulting in 80% lower parasitism rates of its eggs. Besides revealing a novel exploitation of HIPVs, these findings may lead to novel control strategies against an exceedingly important rice pest.

A variety of microscopy techniques are used by researchers in the life and biomedical sciences. As these techniques become more powerful and more complex, it is vital that scientific articles containing images obtained with advanced microscopes include full details about how each image was obtained. To explore the reporting of such details we examined 240 original research articles published in eight journals. We found that the quality of reporting was poor, with some articles containing no information about how images were obtained, and many articles lacking important basic details. Efforts by researchers, funding agencies, journals, equipment manufacturers and staff at shared imaging facilities are required to improve the reporting of experiments that rely on microscopy techniques.

One key bottleneck in understanding the human genome is the relative under-characterization of 90% of protein coding regions. We report a collection of 1,200 transgenic zebrafish strains made with the gene-break transposon (GBT) protein trap to simultaneously report and reversibly knockdown the tagged genes. Protein trap-associated mRFP expression shows previously undocumented expression of 35% and 90% of cloned genes at 2 and 4 days post-fertilization, respectively. Further, investigated alleles regularly show 99% gene-specific mRNA knockdown. Homozygous GBT animals in <i>ryr1b</i>, <i>fras1</i>, <i>tnnt2a</i>, <i>edar</i> and <i>hmcn1</i> phenocopied established mutants. 204 cloned lines trapped diverse proteins, including 64 orthologs of human disease-associated genes with 40 as potential new disease models. Severely reduced skeletal muscle Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in GBT <i>ryr1b</i> homozygous animals validated the ability to explore molecular mechanisms of genetic diseases. This GBT system facilitates novel functional genome annotation towards understanding cellular and molecular underpinnings of vertebrate biology and human disease.

Decision making requires integrating self-gathered information with advice from others. However, the arbitration process by which one source of information is selected over the other has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we formalised arbitration as the relative precision of predictions, afforded by each learning system, using hierarchical Bayesian modelling. In a probabilistic learning task, participants predicted the outcome of a lottery using recommendations from a more informed advisor and/or self-sampled outcomes. Decision confidence, as measured by the number of points participants wagered on their predictions, varied with our relative precision definition of arbitration. Functional neuroimaging demonstrated arbitration signals that were independent of decision confidence and involved modality-specific brain regions. Arbitrating in favour of self-gathered information activated the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the midbrain, whereas arbitrating in favour of social information engaged the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the amygdala. These findings indicate that relative precision captures arbitration between social and individual learning systems at both behavioural and neural levels.

The filarial nematode <i>Brugia malayi</i> represents a leading cause of disability in the developing world, causing lymphatic filariasis in nearly 40 million people. Currently available drugs are not well-suited to mass drug administration efforts, so new treatments are urgently required. One potential vulnerability is the endosymbiotic bacteria <i>Wolbachia</i>—present in many filariae—which is vital to the worm. Genome scale metabolic networks have been used to study prokaryotes and protists and have proven valuable in identifying therapeutic targets, but have only been applied to multicellular eukaryotic organisms more recently. Here, we present <i>i</i>DC625, the first compartmentalized metabolic model of a parasitic worm. We used this model to show how metabolic pathway usage allows the worm to adapt to different environments, and predict a set of 102 reactions essential to the survival of <i>B. malayi</i>. We validated three of those reactions with drug tests and demonstrated novel antifilarial properties for all three compounds.

Guitchounts et al. find that the primary visual cortex (V1) of freely moving rats encodes 3D orienting movements of the head (HOMs). V1 is suppressed or enhanced by HOMs, depending on lighting condition, and individual neurons encode HOM direction. This encoding depends on secondary motor cortex (M2).

The vestibular system broadcasts head-movement-related signals throughout the brain. Bouvier et al. show that ambient light affects how primary visual cortex (V1) responds to head movements. V1 is suppressed by head movements in darkness and excited by head movements in light through the differential recruitment of somatostatin-expressing inhibitory neurons.

The bottleneck for microglia-based gene therapy is the lack of tools for genetic manipulation of microglia and/or their allotransplantation. In this study, Xu et al. develop three strategies achieving efficient microglia replacement at the CNS-wide scale or specific brain regions of interest. Each approach has its own advantages and application scenarios.

Reimer et al. show that EFhd2 restricts migration of germinal center B cells and hapten-specific immunity. Selection of speedy germinal center B cells occurs earlier and they are more likely to differentiate. EFhd2 supports contact of germinal center B cells with follicular dendritic cells, enabling successful competition of rapidly migrating germinal center B cells.

Kweon et al. find that NACHO protein is essential for assembly of transmembrane domains within the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. NACHO associates with the endoplasmic reticulum oligosaccharyltransferase machinery and with calnexin. Accordingly, functional expression of neuronal α7 receptors requires N-glycosylation and calnexin chaperone activity.

Borrett et al. have coupled scRNA-seq with transgenic lineage tracing to define the transcriptional signatures of forebrain mammalian NSCs from embryogenesis to adulthood. They show that dormant adult NSCs share a transcriptional identity with their embryonic parent precursors and reacquire a development-like state when activated to generate adult-born neurons.

Wang et al. find that an E3 ubiquitin ligase, RNF5, promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of PHGDH protein. Acetylation is identified as a regulating signal in RNF5-mediated PHGDH degradation and is responsible for PHGDH protein accumulation. These findings provide a potential explanation for PHGDH overexpression in human cancers.

Cells carry STAG1- and STAG2-cohesin complexes whose functional specificity remains unclear. De Koninck et al. show that Stag2 deletion in mice results in embryonic lethality by mid-gestation. In contrast, STAG2 is not strictly required for viability in cells or adult tissues, and its loss is not sufficient to elicit tumorigenesis.

Zhao et al. identify OGT in intestinal epithelial cells as a “molecular brake” on L cell development and function in response to nutritional and microbial cues. OGT inhibits Ngn3 gene transcription and enteroendocrine differentiation via FOXO1 O-GlcNAcylation. Microbiota-derived SCFAs drive epithelial O-GlcNAcylation, which further influences gut microbiota to control systemic metabolism.

Fisch et al. find that GBP1 targets Toxoplasma vacuolar and parasite membranes for disruption of both membranes. In contrast, appearance of cytosolic Salmonella is GBP1 independent, but caspase-4 recruitment to bacteria and activation is GBP1 dependent. In a negative feedback loop, caspase-1 cleaves GBP1 and suppresses caspase-4-driven pyroptosis during Salmonella infection.

Chen et al. show that Runx2+/Gli1+ niche cells in the adult mouse incisor coordinate the transition from mesenchymal stem cell to transit-amplifying cell (TAC) and control the growth rate of incisors. Runx2 regulates Igfbp3 to control IGF signaling, determine the fate of TACs, and maintain incisor mesenchymal tissue homeostasis.

We can understand actions and learn movements by observing them. These processes are thought to involve neurons in motor cortex that are active during both movement observation and execution. Jiang et al. find that, when observing and executing movements, motor cortical neurons exhibit shared structure through consistent covariation and dynamics.

Simic et al. present a detailed view of LTi ontogeny. Hemogenic progenitors appear specifically in early embryonic hemogenic endothelium and via proliferating precursor populations in the fetal liver and ultimately differentiate into two mature LTi4 populations within the embryonic periphery. In adults, embryonic LTi cells are replaced by HSC-derived LTi cells.

This pattern has both cellular specificity for Wnt3a-induced mESCs and molecular specificity for H3 and H4.

Garay et al. adopt BrU-seq to profile bona fide transcriptional dynamics triggered by neuronal activity shifts. An integrated genomics approach including BrU-seq, combined with electrophysiology, reveals that RAI1, the Smith-Magenis syndrome protein, controls baseline synaptic strength and homeostatic synaptic upscaling by regulating the transcriptome associated with network inactivity.

Neuronal hyperexcitability may underlie many features of fragile X syndrome. Booker et al. show that in hippocampal area CA1, pyramidal neurons are hyperexcitable, with longer axon initial segments. This hyperexcitability helps neurons to overcome a strong reduction in synaptic input from the entorhinal cortex, thus homeostatically regulating local network outputs.

<p>by Laura de Arroyo Garcia, Patrik R. Jones</p>

In the growing field of metabolic engineering, where cells are treated as “factories” that synthesize industrial compounds, it is essential to consider the ability of the cells’ native metabolism to accommodate the demands of synthetic pathways, as these pathways will alter the homeostasis of cellular energy and electron metabolism. From the breakdown of substrate, microorganisms activate and reduce key co-factors such as ATP and NAD(P)H, which subsequently need to be hydrolysed and oxidized, respectively, in order to restore cellular balance. A balanced supply and consumption of such co-factors, here termed <i>co-factor balance</i>, will influence biotechnological performance. To aid the strain selection and design process, we used stoichiometric modelling (FBA, pFBA, FVA and MOMA) and the <i>Escherichia coli</i> (<i>E</i>.<i>coli</i>) core stoichiometric model to investigate the network-wide effect of butanol and butanol precursor production pathways differing in energy and electron demand on the final product yield. An FBA-based co-factor balance assessment (CBA) algorithm was developed to track and categorise how ATP and NAD(P)H pools are affected in the presence of a new pathway. CBA was compared to the balance calculations proposed by Dugar et al. (Nature Biotechnol. 29 (12), 1074–1078). Predicted solutions were compromised by excessively underdetermined systems, displaying greater flexibility in the range of reaction fluxes than experimentally measured by <sup>13</sup>C-metabolic flux analysis (MFA) and the appearance of unrealistic futile co-factor cycles. With the assumption that futile cycles are tightly regulated in reality, the FBA models were manually constrained in a step-wise manner. Solutions with minimal futile cycling diverted surplus energy and electrons towards biomass formation. As an alternative, the use of loopless FBA or constraining the models with measured flux ranges were tried but did not prevent futile co-factor cycles. The results highlight the need to account for co-factor imbalance and confirm that better-balanced pathways with minimal diversion of surplus towards biomass formation present the highest theoretical yield. The analysis also suggests that ATP and NAD(P)H balancing cannot be assessed in isolation from each other, or even from the balance of additional co-factors such as AMP and ADP. We conclude that, through revealing the source of co-factor imbalance CBA can facilitate pathway and host selection when designing new biocatalysts for implementation by metabolic engineering.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cksuVli6J44" width="1" />

<p>by Hedyeh Rezaei, Ad Aertsen, Arvind Kumar, Alireza Valizadeh</p>

Transient oscillations in network activity upon sensory stimulation have been reported in different sensory areas of the brain. These evoked oscillations are the generic response of networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons (<i>EI</i>-networks) to a transient external input. Recently, it has been shown that this resonance property of <i>EI</i>-networks can be exploited for communication in modular neuronal networks by enabling the transmission of sequences of synchronous spike volleys (’pulse packets’), despite the sparse and weak connectivity between the modules. The condition for successful transmission is that the pulse packet (PP) intervals match the period of the modules’ resonance frequency. Hence, the mechanism was termed <i>communication through resonance (CTR)</i>. This mechanism has three severe constraints, though. First, it needs periodic trains of PPs, whereas single PPs fail to propagate. Second, the inter-PP interval needs to match the network resonance. Third, transmission is very slow, because in each module, the network resonance needs to build up over multiple oscillation cycles. Here, we show that, by adding appropriate feedback connections to the network, the CTR mechanism can be improved and the aforementioned constraints relaxed. Specifically, we show that adding feedback connections between two upstream modules, called the resonance pair, in an otherwise feedforward modular network can support successful propagation of a single PP throughout the entire network. The key condition for successful transmission is that the sum of the forward and backward delays in the resonance pair matches the resonance frequency of the network modules. The transmission is much faster, by more than a factor of two, than in the original CTR mechanism. Moreover, it distinctly lowers the threshold for successful communication by synchronous spiking in modular networks of weakly coupled networks. Thus, our results suggest a new functional role of bidirectional connectivity for the communication in cortical area networks.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zIpLJn8J4Lc" width="1" />

<p>by Maria Salfer, Javier F. Collado, Wolfgang Baumeister, Rubén Fernández-Busnadiego, Antonio Martínez-Sánchez</p>

Curvature is a fundamental morphological descriptor of cellular membranes. Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) is particularly well-suited to visualize and analyze membrane morphology in a close-to-native state and molecular resolution. However, current curvature estimation methods cannot be applied directly to membrane segmentations in cryo-ET, as these methods cannot cope with some of the artifacts introduced during image acquisition and membrane segmentation, such as quantization noise and open borders. Here, we developed and implemented a Python package for membrane curvature estimation from tomogram segmentations, which we named PyCurv. From a membrane segmentation, a signed surface (triangle mesh) is first extracted. The triangle mesh is then represented by a graph, which facilitates finding neighboring triangles and the calculation of geodesic distances necessary for local curvature estimation. PyCurv estimates curvature based on tensor voting. Beside curvatures, this algorithm also provides robust estimations of surface normals and principal directions. We tested PyCurv and three well-established methods on benchmark surfaces and biological data. This revealed the superior performance of PyCurv not only for cryo-ET, but also for data generated by other techniques such as light microscopy and magnetic resonance imaging. Altogether, PyCurv is a versatile open-source software to reliably estimate curvature of membranes and other surfaces in a wide variety of applications.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MMlj9Wbreok" width="1" />

<p>by Alessandro Moro, Geeske M. van Woerden, Ruud F. Toonen, Matthijs Verhage</p>

Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) regulates synaptic plasticity in multiple ways, supposedly including the secretion of neuromodulators like brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Here, we show that neuromodulator secretion is indeed reduced in mouse α- and βCaMKII-deficient (αβCaMKII double-knockout [DKO]) hippocampal neurons. However, this was not due to reduced secretion efficiency or neuromodulator vesicle transport but to 40% reduced neuromodulator levels at synapses and 50% reduced delivery of new neuromodulator vesicles to axons. αβCaMKII depletion drastically reduced neuromodulator expression. Blocking BDNF secretion or BDNF scavenging in wild-type neurons produced a similar reduction. Reduced neuromodulator expression in αβCaMKII DKO neurons was restored by active βCaMKII but not inactive βCaMKII or αCaMKII, and by CaMKII downstream effectors that promote cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation. These data indicate that CaMKII regulates neuromodulation in a feedback loop coupling neuromodulator secretion to βCaMKII- and CREB-dependent neuromodulator expression and axonal targeting, but CaMKIIs are dispensable for the secretion process itself.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/6ioF5P1TIuw" width="1" />

<p>by Alexander Soutschek, Marius Moisa, Christian C. Ruff, Philippe N. Tobler</p>

Studies of neural processes underlying delay of gratification usually focus on prefrontal networks related to curbing affective impulses. Here, we provide evidence for an alternative mechanism that facilitates delaying gratification by mental orientation towards the future. Combining continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) with functional neuroimaging, we tested how the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) facilitates processing of future events and thereby promotes delay of gratification. Participants performed an intertemporal decision task and a mental time-travel task in the MRI scanner before and after receiving cTBS over the rTPJ or the vertex (control site). rTPJ cTBS led to both stronger temporal discounting for longer delays and reduced processing of future relative to past events in the mental time-travel task. This finding suggests that the rTPJ contributes to the ability to delay gratification by facilitating mental representation of outcomes in the future. On the neural level, rTPJ cTBS led to a reduction in the extent to which connectivity of rTPJ with striatum reflected the value of delayed rewards, indicating a role of rTPJ–striatum connectivity in constructing neural representations of future rewards. Together, our findings provide evidence that the rTPJ is an integral part of a brain network that promotes delay of gratification by facilitating mental orientation to future rewards.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/RqA111s2EcY" width="1" />

<p>by Yanxia Zhou, Lianghuan Liao, Chen Wang, Jialu Li, Pengliang Chi, Qingjie Xiao, Qingting Liu, Li Guo, Linfeng Sun, Dong Deng</p>

Concentrative nucleoside transporters (CNTs), members of the solute carrier (SLC) 28 transporter family, facilitate the salvage of nucleosides and therapeutic nucleoside derivatives across the plasma membrane. Despite decades of investigation, the structures of human CNTs remain unknown. We determined the cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of human CNT (hCNT) 3 at an overall resolution of 3.6 Å. As with its bacterial homologs, hCNT3 presents a trimeric architecture with additional N-terminal transmembrane helices to stabilize the conserved central domains. The conserved binding sites for the substrate and sodium ions unravel the selective nucleoside transport and distinct coupling mechanism. Structural comparison of hCNT3 with bacterial homologs indicates that hCNT3 is stabilized in an inward-facing conformation. This study provides the molecular determinants for the transport mechanism of hCNTs and potentially facilitates the design of nucleoside drugs.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/zsxneFFEhxI" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Although the neuroanatomy of transgender persons is slowly being charted, findings are presently discrepant. Moreover, the major body of work has focused on Western populations. One important factor is the issue of power and low signal‐to‐noise (SNR) ratio in neuroimaging studies of rare study populations including endocrine or neurological patient groups. The present study focused on the structural neuroanatomy of a Non‐Western (Iranian) sample of 40 transgender men (TM), 40 transgender women (TW), 30 cisgender men (CM), and 30 cisgender women (CW), while assessing whether the reliability of findings across structural anatomical measures including gray matter volume (GMV), cortical surface area (CSA), and cortical thickness (CTh) could be increased by using two back‐to‐back within‐session structural MRI scans. Overall, findings in transgender persons were more consistent with sex assigned at birth in GMV and CSA, while no group differences emerged for CTh. Repeated measures analysis also indicated that having a second scan increased SNR in all regions of interest, most notably bilateral frontal poles, pre‐ and postcentral gyri and putamina. The results suggest that a simple time and cost‐effective measure to improve SNR in rare clinical populations with low prevalence rates is a second anatomical scan when structural MRI is of interest.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We sought to examine the diagnostic utility of existing predictors of any hemorrhagic transformation (HT) and compare them with new perfusion imaging permeability measures in ischemic stroke patients receiving alteplase only.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A pixel‐based analysis of pretreatment CT perfusion (CTP) was undertaken to define the optimal CTP permeability thresholds to predict the likelihood of HT. We then compared previously proposed predictors of HT using regression analyses and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to produce an area under the curve (AUC). We compared AUCs using χ<sup>2</sup> analysis.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>From 5 centers, 1,407 patients were included in this study; of these, 282 had HT. The cohort was split into a derivation cohort (1,025, 70% patients) and a validation cohort (382 patients or 30%). The extraction fraction (<i>E </i>) permeability map at a threshold of 30% relative to contralateral had the highest AUC at predicting any HT (derivation AUC 0.85, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.79–0.91; validation AUC 0.84, 95% CI 0.77–0.91). The AUC improved when permeability was assessed within the acute perfusion lesion for the <i>E </i> maps at a threshold of 30% (derivation AUC 0.91, 95% CI 0.86–0.95; validation AUC 0.89, 95% CI 0.86–0.95). Previously proposed associations with HT and parenchymal hematoma showed lower AUC values than the permeability measure.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In this large multicenter study, we have validated a highly accurate measure of HT prediction. This measure might be useful in clinical practice to predict hemorrhagic transformation in ischemic stroke patients before receiving alteplase alone. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<p>Acetylcholinesterase and Nissl‐staining in the Atlantic white‐sided dolphin Hippocampal Formation.

</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The cetacean hippocampal formation has been noted to be one of the smallest relative to brain size of all mammals studied. This region, comprised of the dentate gyrus, hippocampus proper, subiculum, presubiculum, parasubiculum and the entorhinal cortex, is important in learning, memory and navigation. There have been a number of studies detailing the distribution of acetylcholinesterase in the hippocampal formation of terrestrial mammals with the goal of gaining a greater understanding of some aspects of the cholinergic innervation to this region as well as its parcellation. The present study was undertaken to describe the organization, cytoarchitecture and distribution of acetylcholinesterase in the hippocampal formation of the Atlantic white‐sided dolphin (AWSD) with the view to understand similarities and differences between this aquatic mammal and terrestrial mammals. Nissl‐staining demonstrated cytoarchitecture of the hippocampal formation in the AWSD comparable to that reported in other cetaceans. In addition, the AWSD had a rich pattern of AChE staining that distinctly varied between regions and laminae. A number of differences in the distribution of AChE staining in areas comparable to those of terrestrial species reported suggested possible alterations in connectivity of this region. Overall, however, AChE‐staining suggested that cholinergic innervation, neural pathways and function of the hippocampal formation of the AWSD is conserved, similar to other mammals.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The lateral parafacial region (pF<sub>L</sub>; which encompasses the parafacial respiratory group, pFRG) is a conditional oscillator that drives active expiration during periods of high respiratory demand, and increases ventilation through the recruitment of expiratory muscles. The pF<sub>L</sub> activity is highly modulated, and systematic analysis of its afferent projections is required to understand its connectivity and modulatory control. We combined a viral retrograde tracing approach to map direct brainstem projections to the putative location of pF<sub>L</sub>, with RNAScope and immunofluorescence to identify the neurochemical phenotype of the projecting neurons. Within the medulla, retrogradely‐labeled, glutamatergic, glycinergic and GABAergic neurons were found in the ventral respiratory column (Bötzinger and preBötzinger Complex [preBötC], ventral respiratory group, ventral parafacial region [pF<sub>V</sub>] and pF<sub>L</sub>), nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), reticular formation (RF), pontine and midbrain vestibular nuclei, and medullary raphe. In the pons and midbrain, retrogradely‐labeled neurons of the same phenotypes were found in the Kölliker‐Fuse and parabrachial nuclei, periaqueductal gray, pedunculopontine nucleus (PPT) and laterodorsal tegmentum (LDT). We also identified somatostatin‐expressing neurons in the preBötC and PHOX2B immunopositive cells in the pF<sub>V</sub>, NTS, and part of the RF. Surprisingly, we found no catecholaminergic neurons in the NTS, A5 or <i>Locus Coeruleus </i>, no serotoninergic raphe neurons nor any cholinergic neurons in the PPT and LDT that projected to the pF<sub>L</sub>. Our results indicate that pF<sub>L</sub> neurons receive extensive excitatory and inhibitory inputs from several respiratory and nonrespiratory related brainstem regions that could contribute to the complex modulation of the conditional pF<sub>L</sub> oscillator for active expiration.</p>

<p>Visuo-vestibular integration is crucial for locomotion, yet the cortical mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. We combined binaural monopolar galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to characterize the cortical networks activated during antero-posterior and lateral stimulations in humans. We focused on functional areas that selectively respond to egomotion-consistent optic flow patterns: the human middle temporal complex (hMT+), V6, the ventral intraparietal (VIP) area, the cingulate sulcus visual (CSv) area and the posterior insular cortex (PIC). Areas hMT+, CSv, and PIC were equivalently responsive during lateral and antero-posterior GVS while areas VIP and V6 were highly activated during antero-posterior GVS, but remained silent during lateral GVS. Using psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses, we confirmed that a cortical network including areas V6 and VIP is engaged during antero-posterior GVS. Our results suggest that V6 and VIP play a specific role in processing multisensory signals specific to locomotion during navigation.</p>

<p>Genes for endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-shaping proteins are among the most commonly mutated in hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). Mutation of these genes in model organisms can lead to disruption of the ER network. To investigate how the physiological roles of the ER might be affected by such disruption, we developed tools to interrogate its Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling function. We generated GAL4-driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors targeted to the ER lumen, to record ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes in identified Drosophila neurons. Using GAL4 lines specific for Type Ib or Type Is larval motor neurons, we compared the responses of different lumenal indicators to electrical stimulation, in axons and presynaptic terminals. The most effective sensor, ER-GCaMP6-210, had a Ca<sup>2+</sup> affinity close to the expected ER lumenal concentration. Repetitive nerve stimulation generally showed a transient increase of lumenal Ca<sup>2+</sup> in both the axon and presynaptic terminals. Mutants lacking neuronal reticulon and REEP proteins, homologs of human HSP proteins, showed a larger ER lumenal evoked response compared to wild type; we propose mechanisms by which this phenotype could lead to neuronal dysfunction or degeneration. Our lines are useful additions to a Drosophila Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging toolkit, to explore the physiological roles of ER, and its pathophysiological roles in HSP and in axon degeneration more broadly.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00244">Distinct Residential and Infiltrated Macrophage Populations and Their Phagocytic Function in Mild and Severe Neonatal Hypoxic-Ischemic Brain Damage</a></h4>

<p>Neonatal brain injury, especially severe injury induced by hypoxia-ischemia (HI), causes mortality and long-term neurological impairments. Our previous study demonstrated activation of CD11b<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells, including residential microglial cells (MGs) and infiltrating monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) in a murine model of hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD), with unknown functions. Here, we study the differences in the phagocytic function of MGs and MDMs to clarify their potential roles after HIBD. HI was induced in 9–10-day postnatal mice. On days 1 and 3 after injury, pathological and neurobehavioral tests were performed to categorize the brain damage as mild or severe. Flow cytometry was applied to quantify the dynamic change in the numbers of MGs and MDMs according to the relative expression level of CD45 in CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells. CX<sub>3</sub>CR<sub>1</sub><sup>GFP</sup>CCR<sub>2</sub><sup>RFP</sup> double-transformed mice were used to identify MGs and MDMs in the brain parenchyma after HIBD. Lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1), toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), CD36, and transforming growth factor (TGF-β) expression levels were measured to assess the underlying function of phagocytes and neuroprotective factors in these cells. The FITC-dextran 40 phagocytosis assay was applied to examine the change in phagocytic function under oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in vitro. We found that neonatal HI induced a different degree of brain damage: mild or severe injury. Compared with mildly injured animals, mice with severe injury had lower weight, worse neurobehavioral scores, and abnormal brain morphology. In a severely injured brain, CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells remarkably increased, including an increase in the MDM population and a decrease in the MG population. Furthermore, MDM infiltration into the brain parenchyma was evident in CX<sub>3</sub>CR<sub>1</sub><sup>GFP</sup>CCR<sub>2</sub><sup>RFP</sup> double-transformed mice. Mild and severe brain injury caused different phagocytosis-related responses and neuroprotective functions of MDMs and MGs at 1 and 3 days following HI. The phagocytic function was activated in BV2 cells but downregulated in Raw264.7 cells under OGD in vitro. These observations indicate that neonatal HI induced different degrees of brain injury. The proportion of infiltrated macrophage MDMs was increased and they were recruited into the injured brain parenchyma in severe brain injury. The resident macrophage MGs proportion decreased and maintained activated phagocytic function in both mild and severe brain injury, and restored neuroprotective function in severe brain injury.</p>

The selective autophagy pathways of xenophagy and mitophagy are initiated when the adaptor NDP52 recruits the ULK1 complex to autophagic cargo. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) was used to map the membrane and NDP52 binding sites of the ULK1 complex to unique regions of the coiled coil of the FIP200 subunit. Electron microscopy of the full-length ULK1 complex shows that the FIP200 coiled coil projects away from the crescent-shaped FIP200 N-terminal domain dimer. NDP52 allosterically stimulates membrane-binding by FIP200 and the ULK1 complex by promoting a more dynamic conformation of the membrane-binding portion of the FIP200 coiled coil. Giant unilamellar vesicle (GUV) reconstitution confirmed that membrane recruitment by the ULK1 complex is triggered by NDP52 engagement. These data reveal how the allosteric linkage between NDP52 and the ULK1 complex could drive the first membrane recruitment event of phagophore biogenesis in xenophagy and mitophagy.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58463">Discovery of surrogate agonists for visceral fat Treg cells that modulate metabolic indices <i>in vivo</i></a></h4>

T regulatory (Treg) cells play vital roles in modulating immunity and tissue homeostasis. Their actions depend on TCR recognition of peptide-MHC molecules; yet the degree of peptide specificity of Treg-cell function, and whether Treg ligands can be used to manipulate Treg cell biology are unknown. Here, we developed an A<sup>b</sup>-peptide library that enabled unbiased screening of peptides recognized by a bona fide murine Treg cell clone isolated from the visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and identified surrogate agonist peptides, with differing affinities and signaling potencies. The VAT-Treg cells expanded <i>in vivo</i> by one of the surrogate agonists preserved the typical VAT-Treg transcriptional programs. Immunization with this surrogate, especially when coupled with blockade of TNFa signaling, expanded VAT-Treg cells, resulting in protection from inflammation and improved metabolic indices, including promotion of insulin sensitivity. These studies suggest that antigen-specific targeting of VAT-localized Treg cells could eventually be a strategy for improving metabolic disease.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58157">Cryo-EM structure of VASH1-SVBP bound to microtubules</a></h4>

The dynamic tyrosination-detyrosination cycle of α-tubulin regulates microtubule functions. Perturbation of this cycle impairs mitosis, neural physiology, and cardiomyocyte contraction. The carboxypeptidases vasohibins 1 and 2 (VASH1 and VASH2), in complex with the small vasohibin-binding protein (SVBP), mediate α-tubulin detyrosination. These enzymes detyrosinate microtubules more efficiently than soluble αβ-tubulin heterodimers. The structural basis for this substrate preference is not understood. Using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we have determined the structure of human VASH1-SVBP bound to microtubules. The acidic C-terminal tail of α-tubulin binds to a positively charged groove near the active site of VASH1. VASH1 forms multiple additional contacts with the globular domain of α-tubulin, including contacts with a second α-tubulin in an adjacent protofilament. Simultaneous engagement of two protofilaments by VASH1 can only occur within the microtubule lattice, but not with free αβ heterodimers. These lattice-specific interactions enable preferential detyrosination of microtubules by VASH1.

The UPF3B-dependent branch of the nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD) pathway is critical for human cognition. Here, we examined the role of UPF3B in the olfactory system. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis demonstrated considerable heterogeneity of olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) cell populations in wild type (WT) mice, and revealed that UPF3B loss influences specific subsets of these cell populations. UPF3B also regulates the expression of a large cadre of anti-microbial genes in OSNs, and promotes the selection of specific olfactory receptor (<i>Olfr</i>) genes for expression in mature OSNs (mOSNs). RNA-seq and Ribotag analyses identified classes of mRNAs expressed and translated at different levels in WT and <i>Upf3b</i>-null mOSNs. Integrating multiple computational approaches, UPF3B-dependent NMD target transcripts that are candidates to mediate the functions of NMD in mOSNs were identified <i>in vivo</i>. Together, our data provides a valuable resource for the olfactory field and insights into the roles of NMD <i>in vivo</i>.

Human disease phenotypes are ultimately driven primarily by alterations in protein expression and/or function. To date, relatively little is known about the variability of the human proteome in populations and how this relates to variability in mRNA expression and to disease loci. Here, we present the first comprehensive proteomic analysis of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), a key cell type for disease modelling, analysing 202 iPSC lines derived from 151 donors, with integrated transcriptome and genomic sequence data from the same lines. We characterised the major genetic and non-genetic determinants of proteome variation across iPSC lines and assessed key regulatory mechanisms affecting variation in protein abundance. We identified 654 protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) in iPSCs, including disease-linked variants in protein coding sequences and variants with <i>trans</i> regulatory effects. These include pQTL linked to GWAS variants that cannot be detected at the mRNA level, highlighting the utility of dissecting pQTL at peptide level resolution.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56922">Differentiating <i>Drosophila</i> female germ cells initiate Polycomb silencing by regulating PRC2-interacting proteins</a></h4>

Polycomb silencing represses gene expression and provides a molecular memory of chromatin state that is essential for animal development. We show that <i>Drosophila</i> female germline stem cells (GSCs) provide a powerful system for studying Polycomb silencing. GSCs have a non-canonical distribution of PRC2 activity and lack silenced chromatin, like embryonic progenitors. As GSC daughters differentiate into nurse cells and oocytes, nurse cells silence genes in traditional Polycomb domains and in generally inactive chromatin like embryonic somatic cells. Developmentally controlled expression of two Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)-interacting proteins, Pcl and Scm, initiate silencing during differentiation. In GSCs, abundant Pcl inhibits PRC2-dependent silencing globally, while in nurse cells Pcl declines and newly-induced Scm concentrates PRC2 activity on traditional Polycomb domains. Our results suggest that PRC2-dependent silencing is developmentally regulated by accessory proteins that either increase the concentration of PRC2 at target sites or inhibit the rate that PRC2 samples chromatin.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56915">A large effective population size for established within-host influenza virus infection</a></h4>

Strains of the influenza virus form coherent global populations, yet exist at the level of single infections in individual hosts. The relationship between these scales is a critical topic for understanding viral evolution. Here we investigate the within-host relationship between selection and the stochastic effects of genetic drift, estimating an effective population size of infection N<sub>e</sub> for influenza infection. Examining whole-genome sequence data describing a chronic case of influenza B in a severely immunocompromised child we infer an N<sub>e</sub> of 2.5 x 10<sup>7</sup> (95% confidence range 1.0 x 10<sup>7</sup> to 9.0 x 10<sup>7</sup>) suggesting that genetic drift is of minimal importance during an established influenza infection. Our result, supported by data from influenza A infection, suggests that positive selection during within-host infection is primarily limited by the typically short period of infection. Atypically long infections may have a disproportionate influence upon global patterns of viral evolution.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56811">Inhibition of striatonigral autophagy as a link between cannabinoid intoxication and impairment of motor coordination</a></h4>

The use of cannabis is rapidly expanding worldwide. Thus, innovative studies aimed to identify, understand and potentially reduce cannabis-evoked harms are warranted. Here, we found that Δ<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol, the psychoactive ingredient of cannabis, disrupts autophagy selectively in the striatum, a brain area that controls motor behavior, both in vitro and in vivo. Boosting autophagy, either pharmacologically (with temsirolimus) or by dietary intervention (with trehalose), rescued the Δ<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol-induced impairment of motor coordination in mice. The combination of conditional knockout mouse models and viral vector-mediated autophagy-modulating strategies in vivo showed that cannabinoid CB<sub>1</sub> receptors located on neurons belonging to the direct (striatonigral) pathway are required for the motor-impairing activity of Δ<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol by inhibiting local autophagy. Taken together, these findings identify inhibition of autophagy as an unprecedented mechanistic link between cannabinoids and motor performance, and suggest that activators of autophagy might be considered as potential therapeutic tools to treat specific cannabinoid-evoked behavioral alterations.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55862">Genomic architecture and evolutionary antagonism drive allelic expression bias in the social supergene of red fire ants</a></h4>

Supergene regions maintain alleles of multiple genes in tight linkage through suppressed recombination. Despite their importance in determining complex phenotypes, our empirical understanding of early supergene evolution is limited. Here we focus on the young "social" supergene of fire ants, a powerful system for disentangling the effects of evolutionary antagonism and suppressed recombination. We hypothesize that gene degeneration and social antagonism shaped the evolution of the fire ant supergene, resulting in distinct patterns of gene expression. We test these ideas by identifying allelic differences between supergene variants, characterizing allelic expression across populations, castes and body parts, and contrasting allelic expression biases with differences in expression between social forms. We find strong signatures of gene degeneration and gene-specific dosage compensation. On this background, a small portion of the genes has the signature of adaptive responses to evolutionary antagonism between social forms.

Developmental studies revealed fundamental principles on how organ size and function is achieved, but less is known about organ adaptation to new physiological demands. In fruit flies, juvenile hormone (JH) induces intestinal stem cell (ISC) driven absorptive epithelial expansion balancing energy uptake with increased energy demands of pregnancy. Here, we show 20-Hydroxy-Ecdysone (20HE)-signaling controlling organ homeostasis with physiological and pathological implications. Upon mating, 20HE titer in ovaries and hemolymph are increased and act on nearby midgut progenitors inducing <i>Ecdysone-induced-protein-75B (Eip75B). </i>Strikingly, the <i>PPAR</i><i>γ</i>-homologue <i>Eip75B</i> drives ISC daughter cells towards absorptive enterocyte lineage ensuring epithelial growth. To our knowledge, this is the first time a systemic hormone is shown to direct local stem cell fate decisions. Given the protective, but mechanistically unclear role of steroid hormones in female colorectal cancer patients, our findings suggest a tumor-suppressive role for steroidal signaling by promoting postmitotic fate when local signaling is deteriorated.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55778">Geometric models for robust encoding of dynamical information into embryonic patterns</a></h4>

During development, cells gradually assume specialized fates via changes of transcriptional dynamics, sometimes even within the same developmental stage. For anterior-posterior (AP) patterning in metazoans, it has been suggested that the gradual transition from a dynamic genetic regime to a static one is encoded by different transcriptional modules. In that case, the static regime has an essential role in pattern formation in addition to its maintenance function. In this work, we introduce a geometric approach to study such transition. We exhibit two types of genetic regime transitions, respectively arising through local or global bifurcations. We find that the global bifurcation type is more generic, more robust, and better preserves dynamical information. This could parsimoniously explain common features of metazoan segmentation, such as changes of periods leading to waves of gene expressions, 'speed/frequency-gradient' dynamics, and changes of wave patterns. Geometric approaches appear as possible alternatives to gene regulatory networks to understand development.

Goal-directed behaviours may be poorly coordinated in young animals but, with age and experience, behaviour progressively adapts to efficiently exploit the animal's ecological niche. How experience impinges on the developing neural circuits of behaviour is an open question. We have conducted a detailed study of the effects of experience on the ontogeny of hunting behaviour in larval zebrafish. We report that larvae with prior experience of live prey consume considerably more prey than naive larvae. This is mainly due to increased capture success and a modest increase in hunt rate. We demonstrate that the initial turn to prey and the final capture manoeuvre of the hunting sequence were jointly modified by experience and that modification of these components predicted capture success. Our findings establish an ethologically relevant paradigm in zebrafish for studying how the brain is shaped by experience to drive the ontogeny of efficient behaviour.

The cause has been debated, with some studies indicating perception, while others indicate a response effect. We applied the neural habituation model of Huber and OReilly (2003) to the NCE, explaining the varied results as reflecting changes in the timing of events. We developed a novel variant of the NCE task, specifying the perceptual dynamics of orientation priming as measured with threshold accuracy. This revealed a transition from positive to negative priming as a function of prime duration, and a second experiment ruled out response priming. The perceptual dynamics of the neural habituation model were fit to these results and the parameter values were fixed in applying the model to the NCE literature. Application of the model to RTs necessitated a response representation that accumulates response information during the trial. Our results indicate that the NCE reflects rapid perceptual priming and slower response priming. Because the accumulation of response information is slow and does not suffer from habituation, the response factor of the prime is a positive effect (lingering response information). In contrast, because perceptual activation is fast and habituates, the perceptual factor can be positive or negative priming depending on the timing of the display sequence. These factors interact with the post-prime mask, which can prime the alternative direction when the mask is a related mask created by combining arrows pointing in both directions.

Successful oculomotor target selection often requires discriminating visual features but it remains contentious whether oculomotor substrates encoding saccade vectors functionally contribute to this process. One possibility is that visual features are discriminated cortically and oculomotor modules select the object with the highest activation in the set of all preprocessed cortical object representations, while an alternative possibility is that oculomotor modules actively discriminate potential targets based on visual features. If the latter view is correct, these modules should not require input from specialized visual cortices encoding the task relevant features. We therefore examined whether the latency of visual onset responses elicited by abrupt distractor onsets is consistent with input from specialized visual cortices by non-invasively measuring human saccade metrics (saccade curvature, endpoint deviations, saccade frequency, error proportion) as a function of distractor processing time for novel, visually complex distractors that had to be discriminated from a target to guide saccades. Visual onset response latencies were ~110 ms, consistent with projections from anterior cortical sites specialized for object processing. Surprisingly, oculomotor visual onset responses encoded features, as we manipulated the visual similarity between targets and distractors and observed an increased visual onset response magnitude and duration when the distractor was highly similar to the target, which was not attributable to an inhibitory processing delay. Visual onset responses were dynamically modulated by executive function, as these responses were anticipatorily extinguished over the time course of the experiment. As expected, the latency of distractor-related inhibition was modulated by the behavioral relevance of the distractor.

Somatosensory stimuli guide and shape behavior, from immediate protective reflexes to longer-term learning and high-order processes related to pain and touch. However, somatosensory inputs are challenging to control in awake mammals due to the diversity and nature of contact stimuli. Application of cutaneous stimuli is currently limited to relatively imprecise methods as well as subjective behavioral measures. The strategy we present here overcomes these difficulties by achieving spatiotemporally precise, remote and dynamic optogenetic stimulation of skin by projecting light to a small defined area in freely-behaving mice. We mapped behavioral responses to specific nociceptive inputs and revealed a sparse code for stimulus intensity: using the first action potential, the number of activated nociceptors governs the timing and magnitude of rapid protective pain-related behavior. The strategy can be used to define specific behavioral repertoires, examine the timing and nature of reflexes, and dissect sensory, motor, cognitive and motivational processes guiding behavior.

Foraging is a vital behavioral task for living organisms. Behavioral strategies and abstract mathematical models thereof have been described in detail for various species. To explore the link between underlying neural circuits and computational principles we present how a biologically detailed neural circuit model of the insect mushroom body implements sensory processing, learning and motor control. We focus on cast &amp; surge strategies employed by flying insects when foraging within turbulent odor plumes. Using a spike-based plasticity rule the model rapidly learns to associate individual olfactory sensory cues paired with food in a classical conditioning paradigm. We show that, without retraining, the system dynamically recalls memories to detect relevant cues in complex sensory scenes. Accumulation of this sensory evidence on short time scales generates cast &amp; surge motor commands. Our generic systems approach predicts that population sparseness facilitates learning, while temporal sparseness is required for dynamic memory recall and precise behavioral control. Our work successfully combines biological computational principles with spike-based machine learning. It shows how knowledge transfer from static to arbitrary complex dynamic conditions can be achieved by foraging insects and may serve as inspiration for agent-based machine learning.

Methods for electro- or magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG) based brain source imaging (BSI) using sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) have been demonstrated to achieve excellent performance in situations with low numbers of distinct active sources, such as event-related designs. This paper extends the theory and practice of SBL in three important ways. First, we reformulate three existing SBL algorithms under the majorization-minimization (MM) framework. This unification perspective not only provides a useful theoretical framework for comparing different algorithms in terms of their convergence behavior, but also provides a principled recipe for constructing novel algorithms with specific properties by designing appropriate bounds of the Bayesian marginal likelihood function. Second, building on the MM principle, we propose a novel method called LowSNR-BSI that achieves favorable source reconstruction performance in low signal-to-noise-ratio settings. Third, precise knowledge of the noise level is a crucial requirement for accurate source reconstruction. Here we present a novel principled technique to accurately learn the noise variance from the data either jointly within the source reconstruction procedure or using one of two proposed cross-validation strategies. Empirically, we could show that the monotonous convergence behavior predicted from MM theory is confirmed in numerical experiments. Using simulations, we further demonstrate the advantage of LowSNR-BSI over conventional SBL in low-SNR regimes, and the advantage of learned noise levels over estimates derived from baseline data. To demonstrate the usefulness of our novel approach we show neurophysiologically plausible source reconstructions on averaged auditory evoked potential data.

A hallmark of amyloid disorders, such as Alzheimers disease, is aggregation of secreted proteins. However it is largely unclear how the hundreds of secretory pathway proteins contribute to amyloid formation. We developed a systems biology framework that integrates expression data with protein-protein interaction networks to successfully estimate a tissues fitness for producing specific secreted proteins. Using this framework, we analyzed the fitness of the secretory pathway of various brain regions and cell types for synthesizing the Alzheimers disease-associated amyloid-precursor protein (APP). While none of the key amyloidogenic pathway components were differentially expressed in AD brain, we found the deposition of A{beta} is associated with repressed expression of the secretory pathway components proximal to APP. Concurrently, we detected systemic up-regulation of the secretory pathway components proximal to {beta}- and {gamma}-secretases in AD brains. Our analyses suggest that perturbations from 3 high confidence AD risk genes cascade through the secretory machinery support network for APP and into the endocytosis pathway. Thus, we present a model where amyloidogenesis is associated with dysregulation of dozens of secretory pathway components supporting APP, which could yield novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of AD.

The dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus is fundamental for cognitive flexibility and has the extraordinary ability to generate new neurons throughout life. Recent evidence suggested that adult-born neurons differentially modulate input to the DG during the processing of spatial information and novelty. However, how this differential regulation by neurogenesis is translated into different aspects contributing cognitive flexibility is unclear. Here, we increased adult-born neurons by a genetic expansion of neural stem cells and studied their influence during navigational learning. We found that increased neurogenesis improved memory precision, indexing and retention and that each of these gains was associated with a differential activation of specific DG compartments and better separation of memory representations in the DG-CA3 network. Our results highlight the role of adult-born neurons in promoting memory precision in the infrapyramidal and indexing in the suprapyramidal blade of the DG and together contributing to cognitive flexibility.

Feedforward deep neural networks for object recognition are a promising model of visual processing and can accurately predict firing-rate responses along the ventral stream. Yet, these networks have limitations as models of various aspects of cortical processing related to recurrent connectivity, including neuronal synchronization and the integration of sensory inputs with spatio-temporal context. We trained self-supervised, generative neural networks to predict small regions of natural images based on the spatial context (i.e. inpainting). Using these network predictions, we determined the spatial predictability of visual inputs into (macaque) V1 receptive fields (RFs), and distinguished low- from high-level predictability. Spatial predictability strongly modulated V1 activity, with distinct effects on firing rates and synchronization in gamma-(30-80Hz) and beta-bands (18-30Hz). Furthermore, firing rates, but not synchronization, were accurately predicted by a deep neural network for object recognition. Neural networks trained to specifically predict V1 gamma-band synchronization developed large, grating-like RFs in the deepest layer. These findings suggest complementary roles for firing rates and synchronization in self-supervised learning of natural-image statistics.

Ca2+-imaging is a powerful tool to measure neuronal dynamics and network activity. To monitor network-level changes in cultured neurons, neuronal activity is often evoked by electrical or optogenetic stimulation and assessed using multi-electrode arrays or sophisticated imaging. Although such approaches allow detailed network analyses, multi-electrode arrays lack single-cell precision, whereas optical physiology requires advanced instrumentation. Here we developed a simple, stimulation-free protocol with associated Matlab algorithms that enables scalable analyses of spontaneous network activity in cultured human and mouse neurons. The approach allows analysis of overall networks and single-neuron dynamics, and is amenable to scale-up for screening purposes. We validated the new method by assessing human neurons with a heterozygous conditional deletion of Munc18-1, and mouse neurons with homozygous conditional deletions of neurexins. The approach described here enabled identification of differential changes in the amplitudes and synchronicity of neuronal spikes during network activity in these mutant neurons, demonstrating the utility of the approach. Compared with current imaging platforms, our method is simple, scalable, accessible, and easy to implement. It enables quantification of more detailed parameters than multi-electrode arrays, but does not have the resolution and depth of more sophisticated yet labour-intensive analysis methods, such as patch-clamp electrophysiology. The method reported here is scalable for a rapid direct assessment of neuronal function in culture, and can be applied to both human and mouse neurons. Thus, the method can serve as a basis for phenotypical analysis of mutations and for drug discovery efforts.

Neonatal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure can lead to depressive-like behaviors in mice through inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines including interferon(IFN)-{gamma}. ATP8A2 is a phospholipid transporter located on the cell membrane. Studies have shown that the decrease in ATP8A2 expression in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is associated with depressive behavior. Moreover, it has been reported that IFN-{gamma} could reduce ATP8A2 expression in non-neuronal cells. These findings prompted us to hypothesize that neonatal LPS exposure might induce ATP8A2 down-regulation in PFC in mice by increasing the IFN-{gamma} level. Mice pups consisting approximately evenly of both sexes were intraperitoneally injected with 3 doses of LPS (50 g/kg body weight for each dose) on postnatal day (PND5), PND7 and PND9. Here, we first found that PFC ATP8A2 expression decreased significantly and transiently till ten days after neonatal LPS exposure with the lowest level at two days after it. Moreover, a negative correlation of PFC ATP8A2 expression was found with the PFC level of IFN-{gamma}, rather than the other LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines. Using anti-IFN-{gamma} neutralizing mAb, IFN-{gamma} was identified as the key mediator of LPS-induced ATP8A2 down-regulation in PFC in mice. Besides, neutralizing IFN-{gamma} partially but significantly rescued the depressive-like behaviors in adulthood induced by neonatal LPS exposure. In sum, the present study showed that neonatal LPS exposure induced ATP8A2 down-regulation in PFC and depressive-like behaviors in mice through increasing the IFN-{gamma} level.

Objective and Impact StatementSegmentation of blood vessels from two-photon microscopy (2PM) angiograms of brains has important applications in hemodynamic analysis and disease diagnosis. Here we develop a generalizable deep-learning technique for accurate 2PM vascular segmentation of sizable regions in mouse brains acquired from multiple 2PM setups. In addition, the technique is computationally efficient, making it ideal for large-scale neurovascular analysis.

IntroductionVascular segmentation from 2PM angiograms is usually an important first step in hemodynamic modeling of brain vasculature. Existing state-of-the-art segmentation methods based on deep-learning either lack the ability to generalize to data from various imaging systems, or are computationally infeasible for large-scale angiograms. In this work, we present a method which improves upon both these limitations by being generalizable to various imaging systems, and also being able to segment very large-scale angiograms.

MethodsWe employ a computationally efficient deep-learning framework based on a semi-supervised learning strategy, whose effectiveness we demonstrate on experimentally acquired in-vivo angiograms from mouse brains of dimensions up to 808x808x702 {micro}m.

ResultsAfter training on data from only one 2PM microscope, we perform vascular segmentation on data from another microscope without any network tuning. Our method demonstrates 10x faster computation in terms of voxels-segmented-per-second and 3x larger depth compared to the state-of-the-art.

ConclusionOur work provides a generalizable and computationally efficient anatomical modeling framework for the brain vasculature, which consists of deep-learning based vascular segmentation followed by graphing. It paves the way for future modeling and analysis of hemodynamic response at much greater scales that were inaccessible before.

Oscillatory neural activity is dynamically controlled to coordinate perceptual, attentional and cognitive processes. On the macroscopic scale, this control is reflected in the U-shaped deviations of EEG spectral-power dynamics from stochastic dynamics, characterized by disproportionately elevated occurrences of the lowest and highest ranges of power. To understand the mechanisms that generate these low- and high-power states, we fit a simple mathematical model of synchronization of oscillatory activity to human EEG data. The results consistently indicated that the majority (~95%) of synchronization dynamics is controlled by slowly adjusting the probability of synchronization while maintaining maximum entropy within the timescale of a few seconds. This strategy appears to be universal as the results generalized across oscillation frequencies, EEG current sources, and participants (N = 52) whether they rested with their eyes closed, rested with their eyes open in a darkened room, or viewed a silent nature video. Given that precisely coordinated behavior requires tightly controlled oscillatory dynamics, the current results suggest that the large-scale spatial synchronization of oscillatory activity is controlled by the relatively slow, entropy-maximizing adjustments of synchronization probability (demonstrated here) in combination with temporally precise phase adjustments (e.g., phase resetting generated by sensorimotor interactions). Interestingly, we observed a modest but consistent spatial pattern of deviations from the maximum-entropy rule, potentially suggesting that the mid-central-posterior region serves as an "entropy dump" to facilitate the temporally precise control of spectral-power dynamics in the surrounding regions.

We introduce a straightforward, robust method for recording and analyzing spiking activity over timeframes longer than a single session, with primary application to the marmoset (Callithrix jacchus). Although in theory the marmosets smooth brain allows for broad deployment of powerful tools in primate cortex, in practice marmosets do not typically engage in long experimental sessions akin to rhesus monkeys. This potentially limits their value for detailed, quantitative neurophysiological study. Here we describe chronically-implanted arrays with a 3D arrangement of electrodes yielding stable single and multi-unit responses, and an analytic method for creating "supersessions" combining that array data across multiple experiments. We could match units across different recording sessions over several weeks, demonstrating the feasibility of pooling data over sessions. This could be a key tool for extending the viability of marmosets for dissecting neural computations in primate cortex.

The human nervous system is one of the most complicated systems in nature. The complex non-linear behaviours have been shown from the single neuron level to the system level. For decades, linear connectivity analysis methods, such as correlation, coherence and Granger causality, have been extensively used to assess the neural connectivities and input-output interconnections in neural systems. Recent studies indicate that these linear methods can only capture a small amount of neural activities and functional relationships, and therefore cannot describe neural behaviours in a precise or complete way. In this review, we highlight recent advances on nonlinear system identification of neural systems, corresponding time and frequency domain analysis, and novel neural connectivity measures based on nonlinear system identification techniques. We argue that nonlinear modelling and analysis are necessary to study neuronal processing and signal transfer in neural systems quantitatively. These approaches can hopefully provide new insights to advance our understanding of neurophysiological mechanisms underlying neural functions. They also have the potential to produce sensitive biomarkers to facilitate the development of precision diagnostic tools for evaluating neurological disorders and the effects of targeted intervention.

ATP and its ionotropic P2X receptors are components of one of the most ancient signaling systems. However, little is known about the distribution and function of purinergic transmission in invertebrates. Here, we cloned, expressed, and pharmacologically characterized P2X receptors in the sea slug Aplysia californica, a prominent model in cellular and system neuroscience. We showed that ATP and P2X receptors are essential signaling components within the unique bioenergetic center located in the CNS of Aplysia, also known as the cerebral F-cluster of insulin-containing neurons. Functional P2X receptors were successfully expressed in Xenopus oocytes to characterize their ATP-dependence (EC50 = 306uM), two-phased kinetics, ion selectivity (Na+-dependence), sensitivity to the ATP analog Bz-ATP (~20% compare to ATP) and antagonists (with PPADS as a more potent inhibitor compared to suramin). Next, using RNA-seq, we characterized the expression of P2X receptors across more than a dozen Aplysia peripheral tissues and developmental stages. We showed that P2X receptors are predominantly expressed in chemosensory structures and during early cleavage stages. The localization and pharmacology of P2X receptors in Aplysia highlight the evolutionary conservation of bioenergetic sensors and chemosensory purinergic transmission across animals. This study also provides a foundation to decipher homeostatic mechanisms in development and neuroendocrine systems.

Neuronal cell-types are arranged in brain-wide circuits to guide behavior. In mice, the superior colliculus is comprised of a set of cell-types that each innervate distinct downstream targets. Here we reveal the brain-wide networks downstream of four collicular cell-types by combining functional ultrasound imaging (fUSi) with optogenetics to monitor neural activity at a resolution of ~100 m. Each neuronal group triggered different behaviors, and activated distinct, partially overlapping sets of brain nuclei. This included regions not previously thought to mediate defensive behaviors, e.g. the posterior paralaminar nuclei of the thalamus (PPnT), that we show to play a role in suppressing habituation. Electrophysiological recordings support the fUSi findings and show that neurons in the downstream nuclei preferentially respond to innately threatening visual stimuli. This work provides insight into the functional organization of the networks governing defensive behaviors and demonstrates an experimental approach to explore the whole-brain neuronal activity downstream of targeted cell-types.

Vagal stimulation is emerging as the next frontier in bioelectronic medicine to modulate peripheral organ health and treat disease. The neuronal molecular phenotypes in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV) remain largely unexplored, limiting the potential for harnessing the DMV plasticity for therapeutic interventions. We developed a mesoscale single cell transcriptomics data from hundreds of DMV neurons under homeostasis and following physiological perturbations. Our results revealed that homeostatic DMV neuronal states can be organized into distinguishable input-output signal processing units. Remote ischemic preconditioning induced a distinctive shift in the neuronal states towards diminishing the role of inhibitory inputs, with concomitant changes in regulatory microRNAs miR-218a and miR-495. Chronic cardiac ischemic injury resulted in a dramatic shift in DMV neuronal states suggestive of enhanced neurosecretory function. We propose a DMV molecular network mechanism that integrates combinatorial neurotransmitter inputs from multiple brain regions and humoral signals to modulate cardiac health.

The attraction of Drosophila melanogaster towards byproducts of alcoholic fermentation, especially ethanol, has been extensively studied 1-4. However, the adaptive value of this behavior has not been elucidated. Previous studies have suggested anthropomorphic interpretations of D. melanogaster behavior towards alcohols 5,6. Here, we instead assert that there exists a simple yet vital biological rationale for alcohol contact and consumption by these insects. We show that exposure to alcohols, especially methanol, results in an immediate amplification of fatty acid ester pheromone levels, which in turn elevates the probability that a male will successfully compete for a female during courtship. We proceed to identify three types of olfactory sensory neurons that detect ethanol and methanol. Moreover, we trace the ensuing neural circuits and reveal their role in controlling both attraction and aversion, where valence is balanced around mating status. Based on our results, we deduce that male flies associate with sources of alcohol as a biological imperative related to reproduction, and we provide an assessment of how and why D. melanogaster is associated with alcohol using a sound ecological and natural history approach to this previously enigmatic biological phenomenon.

Examining whether and how the rhythms of limb and breathing movements interact is highly informative about the mechanistic origin of hyperpnoea to exercise. However, studies have failed to reveal regularities. In particular, whether breathing frequency is inherently proportional to limb velocity and/or imposed by a synchronization of breaths to strides is still unclear. Here, we examined the specifications of respiratory changes during running in mice, the premier model for investigating, in a standardized manner, complex integrative tasks including adaptive breathing. We show that respiratory rate increases during running to a fixed and stable value, irrespective of trotting velocities and of inclination. Yet, respiratory rate was further enhanced during gallop. We also demonstrate the absence of temporal coordination of breaths to strides at any speed, intensity or gait. Our work thus highlights a hardwired mechanism that sets respiratory frequency independently of limb movements but in relation with the engaged locomotor program.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Role of peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptors (PPARs) in the pathophysiology of stroke and protective effects of PPAR ligands have been widely investigated in the last 20 years. Activation of all three PPAR isoforms, but especially PPAR‐γ, was documented to limit postischemic injury in the numerous <i>in vivo </i>, as well as in <i>in vitro </i> studies. PPARs have been demonstrated to act on multiple mechanisms and were shown to activate multiple protective pathways related to inflammation, apoptosis, BBB protection, neurogenesis, and oxidative stress. The aim of this review was to summarize two decades of PPAR research in stroke with emphasis on <i>in vivo </i> animal studies. We focus on each PPAR receptor separately and detail their implication in stroke. This review also discusses recent clinical efforts in the field and the epidemiological data with regard to role of PPAR polymorphisms in susceptibility to stroke, and tries to draw conclusions and describe future perspectives.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Thousands of individuals die each year from opioid‐related overdoses. While naloxone (Narcan®) is currently the most widely employed treatment to reverse opioid toxicity, high or repeated doses of this antidote often lead to precipitated opioid withdrawal (POW). We hypothesized that a slow linear release of naloxone from a nanoparticle would induce fewer POW symptoms compared to high‐dose free naloxone. First, we measured the acute impact of covalent naloxone nanoparticles (Nal‐<i>c </i>NPs) on morphine‐induced antinociception in the hotplate test. We found that Nal‐<i>c </i>NP treatment blocked the antinociceptive effect of morphine within 15 min of administration. Next, we tested the impact of Nal‐<i>c </i>NPs on POW symptoms in male morphine‐dependent mice. To induce morphine dependence, mice were treated with 5 mg/kg morphine (or saline) twice‐daily for six consecutive days. On day 7 mice received 5 mg/kg morphine (or saline) injections 2 hr prior to receiving treatment of either unmodified free naloxone, a high or low dose of Nal‐<i>c </i>NP, empty nanoparticle (<i>c </i>NP‐empty), or saline. Behavior was analyzed for 0–6 hr followed by 24 and 48 hr time points after treatment. As expected, free naloxone induced a significant increase in POW behavior in morphine‐dependent mice compared to saline‐treated mice upon free naloxone administration. In comparison, reduced POW behavior was observed with both doses of Nal‐<i>c </i>NP. Side effects of Nal‐<i>c </i>NP on locomotion and fecal boli production were measured and no significant side‐effects were observed. Overall, our data show that sustained release of naloxone from a covalent nanoparticle does not induce severe POW symptoms in morphine‐dependent mice.</p>

<p>by Laura Bella Naumann, Henning Sprekeler</p>

Hebbian plasticity, a mechanism believed to be the substrate of learning and memory, detects and further enhances correlated neural activity. Because this constitutes an unstable positive feedback loop, it requires additional homeostatic control. Computational work suggests that in recurrent networks, the homeostatic mechanisms observed in experiments are too slow to compensate instabilities arising from Hebbian plasticity and need to be complemented by rapid compensatory processes. We suggest presynaptic inhibition as a candidate that rapidly provides stability by compensating recurrent excitation induced by Hebbian changes. Presynaptic inhibition is mediated by presynaptic GABA receptors that effectively and reversibly attenuate transmitter release. Activation of these receptors can be triggered by excess network activity, hence providing a stabilising negative feedback loop that weakens recurrent interactions on sub-second timescales. We study the stabilising effect of presynaptic inhibition in a recurrent networks, in which presynaptic inhibition is implemented as a multiplicative reduction of recurrent synaptic weights in response to increasing inhibitory activity. We show that networks with presynaptic inhibition display a gradual increase of firing rates with growing excitatory weights, in contrast to traditional excitatory-inhibitory networks. This alleviates the positive feedback loop between Hebbian plasticity and network activity and thereby allows homeostasis to act on timescales similar to those observed in experiments. Our results generalise to spiking networks with a biophysically more detailed implementation of the presynaptic inhibition mechanism. In conclusion, presynaptic inhibition provides a powerful compensatory mechanism that rapidly reduces effective recurrent interactions and thereby stabilises Hebbian learning.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/B8M0a75I0Uo" width="1" />

Drug repurposing, identifying novel indications for drugs, bypasses common drug development pitfalls to ultimately deliver therapies to patients faster. However, most repurposing discoveries have been led by anecdotal observations (e.g. Viagra) or experimental-based repurposing screens, which are costly, time-consuming, and imprecise. Recently, more systematic computational approaches have been proposed, however these rely on utilizing the information from the diseases a drug is already approved to treat. This inherently limits the algorithms, making them unusable for investigational molecules. Here, we present a computational approach to drug repurposing, CATNIP, that requires only biological and chemical information of a molecule. CATNIP is trained with 2,576 diverse small molecules and uses 16 different drug similarity features, such as structural, target, or pathway based similarity. This model obtains significant predictive power (AUC = 0.841). Using our model, we created a repurposing network to identify broad scale repurposing opportunities between drug types. By exploiting this network, we identified literature-supported repurposing candidates, such as the use of systemic hormonal preparations for the treatment of respiratory illnesses. Furthermore, we demonstrated that we can use our approach to identify novel uses for defined drug classes. We found that adrenergic uptake inhibitors, specifically amitriptyline and trimipramine, could be potential therapies for Parkinson’s disease. Additionally, using CATNIP, we predicted the kinase inhibitor, vandetanib, as a possible treatment for Type 2 Diabetes. Overall, this systematic approach to drug repurposing lays the groundwork to streamline future drug development efforts.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GaN2Ncpsy4I" width="1" />

<p>by Leo Kozachkov, Mikael Lundqvist, Jean-Jacques Slotine, Earl K. Miller</p>

The brain consists of many interconnected networks with time-varying, partially autonomous activity. There are multiple sources of noise and variation yet activity has to eventually converge to a stable, reproducible state (or sequence of states) for its computations to make sense. We approached this problem from a control-theory perspective by applying contraction analysis to recurrent neural networks. This allowed us to find mechanisms for achieving stability in multiple connected networks with biologically realistic dynamics, including synaptic plasticity and time-varying inputs. These mechanisms included inhibitory Hebbian plasticity, excitatory anti-Hebbian plasticity, synaptic sparsity and excitatory-inhibitory balance. Our findings shed light on how stable computations might be achieved despite biological complexity. Crucially, our analysis is not limited to analyzing the stability of fixed geometric objects in state space (e.g points, lines, planes), but rather the stability of state trajectories which may be complex and time-varying.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/660jkWwn5gk" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe and complex psychiatric disorder characterized by intense fear about weight gain and finalized to food‐related control behaviors. Growing interest has been demonstrated about neurobiological processes subtend to AN physiopathology. The present review aimed to collect neurostructural and neurofunctional available data from 2010 to 2019. Results have been organized according to the neuroimaging technique employed, also including a specific section on electroencephalographic results, mostly neglected in previous reviews. Diffuse cerebral vulnerability has been demonstrated and the contribution of several structures has been identified. Insula, cingulate cortex, parietal and frontal areas are primarily involved both by structural and functional perspectives. Moreover, consistent alterations in white matter integrity and brain electrical activity have been reported. Neuroimaging findings give a substantial contribution to AN pathophysiological description, also in order to understand altered but reversible processes in the passage from acute illness phase to disorder's remission, useful also for defining therapy.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Latest studies have revealed that pain negatively impacts on reward processing and motivation leading to negative affective states and stress. These states not only reduce quality of life of patients by increasing the appearance of psychiatric comorbidities, but also have an important impact on vulnerability to drug abuse, including alcohol. In fact, clinical, epidemiological but also preclinical studies have revealed that the presence of pain is closely related to alcohol use disorders (AUDs). All this evidence suggests that pain is a factor that increases the risk of suffering AUD, predicting heavy drinking behavior and relapse drinking in those patients with a previous history of AUD. The negative consequences of chronic pain and its impact on stress and AUD are likely mediated by alterations in the central nervous system, especially in the stress and reward systems. Therefore, pain and stress impact on dopaminergic mesolimbic pathway can lead to an increase in drug abuse liability. In this mini review we analyze the interaction between pain, stress, and alcohol addiction, and how dynamic changes in the kappa opioid system might play a crucial role in the development of compulsive alcohol drinking in chronic pain patients.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Given the ubiquitous nature of opioids in the treatment of pain, it is an interesting paradox that this class of medications also represents one of the least understood components of clinical pain medicine. For many years, there has been intense interest in the mechanisms of opioid activity, but this has not resulted in a corresponding increase in convincing clinical data. This review focuses primarily on the evidence surrounding the long‐term use of opioids in chronic pain, but discussions of this research are often conflated with the very different data governing acute and cancer‐related pain, where evidence of efficacy is clearer. It is therefore important to clarify the evidence‐based indications for opioid therapy. There remains very little evidence that opioids improve function or quality of life beyond 3 months in people with chronic pain conditions. In all three patient populations, the development of tolerance, dependence, hyperalgesia and withdrawal are key phenomena that affect the patient experience, and in particular the decision to remain on opioids in the long term. This is a common thread that connects the opioid literature in all of these spheres, and justifies the burgeoning interest in these phenomena in the basic science literature. There is an urgent need to address these negative consequences of opioid use, in order to maximize the therapeutic benefit that opioids can offer.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To compare the diagnostic performance of an artificial intelligence deep learning system with that of expert neuro‐ophthalmologists in classifying optic disc appearance.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The deep learning system was previously trained and validated on 14,341 ocular fundus photographs from 19 international centers. The performance of the system was evaluated on 800 new fundus photographs (400 normal optic discs, 201 papilledema [disc edema from elevated intracranial pressure], 199 other optic disc abnormalities) and compared with that of 2 expert neuro‐ophthalmologists who independently reviewed the same randomly presented images without clinical information. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The system correctly classified 678 of 800 (84.7%) photographs, compared with 675 of 800 (84.4%) for Expert 1 and 641 of 800 (80.1%) for Expert 2. The system yielded areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.97 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.96–0.98), 0.96 (95% CI = 0.94–0.97), and 0.89 (95% CI = 0.87–0.92) for the detection of normal discs, papilledema, and other disc abnormalities, respectively. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the system's classification of optic discs were similar to or better than the 2 experts. Intergrader agreement at the eye level was 0.71 (95% CI = 0.67–0.76) between Expert 1 and Expert 2, 0.72 (95% CI = 0.68–0.76) between the system and Expert 1, and 0.65 (95% CI = 0.61–0.70) between the system and Expert 2.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The performance of this deep learning system at classifying optic disc abnormalities was at least as good as 2 expert neuro‐ophthalmologists. Future prospective studies are needed to validate this system as a diagnostic aid in relevant clinical settings. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Calcitonin gene–related peptide (CGRP) pathway inhibitors are emerging treatments for migraine. CGRP‐mediated vasodilation is, however, a critical rescue mechanism in ischemia. We, therefore, investigated whether gepants, small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists, worsen cerebral ischemia.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Middle cerebral artery was occluded for 12 to 60 minutes in mice. We compared infarct risk and volumes, collateral flow, and neurological deficits after pretreatment with olcegepant (single or 10 daily doses of 0.1–1mg/kg) or rimegepant (single doses of 10–100mg/kg) versus vehicle. We also determined their potency on CGRP‐induced relaxations in mouse and human vessels, in vitro.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Olcegepant (1mg/kg, single dose) increased infarct risk after 12‐ to 20‐minute occlusions mimicking transient ischemic attacks (14/19 vs 6/18 with vehicle, relative risk = 2.21, <i>p </i> &lt; 0.022), and doubled infarct volumes (<i>p </i> &lt; 0.001) and worsened neurological deficits (median score = 9 vs 5 with vehicle, <i>p </i> = 0.008) after 60‐minute occlusion. Ten daily doses of 0.1 to 1mg/kg olcegepant yielded similar results. Rimegepant 10mg/kg increased infarct volumes by 60% after 20‐minute ischemia (<i>p </i> = 0.03); 100mg/kg caused 75% mortality after 60‐minute occlusion. In familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 mice, olcegepant 1mg/kg increased infarct size after 30‐minute occlusion (1.6‐fold, <i>p </i> = 0.017). Both gepants consistently diminished collateral flow and reduced reperfusion success. Olcegepant was 10‐fold more potent than rimegepant on CGRP‐induced relaxations in mouse aorta.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Gepants worsened ischemic stroke in mice via collateral dysfunction. CGRP pathway blockers might thus aggravate coincidental cerebral ischemic events. The cerebrovascular safety of these agents must therefore be better delineated, especially in patients at increased risk of ischemic events or on prophylactic CGRP inhibition. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<p>Repetitive visual stimulation is successfully used in a study on the visual evoked potential (VEP) plasticity in the visual system in mammals. Practicing visual tasks or repeated exposure to sensory stimuli can induce neuronal network changes in the cortical circuits and improve the perception of these stimuli. However, little is known about the effect of visual training at the subcortical level. In the present study, we extend the knowledge showing positive results of this training in the rat’s Superior colliculus (SC). In electrophysiological experiments, we showed that a single training session lasting several hours induces a response enhancement both in the primary visual cortex (V1) and in the SC. Further, we tested if collicular responses will be enhanced without V1 input. For this reason, we inactivated the V1 by applying xylocaine solution onto the cortical surface during visual training. Our results revealed that SC’s response enhancement was present even without V1 inputs and showed no difference in amplitude comparing to VEPs enhancement while the V1 was active. These data suggest that the visual system plasticity and facilitation can develop independently but simultaneously in different parts of the visual system.</p>

<p>Meditation practices, originated from ancient traditions, have increasingly received attention due to their potential benefits to mental and physical health. The scientific community invests efforts into scrutinizing and quantifying the effects of these practices, especially on the brain. There are methodological challenges in describing the neural correlates of the subjective experience of meditation. We noticed, however, that technical considerations on signal processing also don't follow standardized approaches, which may hinder generalizations. Therefore, in this article, we discuss the usage of the electroencephalogram (EEG) as a tool to study meditation experiences in healthy individuals. We describe the main EEG signal processing techniques and how they have been translated to the meditation field until April 2020. Moreover, we examine in detail the limitations/assumptions of these techniques and highlight some good practices, further discussing how technical specifications may impact the interpretation of the outcomes. By shedding light on technical features, this article contributes to more rigorous approaches to evaluate the construct of meditation.</p>

<p>Over the last 15 years, network analysis approaches based on MR data have allowed a renewed understanding of the relationship between brain function architecture and consciousness. Application of this approach to Disorders of Consciousness (DOC) highlights the relationship between specific aspects of network topology and levels of consciousness. Nonetheless, such applications do not acknowledge that DOC patients present with a dramatic level of heterogeneity in structural connectivity (SC) across groups (e.g., etiology, diagnostic categories) and within individual patients (e.g., over time), which possibly affects the level and quality of functional connectivity (FC) patterns that can be expressed. In addition, it is rarely acknowledged that the most frequently employed outcome metrics in the study of brain connectivity (e.g., degree distribution, inter- or intra-resting state network connectivity, and clustering coefficient) are interrelated and cannot be assumed to be independent of each other. We present empirical data showing that, when the two points above are not taken into consideration with an appropriate analytic model, it can lead to a misinterpretation of the role of each outcome metric in the graph's structure and thus misinterpretation of FC results. We show that failing to account for either SC or the inter-relation between outcome measures can lead to inflated false positives (FP) and/or false negatives (FN) in inter- or intra-resting state network connectivity results (defined, respectively, as a positive or negative result in network connectivity that is present when not accounting for SC and/or outcome measure inter-relation, but becomes not significant when accounting for all variables). Overall, we find that unconscious patients have lower rates of FP and FN for within cortical connectivity, lower rates of FN for cortico-subcortical connectivity, and lower rates of FP for within subcortical connectivity. These lower rates in unconscious patients may reflect differences in their triadic closure and SC metrics, which bias the interpretations of the inter- or intra-resting state network connectivity if the SC metrics and triadic closure are not modeled. We suggest that future studies of functional connectivity in DOC patients (i) incorporate where possible SC metrics and (ii) properly account for the intercorrelated nature of outcome variables.</p>

<p>The formation of the nervous system involves establishing complex networks of synaptic connections between proper partners. This developmental undertaking requires the rapid expansion of the plasma membrane surface area as neurons grow and polarize, extending axons through the extracellular environment. Critical to the expansion of the plasma membrane and addition of plasma membrane material is exocytic vesicle fusion, a regulated mechanism driven by soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment proteins receptors (SNAREs). Since their discovery, SNAREs have been implicated in several critical neuronal functions involving exocytic fusion in addition to synaptic transmission, including neurite initiation and outgrowth, axon specification, axon extension, and synaptogenesis. Decades of research have uncovered a rich variety of SNARE expression and function. The basis of SNARE-mediated fusion, the opening of a fusion pore, remains an enigmatic event, despite an incredible amount of research, as fusion is not only heterogeneous but also spatially small and temporally fast. Multiple modes of exocytosis have been proposed, with full-vesicle fusion (FFV) and kiss-and-run (KNR) being the best described. Whereas most in vitro work has reconstituted fusion using VAMP-2, SNAP-25, and syntaxin-1; there is much to learn regarding the behaviors of distinct SNARE complexes. In the past few years, robust heterogeneity in the kinetics and fate of the fusion pore that varies by cell type have been uncovered, suggesting a paradigm shift in how the modes of exocytosis are viewed is warranted. Here, we explore both classic and recent work uncovering the variety of SNAREs and their importance in the development of neurons, as well as historical and newly proposed modes of exocytosis, their regulation, and proteins involved in the regulation of fusion kinetics.</p>

<p>Dopamine replacement therapy with L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) is the only temporary therapy for Parkinson’s disease (PD), but it triggers dyskinesia over time. Since dyskinesia is associated with increased neuronal firing that bolsters purinergic signaling, we now tested whether the selective and blood-brain barrier-permeable P2X7 receptor antagonist Brilliant Blue-G (BBG, 22.5–45 mg/kg ip) attenuated behavioral, neurochemical and biochemical alterations in rats turned hemiparkinsonian upon unilateral striatal injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and treated daily with L-DOPA (30 mg/kg by gavage) for 22 days. The blockade of P2X7 receptors decreased L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia and motor incoordination in hemiparkinsonian rats. In parallel, BBG treatment rebalanced the altered dopamine D1 and D2 receptor density and signaling as well as some neuroinflammation-associated parameters in the striatum and substantia nigra. These findings herald a hitherto unrecognized role for purinergic signaling in the etiopathology of dyskinesia and prompt P2X7 receptor antagonists as novel candidate anti-dyskinesia drugs.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00763">Impact of Brain Surface Boundary Conditions on Electrophysiology and Implications for Electrocorticography</a></h4>

<p>Volume conduction of electrical potentials in the brain is highly influenced by the material properties and geometry of the tissue and recording devices implanted into the tissue. These effects are very large in EEG due to the volume conduction through the skull and scalp but are often neglected in intracranial electrophysiology. When considering penetrating electrodes deep in the brain, the assumption of an infinite and homogenous medium can be used when the sources are far enough from the brain surface and the electrodes to minimize the boundary effect. When the electrodes are recording from the brain's surface the effect of the boundary cannot be neglected, and the large surface area and commonly used insulating materials in surface electrode arrays may further increase the effect by altering the nature of the boundary in the immediate vicinity of the electrodes. This gives the experimenter some control over the spatial profiles of the potentials by appropriate design of the electrode arrays. We construct a simple three-layer model to describe the effect of material properties and geometry above the brain surface on the electric potentials and conduct empirical experiments to validate this model. A laminar electrode array is used to measure the effect of insulating and relatively conducting layers above the cortical surface by recording evoked potentials alternating between a dried surface and saline covering layer, respectively. Empirically, we find that an insulating boundary amplifies the potentials relative to conductive saline by about a factor of 4, and that the effect is not constrained to potentials that originate near the surface. The model is applied to predict the influence of array design and implantation procedure on the recording amplitude and spatial selectivity of the surface electrode arrays.</p>

<p>With the release of the multi-site Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange, many researchers have applied machine learning methods to distinguish between healthy subjects and autistic individuals by using features extracted from resting state functional MRI data. An important part of applying machine learning to this problem is extracting these features. Specifically, whether to include negative correlations between brain region activities as relevant features and how best to define these features. For the second question, the graph theoretical properties of the brain network may provide a reasonable answer. In this study, we investigated the first issue by comparing three different approaches. These included using the positive correlation matrix (comprising only the positive values of the original correlation matrix), the absolute value of the correlation matrix, or the anticorrelation matrix (comprising only the negative correlation values) as the starting point for extracting relevant features using graph theory. We then trained a multi-layer perceptron in a leave-one-site out manner in which the data from a single site was left out as testing data and the model was trained on the data from the other sites. Our results show that on average, using graph features extracted from the anti-correlation matrix led to the highest accuracy and AUC scores. This suggests that anti-correlations should not simply be discarded as they may include useful information that would aid the classification task. We also show that adding the PCA transformation of the original correlation matrix to the feature space leads to an increase in accuracy.</p>

<p>The growing importance of astrocytes in the field of neuroscience has led to a greater number of computational models devoted to the study of astrocytic functions and their metabolic interactions with neurons. The modeling of these interactions demands a combined understanding of brain physiology and the development of computational frameworks based on genomic-scale reconstructions, system biology, and dynamic models. These computational approaches have helped to highlight the neuroprotective mechanisms triggered by astrocytes and other glial cells, both under normal conditions and during neurodegenerative processes. In the present review, we evaluate some of the most relevant models of astrocyte metabolism, including genome-scale reconstructions and astrocyte-neuron interactions developed in the last few years. Additionally, we discuss novel strategies from the multi-omics perspective and computational models of other glial cell types that will increase our knowledge in brain metabolism and its association with neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<p>The Tomographic Quantitative Electroencephalography (qEEGt) toolbox is integrated with the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) Neuroinformatics Ecosystem as a docker into the Canadian Brain Imaging Research Platform (CBRAIN). qEEGt produces age-corrected normative Statistical Parametric Maps of EEG log source spectra testing compliance to a normative database. This toolbox was developed at the Cuban Neuroscience Center as part of the first wave of the Cuban Human Brain Mapping Project (CHBMP) and has been validated and used in different health systems for several decades. Incorporation into the MNI ecosystem now provides CBRAIN registered users access to its full functionality and is accompanied by a public release of the source code on GitHub and Zenodo repositories. Among other features are the calculation of EEG scalp spectra, and the estimation of their source spectra using the Variable Resolution Electrical Tomography (VARETA) source imaging. Crucially, this is completed by the evaluation of z spectra by means of the built-in age regression equations obtained from the CHBMP database (ages 5–87) to provide normative Statistical Parametric Mapping of EEG log source spectra. Different scalp and source visualization tools are also provided for evaluation of individual subjects prior to further post-processing. Openly releasing this software in the CBRAIN platform will facilitate the use of standardized qEEGt methods in different research and clinical settings. An updated precis of the methods is provided in Appendix I as a reference for the toolbox. qEEGt/CBRAIN is the first installment of instruments developed by the neuroinformatic platform of the Cuba-Canada-China (CCC) project.</p>

<p>Emotion recognition based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals is a current focus in brain-computer interface research. However, the classification of EEG is difficult owing to large amounts of data and high levels of noise. Therefore, it is important to determine how to effectively extract features that include important information. Regularization, one of the effective methods for EEG signal processing, can effectively extract important features from the signal and has potential applications in EEG emotion recognition. Currently, the most popular regularization technique is Lasso (L<sub>1</sub>) and Ridge Regression (L<sub>2</sub>). In recent years, researchers have proposed many other regularization terms. In theory, L<sub>q</sub>-type regularization has a lower q value, which means that it can be used to find solutions with better sparsity. L<sub>1/2</sub> regularization is of L<sub>q</sub> type (0 &lt; q &lt; 1) and has been shown to have many attractive properties. In this work, we studied the L<sub>1/2</sub> penalty in sparse logistic regression for three-classification EEG emotion recognition, and used a coordinate descent algorithm and a univariate semi-threshold operator to implement L<sub>1/2</sub> penalty logistic regression. The experimental results on simulation and real data demonstrate that our proposed method is better than other existing regularization methods. Sparse logistic regression with L<sub>1/2</sub> penalty achieves higher classification accuracy than the conventional L<sub>1</sub>, Ridge Regression, and Elastic Net regularization methods, using fewer but more informative EEG signals. This is very important for high-dimensional small-sample EEG data and can help researchers to reduce computational complexity and improve computational accuracy. Therefore, we propose that sparse logistic regression with the L<sub>1/2</sub> penalty is an effective technique for emotion recognition in practical classification problems.</p>

<p>For a long time, the relevance of the information provided by direct electrostimulation (DES) for mapping brain functions was debated. Recently, major advances in intraoperative DES for guiding resection of cerebral tumors in awake patients enabled the validation of this method and its increased utilization in basic neurosciences. Indeed, in addition to the cortical stimulation used for many decades in epilepsy surgery, axonal mapping was developed thanks to DES of the white matter tracts, giving original insights into the neural connectivity. Moreover, functional results collected during intrasurgical mapping have been correlated with neuropsychological performances before and after DES-guided resection, and with perioperative neuroimaging data. Thus, it was evidenced that DES offers the unique opportunity to identify both cortical and subcortical structures critical for cerebral functions. Here, the first aim is to propose a three-level model of DES-generated functional disruption, able to explain the behavioral consequences elicited during awake surgery, i.e., (i) DES of an input/output unimodal (e.g., somatosensory or motor) network inducing “positive” responses (as involuntary movement); (ii) DES of a distributed specialized network inducing a within-system disruption leading to specific “negative” disorders (e.g., exclusive language deficit with no other disorders); (iii) DES generating an inter-system disruption leading to more complex behavioral disturbances (e.g., the inability to perform dual-task while each function can be performed separately). Second, in light of this model, original findings gained from DES concerning the human connectome, complementary to those provided by functional neuroimaging (FNI), are reviewed. Further longitudinal multimodal investigations are needed to explore neuroplasticity mechanisms.</p>

<p>A generalized neural field model of large-scale activity in the corticothalamic system is used to predict standard evoked potentials. This model embodies local feedbacks that modulate the gains of neural activity as part of the response to incoming stimuli and thus enables both activity changes and effective connectivity changes to be calculated as parts of a generalized evoked response, and their relative contributions to be determined. The results show that incorporation of gain modulations enables a compact and physically justifiable description of the differences in gain between background-EEG and standard-ERP conditions, with the latter able to be initiated from the background state, rather than requiring distinct parameters as in earlier work. In particular, top-down gains are found to be reduced during an ERP, consistent with recent theoretical suggestions that the role of internal models is diminished in favor of external inputs when the latter change suddenly. The static-gain and modulated-gain system transfer functions are analyzed via control theory in terms of system resonances that were recently shown to implement data filtering whose gain adjustments can be interpreted as attention. These filters are shown to govern early and late features in standard evoked responses and their gain parameters are shown to be dynamically adjusted in a way that implements a form of attention. The results show that dynamically modulated resonant filters responsible for the low-frequency oscillations in an evoked potential response have different parameters than those responsible for low-frequency resting EEG responses, while both responses share similar mid- and high-frequency resonant filters. These results provide a biophysical mechanism by which oscillatory activity in the theta, alpha, and beta frequency ranges of an evoked response are modulated as reflections of attention; notably theta is enhanced and alpha suppressed during the latter parts of the ERP. Furthermore, the model enables the part of the ERP response induced by gain modulations to be estimated and interpreted in terms of attention.</p>

<p>Electrical and chemical synapses shape the dynamics of neural networks, and their functional roles in information processing have been a longstanding question in neurobiology. In this paper, we investigate the role of synapses on the optimization of the phenomenon of self-induced stochastic resonance in a delayed multiplex neural network by using analytical and numerical methods. We consider a two-layer multiplex network in which, at the intra-layer level, neurons are coupled either by electrical synapses or by inhibitory chemical synapses. For each isolated layer, computations indicate that weaker electrical and chemical synaptic couplings are better optimizers of self-induced stochastic resonance. In addition, regardless of the synaptic strengths, shorter electrical synaptic delays are found to be better optimizers of the phenomenon than shorter chemical synaptic delays, while longer chemical synaptic delays are better optimizers than longer electrical synaptic delays; in both cases, the poorer optimizers are, in fact, worst. It is found that electrical, inhibitory, or excitatory chemical multiplexing of the two layers having only electrical synapses at the intra-layer levels can each optimize the phenomenon. Additionally, only excitatory chemical multiplexing of the two layers having only inhibitory chemical synapses at the intra-layer levels can optimize the phenomenon. These results may guide experiments aimed at establishing or confirming to the mechanism of self-induced stochastic resonance in networks of artificial neural circuits as well as in real biological neural networks.</p>

Background<p>The immune system of human and mouse neonates is relatively immature. However, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), commonly divided into the subsets ILC1, ILC2, and ILC3, are already present in the placenta and other fetal compartments and exhibit higher activity than what is seen in adulthood. Recent reports have suggested the potential role of ILCs, especially ILC2s, in spontaneous preterm labor, which is associated with brain damage and subsequent long-term neurodevelopmental deficits. Therefore, we hypothesized that ILCs, and especially ILC2s, play a role in preterm brain injury.</p>Methods<p>C57Bl/6J mice at postnatal day 6 were subjected to hypoxia-ischemia (HI) insult induced by left carotid artery ligation and subsequent exposure to 10% oxygen in nitrogen. The presence of ILCs and ILC2s in the brain was examined at different time points after HI. The contribution of ILC2s to HI-induced preterm brain damage was explored using a conditionally targeted ILC2-deficient mouse strain (Rorα<sup>fl/fl</sup>IL7r<sup>Cre</sup>), and gray and white-matter injury were evaluated at 7 days post-HI. The inflammatory response in the injured brain was assessed using immunoassays and immunochemistry staining.</p>Results<p>Significant increases in ILCs and ILC2s were observed at 24 h, 3 days, and 7 days post-HI in the injured brain hemisphere compared with the uninjured hemisphere in wild-type mice. ILC2s in the brain were predominantly located in the meninges of the injured ipsilateral hemispheres after HI but not in the brain parenchyma. Overall, we did not observe changes in cytokine/chemokine levels in the brains of Rorα<sup>fl/fl</sup>IL7r<sup>Cre</sup> mice compared with wild type animals apart from IL-13. Gray and white-matter tissue loss in the brain was not affected after HI in Rorα<sup>fl/fl</sup>IL7r<sup>Cre</sup> mice. Correspondingly, we did not find any differences in reactive microglia and astrocyte numbers in the brain in Rorα<sup>fl/fl</sup>IL7r<sup>Cre</sup> mice compared with wild-type mice following HI insult.</p>Conclusion<p>After HI, ILCs and ILC2s accumulate in the injured brain hemisphere. However, ILC2s do not contribute to the development of brain damage in this mouse model of preterm brain injury.</p>

<p>Membrane tethering is an important communication method for membrane-packaged organelles. Mitochondria are organelles with a bilayer membrane, and the membrane contact between mitochondria and other organelles is indispensable for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Increased levels of molecular determinants that mediate the membrane contact between mitochondria and other organelles, and their functions, have been revealed in recent years.

<p>Aging is associated with an increased prevalence of vascular health conditions that are linked to a disruption in the cerebral vasculature and white matter microstructural organization. In people with cardiovascular risk factors, increased cerebral arterial pulsatility is associated with poorer white matter microstructural organization and cognitive functioning. This study examines the relationship among arterial pulsatility, white matter microstructural organization, and cognitive ability in a healthy adult lifespan sample. One hundred and eighty-nine adults were divided into a younger adult (&lt;50 years, n = 97) and older adult (&gt;50 years, n = 92). The latter were further subdivided into two subgroups with (CV+, n = 25) and without (CV−, n = 67) cardiovascular risk factors. Arterial pulsatility was measured using cardiac-gated phase-contrast flow quantification sequence and three indexes of whole-brain white matter microstructural organization [i.e., fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RaD), mean diffusivity (MD)] were derived from diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Cognitive ability was assessed using global cognitive functioning (MoCA) and a measure of working memory [sensitivity (d′) from a 2-back task]. Neither the whole group analysis nor the younger adult group showed an association between measures of arterial pulsatility, global white matter microstructural organization, and cognition. In older adults, higher MD and RaD were associated with increased arterial pulsatility and poorer working memory performance. The indirect pathway from arterial pulsatility to working memory performance via both MD and RaD measures was significant in this group. Interestingly, a comparison of CV+ and CV− subgroups showed that this mediating relationship was only evident in older adults with at least one CV risk factor. These findings are consistent with cardiovascular risk factors as underlying arterial, white matter, and cognitive decline in cognitively normal older adults.</p>

<p>Mutations in transmembrane protein 230 (TMEM230) gene are suggested to be associated with the autosomal dominant Parkinson’s disease (PD) with typical movement disorders and Lewy body pathology. However, the normal functions and the pathological roles of TMEM230 are not clear. In this study, we used TMEM230 isoform II constructs including wild-type (WT) and four reported PD-linked mutation constructs (Y92C, R141L, 184Wext*5, and 184PGext*5). Ectopic expression of WT and PD-linked mutant TMEM230 variants in cultured cells dramatically induced apoptotic cell death compared with that of vector control cells. Mutant TMEM230 caused cell toxicity at an increased severity than WT TMEM230. Moreover, expression of TMEM230 increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, decreased cellular ATP, activated caspase 3/7, and increased poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) cleavage. Treatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC; an ROS scavenger) or Z-VAD-FMK (a caspase inhibitor) significantly attenuated TMEM230-induced apoptosis in both cultured cells and primary neurons. Our results indicated that TMEM230 mediated a PARP1-linked apoptotic cell death pathway. These findings not only provide the novel insight into the biological roles of TMEM230 in the PARP1-linked pathway but also provide a TMEM230-induced cell death mechanism underlying PD pathogenesis.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/60513">Structural insights into the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent gating of the human mitochondrial calcium uniporter</a></h4>

Mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake is mediated by an inner mitochondrial membrane protein called the mitochondrial calcium uniporter. In humans, the uniporter functions as a holocomplex consisting of MCU, EMRE, MICU1 and MICU2, among which MCU and EMRE form a subcomplex and function as the conductive channel while MICU1 and MICU2 are EF-hand proteins that regulate the channel activity in a Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent manner. Here we present the EM structures of the human mitochondrial calcium uniporter holocomplex (uniplex) in the presence and absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, revealing distinct Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent assembly of the uniplex. Our structural observations suggest that Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes the dimerization interaction between MICU1 and MICU2, which in turn determines how the MICU1-MICU2 subcomplex interacts with the MCU-EMRE channel and, consequently, changes the distribution of the uniplex assemblies between the blocked and unblocked states.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59806">Actionable recommendations from trainees to improve science training</a></h4>

Over the past 20 years, a series of reports written by groups of senior researchers and administrators have recommended changes to improve the training environments for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in the United States. However, academic institutions and departments have largely failed to implement these recommendations, which has exacerbated the problems faced by these trainees. Here, based on input from trainees at different career stages, we outline seven practical changes that academic institutions and departments can make to improve their training environments.

Local activation and long-range inhibition are mechanisms conserved in self-organizing systems leading to biological patterns. A number of them involve the production by the developing cell of an inhibitory morphogen, but how this cell becomes immune to self-inhibition is rather unknown. Under combined nitrogen starvation, the multicellular cyanobacterium <i>Nostoc</i> PCC 7120 develops nitrogen-fixing heterocysts with a pattern of one heterocyst every 10-12 vegetative cells. Cell differentiation is regulated by HetR which activates the synthesis of its own inhibitory morphogens, diffusion of which establishes the differentiation pattern. Here we show that HetR interacts with HetL at the same interface as PatS, and that this interaction is necessary to suppress inhibition and to differentiate heterocysts. <i>hetL</i> expression is induced under nitrogen-starvation and is activated by HetR, suggesting that HetL provides immunity to the heterocyst. This protective mechanism might be conserved in other differentiating cyanobacteria as HetL homologues are spread across the phylum.

Frizzleds (Fzd) are the primary receptors for Wnt morphogens, which are essential regulators of stem cell biology, yet the structural basis of Wnt signaling through Fzd remains poorly understood. Here we report the structure of an unliganded human Fzd5 determined by single-particle cryo-EM at 3.7 Å resolution, with the aid of an antibody chaperone acting as a fiducial marker. We also analyzed the topology of low-resolution XWnt8/Fzd5 complex particles, which revealed extreme flexibility between the Wnt/Fzd-CRD and the Fzd-TM regions. Analysis of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in response to Wnt3a versus a 'surrogate agonist' that cross-links Fzd to LRP6, revealed identical structure-activity relationships. Thus, canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling appears to be principally reliant on ligand-induced Fzd/LRP6 heterodimerization, versus the allosteric mechanisms seen in structurally analogous class A G protein-coupled receptors, and Smoothened. These findings deepen our mechanistic understanding of Wnt signal transduction, and have implications for harnessing Wnt agonism in regenerative medicine.

<p>by Leonila Lagunes, Lee Bardwell, German A. Enciso</p>

Protein activity is often regulated by ligand binding or by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation. Moreover, proteins that are regulated in this way often contain multiple ligand binding sites or modification sites, which can operate to create an ultrasensitive dose response. Here, we consider the contribution of the individual modification/binding sites to the activation process, and how their individual values affect the ultrasensitive behavior of the overall system. We use a generalized Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model that allows for variable conformational free energy contributions from distinct sites, and associate a so-called activation parameter to each site. Our analysis shows that the ultrasensitivity generally increases as the conformational free energy contribution from one or more sites is strengthen. Furthermore, ultrasensitivity depends on the mean of the activation parameters and not on their variability. In some cases, we find that the best way to maximize ultrasensitivity is to make the contribution from all sites as strong as possible. These results provide insights into the performance objectives of multiple modification/binding sites and thus help gain a greater understanding of signaling and its role in diseases.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RJBqMdkzcCs" width="1" />

Radiotherapy is a commonly used conditioning regimen for bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Cytotoxicity limits the use of this life-saving therapy, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly defined. Here, we use the syngeneic mouse BMT model to test the hypothesis that lethal radiation damages tissues, thereby unleashing signals that indiscriminately activate the inflammasome pathways in host and transplanted cells. We find that a clinically relevant high dose of radiation causes severe damage to bones and the spleen through mechanisms involving the NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes but not the NLRC4 inflammasome. Downstream, we demonstrate that gasdermin D (GSDMD), the common effector of the inflammasomes, is also activated by radiation. Remarkably, protection against the injury induced by deadly ionizing radiation occurs only when NLRP3, AIM2, or GSDMD is lost simultaneously in both the donor and host cell compartments. Thus, this study reveals a continuum of the actions of lethal radiation relayed by the inflammasome-GSDMD axis, initially affecting recipient cells and ultimately harming transplanted cells as they grow in the severely injured and toxic environment. This study also suggests that therapeutic targeting of inflammasome-GSDMD signaling has the potential to prevent the collateral effects of intense radiation regimens.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/2JzKjJWvFho" width="1" />

<p>by Emmanuel Gallaud, Anjana Ramdas Nair, Nicole Horsley, Arnaud Monnard, Priyanka Singh, Tri Thanh Pham, David Salvador Garcia, Alexia Ferrand, Clemens Cabernard</p>

Centrosomes, the main microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs) of metazoan cells, contain an older “mother” and a younger “daughter” centriole. Stem cells either inherit the mother or daughter-centriole-containing centrosome, providing a possible mechanism for biased delivery of cell fate determinants. However, the mechanisms regulating centrosome asymmetry and biased centrosome segregation are unclear. Using 3D-structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) and live-cell imaging, we show in fly neural stem cells (neuroblasts) that the mitotic kinase Polo and its centriolar protein substrate Centrobin (Cnb) accumulate on the daughter centriole during mitosis, thereby generating molecularly distinct mother and daughter centrioles before interphase. Cnb’s asymmetric localization, potentially involving a direct relocalization mechanism, is regulated by Polo-mediated phosphorylation, whereas Polo’s daughter centriole enrichment requires both Wdr62 and Cnb. Based on optogenetic protein mislocalization experiments, we propose that the establishment of centriole asymmetry in mitosis primes biased interphase MTOC activity, necessary for correct spindle orientation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/nIq8ciYcrXg" width="1" />

<p>Many patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) remain unresponsive after surviving critical illness. Although several structural brain abnormalities have been described, their impact on brain function and implications for prognosis are unknown. Functional neuroimaging, which has prognostic significance, has yet to be explored in this population. Here we describe a patient with severe COVID‐19 who, despite prolonged unresponsiveness and structural brain abnormalities, demonstrated intact functional network connectivity, and weeks later recovered the ability to follow commands. When prognosticating for survivors of severe COVID‐19, clinicians should consider that brain networks may remain functionally intact despite structural injury and prolonged unresponsiveness.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Sensory systems provide input to motor networks on the state of the body and environment. One such sensory system in insects is the campaniform sensilla (CS), which detect deformations of the exoskeleton arising from resisted movements or external perturbations. When physical strain is applied to the cuticle, CS external structures are compressed, leading to transduction in an internal sensory neuron. In <i>Drosophila melanogaster </i>, the distribution of CS on the exoskeleton has not been comprehensively described. To investigate CS number, location, spatial arrangement, and potential differences between individuals, we compared the front, middle, and hind legs of multiple flies using scanning electron microscopy. Additionally, we imaged the entire body surface to confirm known CS locations. On the legs, the number and relative arrangement of CS varied between individuals, and single CS of corresponding segments showed characteristic differences between legs. This knowledge is fundamental for studying the relevance of cuticular strain information within the complex neuromuscular networks controlling posture and movement. This comprehensive account of all <i>D. melanogaster </i> CS helps set the stage for experimental investigations into their responsivity, sensitivity, and roles in sensory acquisition and motor control in a light‐weight model organism.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Aromatase, the enzyme that in the brain converts testosterone and androstenedione to estradiol and estrone, respectively, is a putative key factor in psychoneuroendocrinology. <i>In vivo </i> assessment of aromatase was performed to evaluate tracer kinetic models and optimal scan duration, for quantitative analysis of the aromatase positron emission tomography (PET) ligand [<sup>11</sup>C]cetrozole. Anatomical magnetic resonance and 90‐min dynamic [<sup>11</sup>C]cetrozole PET‐CT scans were performed on healthy women. Volume of interest (VOI)‐based analyses with a plasma‐input function were performed using the single‐tissue and two‐tissue (2TCM) reversible compartment models and plasma‐input Logan analysis. Additionally, the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM), Logan reference tissue model (LRTM), and standardized uptake volume ratio model, with cerebellum as reference region, were evaluated. Parametric images were generated and regionally averaged voxel values were compared with VOI‐based analyses of the reference tissue models. The optimal reference model was used for evaluation of a decreased scan duration. Differences between the plasma‐input‐ and reference tissue‐based methods and comparisons between scan durations were assessed by linear regression. The [<sup>11</sup>C]cetrozole time–activity curves were best described by the 2TCM. SRTM nondisplaceable binding potential (BP<sub>ND</sub>), with cerebellum as reference region, can be used to estimate [<sup>11</sup>C]cetrozole binding and generated robust and quantitatively accurate results for a reduced scan duration of 60 min. Receptor parametric mapping, a basis function implementation of SRTM, as well as LRTM, produced quantitatively accurate parametric images, showing BP<sub>ND</sub> at the voxel level. As PET tracer, [<sup>11</sup>C]cetrozole can be employed for relatively short brain scans to measure aromatase binding using a reference tissue‐based approach.</p>

<p>Genetic studies have identified variants in the LRRK2 gene as important components of Parkinson’s disease (PD) pathobiology. Biochemical and emergent biomarker studies have coalesced around LRRK2 hyperactivation in disease. Therapeutics that diminish LRRK2 activity, either with small molecule kinase inhibitors or anti-sense oligonucleotides, have recently advanced to the clinic. Historically, there have been few successes in the development of therapies that might slow or halt the progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Over the past few decades of biomedical research, retrospective analyses suggest the broad integration of informative biomarkers early in development tends to distinguish successful pipelines from those that fail early. Herein, we discuss the biomarker regulatory process, emerging LRRK2 biomarker candidates, assays, underlying biomarker biology, and clinical integration.</p>

<p>Recently, ferroptosis has been revealed as a new form of regulated cell death. Distinct from apoptosis and necrosis, ferroptosis is evoked by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, the metabolism of iron, lipids, and amino acids plays a significant regulatory role in ferroptosis, which can be reversed by glutathione peroxidase 4 and ferroptosis suppressor protein 1. Ferroptosis is implicated in the onset and development of numerous neurological diseases. Emerging studies have reported that ferroptosis induces and aggravates brain tissue damage following cerebral ischemia, whereas inhibition of ferroptosis dramatically attenuates induced damage. In this review, we have summarized the mechanistic relationship between ferroptosis and cerebral ischemia, including through iron overload, downregulation of glutathione peroxidase 4, and upregulation of lipid peroxidation. Although considerable attention has been paid to the effect of ferroptosis on cerebral ischemic injury, specific mechanisms need to be experimentally confirmed, including how cerebral ischemia induces ferroptosis and how ferroptosis deteriorates cerebral ischemia.</p>

<p>The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a dynamic but solid shield in the cerebral microvascular system. It plays a pivotal role in maintaining central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis by regulating the exchange of materials between the circulation and the brain and protects the neural tissue from neurotoxic components as well as pathogens. Here, we discuss the development of the BBB in physiological conditions and then focus on the role of the BBB in cerebrovascular disease, including acute ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage, and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). Finally, we summarize recent advancements in the development of therapies targeting the BBB and outline future directions and outstanding questions in the field. We propose that BBB dysfunction not only results from, but is causal in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders; the BBB is more a contributor to the disruption of CNS homeostasis than a victim in neurological disorders.</p>

Background<p>Sleep disturbances and impairment of cognitive function are among the most frequent non-motor symptoms in Parkinson’s disease (PD) with negative implications on quality of life of patients and caregivers. Despite the fact that sleep disturbances are a major issue in PD patients, only limited data are available regarding interactions of sleep disturbances and cognitive performance.</p>Objective<p>This post hoc analysis of the RaSPar trial was therefore designed to further elucidate sleep disturbances and their impact on cognition in PD.</p>Methods<p>Twenty-six PD patients with sleep disturbances were evaluated thoroughly including assessments of patients’ subjective and objective sleep quality by interview, questionnaires, and polysomnography (PSG). Cognitive performance was assessed by Parkinson Neuropsychometric Dementia Assessment (PANDA) and Test of Attentional Performance (TAP), and associations of sleep and cognitive function were evaluated.</p>Results<p>We did not detect differences in cognitive performance between patients with and without rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD). Instead, cognitive impairment, particularly affecting cognitive domains attention, executive function/working memory, and semantic memory, was associated with impaired PSG-measured sleep quality (e.g., sleep efficiency) and sleep disordered breathing (SDB) (Apnea-Hypopnea Index &gt; 5/h). Global cognitive performance was decreased in patients with SDB (PANDA score 23.2 ± 3.5 vs. 26.9 ± 2.2, P = 0.020, unpaired two-sided t-test).</p>Conclusion<p>Sleep apnea and other sleep disturbances impair cognitive performance in PD and should be evaluated in routine care, and treatment options such as continuous airway pressure therapy should be considered.</p>

<p>The development of cognitive interventions in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often requires the assessment of multiple cognitive functions. However, experimental settings consisting of various tasks are particularly strenuous for patients and can thus result in poor data quality. For the economical assessment of working memory and response inhibition, this study aims to validate a combined n-back/nogo paradigm by comparing it to single task versions and to demonstrate its applicability for ADHD research. Twenty-five healthy individuals and 34 ADHD patients between 9 and 16 years participated in this event-related potential (ERP) study. Healthy controls underwent single task versions of a 2-back working memory task and a go/nogo response inhibition task as well as the introduced combined 2-back/nogo task. This combined task demonstrated a comparable ERP structure for working memory and response inhibition aspects as single task versions. Behaviorally, higher working memory performance during the combined paradigm indicated lower task difficulty, while high correlations between combined and single task versions still indicated valid working memory measures. For response inhibition performance, different task versions resulted in similar outcomes. The application of the combined n-back/nogo paradigm in ADHD patients revealed the expected working memory and response inhibition deficits, increased omission errors, reaction times, and standard deviation of reaction time, as well as diminished n-back P3 and nogo P3 amplitudes. We conclude that the combined n-back/nogo task is an effective paradigm for the economical assessment of working memory and response inhibition deficits in ADHD on a behavioral and neurophysiological level.</p>

<p>Motor imagery-based brain–computer interfaces (MI-BCIs) send commands to a computer using the brain activity registered when a subject imagines—but does not perform—a given movement. However, inconsistent MI-BCI performance occurs in variations of brain signals across subjects and experiments; this is considered to be a significant problem in practical BCI. Moreover, some subjects exhibit a phenomenon referred to as “BCI-inefficiency,” in which they are unable to generate brain signals for BCI control. These subjects have significant difficulties in using BCI. The primary goal of this study is to identify the connections of the resting-state network that affect MI performance and predict MI performance using these connections. We used a public database of MI, which includes the results of psychological questionnaires and pre-experimental resting-state taken over two sessions on different days. A dynamic causal model was used to calculate the coupling strengths between brain regions with directionality. Specifically, we investigated the motor network in resting-state, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which performs motor planning. As a result, we observed a significant difference in the connectivity strength from the supplementary motor area to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex between the low- and high-MI performance groups. This coupling, measured in the resting-state, is significantly stronger in the high-MI performance group than the low-MI performance group. The connection strength is positively correlated with MI-BCI performance (Session 1: r = 0.54; Session 2: r = 0.42). We also predicted MI performance using linear regression based on this connection (r-squared = 0.31). The proposed predictors, based on dynamic causal modeling, can develop new strategies for improving BCI performance. These findings can further our understanding of BCI-inefficiency and help BCI users to lower costs and save time.</p>

We analyze in this article a model for the self-organization of synaptic inputs onto dendritic branches of pyramidal cells. The model combines a generic stochastic rewiring principle with a simple synaptic plasticity rule that depends on local dendritic activity. In computer simulations, we find that this synaptic rewiring model leads to synaptic clustering, that is, temporally correlated inputs become locally clustered on dendritic branches. This empirical finding is backed up by a theoretical analysis which shows that rewiring in our model favors network configurations with synaptic clustering. We propose that synaptic clustering plays an important role in the organization of computation and memory in cortical circuits: we find that synaptic clustering through the proposed rewiring mechanism can serve as a mechanism to protect memories from subsequent modifications on a medium time scale. Rewiring of synaptic connections onto specific dendritic branches may thus counteract the general problem of catastrophic forgetting in neural networks.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00044">New Optical Tools to Study Neural Circuit Assembly in the Retina</a></h4>

<p>During development, neurons navigate a tangled thicket of thousands of axons and dendrites to synapse with just a few specific targets. This phenomenon termed wiring specificity, is critical to the assembly of neural circuits and the way neurons manage this feat is only now becoming clear. Recent studies in the mouse retina are shedding new insight into this process. They show that specific wiring arises through a series of stages that include: directed axonal and dendritic growth, the formation of neuropil layers, positioning of such layers, and matching of co-laminar synaptic partners. Each stage appears to be directed by a distinct family of recognition molecules, suggesting that the combinatorial expression of such family members might act as a blueprint for retinal connectivity. By reviewing the evidence in support of each stage, and by considering their underlying molecular mechanisms, we attempt to synthesize these results into a wiring model which generates testable predictions for future studies. Finally, we conclude by highlighting new optical methods that could be used to address such predictions and gain further insight into this fundamental process.</p>

<p>The inferior colliculus (IC) is an auditory midbrain structure involved in processing biologically important temporal features of sounds. The responses of IC neurons to these temporal features reflect an interaction of synaptic inputs and neuronal biophysical properties. One striking biophysical property of IC neurons is the rebound depolarization produced following membrane hyperpolarization. To understand how the rebound depolarization is involved in spike timing, we made whole-cell patch clamp recordings from IC neurons in brain slices of P9–21 rats. We found that the percentage of rebound neurons was developmentally regulated. The precision of the timing of the first spike on the rebound increased when the neuron was repetitively injected with a depolarizing current following membrane hyperpolarization. The average jitter of the first spikes was only 0.5 ms. The selective T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel antagonist, mibefradil, significantly increased the jitter of the first spike of neurons in response to repetitive depolarization following membrane hyperpolarization. Furthermore, the rebound was potentiated by one to two preceding rebounds within a few hundred milliseconds. The first spike generated on the potentiated rebound was more precise than that on the non-potentiated rebound. With the addition of a calcium chelator, BAPTA, into the cell, the rebound potentiation no longer occurred, and the precision of the first spike on the rebound was not improved. These results suggest that the postinhibitory rebound mediated by T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel promotes spike timing precision in IC neurons. The rebound potentiation and precise spikes may be induced by increases in intracellular calcium levels.</p>

<p>Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of cell death characterized by the accumulation of intracellular lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS). Ferroptosis is significantly different from other types of cell death including apoptosis, autophagy, and necrosis, both in morphology and biochemical characteristics. The mechanisms that are associated with ferroptosis include iron metabolism, lipid oxidation, and other pathophysiological changes. Ferroptosis inducers or inhibitors can influence its occurrence through different pathways. Ferroptosis was initially discovered in tumors, though recent studies have confirmed that it is also closely related to a variety of neurological diseases including neurodegenerative disease [Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), etc.] and stroke. This article reviews the definition and characteristics of ferroptosis, the potential mechanisms associated with its development, inducers/inhibitors, and its role in non-neoplastic neurological diseases. We hope to provide a theoretical basis and novel treatment strategies for the treatment of central nervous system diseases by targeting ferroptosis.</p>

<p>A class of Group III muscle afferent neurons has branching sensory terminals in the connective tissue between layers of mouse abdominal muscles (“CT3 muscle afferents”). These sensory endings are both mechanosensitive and metabosensitive. In the present study, responses of CT3 afferents to lactate ions and changes in temperature were recorded. Raising muscle temperature from 32.7°C to 37°C had no consistent effects on CT3 afferent basal firing rate or responses to either von Frey hair stimulation or to an applied load. Superfusion with lactate ions (15 mM, pH 7.4) was associated with an increase in firing from 6 ± 0.7 Hz to 11.7 ± 6.7 Hz (14 units, n = 13, P &lt; 0.05, P = 0.0484) but with considerable variability in the nature and latency of response. Reducing the concentration of extracellular divalent cations, which mimicked the chelating effects of lactate, did not increase firing. Raised concentrations of divalent cations (to compensate for chelation) did not block excitatory effects of lactate on CT3 afferents, suggesting that effects via ASIC3 were not involved. Messenger RNA for the G-protein coupled receptor, hydroxyl carboxylic acid receptor 1 (HCAR1) was detected in dorsal root ganglia and HCAR1-like immunoreactivity was present in spinal afferent nerve cell bodies retrogradely labeled from mouse abdominal muscles. HCAR1-like immunoreactivity was also present in axons in mouse abdominal muscles. This raises the possibility that some effects of lactate on group III muscle afferents may be mediated by HCAR1.</p>

<p>Inflammatory processes and microglia activation accompany most of the pathophysiological diseases in the central nervous system. It is proven that glial pathology precedes and even drives the development of multiple neurodegenerative conditions. A growing number of studies point out the importance of microglia in brain development as well as in physiological functioning. These resident brain immune cells are divergent from the peripherally infiltrated macrophages, but their precise in situ discrimination is surprisingly difficult. Microglial heterogeneity in the brain is especially visible in their morphology and cell density in particular brain structures but also in the expression of cellular markers. This often determines their role in physiology or pathology of brain functioning. The species differences between rodent and human markers add complexity to the whole picture. Furthermore, due to activation, microglia show a broad spectrum of phenotypes ranging from the pro-inflammatory, potentially cytotoxic M1 to the anti-inflammatory, scavenging, and regenerative M2. A precise distinction of specific phenotypes is nowadays essential to study microglial functions and tissue state in such a quickly changing environment. Due to the overwhelming amount of data on multiple sets of markers that is available for such studies, the choice of appropriate markers is a scientific challenge. This review gathers, classifies, and describes known and recently discovered protein markers expressed by microglial cells in their different phenotypes. The presented microglia markers include qualitative and semi-quantitative, general and specific, surface and intracellular proteins, as well as secreted molecules. The information provided here creates a comprehensive and practical guide through the current knowledge and will facilitate the choosing of proper, more specific markers for detailed studies on microglia and neuroinflammatory mechanisms in various physiological as well as pathological conditions. Both basic research and clinical medicine need clearly described and validated molecular markers of microglia phenotype, which are essential in diagnostics, treatment, and prevention of diseases engaging glia activation.</p>

<p>The adult central nervous system (CNS) contains resident stem cells within specific niches that maintain a self-renewal and proliferative capacity to generate new neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes throughout adulthood. Physiological aging is associated with a progressive loss of function and a decline in the self-renewal and regenerative capacities of CNS stem cells. Also, the biggest risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases is age, and current in vivo and in vitro models of neurodegenerative diseases rarely consider this. Therefore, combining both aging research and appropriate interrogation of animal disease models towards the understanding of the disease and age-related stem cell failure is imperative to the discovery of new therapies. This review article will highlight the main intrinsic and extrinsic regulators of neural stem cell (NSC) aging and discuss how these factors impact normal homeostatic functions within the adult brain. We will consider established in vivo animal and in vitro human disease model systems, and then discuss the current and future trajectories of novel senotherapeutics that target aging NSCs to ameliorate brain disease.</p>

<p>Objective: To assess the value of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) during acute phase in predicting post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) at 3–6 months.</p><p>Methods: We prospectively recruited 229 patients who had suffered their first-ever ischemic stroke.

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was then performed to compare the discriminatory ability of the MMSE and MoCA. Also, we applied a decision tree generated by the classification and regression tree methodology.</p><p>Results: In total, 66 patients had PSCI when evaluated 3–6 months after the onset of minor stroke. Logistic regression analysis revealed that education, body mass index (BMI), and baseline MoCA scores were independently associated with PSCI. ROC curve analysis showed that the ability to predict PSCI was similar when compared between baseline MoCA scores [area under curve (AUC), 0.821; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.743–0.898] and baseline MMSE scores (AUC, 0.809; 95% CI, 0.725–0.892, P = 0.75). Both MMSE and MoCA exhibited similar predictive values at their optimal cut-off points (MMSE ≤27; sensitivity, 0.682; specificity, 0.816; MoCA ≤21; sensitivity, 0.636; specificity, 0.895). Classification and regression tree-derived analysis yielded an AUC of 0.823 (sensitivity, 0.803; specificity, 0.842).</p><p>Conclusion: When applied within 2 weeks of stroke, the MMSE and MoCA are both useful and have similar predictive value for PSCI 3–6 months after the onset of minor stroke.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The aim was to investigate whether neurodegenerative biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) differentiate patients with suspected normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) who respond to CSF drainage from patients who do not respond.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Data from 62 consecutive patients who presented with magnetic resonance imaging changes indicative of NPH were studied with regard to cognitive and gait functions before and after drainage of 40–50ml of CSF. Additionally, S100 protein, neuron‐specific enolase, β‐amyloid protein, tau protein and phospho‐tau were determined in CSF. Statistical analyses were carried out with ANOVA and multiple linear regression.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Patients with CSF constellations typical for Alzheimer's disease (n = 28) improved significantly in cognitive and gait‐related functions after CSF drainage. In contrast, those patients without a CSF constellation typical for Alzheimer's disease (n = 34) did not improve in cognitive and gait‐related functions after CSF drainage. In addition, positive CSF biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease predicted these improvements.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our data suggest an association between Alzheimer's disease and NPH changes, supporting the recently suggested dichotomy of a neurodegenerative NPH and a true idiopathic NPH, with the latter appearing to be rare. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25864?af=R">Non‐motor symptoms in Parkinson´s disease are reduced by nabilone</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To assess the efficacy and safety of nabilone, a synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol analogue, as a treatment for non‐motor symptoms (NMS) in Parkinson´s Disease (PD).</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This was a phase II placebo‐controlled, double‐blind, parallel‐group, enriched enrollment randomized withdrawal trial at the Medical University Innsbruck. A random sample of 47 PD patients with stable motor disease and disturbing NMS defined by a score of ≥4 points on the Movement Disorder Society‐Unified PD Rating Scale‐I (MDS‐UPDRS‐I) underwent open‐label nabilone titration (0.25mg once daily‐1mg twice daily, Phase 1). Responders were randomized 1:1 to continue with nabilone or switch to placebo for four weeks (Phase 2). The primary efficacy criterion was the change of the MDS‐UPDRS‐I between randomization and week four. Safety was analyzed in all patients who received at least one nabilone dose.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Between October 2017 and July 2019, 19 patients received either nabilone (median dose=0.75mg) or placebo. At week four, mean change of the MDS‐UPDRS‐I was 2.63 (95%CI 1.53‐3.74, p=0.002, effect size=1.15) in the placebo versus 1.00 (95%CI ‐0.16‐2.16, p=0.280, effect size=0.42) in the nabilone‐group (difference:1.63, 95%CI 0.09‐3.18, p=0.030, effect size=0.66). Seventy‐seven percent of patients had adverse events (AEs) during open‐label titration, most of them were transient. In the double‐blind phase, similar proportions of patients in each group had AEs (42% placebo‐group, 32% nabilone‐group). There were no serious AEs.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results highlight the potential efficacy of nabilone for PD patients with disturbing NMS, which appears to be driven by positive effects on anxious mood and night‐time sleep problems.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Guidelines recommend initiating anticoagulation within 4 to 14 days after cardioembolic stroke. Data supporting this did not account for key factors potentially affecting the decision to initiate anticoagulation, such as infarct size, hemorrhagic transformation, or high‐risk features on echocardiography.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We pooled data from stroke registries of 8 comprehensive stroke centers across the United States. We included consecutive patients admitted with ischemic stroke and atrial fibrillation. The primary predictor was timing of initiating anticoagulation (0–3 days, 4–14 days, or &gt;14 days), and outcomes were recurrent stroke/transient ischemic attack/systemic embolism, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH), and major extracranial hemorrhage (ECH) within 90 days.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 2,084 patients, 1,289 met the inclusion criteria. The combined endpoint occurred in 10.1% (n = 130) subjects (87 ischemic events, 20 sICH, and 29 ECH). Overall, there was no significant difference in the composite endpoint between the 3 groups (0–3 days: 10.3%, 64/617; 4–14 days: 9.7%, 52/535; &gt;14 days: 10.2%, 14/137; <i>p </i> = 0.933). In adjusted models, patients started on anticoagulation between 4 and 14 days did not have a lower rate of sICH (vs 0–3 days; odds ratio [OR] = 1.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.50–4.43), nor did they have a lower rate of recurrent ischemic events (vs &gt;14 days; OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.36–1.62, <i>p </i> = 0.482).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In this multicenter real‐world cohort, the recommended (4–14 days) time frame to start oral anticoagulation was not associated with reduced ischemic and hemorrhagic outcomes. Randomized trials are required to determine the optimal timing of anticoagulation initiation. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<p>Corticosteroids exert a dual role in eukaryotic cells through their action via (1) intracellular receptors (slow genomic responses), or (2) membrane-bound receptors (fast non-genomic responses). Highly vulnerable regions of the brain, like the hippocampus, express high amounts of corticosteroid receptors, yet their actions on ionic currents and neurotransmitters release are still undefined. Here, we investigated the effect of methylprednisolone (MP) on GABA and glutamate (Glu) release from isolated nerve terminals of the rat hippocampus. MP favored both spontaneous and depolarization-evoked [<sup>14</sup>C]Glu release from rat hippocampal nerve terminals, without affecting [<sup>3</sup>H]GABA outflow. Facilitation of [<sup>14</sup>C]Glu release by MP is mediated by a Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent non-genomic mechanism relying on the activation of membrane-bound glucocorticoid (GR) and mineralocorticoid (MR) receptors sensitive to their antagonists mifepristone and spironolactone, respectively. The involvement of Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent high-affinity EAAT transport reversal was inferred by blockage of MP-induced [<sup>14</sup>C]Glu release by DL-TBOA. Depolarization-evoked [<sup>3</sup>H]GABA release in the presence of MP was partially attenuated by the selective P2X7 receptor antagonist A-438079, but this compound did not affect the release of [<sup>14</sup>C]Glu. Data indicate that MP differentially affects GABA and glutamate release from rat hippocampal nerve terminals via fast non-genomic mechanisms putatively involving the activation of membrane-bound corticosteroid receptors. Facilitation of Glu release strengthen previous assumptions that MP may act as a cognitive enhancer in rats, while crosstalk with ATP-sensitive P2X7 receptors may promote a therapeutically desirable GABAergic inhibitory control during paroxysmal epileptic crisis that might be particularly relevant when extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels decrease below the threshold required for transmitter release.</p>

<p>Mutations in the LAMA2 gene affect the production of the α2 subunit of laminin-211 (= merosin) and result in either partial or complete laminin-211 deficiency. Complete merosin deficiency is typically associated with a more severe congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD), clinically manifested by hypotonia and weakness at birth, the development of contractures of large joints, and progressive respiratory involvement. Muscle atrophy and severe weakness typically prevent independent ambulation. Partial merosin deficiency is mostly manifested by later onset limb-girdle weakness and joint contractures so that independent ambulation is typically achieved. Collectively, complete and partial merosin deficiency is referred to as LAMA2-related dystrophies (LAMA2-RDs) and represents one of the most common forms of congenital muscular dystrophies worldwide. LAMA2-RDs are classically characterized by both central and peripheral nervous system involvement with abnormal appearing white matter (WM) on brain MRI and dystrophic appearing muscle on muscle biopsy as well as creatine kinase (CK) levels commonly elevated to &gt;1,000 IU/L. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has greatly improved diagnostic abilities for LAMA2-RD, and the majority of patients with merosin deficiency carry recessive pathogenic variants in the LAMA2 gene. The existence of multiple animal models for LAMA2-RDs has helped to advance our understanding of laminin-211 and has been instrumental in preclinical research progress and translation to clinical trials. The first clinical trial for the LAMA2-RDs was a phase 1 pharmacokinetic and safety study of the anti-apoptotic compound omigapil, based on preclinical studies performed in the dy<sup>W</sup>/dy<sup>W</sup> and dy<sup>2J</sup>/dy<sup>2J</sup> mouse models. This phase 1 study enabled the collection of pulmonary and motor outcome measures and also provided the opportunity for investigating exploratory outcome measures including muscle ultrasound, muscle MRI and serum, and urine biomarker collection. Natural history studies, including a five-year prospective natural history and comparative outcome measures study in patients with LAMA2-RD, have helped to better delineate the natural history and identify viable outcome measures. Plans for further clinical trials for LAMA2-RDs are presently in progress, highlighting the necessity of identifying adequate, disease-relevant biomarkers, capable of reflecting potential therapeutic changes, in addition to refining the clinical outcome measures and time-to-event trajectory analysis of affected patients.</p>

<p>Emerging evidence suggests that alterations in the development of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract during the early postnatal period can influence brain development and vice-versa. It is increasingly recognized that communication between the GI tract and brain is mainly driven by neural, endocrine, immune, and metabolic mediators, collectively called the gut-brain axis (GBA). Changes in the GBA mediators occur in response to the developmental changes in the body during this period. This review provides an overview of major developmental events in the GI tract and brain in the early postnatal period and their parallel developmental trajectories under physiological conditions. Current knowledge of GBA mediators in context to brain function and behavioral outcomes and their synthesis and metabolism (site, timing, etc.) is discussed. This review also presents hypotheses on the role of the GBA mediators in response to the parallel development of the GI tract and brain in infants.</p>

<p>Reward and punishment have demonstrated dissociable effects on motor learning and memory, which suggests that these reinforcers are differently processed by the brain. To test this possibility, we use electroencephalography to record cortical neural activity after the presentation of reward and punishment feedback during a visuomotor rotation task. Participants were randomly placed into Reward, Punishment, or Control groups and performed the task under different conditions to assess the adaptation (learning) and retention (memory) of the motor task. These conditions featured an incongruent position between the cursor and the target, with the cursor trajectory, rotated 30° counterclockwise, requiring the participant to adapt their movement to hit the target. Feedback based on error magnitude was provided during the Adaptation condition in the form of a positive number (Reward) or negative number (Punishment), each representing a monetary gain or loss, respectively. No reinforcement or visual feedback was provided during the No Vision condition (retention). Performance error and event-related potentials (ERPs) time-locked to feedback presentation were calculated for each participant during both conditions. Punishment feedback reduced performance error and promoted faster learning during the Adaptation condition. In contrast, punishment feedback increased performance error during the No Vision condition compared to Control and Reward groups, which suggests a diminished motor memory. Moreover, the Punishment group showed a significant decrease in the amplitude of ERPs during the No Vision condition compared to the Adaptation condition. The amplitude of ERPs did not change in the other two groups. These results suggest that punishment feedback impairs motor retention by altering the neural processing involved in memory encoding. This study provides a neurophysiological underpinning for the dissociative effects of punishment feedback on motor learning.</p>

<p>Coronavirus disease (CoVID-19), caused by recently identified severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is characterized by inconsistent clinical presentations. While many infected individuals remain asymptomatic or show mild respiratory symptoms, others develop severe pneumonia or even respiratory distress syndrome. SARS-CoV-2 is reported to be able to infect the lungs, the intestines, blood vessels, the bile ducts, the conjunctiva, macrophages, T lymphocytes, the heart, liver, kidneys, and brain. More than a third of cases displayed neurological involvement, and many severely ill patients developed multiple organ infection and injury. However, less than 1% of patients had a detectable level of SARS-CoV-2 in the blood, raising a question of how the virus spreads throughout the body. We propose that nerve terminals in the orofacial mucosa, eyes, and olfactory neuroepithelium act as entry points for the brain invasion, allowing SARS-CoV-2 to infect the brainstem. By exploiting the subcellular membrane compartments of infected cells, a feature common to all coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is capable to disseminate from the brain to periphery via vesicular axonal transport and passive diffusion through axonal endoplasmic reticula, causing multiple organ injury independently of an underlying respiratory infection. The proposed model clarifies a wide range of clinically observed phenomena in CoVID-19 patients, such as neurological symptoms unassociated with lung pathology, protracted presence of the virus in samples obtained from recovered patients, exaggerated immune response, and multiple organ failure in severe cases with variable course and dynamics of the disease. We believe that this model can provide novel insights into CoVID-19 and its long-term sequelae, and establish a framework for further research.</p>

<p>Traumatic spinal cord injury produces long-term neurological damage, and presents a significant public health problem with nearly 18,000 new cases per year in the U.S. The injury results in both acute and chronic changes in the spinal cord, ultimately resulting in the production of a glial scar, consisting of multiple cells including fibroblasts, macrophages, microglia, and reactive astrocytes. Within the scar, there is an accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules—primarily tenascins and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs)—which are considered to be inhibitory to axonal regeneration. In this review article, we discuss the role of CSPGs in the injury response, especially how sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains act to inhibit plasticity and regeneration. This includes how sulfation of GAG chains influences their biological activity and interactions with potential receptors. Comprehending the role of CSPGs in the inhibitory properties of the glial scar provides critical knowledge in the much-needed production of new therapies.</p>

<p>Fear of falling influences postural strategies used for balance, and is key in the maintenance of independent living and quality of life as adults age. However, there is a distinct need for methodology that aims to specifically address and prime fear under dynamic conditions, and to better determine the role of fear in movement preparation. This preliminary study investigated how fear priming influences fear of falling in young and older individuals, and assessed how changes in fear of falling map to movement behavior. Young (21.5 ± 1.7 years, n = 10) and older (58.1 ± 2.2 years) participants matched for height, weight, and sex were repeatedly exposed to four different and incrementally challenging laboratory-based slipping perturbations during a self-initiated, goal-directed step and reach task. Both younger and older cohorts showed similar heightened perceptions in fear of falling after fear priming, and changes in peak joint excursions including reduced ankle flexion, and increased lumbar flexion after fear priming. Age-related changes were only evident in total mediolateral center of mass displacement, with younger participants showing greater displacement after fear priming. Despite clear differences in preparatory muscle onsets relative to reach onset seen in older participants, muscle timings or co-contraction indices were not significantly different. Methods utilizing repeated exposure to varying increases of a slip-based postural challenge can successfully prime fear of falling in individuals, regardless of age.</p>

Nearly all brain functions involve routing neural activity among a distributed network of areas. Understanding this routing requires more than a description of interareal anatomical connectivity: it requires understanding what controls the flow of signals through interareal circuitry and how this communication might be modulated to allow flexible behavior. Here we review proposals of how communication, particularly between visual cortical areas, is instantiated and modulated, highlighting recent work that offers new perspectives.

Memory formation is a dynamic process and sleep is part of it. Consolidation of memories relies on finely orchestrated brain activities occurring during the post-learning sleep period. In this issue of Neuron, Kumar and colleagues provide evidence that the activity of adult-born hippocampal neurons during REM sleep is critical for the consolidation of episodic memory.

To establish a genuine scientific discourse, we must accept a long due departure from the habit of neatly arranging things in a hierarchy where “macroscopic” psychological mystery awaits explanation in terms of “microscopic” neural objects. Instead, a relational scientific methodology is wanted, accompanied by a dialogic mode of conversation between the disciplines.

Vancraeyenest et al. reversibly inactivated the pathway from the VTA to the NAc using a double-infection viral vector approach in macaques. This mainly affected dopaminergic projections and resulted in increased functional connectivity, especially pronounced in fronto-temporal circuits. Surprisingly, reinforcement-based learning remained unaffected, contrary to motivational behavior requiring high effort.

In this issue of Neuron, Vandael et al. (2020) reveal that post-tetanic potentiation at dentate gyrus mossy fiber synapses is induced by natural activity patterns. This plasticity is mediated by an increase in readily releasable vesicle pool size and is extended in the absence of activity, forming a “pool engram.”

<p>by Lina K. Klein, Guido Maiello, Vivian C. Paulun, Roland W. Fleming</p>

We rarely experience difficulty picking up objects, yet of all potential contact points on the surface, only a small proportion yield effective grasps. Here, we present extensive behavioral data alongside a normative model that correctly predicts human precision grasping of unfamiliar 3D objects. We tracked participants’ forefinger and thumb as they picked up objects of 10 wood and brass cubes configured to tease apart effects of shape, weight, orientation, and mass distribution. Grasps were highly systematic and consistent across repetitions and participants. We employed these data to construct a model which combines five cost functions related to force closure, torque, natural grasp axis, grasp aperture, and visibility. Even without free parameters, the model predicts individual grasps almost as well as different individuals predict one another’s, but fitting weights reveals the relative importance of the different constraints. The model also accurately predicts human grasps on novel 3D-printed objects with more naturalistic geometries and is robust to perturbations in its key parameters. Together, the findings provide a unified account of how we successfully grasp objects of different 3D shape, orientation, mass, and mass distribution.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YoLZSjliezU" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This study investigates the response to spinal cord injury in the gray short‐tailed opossum (<i>Monodelphis domestica </i>). In opossums spinal injury early in development results in spontaneous axon growth through the injury, but this regenerative potential diminishes with maturity until it is lost entirely. The mechanisms underlying this regeneration remain unknown. RNA sequencing was used to identify differential gene expression in regenerating (SCI at postnatal Day 7, P7SCI) and nonregenerating (SCI at Day 28, P28SCI) cords +1d, +3d, and +7d after complete spinal transection, compared to age‐matched controls. Genes showing significant differential expression (log2FC ≥ 1, <i>Padj </i> ≤ 0.05) were used for downstream analysis. Across all time‐points 233 genes altered expression after P7SCI, and 472 genes altered expression after P28SCI. One hundred and forty‐seven genes altered expression in both injury ages (63% of P7SCI data set). The majority of changes were gene upregulations. Gene ontology overrepresentation analysis in P7SCI gene‐sets showed significant overrepresentations only in immune‐associated categories, while P28SCI gene‐sets showed overrepresentations in these same immune categories, along with other categories such as “cell proliferation,” “cell adhesion,” and “apoptosis.” Cell‐type–association analysis suggested that, regardless of injury age, injury‐associated gene transcripts were most strongly associated with microglia and endothelial cells, with strikingly fewer astrocyte, oligodendrocyte and neuron‐related genes, the notable exception being a cluster of mostly downregulated oligodendrocyte‐associated genes in the P7SCI + 7d gene‐set. Our findings demonstrate a more complex transcriptomic response in nonregenerating cords, suggesting a strong influence of non‐neuronal cells in the outcome after injury and providing the largest survey yet of the transcriptomic changes occurring after SCI in this model.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Polysialic acid (polySia), a homopolymer of α2,8‐linked glycans, is a posttranslational modification on a few glycoproteins, most commonly in the brain, on the neural cell adhesion molecule. Most research in the adult central nervous system has focused on its expression in higher brain regions, where its distribution coincides with regions known to exhibit high levels of synaptic plasticity. In contrast, scant attention has been paid to the expression of polySia in the hindbrain. The main aims of the study were to examine the distribution of polySia immunoreactivity in the brainstem and thoracolumbar spinal cord, to compare the distribution of polySia revealed by two commercial antibodies commonly used for its investigation, and to compare labeling in the rat and mouse. We present a comprehensive atlas of polySia immunoreactivity: we report that polySia labeling is particularly dense in the dorsal tegmentum, medial vestibular nuclei and lateral parabrachial nucleus, and in brainstem regions associated with autonomic function, including the dorsal vagal complex, A5, rostral ventral medulla, A1, and midline raphe, as well as sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the spinal cord and central targets of primary sensory afferents (nucleus of the solitary tract, spinal trigeminal nucleus, and dorsal horn [DH]). Ultrastructural examination showed labeling was present predominantly on the plasma membrane/within the extracellular space/in or on astrocytes. Labeling throughout the brainstem and spinal cord were very similar for the two antibodies and was eliminated by the polySia‐specific sialidase, Endo‐NF. Similar patterns of distribution were found in rat and mouse brainstem with differences evident in DH.</p>

<p>Exogenous melatonin significantly alters hippocampal neuronal micromorphometry, increases cysteine‐rich protein 1 (crp‐1) expression, and improves memory retention in mice. These findings expand our knowledge about the beneficial effects of melatonin on hippocampal neurons, and implicates alterations of structural neuroplasticity and crp‐1 upregulation as possible key players in this process of cognitive function improvement. </p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neuronal plasticity describes changes in structure, function, and connections of neurons. The hippocampus, in particular, has been shown to exhibit considerable plasticity regarding both physiological and morphological functions. Melatonin, a hormone released by the pineal gland, promotes cell survival and dendrite maturation of neurons in the newborn brain and protects against neurological disorders. In this study, we investigated the effect of exogenous melatonin on neuronal architecture and its possible mechanism in the hippocampus of adult male C57BL/6 mice. Melatonin treatment significantly increased the total length and complexity of dendrites in the apical and basal <i>cornu ammonis </i> (CA) 1 and in the dentate gyrus in mouse hippocampi. Spine density in CA1 apical dendrites was increased, but no significant differences in other subregions were observed. In primary cultured hippocampal neurons, the length and arborization of neurites were significantly augmented by melatonin treatment. Additionally, western blot and immunohistochemical analyses in both <i>in vivo </i> and <i>in vitro </i> systems revealed significant increases in the level of cysteine‐rich protein 1 (crp‐1) protein, which is known to be involved in dendritic branching in mouse hippocampal neurons after melatonin treatment. Our results suggest that exogenous melatonin leads to significant alterations of neuronal micromorphometry in the adult hippocampus, possibly via crp‐1 signaling.</p>

<p>Extracellular ascorbic acid induces Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, stimulating sodium‐dependent vitamin C transporter 2 (SVCT2) anterograde trafficking in wild‐type cells. No ascorbic acid‐induced cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase was observed in Huntington's disease (HD) cells. Thus, SVCT2 would fail to reach the cellular surface, affecting ascorbic acid uptake in HD cells.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a glutamine expansion at the first exon of the huntingtin gene. Huntingtin protein (Htt) is ubiquitously expressed and it is localized in several organelles, including endosomes. HD is associated with a failure in energy metabolism and oxidative damage. Ascorbic acid is a powerful antioxidant highly concentrated in the brain where it acts as a messenger, modulating neuronal metabolism. It is transported into neurons via the sodium‐dependent vitamin C transporter 2 (SVCT2). During synaptic activity, ascorbic acid is released from glial reservoirs to the extracellular space, inducing an increase in SVCT2 localization at the plasma membrane. Here, we studied SVCT2 trafficking and localization in HD. SVCT2 is decreased at synaptic terminals in YAC128 male mice. Using cellular models for HD (STHdhQ7 and STHdhQ111 cells), we determined that SVCT2 trafficking through secretory and endosomal pathways is altered in resting conditions. We observed Golgi fragmentation and SVCT2/Htt‐associated protein‐1 mis‐colocalization. Additionally, we observed altered ascorbic acid‐induced calcium signaling that explains the reduced SVCT2 translocation to the plasma membrane in the presence of extracellular ascorbic acid (active conditions) described in our previous results. Therefore, SVCT2 trafficking to the plasma membrane is altered in resting and active conditions in HD, explaining the redox imbalance observed during early stages of the disease.</p>

<p>Projections from hippocampal fields CA1 and the subiculum to the entorhinal cortex are topographically organized. Projections from the presubiculum preferentially distribute to the caudal half of the entorhinal cortex and thus provides a potential indicator for a primate homologue of the medial entorhinal cortex as defined in rodents.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The organization of projections from the macaque monkey hippocampus, subiculum, presubiculum, and parasubiculum to the entorhinal cortex was analyzed using anterograde and retrograde tracing techniques. Projections exclusively originate in the CA1 field of the hippocampus and in the subiculum, presubiculum, and parasubiculum. The CA1 and subicular projections terminate most densely in Layers V and VI of the entorhinal cortex, with sparser innervation of the deep portion of Layers III and II. Entorhinal projections from CA1 and the subiculum are topographically organized such that a rostrocaudal axis of origin is related to a medial‐to‐lateral axis of termination. A proximodistal axis of origin in CA1 and distoproximal axis in subiculum are related to a rostrocaudal axis of termination in the entorhinal cortex. The presubiculum sends a dense, bilateral projection to caudal parts of the entorhinal cortex. This projection terminates most densely in Layer III with sparser termination in Layers I, II, and V. The same parts of entorhinal cortex receive a dense projection from the parasubiculum. This projection terminates in Layers III and II. Both presubicular and parasubicular projections demonstrate the same longitudinal topographic organization as the projections from CA1 and the subiculum. These studies demonstrate that: (a) hippocampal and subicular inputs to the entorhinal cortex in the monkey are organized similar to those described in nonprimate species; (b) the topographic organization of the projections from the hippocampus and subicular areas matches that of the reciprocal projections from the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampus and the subicular areas.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00052">Effects of Cortical Cooling on Activity Across Layers of the Rat Barrel Cortex</a></h4>

<p>Moderate cortical cooling is known to suppress slow oscillations and to evoke persistent cortical activity. However, the cooling-induced changes in electrical activity across cortical layers remain largely unknown. Here, we performed multi-channel local field potential (LFP) and multi-unit activity (MUA) recordings with linear silicone probes through the layers of single cortical barrel columns in urethane-anesthetized rats under normothermia (38°C) and during local cortical surface cooling (30°C). During cortically generated slow oscillations, moderate cortical cooling decreased delta wave amplitude, delta-wave occurrence, the duration of silent states, and delta wave-locked MUA synchronization. Moderate cortical cooling increased total time spent in the active state and decreased total time spent in the silent state. Cooling-evoked changes in the MUA firing rate in cortical layer 5 (L5) varied from increase to decrease across animals, and the polarity of changes in L5 MUA correlated with changes in total time spent in the active state. The decrease in temperature reduced MUA firing rates in all other cortical layers. Sensory-evoked MUA responses also decreased during cooling through all cortical layers. The cooling-dependent slowdown was detected at the fast time-scale with a decreased frequency of sensory-evoked high-frequency oscillations (HFO). Thus, moderate cortical cooling suppresses slow oscillations and desynchronizes neuronal activity through all cortical layers, and is associated with reduced firing across all cortical layers except L5, where cooling induces variable and non-consistent changes in neuronal firing, which are common features of the transition from slow-wave synchronization to desynchronized activity in the barrel cortex.</p>

<p>Aim: To examine the effects of fentanyl, a potent mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist, on-air puff-evoked responses in Purkinje cells (PCs), and molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) using in vivo patch-clamp recordings in anesthetized mice.</p><p>Methods: Male mice 6–8 weeks-old were anesthetized and fixed on a custom-made stereotaxic frame. The cerebellar surface was exposed and perfused with oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF). Patch-clamp recordings in the cell-attached mode were obtained from PCs and MLIs. Facial stimulation by air-puff of the ipsilateral whisker pad was performed through a pressurized injection system. Fentanyl citrate, CTOP, and H-89 dissolved in ACSF were perfused onto the cerebellar surface.</p><p>Results: Fentanyl significantly inhibited the amplitude and area under the curve (AUC) of sensory stimulation-evoked inhibitory responses in PCs. Although fentanyl did not influence the frequency of simple spikes (SSs), it decreased the pause of SS. The IC<sub>50</sub> of the fentanyl-induced suppression of the P1 response amplitude was 5.53 μM. The selective MOR antagonist CTOP abolished fentanyl-induced inhibitory responses in PCs. However, the application of CTOP alone increased the amplitude, AUC of P1, and the pause of SS. Notably, fentanyl significantly inhibited the tactile-evoked response of MLIs but did not affect their spontaneous firing. The fentanyl-induced decrease of inhibitory responses in PCs was partially prevented by a PKA inhibitor, H-89.</p><p>Conclusions: These results suggest that fentanyl binds to MORs in MLIs to reduce GABAergic neurotransmission in MLI-PC projections and one potential mechanism is via modulation of the cAMP-PKA pathway.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common type of senile dementia, characterized by neurofibrillary tangle and amyloid plaque in brain pathology. Major efforts in AD drug were devoted to the interference with the production and accumulation of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ), which plays a causal role in the pathogenesis of AD. Aβ is generated from amyloid precursor protein (APP), by consecutive cleavage by β-secretase and γ-secretase. Therefore, β-secretase and γ-secretase inhibition have been the focus for AD drug discovery efforts for amyloid reduction. Here, we review β-secretase inhibitors and γ-secretase inhibitors/modulators, and their efficacies in clinical trials. In addition, we discussed the novel concept of specifically targeting the γ-secretase substrate APP. Targeting amyloidogenic processing of APP is still a fundamentally sound strategy to develop disease-modifying AD therapies and recent advance in γ-secretase/APP complex structure provides new opportunities in designing selective inhibitors/modulators for AD.</p>

<p>The dynamic trafficking of AMPA receptors (AMPARs), which enables the endocytosis, recycling, and exocytosis of AMPARs, is crucial for synaptic plasticity. Endophilin2, which directly interacts with the GluA1 subunit of AMPARs, plays an important role in AMPAR endocytosis. Collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) promotes the maturation of the dendritic spine and can transfer AMPARs to the membrane. Although the mechanisms of AMPAR endocytosis and exocytosis are well known, the exact molecular mechanisms underlying AMPAR recycling remain unclear. Here, we report a unique interaction between CRMP2 and endophilin2. Our results showed that overexpression of CRMP2 and endophilin2 increased the amplitude and frequency of miniature excitatory synaptic currents (mEPSCs) and modestly enhanced AMPAR levels in hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, the CRMP2 and endophilin2 overexpression phenotype failed to occur when the interaction between these two proteins was inhibited. Further analysis revealed that this interaction was regulated by CRMP2 phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of CRMP2 inhibited its interaction with endophilin2; this was mainly affected by the phosphorylation of Thr514 and Ser518 by glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3β. CRMP2 phosphorylation increased degradation and inhibited the surface expression of AMPAR GluA1 subunits in cultured hippocampal neurons. However, the dephosphorylation of CRMP2 inhibited degradation and promoted the surface expression of AMPAR GluA1 subunits in cultured hippocampal neurons. Taken together, our data demonstrated that the interaction between CRMP2 and endophilin2 was conductive to the recycling of AMPA receptor GluA1 subunits in hippocampal neurons.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00035">Assessing the Effects of Continuous Theta Burst Stimulation Over the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex on Human Cognition: A Systematic Review</a></h4>

<p>Theta burst stimulation is increasingly growing in popularity as a non-invasive method of moderating corticospinal networks. Theta burst stimulation uses gamma frequency trains applied at the rhythm of theta, thus, mimicking theta–gamma coupling involved in cognitive processes. The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex has been found to play a crucial role in numerous cognitive processes. Here, we include 25 studies for review to determine the cognitive effects of continuous theta burst stimulation over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; 20 of these studies are healthy participant and five are patient (pharmacotherapy-resistant depression) studies. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the included studies, only a descriptive approach is used and meta-analytics ruled out. The cognitive effect is measured on various cognitive domains: attention, working memory, planning, language, decision making, executive function, and inhibitory and cognitive control. We conclude that continuous theta burst stimulation over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex mainly inhibits cognitive performance. However, in some instances, it can lead to improved performance by inhibiting the effect of distractors or other competing irrelevant cognitive processes. To be precise, continuous theta burst stimulation over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex impaired attention, inhibitory control, planning, and goal-directed behavior in decision making but also improved decision making by reducing impulsivity. Conversely, continuous theta burst stimulation over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex impaired executive function, working, auditory feedback regulation, and cognitive control but accelerated the planning, decision-making process. These findings constitute a useful contribution to the literature on the cognitive effects of continuous theta burst stimulation over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.</p>

Background<p>Apathy is one of the most common non-motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, its pathophysiology remains unclear.</p>Methods<p>We analyzed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data acquired at a 3.0T MRI scanner using the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) metric in 20 de novo, drug-naïve, non-demented PD patients with apathy (PD-A), 26 PD patients without apathy (PD-NA) without comorbidity of depressive or anxious symptoms, and 23 matched healthy control (HC) subjects.</p>Results<p>We found that the ALFF decreased significantly in the bilateral nucleus accumbens, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in patients with PD-A compared to patients with PD-NA and HC subjects. Furthermore, apathy severity was negatively correlated with the ALFF in the bilateral nucleus accumbens and dorsal ACC in the pooled patients with PD.</p>Conclusion<p>The present study characterized the functional pattern of changes in spontaneous neural activity in patients with PD-A. With the aim to better elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for these changes, this study controlled for the potentially confounding effects of dopaminergic medication, depression, anxiety, and global cognitive impairment. The findings of the current study add to the literature by highlighting potential abnormalities in mesocorticolimbic pathways involved in the development of apathy in PD.</p>

<p>Transient receptor potential (TRP) are cation channels expressed in both non-excitable and excitable cells from diverse tissues, including heart, lung, and brain. The TRP channel family includes 28 isoforms activated by physical and chemical stimuli, such as temperature, pH, osmotic pressure, and noxious stimuli. Recently, it has been shown that TRP channels are also directly or indirectly activated by reactive oxygen species. Oxidative stress plays an essential role in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, and TRP channels are involved in the progression of those diseases by mechanisms involving changes in the crosstalk between Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation, oxidative stress, and production of inflammatory mediators. TRP channels involved in nociception include members of the TRPV, TRPM, TRPA, and TRPC subfamilies that transduce physical and chemical noxious stimuli. It has also been reported that pain is a complex issue in patients with Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, and adequate management of pain in those conditions is still in discussion. TRPV1 has a role in neuroinflammation, a critical mechanism involved in neurodegeneration. Therefore, some studies have considered TRPV1 as a target for both pain treatment and neurodegenerative disorders. Thus, this review aimed to describe the TRP-dependent mechanism that can mediate pain sensation in neurodegenerative diseases and the therapeutic approach available to palliate pain and neurodegenerative symptoms throughout the regulation of these channels.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00749">MR Imaging of SCA3/MJD</a></h4>

<p>Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3/Machado–Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD) is a progressive autosomal dominantly inherited cerebellar ataxia characterized by the aggregation of polyglutamine-expanded protein within neuronal nuclei in the brain, which can lead to brain damage that precedes the onset of clinical manifestations. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques such as morphometric MRI, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) have gained increasing attention as non-invasive and quantitative methods for the assessment of structural and functional alterations in clinical SCA3/MJD patients as well as preclinical carriers. Morphometric MRI has demonstrated typical patterns of atrophy or volume loss in the cerebellum and brainstem with extensive lesions in some supratentorial areas. DTI has detected widespread microstructural alterations in brain white matter, which indicate disrupted brain anatomical connectivity. Task-related fMRI has presented unusual brain activation patterns within the cerebellum and some extracerebellar tissue, reflecting the decreased functional connectivity of these brain regions in SCA3/MJD subjects. MRS has revealed abnormal neurochemical profiles, such as the levels or ratios of N-acetyl aspartate, choline, and creatine, in both clinical cases and preclinical cases before the alterations in brain anatomical structure. Moreover, a number of studies have reported correlations of MR imaging alterations with clinical and genetic features. The utility of these MR imaging techniques can help to identify preclinical SCA3/MJD carriers, monitor disease progression, evaluate response to therapeutic interventions, and illustrate the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the occurrence, development, and prognosis of SCA3/MJD.</p>

<p>Introduction: In this study, we examined whether the self-selection of occupations of interest affects reaction times (RTs) and cognitive processing by using the Aid for Decision-making in Occupation Choice (ADOC) and event-related potentials (ERP). We also assessed the relationship of these with psychological indicators.</p><p>Method: We extracted 78 occupations from the ADOC in consideration of the subjects’ age, and three conditions were set: (1) self-selection of an interesting occupation; (2) self-selection of a disliked occupation; and (3) forced selection. The RT task was executed under their conditions during which ERP was measured. We compared the P300 component of ERP in these conditions. Moreover, we examined the association of cognitive processing and degree of satisfaction and performance concerning occupation, with psychological indicators.</p><p>Results: P300 amplitude at Fz significantly increased in the self-selection of an interesting occupation. P300 amplitude at Pz was significantly positively correlated with the occupational satisfaction score.</p><p>Conclusion: Self-selection of interesting occupations in the ADOC resulted in increased attention resource allocation by increasing motivation. Further, there was a positive correlation between satisfaction concerning the occupation and attention of resource allocation. Therefore, occupational therapists should know which occupations the patients consider interesting and help them to select by themselves, thus enhancing their satisfaction after consultation. These interventions may contribute to promoting motivation and cognitive processing.</p>

<p>Adolescence is an important ontogenetic period that is characterized by behaviors such as enhanced novelty-seeking, impulsivity, and reward preference, which can give rise to an increased risk for substance use. While substance use rates in adolescence are generally on a decline, the current rates combined with emerging trends, such as increases in e-cigarette use, remain a significant public health concern. In this review, we focus on the neurobiological divergences associated with adolescent substance use, derived from a cross-sectional, retrospective, and longitudinal studies, and highlight how the use of these substances during adolescence may relate to behavioral and neuroimaging-based outcomes. Identifying and understanding the associations between adolescent substance use and changes in cognition, mental health, and future substance use risk may assist our understanding of the consequences of drug exposure during this critical window.</p>

<p>The process of aging commonly features a gradual deterioration in cognitive performance and, in particular, the decline of memory. Despite the increased longevity of the world’s population, the prevalence of neurodegenerative conditions, such as dementia, continues to be a major burden on public health, and consequently, the latest research has been focused on memory and aging. Currently, the failure of episodic and Prospective memory (PM) is one of the main complaints in the elderly, considered among the early symptoms of dementia. It is therefore increasingly important to define more clearly the boundaries between normal and pathological aging. Recently, researchers have begun to build and apply Virtual Environments (VE) to the explicit purpose of better understanding the performance of episodic and PM in complex and realistic contexts, with the perspective of further developing effective training procedures that depend on reliable cognitive assessment methods. Virtual technology offers higher levels of realism than “pen and paper” testing and at the same time more experimental control than naturalistic settings. In this mini-review article, we examine the outcomes of recently available studies on virtual reality technology applications developed for the assessment and improvement of episodic and/or PM. To consider the latest technology, we selected 29 articles that have been published in the last 10 years. These documents show that VR-based technologies can provide a valid basis for screening and treatment and, through increased sensory stimulation and enriched environments reproducing the scenarios of everyday life, could represent effective stimulating experiences even in pathological aging.</p>

<p>Significant progress has been made toward model-based prediction of neral tissue activation in response to extracellular electrical stimulation, but challenges remain in the accurate and efficient estimation of distributed local field potentials (LFP). Analytical methods of estimating electric fields are a first-order approximation that may be suitable for model validation, but they are computationally expensive and cannot accurately capture boundary conditions in heterogeneous tissue. While there are many appropriate numerical methods of solving electric fields in neural tissue models, there isn't an established standard for mesh geometry nor a well-known rule for handling any mismatch in spatial resolution. Moreover, the challenge of misalignment between current sources and mesh nodes in a finite-element or resistor-network method volume conduction model needs to be further investigated. Therefore, using a previously published and validated multi-scale model of the hippocampus, the authors have formulated an algorithm for LFP estimation, and by extension, bidirectional communication between discretized and numerically solved volume conduction models and biologically detailed neural circuit models constructed in NEURON. Development of this algorithm required that we assess meshes of (i) unstructured tetrahedral and grid-based hexahedral geometries as well as (ii) differing approaches for managing the spatial misalignment of current sources and mesh nodes. The resulting algorithm is validated through the comparison of Admittance Method predicted evoked potentials with analytically estimated LFPs. Establishing this method is a critical step toward closed-loop integration of volume conductor and NEURON models that could lead to substantial improvement of the predictive power of multi-scale stimulation models of cortical tissue. These models may be used to deepen our understanding of hippocampal pathologies and the identification of efficacious electroceutical treatments.</p>

<p>Glioblastoma is a WHO grade IV brain tumor, which leads to poor overall survival (OS) of patients. For precise surgical and treatment planning, OS prediction of glioblastoma (GBM) patients is highly desired by clinicians and oncologists. Radiomic research attempts at predicting disease prognosis, thus providing beneficial information for personalized treatment from a variety of imaging features extracted from multiple MR images. In this study, first-order, intensity-based volume and shape-based and textural radiomic features are extracted from fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and T1ce MRI data. The region of interest is further decomposed with stationary wavelet transform with low-pass and high-pass filtering. Further, radiomic features are extracted on these decomposed images, which helped in acquiring the directional information. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge training, validation, and test datasets. The proposed approach achieved 0.695, 0.571, and 0.558 on BraTS training, validation, and test datasets. The proposed approach secured the third position in BraTS 2018 challenge for the OS prediction task.</p>

<p>One of the risk factors for schizophrenia is maternal infection. We have previously shown that Polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid (poly I:C) induced maternal immune activation in mice caused histological changes in the hippocampal CA1 area of offspring during the developmental period and impaired sensorimotor gating in offspring during adulthood, resulting in behavioral changes. However, it remains unclear how maternal immune activation functionally impacts the hippocampal neuronal activity of offspring. We studied the effect of prenatal poly I:C treatment on synaptic transmission of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells in postnatal and adult offspring. Treatment with poly I:C diminished excitatory and enhanced inhibitory (GABAergic) synaptic transmission on pyramidal cells in adult offspring. During the early developmental period, we still observed that treatment with poly I:C decreased excitatory synaptic transmission and potentially increased GABAergic synaptic transmission, which was uncovered under a condition of high extracellular potassium-activated neurons. In conclusion, we demonstrate that maternal immune activation decreased excitatory and increased inhibitory synaptic transmission on hippocampal pyramidal cells from an early developmental period to adulthood, which could result in net inhibition in conjunction with poor functional organization and integration of hippocampal circuits.</p>

<p>For a long time, post-mortem analysis of human brain pathologies has been purely descriptive, limiting insight into the pathological mechanisms. However, starting in the early 2000s, next-generation sequencing (NGS) and the routine application of bulk RNA-sequencing and microarray technologies have revolutionized the usefulness of post-mortem human brain tissue. This has allowed many studies to provide novel mechanistic insights into certain brain pathologies, albeit at a still unsatisfying resolution, with masking of lowly expressed genes and regulatory elements in different cell types. The recent rapid evolution of single-cell technologies has now allowed researchers to shed light on human pathologies at a previously unreached resolution revealing further insights into pathological mechanisms that will open the way for the development of new strategies for therapies. In this review article, we will give an overview of the incremental information that single-cell technologies have given us for human white matter (WM) pathologies, summarize which single-cell technologies are available, and speculate where these novel approaches may lead us for pathological assessment in the future.</p>

<p>The fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family polypeptides play key roles in promoting tissue regeneration and repair. FGF5 is strongly up-regulated in Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system following injury; however, a role for FGF5 in peripheral nerve regeneration has not been shown up to now. In this report, we examined the expression of FGF5 and its receptors FGFR1-4 in Schwann cells of the mouse sciatic nerve following injury, and then measured the effects of FGF5 treatment upon cultured primary rat Schwann cells. By microarray and mRNA sequencing data analysis, RT-PCR, qPCR, western blotting and immunostaining, we show that FGF5 is highly up-regulated in Schwann cells of the mouse distal sciatic nerve following injury, and FGFR1 and FGFR2 are highly expressed in Schwann cells of the peripheral nerve both before and following injury. Using cultured primary rat Schwann cells, we show that FGF5 inhibits ERK1/2 MAP kinase activity but promotes rapid Schwann cell migration and adhesion via the upregulation of N-cadherin. Thus, FGF5 is an autocrine regulator of Schwann cells to regulate Schwann cell migration and adhesion.</p>

<p>Aberrant brain insulin signaling plays a critical role in the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a role in the progression of AD, with excessive mitochondrial fission in the hippocampus being one of the pathological mechanisms of AD. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the progression of AD and mitochondrial fragmentation induced by aberrant brain insulin signaling in the hippocampal neurons are poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated the molecular mechanistic signaling associated with mitochondrial dynamics using streptozotocin (STZ), a diabetogenic compound, in the hippocampus cell line, HT-22 cells. In this metabolic dysfunctional cellular model, hallmarks of AD such as neuronal apoptosis, synaptic loss, and tau hyper-phosphorylation are induced by STZ. We found that in the mitochondrial fission protein Drp1, phosphorylation is increased in STZ-treated HT-22 cells. We also determined that inhibition of mitochondrial fragmentation suppresses STZ-induced AD-like pathology. Furthermore, we found that phosphorylation of Drp1 was induced by CDK5, and inhibition of CDK5 suppresses STZ-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and AD-like pathology. Therefore, these findings indicate that mitochondrial morphology and functional regulation may be a strategy of potential therapeutic for treating abnormal metabolic functions associated with the pathogenesis of AD.</p>

<p>Myelin is a dynamic membrane that is important for coordinating the fast propagation of action potentials along small or large caliber axons (0.1–10 μm) some of which extend the entire length of the spinal cord. Due to the heterogeneity of electrical and energy demands of the variable neuronal populations, the axo-myelinic and axo-glial interactions that regulate the biophysical properties of myelinated axons also vary in terms of molecular interactions at the membrane interfaces. An important topic of debate in neuroscience is how myelin is maintained and modified under neuronal control and how disruption of this control (due to disease or injury) can initiate and/or propagate neurodegeneration. One of the key molecular signaling cascades that have been investigated in the context of neural injury over the past two decades involves the myelin-associated inhibitory factors (MAIFs) that interact with Nogo receptor 1 (NgR1). Chief among the MAIF superfamily of molecules is a reticulon family protein, Nogo-A, that is established as a potent inhibitor of neurite sprouting and axon regeneration. However, an understated role for NgR1 is its ability to control axo-myelin interactions and Nogo-A specific ligand binding. These interactions may occur at axo-dendritic and axo-glial synapses regulating their functional and dynamic membrane domains. The current review provides a comprehensive analysis of how neuronal NgR1 can regulate myelin thickness and plasticity under normal and disease conditions. Specifically, we discuss how NgR1 plays an important role in regulating paranodal and juxtaparanodal domains through specific signal transduction cascades that are important for microdomain molecular architecture and action potential propagation. Potential therapeutics designed to target NgR1-dependent signaling during disease are being developed in animal models since interference with the involvement of the receptor may facilitate neurological recovery. Hence, the regulatory role played by NgR1 in the axo-myelinic interface is an important research field of clinical significance that requires comprehensive investigation.</p>

The current diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease, however, mainly depends on the symptoms, so it is necessary to establish a reliable imaging modality for PD diagnosis and its progression monitoring. Other studies and our previous ones demonstrated that substantia nigra hyperechogenicity (SNH) was detected by transcranial sonography (TCS) in the ventral midbrain of PD patients, and SNH is regarded as a characteristic marker of PD. The present study aimed to explore whether SNH could serve as a reliable imaging modality to monitor the progression of dopaminergic neurodegeneration of PD. The results revealed that the size of SNH was positively related with the degree of dopaminergic neuron death in PD animal models. Furthermore, we revealed that microglia activation contributed to the SNH formation in substantia nigra (SN) in PD models. Taken together, this study suggests that SNH through TCS is a promising imaging modality to monitor the progression of dopaminergic neurodegeneration of PD.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that there is a critical window for estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) in postmenopausal women with Alzheimer’s disease (AD); however, supporting evidence is lacking. To address this issue, we investigated the effective period for estradiol (E2) treatment using a mouse model of AD. Four-month-old female APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice were ovariectomized (OVX) and treated with E2 for 2 months starting at the age of 4 months (early period), 6 months (mid-period), or 8 months (late period). We then evaluated hippocampal neurogenesis, β-amyloid (Aβ) accumulation, telomerase activity, and hippocampal-dependent behavior. Compared to age-matched wild type mice, APP/PS1 mice with intact ovaries showed increased proliferation of hippocampal neural stem cells (NSCs) at 8 months of age and decreased proliferation of NSCs at 10 months of age; meanwhile, Aβ accumulation progressively increased with age, paralleling the reduced survival of immature neurons. OVX-induced depletion of E2 in APP/PS1 mice resulted in elevated Aβ levels accompanied by elevated p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75<sup>NTR</sup>) expression and increased NSC proliferation at 6 months of age, which subsequently declined; accelerated reduction of immature neurons starting from 6 months of age, and reduced telomerase activity and worsened memory performance at 10 months of age. Treatment with E2 in the early period post-OVX, rather than in the mid or late period, abrogated these effects, and p75<sup>NTR</sup> inhibition reduced the overproliferation of NSCs in 6-month-old OVX-APP/PS1 mice. Thus, E2 deficiency in young APP/PS1 mice exacerbates cognitive deficits and depletes the hippocampal NSC pool in later life; this can be alleviated by E2 treatment in the early period following OVX, which prevents Aβ/p75<sup>NTR</sup>-induced NSC overproliferation and preserves telomerase activity.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by senile plaques (SPs), which are caused by amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) of abnormal hyperphosphorylated tau protein. The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) binds to advanced glycation end products deposited during vascular dysfunction. Alzheimer’s disease may occur when RAGE binds to Aβ and releases reactive oxygen species, further exacerbating Aβ deposition and eventually leading to SPs and NFTs. As it is involved in early AD, RAGE may be considered as a more potent biomarker than Aβ. Positron emission tomography provides valuable information regarding the underlying pathological processes of AD many years before the appearance of clinical symptoms. Thus, to further reveal the role of RAGE in AD pathology and for early diagnosis of AD, a tracer that targets RAGE is needed. In this review, we first describe the early diagnosis of AD and then summarize the interaction between RAGE and Aβ and Tau that is required to induce AD pathology, and finally focus on RAGE-targeting probes, highlighting the potential of RAGE to be used as an effective target. The development of RAGE probes is expected to aid in AD diagnosis and treatment.</p>

<p>by Gabriel Koch Ocker, Michael A. Buice</p>

Neural computation is determined by neurons’ dynamics and circuit connectivity. Uncertain and dynamic environments may require neural hardware to adapt to different computational tasks, each requiring different connectivity configurations. At the same time, connectivity is subject to a variety of constraints, placing limits on the possible computations a given neural circuit can perform. Here we examine the hypothesis that the organization of neural circuitry favors computational flexibility: that it makes many computational solutions available, given physiological constraints. From this hypothesis, we develop models of connectivity degree distributions based on constraints on a neuron’s total synaptic weight. To test these models, we examine reconstructions of the mushroom bodies from the first instar larva and adult <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. We perform a Bayesian model comparison for two constraint models and a random wiring null model. Overall, we find that flexibility under a homeostatically fixed total synaptic weight describes Kenyon cell connectivity better than other models, suggesting a principle shaping the apparently random structure of Kenyon cell wiring. Furthermore, we find evidence that larval Kenyon cells are more flexible earlier in development, suggesting a mechanism whereby neural circuits begin as flexible systems that develop into specialized computational circuits.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OhEIj0eIIGQ" width="1" />

<p>by Giorgos Minas, Dan J. Woodcock, Louise Ashall, Claire V. Harper, Michael R. H. White, David A. Rand</p>

We consider how a signalling system can act as an information hub by multiplexing information arising from multiple signals. We formally define multiplexing, mathematically characterise which systems can multiplex and how well they can do it. While the results of this paper are theoretical, to motivate the idea of multiplexing, we provide experimental evidence that tentatively suggests that the NF-<i>κ</i>B transcription factor can multiplex information about changes in multiple signals. We believe that our theoretical results may resolve the apparent paradox of how a system like NF-<i>κ</i>B that regulates cell fate and inflammatory signalling in response to diverse stimuli can appear to have the low information carrying capacity suggested by recent studies on scalar signals. In carrying out our study, we introduce new methods for the analysis of large, nonlinear stochastic dynamic models, and develop computational algorithms that facilitate the calculation of fundamental constructs of information theory such as Kullback–Leibler divergences and sensitivity matrices, and link these methods to new theory about multiplexing information. We show that many current models such as those of the NF-<i>κ</i>B system cannot multiplex effectively and provide models that overcome this limitation using post-transcriptional modifications.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9MxzVqLUduA" width="1" />

<p>by Sara Hamis, Mohammad Kohandel, Ludwig J. Dubois, Ala Yaromina, Philippe Lambin, Gibin G. Powathil</p>

Hypoxia-activated prodrugs (HAPs) present a conceptually elegant approach to not only overcome, but better yet, exploit intra-tumoural hypoxia. Despite being successful <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, HAPs are yet to achieve successful results in clinical settings. It has been hypothesised that this lack of clinical success can, in part, be explained by the insufficiently stringent clinical screening selection of determining which tumours are suitable for HAP treatments. Taking a mathematical modelling approach, we investigate how tumour properties and HAP-radiation scheduling influence treatment outcomes in simulated tumours. The following key results are demonstrated <i>in silico</i>: <i>(i)</i> HAP and ionising radiation (IR) monotherapies may attack tumours in dissimilar, and complementary, ways. <i>(ii)</i> HAP-IR scheduling may impact treatment efficacy. <i>(iii)</i> HAPs may function as IR treatment intensifiers. <i>(iv)</i> The spatio-temporal intra-tumoural oxygen landscape may impact HAP efficacy.

<p>by Andy Hoyle, David Cairns, Iona Paterson, Stuart McMillan, Gabriela Ochoa, Andrew P. Desbois</p>

Mass production and use of antibiotics has led to the rise of resistant bacteria, a problem possibly exacerbated by inappropriate and non-optimal application. Antibiotic treatment often follows <i>fixed-dose</i> regimens, with a standard dose of antibiotic administered equally spaced in time. But are such fixed-dose regimens optimal or can alternative regimens be designed to increase efficacy? Yet, few mathematical models have aimed to identify optimal treatments based on biological data of infections inside a living host. In addition, assumptions to make the mathematical models analytically tractable limit the search space of possible treatment regimens (e.g. to fixed-dose treatments). Here, we aimed to address these limitations by using experiments in a <i>Galleria mellonella</i> (insect) model of bacterial infection, to create a fully parametrised mathematical model of a systemic <i>Vibrio</i> infection. We successfully validated this model with biological experiments, including treatments unseen by the mathematical model. Then, by applying artificial intelligence, this model was used to determine optimal antibiotic dosage regimens to treat the host to maximise survival while minimising total antibiotic used. As expected, host survival increased as total quantity of antibiotic applied during the course of treatment increased. However, many of the optimal regimens tended to follow a large initial ‘loading’ dose followed by doses of incremental reductions in antibiotic quantity (dose ‘tapering’). Moreover, application of the entire antibiotic in a single dose at the start of treatment was never optimal, except when the total quantity of antibiotic was very low. Importantly, the range of optimal regimens identified was broad enough to allow the antibiotic prescriber to choose a regimen based on additional criteria or preferences. Our findings demonstrate the utility of an insect host to model antibiotic therapies <i>in vivo</i> and the approach lays a foundation for future regimen optimisation for patient and societal benefits.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/n6KNpSUkA4E" width="1" />

Many large-scale functional connectivity studies have emphasized the importance of communication through increased inter-region correlations during task states. In contrast, local circuit studies have demonstrated that task states primarily reduce correlations among pairs of neurons, likely enhancing their information coding by suppressing shared spontaneous activity. Here we sought to adjudicate between these conflicting perspectives, assessing whether co-active brain regions during task states tend to increase or decrease their correlations. We found that variability and correlations primarily decrease across a variety of cortical regions in two highly distinct data sets: non-human primate spiking data and human functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Moreover, this observed variability and correlation reduction was accompanied by an overall increase in dimensionality (reflecting less information redundancy) during task states, suggesting that decreased correlations increased information coding capacity. We further found in both spiking and neural mass computational models that task-evoked activity increased the stability around a stable attractor, globally quenching neural variability and correlations. Together, our results provide an integrative mechanistic account that encompasses measures of large-scale neural activity, variability, and correlations during resting and task states.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5-P3CCpUKEk" width="1" />

<p>by K. L. Nikhil, Sandra Korge, Achim Kramer</p>

A ubiquitous feature of the circadian clock across life forms is its organization as a network of cellular oscillators, with individual cellular oscillators within the network often exhibiting considerable heterogeneity in their intrinsic periods. The interaction of coupling and heterogeneity in circadian clock networks is hypothesized to influence clock’s entrainability, but our knowledge of mechanisms governing period heterogeneity within circadian clock networks remains largely elusive. In this study, we aimed to explore the principles that underlie intercellular period variation in circadian clock networks (clonal period heterogeneity). To this end, we employed a laboratory selection approach and derived a panel of 25 clonal cell populations exhibiting circadian periods ranging from 22 to 28 h. We report that a single parent clone can produce progeny clones with a wide distribution of circadian periods, and this heterogeneity, in addition to being stochastically driven, has a heritable component. By quantifying the expression of 20 circadian clock and clock-associated genes across our clone panel, we found that inheritance of expression patterns in at least three clock genes might govern clonal period heterogeneity in circadian clock networks. Furthermore, we provide evidence suggesting that heritable epigenetic variation in gene expression regulation might underlie period heterogeneity.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/nO7_HYsM5lM" width="1" />

The Scar/WAVE complex is the principal catalyst of pseudopod and lamellipod formation. Here we show that Scar/WAVE’s proline-rich domain is polyphosphorylated after the complex is activated. Blocking Scar/WAVE activation stops phosphorylation in both <i>Dictyostelium</i> and mammalian cells, implying that phosphorylation modulates pseudopods after they have been formed, rather than controlling whether they are initiated. Unexpectedly, phosphorylation is not promoted by chemotactic signaling but is greatly stimulated by cell:substrate adhesion and diminished when cells deadhere. Phosphorylation-deficient or phosphomimetic Scar/WAVE mutants are both normally functional and rescue the phenotype of knockout cells, demonstrating that phosphorylation is dispensable for activation and actin regulation. However, pseudopods and patches of phosphorylation-deficient Scar/WAVE last substantially longer in mutants, altering the dynamics and size of pseudopods and lamellipods and thus changing migration speed. Scar/WAVE phosphorylation does not require ERK2 in <i>Dictyostelium</i> or mammalian cells. However, the MAPKKK homologue SepA contributes substantially—<i>sep</i>A mutants have less steady-state phosphorylation, which does not increase in response to adhesion. The mutants also behave similarly to cells expressing phosphorylation-deficient Scar, with longer-lived pseudopods and patches of Scar recruitment. We conclude that pseudopod engagement with substratum is more important than extracellular signals at regulating Scar/WAVE’s activity and that phosphorylation acts as a pseudopod timer by promoting Scar/WAVE turnover.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Z8MkWjL8crs" width="1" />

<p>by I-Ting Lin, Meng-Chao Yao</p>

Recognition of self and nonself is important for outcrossing organisms, and different mating types establish the barrier against self-mating. In the unicellular ciliate <i>T</i>. <i>thermophila</i>, mating type determination requires complex DNA rearrangements at a single <i>mat</i> locus during conjugation to produce a type-specific gene pair (<i>MTA</i> and <i>MTB</i>) for 1 of 7 possible mating types. Surprisingly, we found that decreased expression of the DNA breakage-repair protein Ku80 at late stages of conjugation generated persistent selfing phenotype in the progeny. DNA analysis revealed multiple mating-type gene pairs as well as a variety of mis-paired, unusually arranged mating-type genes in these selfers that resemble some proposed rearrangement intermediates. They are found also in normal cells during conjugation and are lost after 10 fissions but are retained in Ku mutants. Silencing of <i>TKU80</i> or <i>TKU70-2</i> immediately after conjugation also generated selfing phenotype, revealing a hidden DNA rearrangement process beyond conjugation. Mating reactions between the mutant and normal cells suggest a 2-component system for self–nonself-recognition through <i>MTA</i> and <i>MTB</i> genes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/O3TPN2fSdms" width="1" />

Sleep is vital for survival. Yet under environmentally challenging conditions, such as starvation, animals suppress their need for sleep. Interestingly, starvation-induced sleep loss does not evoke a subsequent sleep rebound. Little is known about how starvation-induced sleep deprivation differs from other types of sleep loss, or why some sleep functions become dispensable during starvation. Here, we demonstrate that down-regulation of the secreted cytokine unpaired 2 (<i>upd2</i>) in <i>Drosophila</i> flies may mimic a starved-like state. We used a genetic knockdown strategy to investigate the consequences of <i>upd2</i> on visual attention and sleep in otherwise well-fed flies, thereby sidestepping the negative side effects of undernourishment. We find that knockdown of <i>upd2</i> in the fat body (FB) is sufficient to suppress sleep and promote feeding-related behaviors while also improving selective visual attention. Furthermore, we show that this peripheral signal is integrated in the fly brain via insulin-expressing cells. Together, these findings identify a role for peripheral tissue-to-brain interactions in the simultaneous regulation of sleep quality and attention, to potentially promote adaptive behaviors necessary for survival in hungry animals.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/vW68mrDTUfg" width="1" />

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Insula epilepsy is rare and can be evaluated effectively by Stereotactic intracerebral EEG (SEEG). Many previous studies of insulo‐opercular seizures have been unable to separate insular and opercular onset. With adequate sampling of the insula, this study shows this is possible.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed intrainsular dynamics and extrainsular propagation in 12 patients with “pure” insula epilepsy (n = 9) or insular and only deepest opercular involvement (n = 3) at seizure onset. Review of semiology defined clinical groups, agglomerative cluster, and principal component analysis of semiological features were performed. Quantitative epileptogenicity, and intrainsular and extrainsular propagation were computed via time frequency analysis and epileptogenicity mapping.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Seizure onset patterns were heterogeneous; the seizure onset zone was focal. Seizure onset and first ictal change within insula functional subdivision correlated with aura and reflex component. No paninsular spread occurred; contralateral insular spread was very early. While the discharge was intrainsular, clinical signs related to aura or vegetative signs. Extrainsular propagation was early and related to the emergence of the majority of clinical signs. Cluster analysis found an anterior, intermediate, and posterior insula seizure onset group. The largest principal component separated anterior insula manifestations, including early hypermotor signs, early recovery, and no aura from posterior insula features of early dystonia, early tonic motor features, and sensorimotor aura.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Aura is vital to identifying seizure onset and relates to insula functional subdivision. Seizures are heterogenous; extrainsular propagation occurs early, accounting for most of the semiology. With adequate sampling, "pure" insula epilepsy can be identified and focal curative resection is possible. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Early discrimination of patients with ischemic stroke (IS) from stroke mimics (SM) poses a diagnostic challenge. The circulating metabolome might reflect pathophysiological events related to acute IS. Here, we investigated the utility of early metabolic changes for differentiating IS from SM.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed untargeted metabolomics on serum samples obtained from patients with IS (N=508) and SM (N=349; defined by absence of a DWI positive lesion on MRI) who presented to hospital within 24 hours after symptom onset (median time from symptom onset to blood sampling= 3.3h; IQR: 1.6‐6.7h) and from neurologically normal controls (NC, N=112). We compared diagnostic groups in a discovery‐validation approach by applying multivariable linear regression models, machine learning techniques, and propensity score matching. We further performed a targeted look‐up of published metabolite sets.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Levels of forty‐one metabolites were significantly associated with IS compared to NC. The top metabolites showing the highest value in separating IS from SM were asymmetrical and symmetrical dimethylarginine, pregnenolone sulfate, and adenosine. Together, these four metabolites differentiated patients with IS from SM with an AUC of 0.90 in the replication sample, which was superior to multimodal cranial computed tomography (AUC=0.80) obtained for routine diagnostics. They were further superior to previously published metabolite sets detected in our samples. All four metabolites returned to control levels by day 90.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>A set of four metabolites with known biological effects relevant to stroke pathophysiology shows unprecedented utility to identify patients with IS upon hospital arrival thus encouraging further investigation including multicenter studies.</p>

<p>Sex steroid hormones such as 17β‐estradiol (estradiol) regulate neuronal function by binding to estrogen receptors (ERs), including ERα and GPER1, and through differential production via the enzyme aromatase. ERs and aromatase are expressed across the nervous system, including in the striatal brain regions. These regions, comprising the nucleus accumbens core, shell, and caudate–putamen, are instrumental for a wide‐range of functions and disorders that show sex differences in phenotype and/or incidence. Sex‐specific estrogen action is an integral component for generating these sex differences. A distinctive feature of the striatal regions is that in adulthood neurons exclusively express membrane but not nuclear ERs. This long‐standing finding dominates models of estrogen action in striatal regions. However, the developmental etiology of ER and aromatase cellular expression in female and male striatum is unknown. This omission in knowledge is important to address, as developmental stage influences cellular estrogenic mechanisms. Thus, ERα, GPER1, and aromatase cellular immunoreactivity was assessed in perinatal, prepubertal, and adult female and male rats. We tested the hypothesis that ERα, GPER1, and aromatase exhibits sex, region, and age‐specific differences, including nuclear expression. ERα exhibits nuclear expression in all three striatal regions before adulthood and disappears in a region‐ and sex‐specific time‐course. Cellular GPER1 expression decreases during development in a region‐ but not sex‐specific time‐course, resulting in extranuclear expression by adulthood. Somatic aromatase expression presents at prepuberty and increases by adulthood in a region‐ but not sex‐specific time‐course. These data indicate that developmental period exerts critical sex‐specific influences on striatal cellular estrogenic mechanisms.</p>

<p>Neurons of the dorsomedial division of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTdm) project onto hypothalamic nuclei including the paraventricular (PVH), dorsomedial (DMH), arcuate (ARH) nuclei and the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA).

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>As stressful environment is a potent modulator of feeding, we seek in the present work to decipher the neuroanatomical basis for an interplay between stress and feeding behaviors. For this, we combined anterograde and retrograde tracing with immunohistochemical approaches to investigate the patterns of projections between the dorsomedial division of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), well connected to the amygdala, and hypothalamic structures such as the paraventricular (PVH) and dorsomedial (DMH), the arcuate (ARH) nuclei and the lateral hypothalamic areas (LHA) known to control feeding and motivated behaviors. We particularly focused our study on afferences to proopiomelanocortin (POMC), agouti‐related peptide (AgRP), melanin‐concentrating‐hormone (MCH) and orexin (ORX) neurons characteristics of the ARH and the LHA, respectively. We found light to intense innervation of all these hypothalamic nuclei. We particularly showed an innervation of POMC, AgRP, MCH and ORX neurons by the dorsomedial and dorsolateral divisions of the BNST. Therefore, these results lay the foundation for a better understanding of the neuroanatomical basis of the stress‐related feeding behaviors.</p>

<p>Light sheet microcopy is used to map frequency along the basilar membrane within intact cochleae, retaining spatial orientation and relationships with internal and external structural landmarks. Three‐dimensional measures of how frequency domains relate to one another gives insight into how the geometric organization of the cochlea may influence its physiology.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) provides a rapid and complete three‐dimensional image of the cochlea. The method retains anatomical relationships—on a micrometer scale—between internal structures such as hair cells, basilar membrane (BM), and modiolus with external surface structures such as the round and oval windows. Immunolabeled hair cells were used to visualize the spiraling BM in the intact cochlea without time intensive dissections or additional histological processing; yet material prepared for LSFM could be rehydrated, the BM dissected out and reimaged at higher resolution with the confocal microscope. In immersion‐fixed material, details of the cochlear vasculature were seen throughout the cochlea. Hair cell counts (both inner and outer) as well as frequency maps of the BM were comparable to those obtained by other methods, but with the added dimension of depth. The material provided measures of angular, linear, and vector distance between characteristic frequency regions along the BM. Thus, LSFM provides a unique ability to rapidly image the entire cochlea in a manner applicable to model and interpret physiological results. Furthermore, the three‐dimensional organization of the cochlea can be studied at the organ and cellular level with LSFM, and this same material can be taken to the confocal microscope for detailed analysis at the subcellular level.</p>

<p>Adaptation is an important mechanism that causes a decrease in the neural response both in terms of local field potentials (LFP) and spiking activity. We previously showed this reduction effect in the tuning curve of the primary auditory cortex. Moreover, we revealed that a repeated stimulus reduces the neural response in terms of spike-phase coupling (SPC). In the current study, we examined the effect of adaptation on the SPC tuning curve. To this end, employing the phase-locking value (PLV) method, we estimated the spike-LFP coupling. The data was obtained by a simultaneous recording from four single-electrodes in the primary auditory cortex of 15 rats. We first investigated whether the neural system may use spike-LFP phase coupling in the primary auditory cortex to encode sensory information. Secondly, we investigated the effect of adaptation on this potential SPC tuning. Our data showed that the coupling between spikes’ times and the LFP phase in beta oscillations represents sensory information (different stimulus frequencies), with an inverted bell-shaped tuning curve. Furthermore, we showed that adaptation to a specific frequency modulates SPC tuning curve of the adapter and its neighboring frequencies. These findings could be useful for interpretation of feature representation in terms of SPC and the underlying neural mechanism of adaptation.</p>

<p>Novel therapeutic approaches for treating inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs) prompt a need to understand which patients with impaired vision have the anatomical potential to gain from participation in a clinical trial. We used supervised machine learning to predict foveal function from foveal structure in blue cone monochromacy (BCM), an X-linked congenital cone photoreceptor dysfunction secondary to mutations in the OPN1LW/OPN1MW gene cluster. BCM patients with either disease-associated large deletion or missense mutations were studied and results compared with those from subjects with other forms of IRD and various degrees of preserved central structure and function. A machine learning technique was used to associate foveal sensitivities and best-corrected visual acuities to foveal structure in IRD patients. Two random forest (RF) models trained on IRD data were applied to predict foveal function in BCM. A curve fitting method was also used and results compared with those of the RF models. The BCM and IRD patients had a comparable range of foveal structure. IRD patients had peak sensitivity at the fovea. Machine learning could successfully predict foveal sensitivity (FS) results from segmented or un-segmented optical coherence tomography (OCT) input. Application of machine learning predictions to BCM at the fovea showed differences between predicted and measured sensitivities, thereby defining treatment potential. The curve fitting method provided similar results. Given a measure of visual acuity (VA) and foveal outer nuclear layer thickness, the question of how many lines of acuity would represent the best efficacious result for each BCM patient could be answered. We propose that foveal vision improvement potential in BCM is predictable from retinal structure using machine learning and curve fitting approaches. This should allow estimates of maximal efficacy in patients being considered for clinical trials and also guide decisions about dosing.</p>

<p>Background: Neuronal apoptosis involved in secondary injury following traumatic brain injury (TBI) significantly contributes to the poor outcomes of patients with TBI. The tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) can selectively induce apoptosis of tumor cells. Hypoxia factor (HIF) 1α is a controversial factor that mediates the neuronal apoptotic pathway. Herein, we hypothesize that HIF-1α may mediate the TRAIL-induced neuronal apoptosis after TBI.</p><p>Methods: We used Western blots and immunofluorescence to study the expression and cell localization of TRAIL and death receptor 5 (DR5) after TBI in rats. Soluble DR5 (sDR5) administration was used to block the TRAIL-induced neuronal death and neural deficits. HIF-1α inhibitor 2ME and agonist DMOG were used to study the role of HIF-1α in TRAIL-induced neuronal death. Meanwhile, HIF-1α siRNA was used to investigate the role of HIF-1α in TRAIL-induced neuronal death in vitro.</p><p>Results: The expressions of microglia-located TRAIL and neuron-located DR5 were significantly upregulated after TBI. sDR5 significantly attenuated TRAIL-induced neuronal apoptosis and neurological deficits. 2ME decreased neuronal apoptosis, lesion area, and brain edema and improved neurological function via increased expression of TRAIL decoy receptor 1 (DcR1), which inhibited TRAIL-induced apoptosis after TBI. The administration of DMOG produced the opposite effect than did 2ME. Similarly, HIF-1α siRNA attenuated TRAIL-induced neuronal death via increased DcR1 expression in vitro.</p><p>Conclusion: Our findings suggested that the TRAIL/DR5 signaling pathway plays an important role after neuronal apoptosis after TBI. HIF-1α mediates TRAIL-induced neuronal apoptosis by regulating DcR1 expression following TBI.</p>

Biological agents adapt behavior to support the survival needs of the individual and the species. In this review we outline the anatomical, physiological, and computational processes that support reinforcement learning (RL). We describe two circuits in the primate brain that are linked to specific aspects of learning and goal-directed behavior. The ventral circuit, that includes the amygdala, ventral medial prefrontal cortex, and ventral striatum, has substantial connectivity with the hypothalamus.

<p>Ultrasonic neuromodulation of peripheral nerve cells.</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Satisfactory treatment of peripheral nerve injury (PNI) faces difficulties owing to the intrinsic biological barriers in larger injuries and invasive surgical interventions. Injury gaps &gt;3 cm have low chances of full motor and sensory recovery, and the unmet need for PNI repair techniques which increase the likelihood of functional recovery while limiting invasiveness motivate this work. Building upon prior work in ultrasound stimulation (US) of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, the effects of US on DRG neuron and Schwann cell (SC) cocultures were investigated to uncover the role of SCs in mediating the neuronal response to US <i>in vitro </i>. Acoustic intensity‐dependent alteration in selected neuromorphometrics of DRG neurons in coculture with SCs was observed in total outgrowth, primary neurites, and length compared to previously reported DRG monoculture in a calcium‐independent manner. SC viability and proliferation were not impacted by US. Conditioned medium studies suggest secreted factors from SCs subjected to US impact DRG neuron morphology. These findings advance the current understanding of mechanisms by which these cell types respond to US, which may lead to new noninvasive US therapies for treating PNI.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We conducted a multi‐site, randomized, double‐blinded controlled trial to examine the effectiveness of a digital health intervention targeting the intrinsic regulation of goal‐directed alertness in patients with chronic hemispatial neglect.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Forty‐nine participants with hemispatial neglect that demonstrated significant spatially biased attention following acquired brain injury were randomly assigned to the experimental attention remediation treatment or active control group. The participants engaged with the remotely administered interventions for twelve weeks. The primary outcome was spatial bias on the Posner cueing task (response time difference: left – right target trials). Secondary outcomes included functional abilities (measured via the Catherine Bergego scale and Barthel index), spatial cognition, executive function, quality of life and sleep. Assessments were conducted prior to and immediately following participation in the experimental intervention or control condition, and again after a three‐month no contact period.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared with the active control group, the intervention group exhibited a significant improvement in the primary outcome—a reduction in spatially biased attention on the Posner cueing task (p=0.010, Cohen’s d=0.96)—as well as significant improvements in functional abilities as measured on the Catherine Bergego and Barthel indices (p=0.027, Cohen’s d=0.24).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results demonstrate that our attention training program was effective in improving the debilitating attention deficits common to hemispatial neglect. This benefit generalized to improvements in real‐world functional abilities. This safe, highly scalable and self‐administered treatment for hemispatial neglect may serve as a useful addition to the existing standard of care.</p>

<p>Anti‐IgLON5 disease is a neurological disorder characterized by autoantibodies against IgLON5 and pathological evidence of neuronal‐specific tau accumulation. Here we report that patients' IgLON5 IgG, but not other cell‐surface antibodies, disrupt the cytoskeletal organization in cultured rat hippocampal neurons resulting in dystrophic neurites and axonal swelling. Adsorption of IgLON5 IgG with HEK293 cells expressing IgLON5 abrogated the indicated cytoskeletal changes. These findings along an increase of levels of neurofilaments in patients' CSF suggest that IgLON5 IgG, unlike other cell‐surface antibodies, disrupt neuronal cytoskeleton maintenance providing a link between autoimmunity and neurodegeneration.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Millions suffer a traumatic brain injury (TBI) each year wherein the outcomes associated with injury can vary greatly between individuals. This study postulates that variations in each biomechanical parameter of a head trauma lead to differences in histological and behavioral outcome measures that should be considered collectively in assessing injury. While trauma severity typically scales with the magnitude of injury, much less is known about the effects of rate and duration of the mechanical insult. In this study, a newly developed voice‐coil fluid percussion injury system was used to investigate the effects of injury rate and fluid percussion impulse on a collection of post‐injury outcomes in male rats. Collectively the data suggest a potential shift in the specificity and progression of neuronal injury and function rather than a general scaling of injury severity. While a faster, shorter fluid percussion first presents as a mild TBI, neuronal loss and some behavioral tasks were similar among the slower and faster fluid percussion injuries. This study concludes that the sequelae of neuronal degeneration and behavioral outcomes are related to the complete temporal profile of the fluid percussion and do not scale only with peak pressure.</p>

<p>Insulin deficiency, rather than insulin resistance, induces AD‐like features in wild type and transgenic mice carrying amyloid β and tau genes. Treatment with Exendin‐4 ameliorates these features in an intervention paradigm when deficits were already present, reflecting the more likely scenario when patients will consult.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Epidemiological studies have pointed at diabetes as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and this has been supported by several studies in animal models of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. However, side‐by‐side comparison of the two types of diabetes is limited. We investigated the role of insulin deficiency and insulin resistance in the development of memory impairments and the effect of Exendin‐4 (Ex4) treatment in a mouse model of AD. Three–4‐month‐old female wild type (WT) mice and mice overexpressing human tau and amyloid precursor protein (TAPP) were injected with streptozotocin (STZ) or fed a high‐fat diet (HFD). A second study was performed in TAPP‐STZ mice treated with Ex4, a long‐lasting analog of GLP‐1. Plasma and brain were collected at study termination for ELISA, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry analysis. Learning and memory deficits were impaired in TAPP transgenic mice compared with WT mice at the end of the study. Deficits were exaggerated by insulin deficiency in TAPP mice but 12 weeks of insulin resistance did not affect memory performances in either WT or TAPP mice. Levels of phosphorylated tau were increased in the brain of WT‐STZ and TAPP‐STZ mice but not in the brain of WT or TAPP mice on HFD. In the TAPP‐STZ mice, treatment with Ex4 initiated after established cognitive deficits ameliorated learning, but not memory, impairments. This was accompanied by the reduction of amyloid β and phosphorylated tau expression. Theses studies support the role of Ex4 in AD, independently from its actions on diabetes.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To explore the role of alpha‐synuclein (αSyn) oligomers and neurofilament light chain (NFL) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as markers of early multiple system atrophy (MSA) and to contrast findings with Lewy body synucleinopathies.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In a discovery cohort of well‐characterized early MSA patients (n = 24) and matched healthy controls (CON, n = 14), we utilized enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay to measure NFL and protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) to detect αSyn oligomers in CSF. We confirmed findings in a separate prospectively enrolled cohort of patients with early MSA (n = 38), Parkinson disease (PD, n = 16), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB, n = 13), and CON subjects (n = 15).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the discovery cohort, NFL was markedly elevated in MSA patients, with perfect separation from CON. αSyn‐PMCA was nonreactive in all CON, whereas all MSA samples were positive. In the confirmatory cohort, NFL again perfectly separated MSA from CON, and was significantly lower in PD and DLB compared to MSA. PMCA was again nonreactive in all CON, and positive in all but 2 MSA cases. All PD and all but 2 DLB samples were also positive for αSyn aggregates but with markedly different reaction kinetics from MSA; aggregation occurred later, but maximum fluorescence was higher, allowing for perfect separation of reactive samples between MSA and Lewy body synucleinopathies.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>NFL and αSyn oligomers in CSF faithfully differentiate early MSA not only from CON but also from Lewy body synucleinopathies. The findings support the role of these markers as diagnostic biomarkers, and have important implications for understanding pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the synucleinopathies.

<p>Design‐based stereological methods allow the estimation of basic morphological parameters in representative samples of the sectioned central nervous system. Point probes can be used to estimate volume (illustrated for the Area Fraction Fractionator), line probes can be used to estimate surface area (illustrated for a vertical sections design), area probes can be used to estimate length (illustrated for the Spaceball probe), and volume probes must be used to estimate number (illustrated for the Disector). This review provides an introduction to how these methods solve problems associated with other quantitative approaches, how they are applied to histological material, how a sampling scheme can be designed and evaluated, and which practical problems need to be solved to generate the numbers that we will need to come to an understanding of central nervous system function.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Generating numbers has become an almost inevitable task associated with studies of the morphology of the nervous system. Numbers serve a desire for clarity and objectivity in the presentation of results and are a prerequisite for the statistical evaluation of experimental outcomes. Clarity, objectivity, and statistics make demands on the quality of the numbers that are not met by many methods. This review provides a refresher of problems associated with generating numbers that describe the nervous system in terms of the volumes, surfaces, lengths, and numbers of its components. An important aim is to provide comprehensible descriptions of the methods that address these problems. Collectively known as design‐based stereology, these methods share two features critical to their application. First, they are firmly based in mathematics and its proofs. Second and critically underemphasized, an understanding of their mathematical background is not necessary for their informed and productive application. Understanding and applying estimators of volume, surface, length or number does not require more of an organizational mastermind than an immunohistochemical protocol. And when it comes to calculations, square roots are the gravest challenges to overcome. Sampling strategies that are combined with stereological probes are efficient and allow a rational assessment if the numbers that have been generated are “good enough.” Much may be unfamiliar, but very little is difficult. These methods can no longer be scapegoats for discrepant results but faithfully produce numbers on the material that is assessed. They also faithfully reflect problems that associated with the histological material and the anatomically informed decisions needed to generate numbers that are not only valid in theory. It is within reach to generate practically useful numbers that must integrate with qualitative knowledge to understand the function of neural systems.</p>

<p>Herculano‐Houzel et al. examine numbers of neurons in the brain of 13 bat species and find that the apparently “enlarged” cerebellum of small echolocating bats has the same proportion of brain neurons as other mammals, and is more likely simply the result of a diminutive cerebral cortex.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Small echolocating bats are set apart from most other mammals by their relatively large cerebellum, a feature that has been associated to echolocation, as it is presumed to indicate a relatively enlarged number of neurons in the cerebellum in comparison to other brain structures. Here we quantify the neuronal composition of the cerebral cortex, cerebellum and remaining brain structures of seven species of large Pteropodid bats (formerly classified as megachiropterans), one of which echolocates, and six species of small bats (formerly classified as microchiropterans), all of which echolocate. This chiropteran data is compared to 60 mammalian species in our dataset to determine whether the relatively large cerebellum of the small echolocating bats, and possibly that of the echolocating Pteropodid, contains a relatively enlarged number of neurons. We find no evidence that the distribution of neurons differs between microchiropterans and megachiropterans, but our data indicate that microchiropterans, like the smallest shrew in our dataset, have diminutive cerebral cortices, which makes the cerebellum appear relatively large. We propose that, in agreement with the diminutive brain size of the earliest fossil mammals, this is a plesiomorphic, not a derived, feature of microchiropteran brains. The results of this study also reveal important neural characteristics related to the phylogenetic affinities and relationships of the chiropterans.</p>

<p>Ocular dominance plasticity (ODP) is a type of cortical plasticity operating in visual cortex of mammals that are endowed with binocular vision based on the competition‐driven disparity.</p>
<p>Earlier, a molecular mechanism was proposed that catecholamines play an important role in the maintenance of ODP in kittens. Having survived the initial test, the hypothesis was further advanced to identify noradrenaline (NA) as a key factor that regulates ODP in the immature cortex. Later, the ODP‐promoting effect of NA is extended to the adult with age‐related limitations. Following the enhanced NA availability, the chain events downstream lead to the β‐adrenoreceptor‐induced cAMP accumulation, which in turn activates the protein kinase A. Eventually, the protein kinase translocates to the cell nucleus to activate cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB). CREB is a cellular transcription factor that controls the transcription of various genes, underpinning neuronal plasticity and long‐term memory.</p>
<p>In the advent of molecular genetics in that various types of new tools have become available with relative ease, ODP research has lightly adopted in the rodent model the original concepts and methodologies. Here, after briefly tracing the strategic maturation of our quest, the review moves to the later development of the field, with the emphasis placed around the following issues: 1) Are we testing ODP <i>per s </i>e? 2) What does monocular deprivation deprive of the immature cortex? 3) The critical importance of binocular competition, 4) What is the adult plasticity? 5) Excitation‐Inhibition balance in local circuits, and 6) Species differences in the animal models.</p>

High levels of heterozygosity present a unique genome assembly challenge and can adversely impact downstream analyses, yet is common in sequencing datasets obtained from non-model organisms. Here we show that by re-assembling a heterozygous dataset with variant parameters and different assembly algorithms, we are able to generate assemblies whose protein annotations are statistically enriched for specific gene ontology categories. While total assembly length was not significantly affected by assembly methodologies tested, the assemblies generated varied widely in fragmentation level and we show local assembly collapse or expansion underlying the enrichment or depletion of specific protein functional groups. We show that these statistically significant deviations in gene ontology groups can occur in seemingly high-quality assemblies, and result from difficult-to-detect local sequence expansion or contractions. Given the unpredictable interplay between assembly algorithm, parameter, and biological sequence data heterozygosity, we highlight the need for better measures of assembly quality than N50 value, including methods for assessing local expansion and collapse.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UOVWOmeRqLQ" width="1" />

<p>by Samy Castro, Wael El-Deredy, Demian Battaglia, Patricio Orio</p>

The capability of cortical regions to flexibly sustain an “ignited” state of activity has been discussed in relation to conscious perception or hierarchical information processing. Here, we investigate how the intrinsic propensity of different regions to get ignited is determined by the specific topological organisation of the structural connectome. More specifically, we simulated the resting-state dynamics of mean-field whole-brain models and assessed how dynamic multi-stability and ignition differ between a reference model embedding a realistic human connectome, and alternative models based on a variety of randomised connectome ensembles. We found that the strength of global excitation needed to first trigger ignition in a subset of regions is substantially smaller for the model embedding the empirical human connectome. Furthermore, when increasing the strength of excitation, the propagation of ignition outside of this initial core–which is able to self-sustain its high activity–is way more gradual than for any of the randomised connectomes, allowing for graded control of the number of ignited regions. We explain both these assets in terms of the exceptional weighted core-shell organisation of the empirical connectome, speculating that this topology of human structural connectivity may be attuned to support enhanced ignition dynamics.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uuJ9kZWwaLk" width="1" />

One of the earliest and most prevalent barriers to successful reproduction is polyspermy, or fertilization of an egg by multiple sperm. To prevent these supernumerary fertilizations, eggs have evolved multiple mechanisms. It has recently been proposed that zinc released by mammalian eggs at fertilization may block additional sperm from entering. Here, we demonstrate that eggs from amphibia and teleost fish also release zinc. Using <i>Xenopus laevis</i> as a model, we document that zinc reversibly blocks fertilization. Finally, we demonstrate that extracellular zinc similarly disrupts early embryonic development in eggs from diverse phyla, including Cnidaria, Echinodermata, and Chordata. Our study reveals that a fundamental strategy protecting human eggs from fertilization by multiple sperm may have evolved more than 650 million years ago.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/sYhQr72cKJU" width="1" />

The temporal association cortex is considered a primate specialization and is involved in complex behaviors, with some, such as language, particularly characteristic of humans. The emergence of these behaviors has been linked to major differences in temporal lobe white matter in humans compared with monkeys. It is unknown, however, how the organization of the temporal lobe differs across several anthropoid primates. Therefore, we systematically compared the organization of the major temporal lobe white matter tracts in the human, gorilla, and chimpanzee great apes and in the macaque monkey. We show that humans and great apes, in particular the chimpanzee, exhibit an expanded and more complex occipital–temporal white matter system; additionally, in humans, the invasion of dorsal tracts into the temporal lobe provides a further specialization. We demonstrate the reorganization of different tracts along the primate evolutionary tree, including distinctive connectivity of human temporal gray matter.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/cbbjsGCW4V0" width="1" />

<p>The inflammatory immune response (IIR) is a physiological or excessive systemic response, induced by inflammatory immune cells according to changes in the internal and external environments. An excessive IIR is the pathological basis for the generation and development of neurological diseases. Ginkgolides are one of the important medicinal ingredients in Ginkgo biloba. Many studies have verified that ginkgolides have anti-platelet-activating, anti-apoptotic, anti-oxidative, neurotrophic, and neuroimmunomodulatory effects. Inflammatory immunomodulation is mediated by inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathways. They also inhibit the platelet-activating factor (PAF)-mediated signal transduction to attenuate the inflammatory response. Herein, we reviewed the studies on the roles of ginkgolides in inflammatory immunomodulation and suggested its potential role in novel treatments for neurological diseases.</p>

Objective<p>To investigate the impact of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-related risk gene (ATP-binding cassette A7-ABCA7 and Clusterin-CLU) on the functional connectivity pattern of default mode network (DMN) in healthy middle-age adults.</p>Methods<p>A total of 147 healthy middle-aged volunteers were enrolled in this study. All subjects completed MRI scans, neuropsychological assessments, and AD-related genotyped analysis. All subjects were divided into high, middle and low risk groups according to the score of risk genotypes, which included CLU (rs11136000, rs2279590, rs9331888, and rs9331949) and ABCA7 (rs3764650 and rs4147929). The genetic effects of CLU, ABCA7, and CLU × ABCA7 on DMN functional connectivity pattern were further explored. Moreover, the genetic effect of Apolipoprotein ε4 (APOEε4) was also considered. Finally, correlation analysis was performed between the signals of brain regions with genetic effect and neuropsychological test scores.</p>Results<p>Compared with the low-risk group, the high-risk group of CLU showed decreased functional connectivity in posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the left middle frontal cortex (P &lt; 0.05, GRF correction). As for the interaction between the CLU and ABCA7, all the subjects were divided into high, middle, and low risk group; the middle-risk group was divided into CLU and ABCA7-dominated middle-risk group. The function connectivity pattern of DMN among the three or four groups were distributed in the bilateral medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and bilateral superior frontal gyrus (SFG) (P &lt; 0.05, GRF correction). When APOEε4 carriers were excluded, the CLU-predominant middle-risk group displayed the decreased functional connectivity in MPFC when compared with the low-risk group, while ABCA7-prodominant middle-risk group displayed decreased functional connectivity in cuneus when compared with the high-risk group (all P &lt; 0.05, GRF correction). The z values of left middle frontal cortex were positively correlated with the scores of Serial Dotting Test (SDT) in high-risk group of CLU, while z values of MPFC and cuneus were positively correlated to the scores of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in low-risk group of three or four groups.</p>Conclusion<p>The functional connectivity of MPFC-PCC might be modulated by the interaction of CLU and ABCA7. Moreover, APOEε4 might be interacted with ABCA7 and CLU modulation in the middle-aged carriers.</p>

<p>Alternative splicing occurs in over 95% of protein-coding genes and contributes to the diversity of the human proteome. Apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (apoER2) is a critical modulator of neuronal development and synaptic plasticity in the brain and is enriched in cassette exon splicing events, in which functional exons are excluded from the final transcript. These alternative splicing events affect apoER2 function, as individual apoER2 exons tend to encode distinct protein functional domains. Although several apoER2 splice variants have been characterized, much work remains to understand how apoER2 splicing events modulate distinct apoER2 activities, including ligand binding specificity, synapse formation and plasticity. Additionally, little is known about how apoER2 splicing events are regulated. Often, alternative splicing events are regulated through the combinatorial action of RNA-binding proteins and other epigenetic mechanisms, however, the regulatory pathways corresponding to each specific exon are unknown in most cases. In this mini-review, we describe the structure of apoER2, highlight the unique functions of known isoforms, discuss what is currently known about the regulation of apoER2 splicing by RNA-binding proteins and pose new questions that will further our understanding of apoER2 splicing complexity.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00124">The P2X7 Receptor: Central Hub of Brain Diseases</a></h4>

<p>The P2X7 receptor is a cation channel activated by high concentrations of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Upon long-term activation, it complexes with membrane proteins forming a wide pore that leads to cell death and increased release of ATP into the extracellular milieu. The P2X7 receptor is widely expressed in the CNS, such as frontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala and striatum, regions involved in neurodegenerative diseases and psychiatric disorders. Despite P2X7 receptor functions in glial cells have been extensively studied, the existence and roles of this receptor in neurons are still controversially discussed. Regardless, P2X7 receptors mediate several processes observed in neuropsychiatric disorders and brain tumors, such as activation of neuroinflammatory response, stimulation of glutamate release and neuroplasticity impairment. Moreover, P2X7 receptor gene polymorphisms have been associated to depression, and isoforms of P2X7 receptors are implicated in neuropsychiatric diseases. In view of that, the P2X7 receptor has been proposed to be a potential target for therapeutic intervention in brain diseases. This review discusses the molecular mechanisms underlying P2X7 receptor-mediated signaling in neurodegenerative diseases, psychiatric disorders, and brain tumors. In addition, it highlights the recent advances in the development of P2X7 receptor antagonists that are able of penetrating the central nervous system.</p>

Background<p>Despite the recent advances in the acute stroke care, treatment options for long-term disability are limited. RPh201 is a botany-derived bioactive compound that has been shown to exert beneficial effects in various experimental models of neural injury. The present study evaluated the effect of delayed RPh201 treatment on long term functional recovery after stroke.</p>Methods<p>Adult male Wistar rats subjected to embolic middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) were randomized into the following experimental groups (n = 20/group): (1) RPh201 treatment, and (2) Vehicle (cottonseed oil). RPh201 (20 μl) or Vehicle were subcutaneously administered twice a week for 16 consecutive weeks starting at 21 days after MCAO. An array of behavioral tests was performed up to120 days after MCAO.</p>Results<p>Ischemic rats treated with RPh201 exhibited significant (p &lt; 0.05) improvement of neurological function measured by adhesive removal test, foot-fault test, and modified neurological severity score at 90 and 120 days after MCAO. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed that RPh201 treatment robustly increased neurofilament heavy chain positive axons and myelin basic protein densities in the peri-infarct area by 61% and 31%, respectively, when compared to the Vehicle treatment, which were further confirmed by Western blot analysis. The RPh201 treatment did not reduce infarct volume.</p>Conclusion<p>Our data demonstrated that RPh201 has a therapeutic effect on improvement of functional recovery in male ischemic rats even when the treatment was initiated 21 days post stroke. Enhanced axonal and myelination densities by RPh201 in ischemic brain may contribute to improved stroke recovery.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00791">Will Sirtuins Be Promising Therapeutic Targets for TBI and Associated Neurodegenerative Diseases?</a></h4>

<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI), a leading cause of morbidity worldwide, induces mechanical, persistent structural, and metabolic abnormalities in neurons and other brain-resident cells. The key pathological features of TBI include neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, and mitochondrial dysfunction. These pathological processes persist for a period of time after TBIs. Sirtuins are evolutionarily conserved nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent deacetylases and mono-ADP-ribosyl transferases. The mammalian sirtuin family has seven members, referred to as Sirtuin (SIRT) 1–7. Accumulating evidence suggests that SIRT1 and SIRT3 play a neuroprotective role in TBI. Although the evidence is scant, considering the involvement of SIRT2, 4–7 in other brain injury models, they may also intervene in similar pathophysiology in TBI. Neurodegenerative diseases are generally accepted sequelae of TBI. It was found that TBI and neurodegenerative diseases have many similarities and overlaps in pathological features. Besides, sirtuins play some unique roles in some neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, we propose that sirtuins might be a promising therapeutic target for both TBI and associated neurodegenerative diseases. In this paper, we review the neuroprotective effects of sirtuins on TBI as well as related neurodegeneration and discuss the therapeutic potential of sirtuin modulators.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, accounting for 60–70% of all dementias. AD is often under-diagnosed and recognized only at a later, more advanced stage, and this delay in diagnosis has been suggested as a contributing factor in the numerous unsuccessful AD treatment trials. Although there is no known cure for AD, early diagnosis is important for disease management and care. A hallmark of AD is the deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ)-containing senile neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosporylated tau in the brain. However, current in vivo methods to quantify Aβ in the brain are invasive, requiring radioactive tracers and positron emission tomography. Toward development of alternative methods to assess AD progression, we focus on the retinal manifestation of AD pathology. The retina is an extension of the central nervous system uniquely accessible to light-based, non-invasive ophthalmic imaging. However, earlier studies in human retina indicate that the literature is divided on the presence of Aβ in the AD retina. To help resolve this disparity, this study assessed retinal tissues from neuropathologically confirmed AD cases to determine the regional distribution of Aβ in retinal wholemounts and to inform on future retinal image studies targeting Aβ. Concurrent post-mortem brain tissues were also collected. Neuropathological cortical assessments including neuritic plaque (NP) scores and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) were correlated with retinal Aβ using immunohistochemistry, confocal microscopy, and quantitative image analysis. Aβ load was compared between AD and control (non-AD) eyes. Our results indicate that levels of intracellular and extracellular Aβ retinal deposits were significantly higher in AD than controls. Mid-peripheral Aβ levels were greater than central retina in both AD and control eyes. In AD retina, higher intracellular Aβ was associated with lower NP score, while higher extracellular Aβ was associated with higher CAA score. Our data support the feasibility of using the retinal tissue to assess ocular Aβ as a surrogate measure of Aβ in the brain of individuals with AD. Specifically, mid-peripheral retina possesses more Aβ deposition than central retina, and thus may be the optimal location for future in vivo ocular imaging.</p>

Purpose<p>The occurrence of mental fatigue when users stare at stimuli is a critical problem in the implementation of steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based visual acuity assessment, which may weaken the SSVEP amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and subsequently affect the results of visual acuity assessment. This study aimed to explore the anti-fatigue performance of six stimulus paradigms (reverse vertical sinusoidal gratings, reverse horizontal sinusoidal gratings, reverse vertical square-wave gratings, brief-onset vertical sinusoidal gratings, reversal checkerboards, and oscillating expansion–contraction concentric rings) in SSVEP acuity assessment.</p>Methods<p>Based on four indices of α + θ index, pupil diameter, National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA-TLX), and amplitude and SNR of SSVEPs, this study quantitatively evaluated mental fatigue in six SSVEP visual attention runs corresponding to six paradigms with 12 subjects.</p>Results<p>These indices of mental fatigue showed a good agreement. The results showed that the paradigm of motion expansion–contraction concentric rings had a superior anti-fatigue efficacy than the other five paradigms of conventional onset mode or pattern reversal mode during prolonged SSVEP experiment. The paradigm of brief-onset mode showed the lowest anti-fatigue efficacy, and the other paradigms of pattern reversal SSVEP paradigms showed a similar anti-fatigue efficacy, which was between motion expansion–contraction mode and onset mode.</p>Conclusion<p>This study recommended the paradigm of oscillating expansion–contraction concentric rings as the stimulation paradigm in SSVEP visual acuity because of its superior anti-fatigue efficacy.</p>

<p>The brain–computer interface (BCI) is a system that is designed to provide communication channels to anyone through a computer. Initially, it was suggested to help the disabled, but actually had been proposed a wider range of applications. However, the cross-subject recognition in BCI systems is difficult to break apart from the individual specific characteristics, unsteady characteristics, and environmental specific characteristics, which also makes it difficult to develop highly reliable and highly stable BCI systems. Rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) is one of the most recent spellers with a clean, unified background and a single stimulus, which may evoke event-related potential (ERP) patterns with less individual difference. In order to build a BCI system that allows new users to use it directly without calibration or with less calibration time, RSVP was employed as evoked paradigm, then correlation analysis rank (CAR) algorithm was proposed to improve the cross-individual classification and simultaneously use as less training data as possible. Fifty-eight subjects took part in the experiments. The flash stimulation time is 200 ms, and the off time is 100 ms. The P300 component was locked to the target representation by time. The results showed that RSVP could evoke more similar ERP patterns among subjects compared with matrix paradigm. Then, the included angle cosine was calculated and counted for averaged ERP waveform between each two subjects. The average matching number of all subjects was 6 for the matrix paradigm, while for the RSVP paradigm, the average matching number range was 20 when the threshold value was set to 0.5, more than three times as much larger, quantificationally indicating that ERP waveforms evoked by the RSVP paradigm produced smaller individual differences, and it is more favorable for cross-subject classification. Information transfer rates (ITR) were also calculated for RSVP and matrix paradigms, and the RSVP paradigm got the average ITR of 43.18 bits/min, which was 13% higher than the matrix paradigm. Then, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve value was computed and compared using the proposed CAR algorithm and traditional random selection. The results showed that the proposed CAR got significantly better performance than the traditional random selection and got the best AUC value of 0.8, while the traditional random selection only achieved 0.65. These encouraging results suggest that with proper evoked paradigm and classification methods, it is feasible to get stable performance across subjects for ERP-based BCI. Thus, our findings provide a new approach to improve BCI performances.</p>

<p>Previous research investigating handle-response compatibility effects with graspable objects used different categories of objects as stimuli, regardless of their specific, intrinsic characteristics. The current study explores whether different types of objects’ characteristics may elicit different types of spatial compatibility, that is, handle-response and response-effect compatibility as well as their potential interaction. In Experiment 1, objects having a graspable handle opposite to either a visible functional component (i.e., handle-function objects: a teapot) or a latent functional component (handle-only objects: a pitcher lacking the spout) were presented separately in different blocks. Both the handle and the goal-directed functional components of these objects were located on the horizontal axis. In Experiment 2, handle-only objects had a handle located on the horizontal axis and a latent functional component located on the vertical axis (e.g., a cup). In both experiments, participants were required to judge the material (plastic and metal) the object was made of. Results showed that the handle-response compatibility effect was sensitive to whether the actions consequences of object manipulation took place on the horizontal rather than on the vertical axis.</p>

<p>The brain shows a complex multiscale organization that prevents a direct understanding of how structure, function and dynamics are correlated. To date, advances in neural modeling offer a unique opportunity for simulating global brain dynamics by embedding empirical data on different scales in a mathematical framework. The Virtual Brain (TVB) is an advanced data-driven model allowing to simulate brain dynamics starting from individual subjects’ structural and functional connectivity obtained, for example, from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The use of TVB has been limited so far to cerebral connectivity but here, for the first time, we have introduced cerebellar nodes and interconnecting tracts to demonstrate the impact of cerebro-cerebellar loops on brain dynamics. Indeed, the matching between the empirical and simulated functional connectome was significantly improved when including the cerebro-cerebellar loops. This positive result should be considered as a first step, since issues remain open about the best strategy to reconstruct effective structural connectivity and the nature of the neural mass or mean-field models generating local activity in the nodes. For example, signal processing is known to differ remarkably between cortical and cerebellar microcircuits. Tackling these challenges is expected to further improve the predictive power of functional brain activity simulations, using TVB or other similar tools, in explaining not just global brain dynamics but also the role of cerebellum in determining brain states in physiological conditions and in the numerous pathologies affecting the cerebro-cerebellar loops.</p>

<p>Asthma is a heterogeneous disease, and the central nervous system (CNS) also participates in the pathogenesis of asthma. We previously reported the amygdala might regulate asthmatic attacks via projecting to the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVN). The dorsal vagal complex (DVC) is a crucial region that modulates respiratory. This study aimed to observe the activity in both PVN and DVC and the connection between PVN and DVC in asthmatic rats. Immunohistochemistry was conducted to observe the changes in Fos and oxytocin (OT) expression. Retrograde tracing using wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) and double immunohistochemistry for OT and Fos was used to observe the HRP/OT/Fos positive neurons distribution in the PVN. The results showed that during an asthma attack, the Fos positive neurons increased in both PVN and DVC over time. The expression of OT positive neurons in PVN showed a similar trend in parallel to the c-Fos positive neurons in PVN. The HRP retrograde-labeled neurons were densely distributed in the medial and lateral subnucleus in the PVN. OT<sup>+</sup>/HRP<sup>+</sup> and Fos<sup>+</sup>/OT<sup>+</sup>/HRP<sup>+</sup> accounted for 18.14%, and 2.37% of HRP-labeled neurons, respectively. Our study showed PVN and DVC were activated and the expression of OT positive neurons in PVN were increased over time during an asthma attack. The existence of connection between PVN and DVC suggested the OT neurons in PVN might project to DVC which might be involved in the pathogenesis of asthma.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00237">Clinical and Oculomotor Correlates With Freezing of Gait in a Chinese Cohort of Parkinson’s Disease Patients</a></h4>

<p>Accumulating evidence suggests that freezing of gait (FOG) is a unique gait disturbance in Parkinson’s disease (PD), and its pathophysiology is not fully elucidated. The present study aims to investigate the clinical and oculomotor associations with FOG in Chinese PD patients. From Jan 2017 to Dec 2019, a total of 210 PD patients were consecutively registered for FOG evaluation based on item-3 of the Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (FOGQ). We explored the demographic, motor, and non-motor symptom differences in FOG positive (PD+FOG, n = 45) vs. negative (PD-FOG, n = 165) group. In addition, 40 PD patients and 37 healthy controls (HC) also underwent oculomotor test via videonystagmography (VNG). Visually guided saccade (VGS) latency, saccade accuracy and gain in smooth pursuit eye movement (SPEM) at three frequencies of horizontal axis were compared among PD+FOG (n = 20), PD-FOG (n = 20), and HC (n = 37). Compared with PD-FOG, PD+FOG had longer disease duration, more severe motor symptoms, lower cognitive scores, more severe depressive and autonomic impairments, as well as higher daily levodopa equivalent dosage. FOG occurred more frequently in patients with wearing-off. VNG subgroup analysis demonstrated that PD+FOG had prolonged saccade latency and decreased saccade accuracy relative to PD-FOG or HC. SPEM gain at 0.1 and 0.2 Hz was also decreased in PD+FOG compared with HC. Furthermore, prolonged saccade latency was correlated with higher FOGQ scores in PD patients. Our results verify that PD with FOG patients suffer from more severe motor and non-motor symptoms, indicating more extensive neurodegeneration. Prolonged saccade latency could be a practical oculomotor parameter both for identification and progression of FOG in PD.</p>

<p>by Rafael D’Andrea, Theo Gibbs, James P. O’Dwyer</p>

Neutral theory assumes all species and individuals in a community are ecologically equivalent. This controversial hypothesis has been tested across many taxonomic groups and environmental contexts, and successfully predicts species abundance distributions across multiple high-diversity communities. However, it has been critiqued for its failure to predict a broader range of community properties, particularly regarding community dynamics from generational to geological timescales. Moreover, it is unclear whether neutrality can ever be a true description of a community given the ubiquity of interspecific differences, which presumably lead to ecological inequivalences. Here we derive analytical predictions for when and why non-neutral communities of consumers and resources may present neutral-like outcomes, which we verify using numerical simulations. Our results, which span both static and dynamical community properties, demonstrate the limitations of summarizing distributions to detect non-neutrality, and provide a potential explanation for the successes of neutral theory as a description of macroecological pattern.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_7VQxYo9Oqg" width="1" />
