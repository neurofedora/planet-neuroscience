     alt="Ultrastructure of ipsilateral and contralateral tectopulvinar projections in the mouse"/>
<p>The confocal image of a coronal section through the left mouse pulvinar nucleus (PUL) illustrates the distribution of projections from the left (Ipsi, magenta) and right (Contra, green) superior colliculus (SC). This study examined the ultrastructure of ipsi and contra SC to PUL projections using viruses that induce the expression of peroxidase in synaptic vesicles (example electron micrographs circled, black arrows indicate synapses). Synaptic terminals originating from the ipsi SC were found to be significantly larger than synaptic terminals originating from the contra SC (left graph), and both populations of SC terminals were found to be significantly larger than synaptic terminals in the PUL that do not originate from the SC (right graph).

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Visual pathways of the brain are organized into parallel channels that code different features of the external environment. In the current study, we investigated the anatomical organization of parallel pathways from the superior colliculus (SC) to the pulvinar nucleus in the mouse. Virus injections placed in the ipsilateral and contralateral SC to induce the expression of different fluorescent proteins define two pulvinar zones. The lateral pulvinar (Pl) receives ipsilateral SC input and the caudal medial pulvinar (Pcm) receives bilateral SC input. To examine the ultrastructure of these projections using transmission electron microscopy, we injected the SC with viruses to induce peroxidase expression within synaptic vesicles or mitochondria. We quantitatively compared the sizes of ipsilateral and contralateral tectopulvinar terminals and their postsynaptic dendrites, as well as the sizes of the overall population of synaptic terminals and their postsynaptic dendrites in the Pl and Pcm. Our ultrastructural analysis revealed that ipsilateral tectopulvinar terminals are significantly larger than contralateral tectopulvinar terminals. In particular, the ipsilateral tectopulvinar projection includes a subset of large terminals (≥ 1 μm<sup>2</sup>) that envelop dendritic protrusions of postsynaptic dendrites. We also found that both ipsilateral and contralateral tectopulvinar terminals are significantly larger than the overall population of synaptic terminals in both the Pl and Pcm. Thus, the ipsilateral tectopulvinar projection is structurally distinct from the bilateral tectopulvinar pathway, but both tectopulvinar channels may be considered the primary or “driving” input to the Pl and Pcm.</p>

	<p>Across all ages, individuals with Down syndrome (DS) experience high rates of sleep problems as well as cognitive impairments. This study sought to investigate whether circadian rhythm disruption was also experienced by people with DS and whether this kind of sleep disorder may be correlated with cognitive performance. A cross-sectional study of 101 participants (58 with DS, 43 with typical development) included individuals in middle childhood (6–10 years old), adolescence (11–18 years old), and young adulthood (19–26 years old). Sleep and markers of circadian timing and robustness were calculated using actigraphy. Cognitive and behavioral data were gathered via a novel touchscreen battery (A-MAPTM, Arizona Memory Assessment for Preschoolers and Special Populations) and parent questionnaire. Results indicated that children and adolescents with DS slept the same amount as peers with typical development, but significant group differences were seen in phase timing. The circadian robustness markers, interdaily stability and intradaily variability of sleep-wake rhythms, were healthiest for children regardless of diagnostic group and worst for adults with DS. Amplitude of the 24-h activity profile was elevated for all individuals with DS. In analyses of the correlations between sleep quality, rhythms, and cognition in people with DS, interdaily stability was positively correlated with reaction time and negatively correlated with verbal and scene recall, a finding that indicates increased stability may paradoxically correlate with poorer cognitive outcomes. Further, we found no relations with sleep efficiency previously found in preschool and adult samples. Therefore, the current findings suggest that a thorough examination of sleep disorders in DS must take into account age as well as circadian robustness to better understand sleep-cognitive correlations in this group.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spatial coding in the hippocampus of flying owls</a></h4>

              
                The elucidation of spatial coding in the hippocampus requires exploring diverse animal species. While robust place-cells are found in the mammalian hippocampus, much less is known about spatial coding in the hippocampus of birds - and nothing is known about avian spatial representation during flight. Here we used a wireless-electrophysiology system to record single neurons in the hippocampus and related pallial structures from freely flying barn owls (Tyto alba) - a central-place nocturnal predator species with excellent navigational abilities. The owl 3D position was monitored while it flew back and forth between two perches. We found place cells - neurons that robustly represented the owls location during flight, and its flight-direction - as well as neurons that coded the owls perching position between flights. Spatial coding was invariant to changes in lighting conditions and to the position of a salient object in the room. Place cells were found in the anterior hippocampus and in the adjacent posterior hyperpallium apicale, and to a much lesser extent in the visual Wulst (visual-cortex homologue). The finding of place-cells in flying owls suggests commonalities in spatial coding across a variety of species - including rodents, bats and owls.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A transcriptomic axis predicts state modulation of cortical interneurons</a></h4>

              
                Transcriptomics has revealed the exquisite diversity of cortical inhibitory neurons, but it is not known whether these fine molecular subtypes have correspondingly diverse activity patterns in the living brain. Here, we show that inhibitory subtypes in primary visual cortex (V1) have diverse correlates with brain state, but that this diversity is organized by a single factor: position along their main axis of transcriptomic variation. We combined in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging of mouse V1 with a novel transcriptomic method to identify mRNAs for 72 selected genes in ex vivo slices. We used transcriptomic clusters to classify inhibitory neurons imaged in layers 1-3 using a three-level hierarchy of 5 Families, 11 Classes, and 35 Subclasses. Visual responses differed significantly only across Families, but modulation by brain state differed at all three hierarchical levels. Nevertheless, this diversity could be predicted from the first transcriptomic principal component, which predicted a cell type's brain state modulation and correlations with simultaneously recorded cells. Inhibitory Subclasses with narrower spikes, lower input resistance, weaker adaptation, and less axon in layer 1 as determined in vitro fired more in resting, oscillatory brain states. Subclasses with the opposite properties fired more during arousal. The former cells had more inhibitory cholinergic receptors, and the latter more excitatory receptors. Thus, despite the diversity of V1 inhibitory neurons, a simple principle determines how their joint activity shapes state-dependent cortical processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Flexible neural coding in sensory, parietal, and frontal cortices during goal-directed virtual navigation</a></h4>

              
                We do not understand how neural nodes operate within the recurrent action-perception loops that characterize naturalistic self-environment interactions, nor how brain networks reconfigure during changing computational demands. Here, we record local field potentials (LFPs) and spiking activity simultaneously from the dorsomedial superior temporal area (MSTd), parietal area 7a, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) as monkeys navigate in virtual reality to catch fireflies. This task requires animals to actively sample from a closed-loop visual environment while concurrently computing latent variables: the evolving distance and angle to a memorized firefly. We observed mixed selectivity in all areas, with even a traditionally sensory area (MSTd) tracking latent variables. Strikingly, global encoding profiles and unit-to-unit coupling suggested a functional subnetwork between MSTd and dlPFC, and not between these are 7a, as anatomy would suggest. When sensory evidence was rendered scarce, lateral connectivity through neuron-to-neuron coupling within MSTd strengthened but its pattern remains fixed, while neuronal coupling adaptively remapped within 7a and dlPFC. The larger the remapping in 7a/dlPFC and the greater the stability within MSTd, the less was behavior impacted by loss of sensory evidence. These results highlight the distributed nature of neural coding during closed-loop action-perception naturalistic behaviors and suggest internal models may be housed in the pattern of fine-grain lateral connectivity within parietal and frontal cortices.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Optimal confidence for unaware visuomotor deviations</a></h4>

              
                Numerous studies have shown that humans can successfully correct deviations to ongoing movements without being aware of them, suggesting limited conscious monitoring of visuomotor performance. Here, we ask whether such limited monitoring impairs the capacity to judiciously place confidence ratings to reflect decision accuracy (metacognitive sensitivity). To this end, we recorded functional magnetic resonance imaging data while thirty-one participants reported visuomotor cursor deviations and rated their confidence retrospectively. We show that participants use a summary statistic of the unfolding visual feedback (the maximum cursor error) to detect deviations but that this information alone is insufficient to explain detection performance. The same summary statistics is used by participants to optimally adjust their confidence ratings, even for unaware deviations. At the neural level, activity in the ventral striatum tracked high confidence, whereas a broad network including the anterior prefrontal cortex encoded cursor error but not confidence, shedding new light on a role of the anterior prefrontal cortex for action monitoring rather than confidence. Together, our results challenge the notion of limited action monitoring and uncover a new mechanism by which humans optimally monitor their movements as they unfold, even when unaware of ongoing deviations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Clostridioides difficile infection increases circulating p-cresol levels and dysregulates brain dopamine metabolism: linking gut-brain axis to autism and other neurologic disorders?</a></h4>

              
                Gastrointestinal illnesses are one of the most common comorbidities reported in patients with neurodevelopmental diseases, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Gut dysbiosis, overgrowth of C. difficile in the gut, and gut microbiota-associated alterations in central neurotransmission have been implicated in ASD, where the dopaminergic axis plays an important role in the disease pathogenesis. Human C. difficile strains produce a significant amount of the toxic metabolite p-cresol, an inhibitor of dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH), which catalyzes the conversion of dopamine (DA) to norepinephrine (NE). p-cresol is known to precipitate and exacerbate autistic behavior in rodents by increasing DA levels and altering DA receptor sensitivity in brain regions relevant to ASD. Therefore, we hypothesized that C. difficile infection dysregulates dopaminergic metabolism in the brain by increasing p-cresol levels in the gut and circulation and by inhibiting DBH, ultimately leading to elevated DA in the brain. For testing this hypothesis, we induced antibiotic-associated C. difficile in mice and determined the gut and serum p-cresol levels, serum DBH activity, and dopamine and its metabolite levels in different brain regions relevant to ASD. The results showed that C. difficile infection causes significant alterations in the dopaminergic axis in mice (p < 0.05). In addition, significantly increased circulating p-cresol levels and reduced DBH activity was observed in C. difficile infected animals (p < 0.05). Therefore, the results from this study suggest a potential link between C. difficile infection and alterations in the dopaminergic axis implicated in the precipitation and aggravation of ASD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Generating accurate 3D gaze vectors using synchronized eye tracking and motion capture</a></h4>

              
                Assessing gaze behaviour during real-world tasks is difficult; dynamic bodies moving through dynamic worlds make finding gaze fixations challenging. Current approaches involve laborious coding of pupil positions overlaid on video. One solution is to combine eye tracking with motion tracking to generate 3D gaze vectors. When combined with tracked or known object locations, fixation detection can be automated. Here we use combined eye and motion tracking and explore how linear regression models generate accurate 3D gaze vectors. We compare spatial accuracy of models derived from four short calibration routines across three data types: the performance of calibration routines were assessed using calibration data, a validation task that demands short fixations on task-relevant locations, and an object interaction task we used to bridge the gap between laboratory and "in the wild" studies. Further, we generated and compared models using spherical and cartesian coordinate systems and monocular (Left or Right) or binocular data. Our results suggest that all calibration routines perform similarly, with the best performance (i.e., sub-centimeter errors) coming from the task (i.e., the most "natural") trials when the participant is looking at an object in front of them. Further, we found that spherical coordinate systems generate more accurate gaze vectors with no differences in accuracy when using monocular or binocular data. Overall, we recommend recording one-minute calibration datasets, using a binocular eye tracking headset (for redundancy), a spherical coordinate system when depth is not considered, and ensuring data quality (i.e., tracker positioning) is high when recording datasets.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Listening Zone of Human Electrocorticographic Field Potential Recordings</a></h4>

              
                Intracranial electroencephalographic (icEEG) recordings provide invaluable insights into neural dynamics in humans due to their unmatched spatiotemporal resolution. Yet, such recordings reflect the combined activity of multiple underlying generators, confounding the ability to resolve spatially distinct neural sources. To empirically quantify the listening zone of icEEG recordings, we computed the correlations between signals as a function of distance (expressed as full width at half maximum; FWHM) between 8,752 recording sites in 71 patients implanted with either subdural electrodes (SDE), stereo-encephalography electrodes (sEEG), or high-density sEEG electrodes. As expected, for both SDE and sEEG electrodes, higher frequency signals exhibited a sharper fall off relative to lower frequency signals. For broadband high gamma (BHG) activity, the mean FWHM of SDEs (6.6 {+/-} 2.5 mm) and sEEGs in gray matter (7.14 {+/-} 1.7 mm) was not significantly different, however the FWHM for low frequencies recorded by sEEGs was 2.45 mm smaller than SDEs. White matter sEEG electrodes showed much lower power for frequencies 17 to 200 Hz (q < 0.01) and a much broader decay (11.3 {+/-} 3.2 mm) than gray matter electrodes (7.14 {+/-} 1.7 mm). The use of a bipolar referencing scheme significantly lowered FWHM for sEEG electrodes, as compared with a white matter reference or a common average reference. These results outline the influence of array design, spectral bands, and referencing schema on local field potential recordings and source localization in icEEG recordings in humans. The metrics we derive have immediate relevance to the analysis and interpretation of both cognitive and epileptic data.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An Unsupervised Machine Learning Paradigm for Artifact Removal from Electrodermal Activity in an Uncontrolled Clinical Setting</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Electrodermal activity (EDA) reflects sympathetic nervous system activity through sweating-related changes in skin conductance. To enable EDA data to be used robustly in clinical settings, we need to develop artifact detection and removal frameworks that can handle the types of interference experienced in clinical settings. Methods: We collected EDA data from 69 subjects while they were undergoing surgery in the operating room. We then built an artifact removal framework using unsupervised learning methods and informed features to remove the heavy artifact that resulted from the use of surgical electrocautery during the surgery and compared it to other existing methods for artifact removal from EDA data. Results: Our framework was able to remove the vast majority of artifact from the EDA data across all subjects with high sensitivity (94%) and specificity (90%). In contrast, existing methods used for comparison struggled to be sufficiently sensitive and specific, and none effectively removed artifact even if it was identifiable. In addition, the use of unsupervised learning methods in our framework removes the need for manually labeled datasets for training. Conclusion: Our framework allows for robust removal of heavy artifact from EDA data in clinical settings such as surgery. Since this framework only relies on a small set of informed features, it can be expanded to other modalities such as ECG and EEG. Significance: Robust artifact removal from EDA data is the first step to enable clinical integration of EDA as part of standard monitoring in settings such as the operating room.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fatigue induces behavioural improvements in the unfatigued hand via altered functional connectivity and neurochemicals in cortical motor areas</a></h4>

              
                In humans, motor learning is underpinned by changes in functional connectivity (FC) across the sensorimotor network. Unilateral exercise-induced fatigue increases FC in the ipsilateral primary motor cortex (M1) and supplementary motor area (SMA); areas involved in motor planning and execution of the contralateral hand. Unilateral fatiguing exercise is therefore a promising potential approach to augment motor performance in the non-fatigued, contralateral, hand. In a within-participant, controlled, randomized, cross-over design, 15 right-handed adults had two magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sessions, where functional MRI and MR Spectroscopic Imaging were acquired before and after repeated right-hand contractions at either 5% or 50% maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). Before and after scanning, response times (RTs) were determined in both hands, and after scanning, participants performed a serial reaction time task (SRTT) with their left, unfatigued, hand. Nine minutes of 50% MVC contractions resulted in fatigue. This unimanual fatigue improved motor performance, as indexed by decreased RTs, in the contralateral hand. Although fatigue had no significant effects on sequence learning, fatigue led to a significant increase in the transfer of the learned skill to the untrained hand. These behavioural effects were supported by significant neural changes: an increase in SMA-SMA functional connectivity, and increased connectivity between right M1 and right Orbitofrontal Cortex. At a neurochemical level, the degree of fatigue-induced decrease in GABA in left M1, left and right SMA correlated with subsequent behavioural improvements in the left-hand. These results support unilateral fatiguing exercise as a potential therapeutic intervention in a range of neurological and orthopedic conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">E-Cannula reveals anatomical diversity in sharp-wave ripples as a driver for the recruitment of distinct hippocampal assemblies</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus plays a critical role in spatial navigation and episodic memory. However, research on in vivo hippocampal activity dynamics has mostly relied on single modalities such as electrical recordings or optical imaging, with respectively limited spatial and temporal resolution. This technical difficulty greatly impedes multi-level investigations into network state-related changes in cellular activity. To overcome these limitations, we developed the E-Cannula integrating fully transparent graphene microelectrodes with imaging-cannula. The E-Cannula enables the simultaneous electrical recording and two-photon calcium imaging from the exact same population of neurons across an anatomically extended region of the mouse hippocampal CA1 stably across several days. These large-scale simultaneous optical and electrical recordings showed that local hippocampal sharp wave ripples (SWRs) are associated with synchronous calcium events involving large neural populations in CA1. We show that SWRs exhibit spatiotemporal wave patterns along multiple axes in 2D space with different spatial extents (local or global) and temporal propagation modes (stationary or travelling). Notably, distinct SWR wave patterns were associated with, and decoded from, the selective recruitment of orthogonal CA1 cell assemblies. These results suggest that the diversity in the anatomical progression of SWRs may serve as a mechanism for the selective activation of the unique hippocampal cell assemblies extensively implicated in the encoding of distinct memories. Through these results we demonstrate the utility of the E-Cannula as a versatile neurotechnology with the potential for future integration with other optical components such as green lenses, fibers or prisms enabling the multi-modal investigation of cross-time scale population-level neural dynamics across brain regions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Decoding individualized motor cortical excitability states from whole-brain electroencephalography</a></h4>

              
                OBJECTIVE: Brain state-dependent transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) requires real-time identification of cortical excitability states. Here, we aimed to identify individualized, subject-specific motor cortex (M1) excitability states from whole-scalp electroencephalography (EEG) signals. METHODS: We analyzed a pre-existing dataset that delivered 600 single TMS pulses to the right M1 during EEG and electromyography (EMG) recordings. Subject-specific multivariate pattern classification was used to discriminate between brain states during which TMS elicited small or large motor-evoked potentials (MEPs). RESULTS: Classifiers trained at the individual subject level successfully discriminated between low and high M1 excitability states. MEPs elicited during classifier-predicted high excitability states were significantly larger than those elicited during classifier-predicted low excitability states. Classifiers trained on subject-specific data obtained immediately before TMS delivery performed better than classifiers trained on data from earlier time points, and subject-specific classifiers generalized weakly but significantly across subjects. CONCLUSION: Decoding individualized M1 excitability states from whole-brain EEG activity is feasible and robust. SIGNIFICANCE: Deploying subject-specific classifiers during brain state-dependent TMS may enable effective, fully individualized neuromodulation in the future.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distribution of multi-unit pitch responses recorded intracranially from human auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                The perception of pitch requires the abstraction of stimulus properties related to the spectrotemporal structure of sound. Previous studies utilizing both animal electrophysiology and human imaging have indicated the presence of a center for pitch representation in the auditory cortex. Recent data from our own group - examining local field potentials (LFPs) in humans - indicate more widely distributed pitch-associated responses within the auditory cortex (Gander et al., 2019). To probe this with greater spatial resolution, we examined multi-unit activity related to three different auditory stimuli, in seven epilepsy patients who were implanted with high-impedance electrodes in auditory cortex for the clinical purpose of localizing seizures. The stimuli were regular-interval noise (RIN) with a pitch strength that is related to the temporal regularity, and pitch value determined by repetition rate, and harmonic complexes with missing fundamentals. We demonstrated increases in spiking activity in 69 of 104 (66%) responsive multi-unit activity in auditory cortex due to pitch-associated stimuli. Importantly, these responses were distributed across the entire extent of Heschl's gyrus (HG), in both primary and non-primary areas, rather than isolated to a specific region, and this finding was evident regardless of the stimulus presented. These findings are the first multi-unit pitch responses recorded from humans, and align with a recent study in macaques (Kikuchi et al., 2019) demonstrating that both local field potential and unit responses to pitch-inducing stimuli are distributed throughout auditory cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Visual occipito-temporal sensitivity to digits through elementary school</a></h4>

              
                Number processing abilities are important for academic and personal development. The course of initial specialization of ventral occipito-temporal cortex (vOTC) for visual number processing is crucial for the development of numeric and arithmetic skills. We examined the visual N1, the electrophysiological correlate of vOTC activations across five time points in kindergarten (T1), middle and end of first grade (T2, T3), second (T4) and fifth grade (T5). 62 children (35 female) performed a target detection task which included visual presentation of digits, false fonts, and letters. Arithmetic skills were measured at T4 and T5 with standardized math tests. Stronger N1 amplitudes for digits than false fonts were found across all 5 measurements. Arithmetic skills correlated negatively with visual N1 sensitivity to digits at T4 (2nd grade, mean age 8.3 yrs) over the left hemisphere, possibly reflecting allocation of more attentional or cognitive resources with poorer arithmetic skills. Our main result shows persistent visual N1 sensitivity to digits that is already present early on in pre-school and remains stable until fifth grade. This differs from the relatively sharp rise and fall of the visual N1 sensitivity to words or letters between kindergarten and middle of elementary school. The present study thus indicates different trajectories in the development of visual processing for written characters that are relevant to numeracy and literacy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling of the Relationship between Task Related Hemodynamic Responses and Neuronal Excitability: a Simultaneous fNIRS/TMS Study</a></h4>

              
                Background: Investigating the relationship between task-related cortical hemodynamic activity and brain excitability is challenging because it requires simultaneous measurement of brain hemodynamic activity while applying non-invasive brain stimulation. There is also considerable inter-/intra-subject variability which both brain excitability and task-related hemodynamic responses are associated with. Here we proposed hierarchical Bayesian modeling to taking into account variability in the data at the individual and group levels, aiming to provide accurate and reliable statistical inferences on this research question. Methods: We performed a study on 16 healthy subjects with simultaneous Paired Associative Stimulation (Inhibitory PAS10, Excitatory PAS25, Sham) and functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) targeting the primary motor cortex (M1). PAS was applied to modulate the cortical function and induce plasticity. Before and after each intervention cortical excitability was measured by motor evoked potentials (MEPs), and the motor task-related hemodynamic response was measured using fNIRS. We constructed three models to encode 1) PAS effects on the M1 excitability; 2) PAS effects on the whole-time course of fNIRS hemodynamic responses to finger tapping tasks, and 3) the correlation between PAS effects on M1 excitability and PAS effects on task-related hemodynamic responses. Results: Significant increase of the cortical excitability was found after PAS25, whereas a small reduction of the cortical excitability was shown after PAS10 and no changes after sham. We found PAS effects on finger tapping evoked HbO/HbR within M1, around the peak of the hemodynamic time courses. Both HbO and HbR absolute amplitudes increased after PAS25 and decreased after PAS10. Cortical excitability changes and task-related HbO/HbR changes showed a high probability of being positively correlated, 0.77 and 0.79, respectively. The corresponding Pearson correlations were 0.58 (p<.0001, HbO with MEP) and 0.56 (p<.001, HbR with MEP), respectively. Conclusion: Benefiting from this original Bayesian data analysis, our results showed that PAS modulates task-related cortical hemodynamic responses in addition to M1 excitability. The fact that PAS effects on hemodynamic response were exhibited mainly around the peak of the hemodynamic time course may indicate that the intervention only increases metabolic demanding rather than modulating hemodynamic response function per se. Moreover, the positive correlation between PAS modulations of excitability and hemodynamic brings insights to understand the fundamental properties of cortical function and cortical excitability.

                The cellular mechanisms of emotional contagion are unknown. We investigated tickle contagion and the underlying neuronal representations in rats. We recorded trunk somatosensory cortex activity of observer rats while they received tickling, audio-visual playback of tickling footage, and while they witnessed tickling of demonstrator rats. Observers vocalized, and showed "Freudenspruenge" ("joy jumps") during witnessing live tickling, while they showed little behavioral responses to playbacks. A fraction of trunk somatosensory neurons responded to both direct and witnessed tickling in action-specific manner. The correlation between direct and witnessed tickling responses increased towards deeper cortical layers. Tickle-mirror neurons but not non-mirror neurons discharged prior to and during vocalizations and hence might drive contagious 'laughter'. We conclude that trunk somatosensory cortex represents mirrored ticklishness.

                Neurodegeneration is a protracted process involving progressive changes in myriad cell types that ultimately result in neuronal death. Changes in vulnerable neuronal populations are highly influenced by concomitant changes in surrounding cells, complicating experimental approaches to interrogate the simultaneous events that underlie neurodegeneration. To dissect how individual cell types within a heterogeneous tissue contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of a neurodegenerative disorder, we performed longitudinal single-nucleus RNA sequencing of the mouse and human spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) cerebellum, establishing continuous dynamic trajectories of each population. Furthermore, we defined the precise transcriptional changes that precede loss of Purkinje cells and identified early oligodendroglial impairments that can profoundly impact cerebellar function. Finally, we applied a deep learning method to accurately predict disease state and identify drivers of disease. Together, this work uncovers new roles for diverse cerebellar cell types in SCA1 and provides a generalizable analysis framework for studying neurodegeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Oxytocin reduces interoceptive influences on empathy-for-pain in the anterior insula</a></h4>

              
                Empathy-for-pain states are underpinned by interoception, i.e the central representation of internal states. Cardiac signals occur in a phasic manner; baroreceptor discharges at systole communicate the heartbeats' strength. These signals modulate pain and emotion processing. We tested whether these phasic interoceptive signals modulate empathy-for-pain. As oxytocin (OT) enhances empathy and modulates interoceptive signals' precision, we also tested if OT administration impacts empathy-for-pain via interoceptive mechanisms. Male subjects (N=32) attended three sessions to perform psychometric tests and an fMRI empathy-for-pain task, after intranasal administration of OT or placebo (40IU). Pictures of hands in painful or non-painful context were presented at systole or diastole. Effects of drug, emotion and cardiac timing on behaviour and brain activity was tested using general and mixed-effects linear models. Across conditions, activation was observed within regions implicated in pain and empathy-for-pain, with insula activation greater in the right than left hemisphere. OT administration, compared to placebo, attenuated the reactivity of some regions, including anterior cingulate cortex, but presentation of stimuli at systole blocked the OT attenuating effect. Our data suggest that OT alters the processing of motivationally-salient social cues, interacting with interoceptive signals. Our findings may inform targeted use of OT in psychiatric conditions linked to aberrant interoceptive processing.

	<p>We examined whether word processing is associated with subjective self-evaluation of cognition in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) as a function of their depressive symptoms. MTLE patients with (MTLE +d, N = 28) or without (MTLE -d, N = 11) depression were compared to pair-matched healthy control participants on free recall and self-relevance ratings of emotionally valenced words. Correlation and hierarchical analyses were conducted to investigate whether the subjective self-evaluation of cognition in MTLE patients is predicted by the negative emotional bias reflected in task performance. MTLE +d patients endorsed as self-relevant fewer positive words and more negative words than the MTLE -d patients and healthy participants. They also self-evaluated their cognition poorer than the MTLE -d patients. Analyses indicated that recall and self-endorsement of emotional words predicted both self-evaluation of cognition as well as epilepsy duration. Our findings indicate that negative self-relevance emotional bias is observed in MTLE patients and is predictive of subjective self-evaluation of cognition. Application of brief behavioral tasks probing emotional functions could be valuable for clinical research and practice in the patients with MTLE.</p>

	<p>Background: Cataract is one of the most common age-related vision deteriorations, leading to opacification of the lens and therefore visual impairment as well as blindness. Both cataract extraction and the implantation of blue light filtering lens are believed to improve not only vision but also overall functioning. Methods: Thirty-four cataract patients were subject to resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging before and after cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation (IOL). Global and local graph metrics were calculated in order to investigate the reorganization of functional network architecture associated with alterations in blue light transmittance. Psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) was conducted. Results: Graph theory-based analysis revealed decreased eigenvector centrality after the cataract extraction and IOL replacement in inferior occipital gyrus, superior parietal gyrus and many cerebellum regions as well as increased clustering coefficient in superior and inferior parietal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus and various cerebellum regions. PVT results revealed significant change between experimental sessions as patients responded faster after IOL replacement. Moreover, a few regions were correlated with the difference in blue light transmittance and the time reaction in PVT. Conclusion: Current study revealed substantial functional network architecture reorganization associated with cataract extraction and alteration in blue light transmittance.</p>

	<p>Balance training interventions over several months have been shown to improve spatial cognitive functions and to induce structural plasticity in brain regions associated with visual-vestibular self-motion processing. In the present cross-sectional study, we tested whether long-term balance practice is associated with better spatial cognition. To this end, spatial perspective-taking abilities were compared between balance experts (n = 40) practicing sports such as gymnastics, acrobatics or slacklining for at least four hours a week for the last two years, endurance athletes (n = 38) and sedentary healthy individuals (n = 58). The balance group showed better performance in a dynamic balance task compared to both the endurance group and the sedentary group. Furthermore, the balance group outperformed the sedentary group in a spatial perspective-taking task. A regression analysis across all participants revealed a positive association between individual balance performance and spatial perspective-taking abilities. Groups did not differ in executive functions, and individual balance performance did not correlate with executive functions, suggesting a specific association between balance skills and spatial cognition. The results are in line with theories of embodied cognition, assuming that sensorimotor experience shapes cognitive functions.</p>

	<p>In recent years, there has been growing interest in investigating the effect of specific pharmacological treatments for ADHD not only on its core symptoms, but also on social skills in youths. This stands especially true for ADHD patients displaying impulsive aggressiveness and antisocial behaviors, being the comorbidity with Disruptive Behavior Disorders, one of the most frequently observed in clinical settings. This systematic review aimed to synthesize research findings on this topic following PRISMA guidelines and to identify gaps in current knowledge, future directions, and treatment implications. Search strategies included the following terms: ADHD; methylphenidate and other ADHD drugs; empathy, theory of mind and emotion recognition. Full-text articles were retrieved and data from individual studies were collected. Thirteen studies were finally included in our systematic review. Ten studies assessing changes in empathy and/or theory of mind in patients with ADHD treated after pharmacological interventions were identified. Similarly, seven partially overlapping studies assessing changes in emotion recognition were retrieved. Despite a great heterogeneity in the methodological characteristics of the included studies, most of them reported an improvement in emphatic and theory of mind abilities in youths with ADHD treated with psychostimulants and nonstimulant drugs, as well as positive but less consistent results about emotion recognition performances.</p>

	<p>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is an X-chromosome-linked dominant genetic disorder that causes a variable degree of cognitive dysfunction and developmental disability. Current treatment is symptomatic and no existing medications target the specific cause of FXS. As with other X-linked disorders, FXS manifests differently in males and females, including abnormalities in the dopamine system that are also seen in Fmr1-knockout (KO) mice. We investigated sex differences in dopamine signaling in Fmr1-KO mice in response to L-stepholidine, a dopamine D1 receptor agonist and D2 receptor antagonist. We found significant sex differences in basal levels of phosphorylated protein kinase A (p-PKA) and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β in wild type mice that were absent in Fmr1-KO mice. In wild-type mice, L-stepholidine increased p-PKA in males but not female mice, decreased p-GSK-3 in female mice and increased p-GSK-3 in male mice. Conversely, in Fmr1-KO mice, L-stepholidine increased p-PKA and p-GSK-3β in females, and decreased p-PKA and p-GSK-3β in males.</p>

	<p>Educational theory claims that integrating learning style into learning-related activities can improve academic performance. Traditional methods to recognize learning styles are mostly based on questionnaires and online behavior analyses. These methods are highly subjective and inaccurate in terms of recognition. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals have significant potential for use in the measurement of learning style. This study uses EEG signals to design a deep-learning-based model of recognition to recognize people’s learning styles with EEG features by using a non-overlapping sliding window, one-dimensional spatio-temporal convolutions, multi-scale feature extraction, global average pooling, and the group voting mechanism; this model is named the TSMG model (Temporal-Spatial-Multiscale-Global model). It solves the problem of processing EEG data of variable length, and improves the accuracy of recognition of the learning style by nearly 5% compared with prevalent methods, while reducing the cost of calculation by 41.93%. The proposed TSMG model can also recognize variable-length data in other fields. The authors also formulated a dataset of EEG signals (called the LSEEG dataset) containing features of the learning style processing dimension that can be used to test and compare models of recognition. This dataset is also conducive to the application and further development of EEG technology to recognize people’s learning styles.</p>

	<p>Several electrical stimulation patterns of the auditory nerve have been described for tinnitus relief, but there is no consensus on the most effective stimulation pattern. Therefore, we aim to systematically review the literature on the effect of intra- and extracochlear electrical stimulation patterns as a treatment option for patients with tinnitus. Only studies on intra- and extracochlear electrical stimulation for patients with tinnitus were included if the stimulation used did not concern standardized CI stimulation patterns to primarily rehabilitate hearing loss as intervention. A total of 34 studies met the inclusion criteria, with 10 studies (89 patients) on intracochlear electrical stimulation and 25 studies on extracochlear electrical stimulation (1109 patients). There was a high to medium risk of bias in 22 studies, especially due to lack of a non-exposed group and poor selection of the exposed group. All included studies showed subjective tinnitus improvement during or after electrical stimulation, using different stimulation patterns. Due to methodological limitations and low reporting quality of the included studies, the potential of intra- and extracochlear stimulation has not been fully explored. To draw conclusions on which stimulation patterns should be optimized for tinnitus relief, a deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved in tinnitus suppression is needed.</p>

	<p>The present study investigated whether, as in adults, 7-month-old infants’ sensorimotor brain areas are recruited in response to the observation of emotional facial expressions. Activity of the sensorimotor cortex, as indexed by µ rhythm suppression, was recorded using electroencephalography (EEG) while infants observed neutral, angry, and happy facial expressions either in a static (N = 19) or dynamic (N = 19) condition. Graph theory analysis was used to investigate to which extent neural activity was functionally localized in specific cortical areas. Happy facial expressions elicited greater sensorimotor activation compared to angry faces in the dynamic experimental condition, while no difference was found between the three expressions in the static condition. Results also revealed that happy but not angry nor neutral expressions elicited a significant right-lateralized activation in the dynamic condition. Furthermore, dynamic emotional faces generated more efficient processing as they elicited higher global efficiency and lower networks’ diameter compared to static faces. Overall, current results suggest that, contrarily to neutral and angry faces, happy expressions elicit sensorimotor activity at 7 months and dynamic emotional faces are more efficiently processed by functional brain networks. Finally, current data provide evidence of the existence of a right-lateralized activity for the processing of happy facial expressions.</p>

     alt="Characterization and manipulation of Corticothalamic neurons in associative cortices using Syt6-Cre transgenic mice"/>
<p>Our work highlights the potential of the Syt6-Cre transgenic mouse line to effectively target Corticothalamic neurons in the associative cortices. This detailed study describes and tests the utility of the system, laying the foundation for its implementation as a new tool to study corticothalamic interactions between frontal and medial associative areas, thalamic nuclei, and the contribution of these interactions to higher cognitive functions.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Corticothalamic interactions between associative cortices and higher order thalamic nuclei are involved in high-cognitive functions such as decision-making and working memory. Corticothalamic neurons (CTn) in the prefrontal cortex and other associative areas have been much less studied than their counterparts in the primary sensory areas. The availability of characterized transgenic tools to study CTn in associative areas will facilitate their study and contribute to overcome the scarcity of data about their properties, network dynamics, and contribution to cognitive functions.</p>
<p>Here, we characterized the Syt6-Cre (KI148Gsat/Mmud) transgenic mouse line, by tracking expression of a Cre-mediated reporter. In this line, Cre-reporter is strongly expressed in the prefrontal, motor, cingulate, and retrosplenial cortices, as well as in other brain areas including the cerebellum and the olfactory tubercle. Cortical expression starts embryonically and reaches the adult expression pattern by postnatal day 15. In the cortex, Cre-reporter is expressed by layer 6-CTn and by layer 5-CTn to a lesser extent. We quantified Syt6-Cre<sup>+</sup> CTn axon varicosities to estimate the distribution and density of putative corticothalamic driver and modulator inputs to thalamic nuclei in the medial, midline, intralaminar, anterior, and motor groups. Also, we characterized the effect of optogenetic stimulation of Syt6-Cre<sup>+</sup> neurons in the activity of the prefrontal cortex. CTn stimulation in the prefrontal cortex induces an oscillatory activity in the local field potential that resembles the cortical downstates typically observed during slow-wave sleep or quiet wake.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) causes lifelong neurologic disability. Despite the use of therapeutic hypothermia, memory deficits and executive functions remain severely affected. Cholinergic neurotransmission from the basal forebrain to neocortex and hippocampus is central to higher cortical functions. We examined the basal forebrain by light microscopy and report loss of choline acetyltransferase-positive (ChAT)+ neurons, at postnatal day (P) 40, in the ipsilateral medial septal nucleus (MSN) after neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI) in mice. There was no loss of ChAT+ neurons in the ipsilateral nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM) and striatum. Ipsilateral striatal and nbM ChAT+ neurons were abnormal with altered immunoreactivity for ChAT, shrunken and crenated somas, and dysmorphic appearing dendrites. Using confocal images with 3D reconstruction, nbM ChAT+ dendrites in HI mice were shorter than sham (p = 0.0001). Loss of ChAT+ neurons in the MSN directly correlated with loss of ipsilateral hippocampal area. In the nbM and striatum, percentage of abnormal ChAT+ neurons correlated with loss of ipsilateral cerebral cortical and striatal area, respectively. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity increased in adjacent ipsilateral cerebral cortex and hippocampus and the increase was linearly related to loss of cortical and hippocampal area. Numbers and size of cathepsin D+ lysosomes increased in large neurons in the ipsilateral nbM. After neonatal HI, abnormalities were found throughout the major cholinergic systems in relationship to amount of forebrain area loss. There was also an upregulation of cathepsin D+ particles within the nbM. Cholinergic neuropathology may underlie the permanent dysfunction in learning, memory, and executive function after neonatal brain injury.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Satb1 expression in retinal ganglion cells of marmosets, macaques, and humans</a></h4>

              
                <img src="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/62ed6c2d-ab9d-45f2-aeb6-e635ba50d90c/cne25258-gra-0001-m.png"
     alt="Satb1 expression in retinal ganglion cells of marmosets, macaques, and humans"/>
<p>Satb1 expressing cells make up a subpopulation of ganglion cells in the retinas of marmosets, macaques, and humans. They comprise different morphological cell types and in marmoset include the recursive bistratified cell, which is a candidate for the on-off direction-selective ganglion cell.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing have enabled the molecular distinction of ganglion cell populations in mammalian retinas. Here we used antibodies against the transcription factor special AT-rich binding protein 1 (Satb1, a protein which is expressed by on-off direction-selective ganglion cells in mouse retina) to study Satb1 expression in the retina of marmosets (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>), macaques (<i>Macaca fascicularis</i>), and humans. In all species, Satb1 was exclusively expressed in retinal ganglion cells. The Satb1 cells made up ∼2% of the ganglion cell population in the central retina of all species, rising to a maximum ∼7% in peripheral marmoset retina. Intracellular injections in marmoset and macaque retinas revealed that most Satb1 expressing ganglion cells are widefield ganglion cells. In marmoset, Satb1 cells have a densely branching dendritic tree and include broad and narrow thorny, recursive bistratified, and parasol cells, all of which show some costratification with the outer or inner cholinergic amacrine cells. The recursive bistratified cells showed the strongest costratification but did not show extensive cofasciculation as reported for on-off direction-selective ganglion cells in rabbit and rodent retinas. In macaque, Satb1 was not expressed in recursive bistratified cells, but in large sparsely branching cells. Our findings further support the idea that the expression of transcription factors in retinal ganglion cells is not conserved across Old World (human and macaque) and New World (marmoset) primates and provides a further step to link a molecular marker with specific cell types.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">COVID‐19 vaccine response in people with multiple sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate the effect of disease modifying therapies on immune response to SARS-CoV2 vaccines in people with multiple sclerosis.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>473 people with multiple sclerosis provided one or more dried blood spot samples. Information about COVID-19 and vaccine history, medical and drug history were extracted from questionnaires and medical records. Dried blood spots were eluted and tested for antibodies to SARS-CoV2. Antibody titres were partitioned into tertiles with people on no disease modifying therapy as a reference. We calculated the odds ratio of seroconversion (univariate logistic regression) and compared quantitative vaccine response (Kruskal Wallis) following SARS-CoV2 vaccine according to disease modifying therapy. We used regression modelling to explore the effect of vaccine timing, treatment duration, age, vaccine type and lymphocyte count on vaccine response.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared to no disease modifying therapy, the use of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (odds ratio 0.03; 95% confidence interval 0.01-0.06, p&lt;0.001) and fingolimod (odds ratio 0.04; 95% confidence interval 0.01-0.12) were associated with lower seroconversion following SARS-CoV2 vaccine. All other drugs did not differ significantly from the untreated cohort. Both time since last anti-CD20 treatment and total time on treatment were significantly associated with response to vaccination. Vaccine type significantly predicted seroconversion, but not in those on anti-CD20 medications. Preliminary data on cellular T-cell immunity showed 40% of seronegative subjects had measurable anti-SARS-CoV2 T cell responses.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Some disease modifying therapies convey risk of attenuated serological response to SARS-CoV2 vaccination in people with MS. We provide recommendations for the practical management of this patient group.</p>

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and affective disorders are frequently comorbid and share underlying mechanisms that could be targets for comprehensive treatment. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has high comorbidity with AUD, but comprehensive models of this overlap are nascent. We recently characterized a model of comorbid AUD and PTSD-like symptoms, wherein stressed rats receive an inhibitory avoidance (IA)-related footshock on two occasions followed by two-bottle choice (2BC) voluntary alcohol drinking. Stressed rats received the second footshock in a familiar (FAM, same IA box as the first footshock) or novel context (NOV, single-chambered apparatus); the FAM paradigm more effectively increased alcohol drinking in males and the NOV paradigm in females. During abstinence, stressed males displayed avoidance-like PTSD symptoms, and females showed hyperarousal-like PTSD symptoms. Rats in the model had altered spontaneous action potential-independent GABAergic transmission in the central amygdala (CeA), a brain region key in alcohol dependence and stress-related signaling. However, PTSD sufferers may have alcohol experience prior to their trauma. Here, we therefore modified our AUD/PTSD comorbidity model to provide 3 weeks of intermittent extended alcohol access before footshock and then studied the effects of NOV and FAM stress on drinking and PTSD phenotypes. NOV stress suppressed the escalation of alcohol intake and preference seen in male controls, but no stress effects were seen on drinking in females. Additionally, NOV males had decreased action potential-independent presynaptic GABA release and delayed postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor kinetics in the CeA compared to control and FAM males. Despite these changes to alcohol intake and CeA GABA signaling, stressed rats showed broadly similar anxiogenic-like behaviors to our previous comorbid model, suggesting decoupling of the PTSD symptoms from the AUD vulnerability for some of these animals. The collective results show the importance of alcohol history and trauma context in vulnerability to comorbid AUD/PTSD-like symptoms.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Sex and gender difference in cognitive and behavioral studies in developmental age: An introduction</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This paper introduces a special issue focused on sex and gender (s/g) cognitive/behavioral differences at developmental ages providing an overview of this multifaceted and debated topic. It will provide a description of the biological systems that are strongly interconnected to generate s/g differences, that is, genetic determinants, sex hormones, differences in brain structure, organization, and/or function, inherited or modifiable under environmental pressures. Developmental studies are rare. Some addressed whether s/g differences in cognitive/behavioral characteristics are evident early in life and are consistent throughout development, entailing that s/g differences can follow the evolving steps in girls and boys in different domains. The data are far from being homogeneous and consistent about s/g difference in language, social skills, and visuo/spatial abilities. The differences are small, often with overlapping performances, similar to what is seen in adulthood. Given that several variables and the interactions between them are implicated, further longitudinal studies adopting adequate assessment tools, very large size multicultural samples stratified in different, well-sized and precise age groups, considering biological and sociocultural variables, are needed. Due to the complexity of the issue, there is still the need to support and adopt an s/g difference approach also in cognitive and behavioral studies at developmental ages. Finally, these studies have not only scientific importance and relevant cultural, anthropological, and social implications, but are also useful for pedagogical programming as well as for the study of the different susceptibility to develop CNS diseases and consequently to promote different therapies and treatments.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Alcohol and the brain: from genes to circuits</a></h4>

              
                Alcohol use produces wide-ranging and diverse effects on the central nervous system. It influences intracellular signaling mechanisms, leading to changes in gene expression, chromatin remodeling, and translation. As a result of these molecular alterations, alcohol affects the activity of neuronal circuits. Together, these mechanisms produce long-lasting cellular adaptations in the brain that in turn can drive the development and maintenance of alcohol use disorder (AUD). We provide an update on alcohol research, focusing on multiple levels of alcohol-induced adaptations, from intracellular changes to changes in neural circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The many layers of BOLD. On the contribution of different vascular compartments to laminar fMRI.</a></h4>

              
                Ultra-high field functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) offers the spatial resolution to measure neural activity at the scale of cortical layers. Most fMRI studies make use of the Blood-Oxygen-Level Dependent (BOLD) signal, arising from a complex interaction of changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and volume (CBV), and venous oxygenation. However, along with cyto- and myeloarchitectural changes across cortical depth, laminar fMRI is confronted with additional confounds related to vascularization differences that exist across cortical depth. In the current study, we quantify how the non-uniform distribution of macro- and micro-vascular compartments, as measured with Gradient-Echo (GE) and Spin-Echo (SE) scan sequences, respectively, affect laminar BOLD fMRI responses following evoked hypercapnic and hyperoxic breathing conditions. We find that both macro- and micro-vascular compartments are capable of comparable theoretical maximum signal intensities, as represented by the M-scaling parameter. However, the capacity for vessel dilation, as reflected by the cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), is approximately three times larger for the macro- compared to the micro-vasculature at superficial layers. Finally, there is roughly a 35% difference in CBV estimates between the macro- and micro-vascular compartments, although this relative difference is approximately uniform across cortical depth.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Evaluating test-retest reliability and sex/age-related effects on temporal clustering coefficient of dynamic functional brain networks</a></h4>

              
                The multilayer dynamic network model has been proposed as an effective method to understand how the brain functions dynamically. Specially, derived from the definition of clustering coefficient in static networks, the temporal clustering coefficient provides a direct measure of topological stability of dynamic brain networks and shows potential in predicting altered brain functions in both normal and pathological conditions. However, test-retest reliability and demographic-related effects on this measure remain to be evaluated. Using a publicly available dataset from the Human Connectome Project consisting of 337 young healthy adults (157 males/180 females; 22 to 37 years old), the present study investigated: (1) the test-retest reliability of temporal clustering coefficient across four repeated resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans as measured by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC); and (2) sex- and age-related effects on temporal clustering coefficient. The results showed that (1) the temporal clustering coefficient had overall moderate test-retest reliability (ICC > 0.40 over a wide range of densities) at both global and subnetwork levels; (2) female subjects showed significantly higher temporal clustering coefficient than males at both global and subnetwork levels, in particular within the default-mode and subcortical regions; (3) temporal clustering coefficient of the subcortical subnetwork was negatively correlated with age in young adults. Our findings suggest that temporal clustering coefficient is a reliable and reproducible approach for the identification of individual differences in brain function, and provide evidence for sex and age effects on human brain dynamic connectome.

                The crustacean cardiac ganglion (CG) network coordinates the rhythmic contractions of the heart muscle to control the circulation of blood. The network consists of 9 cells, 5 large motor cells (LC1-5) and 4 small endogenous pacemaker cells (SCs). We report a new three-compartmental biophysical model of an LC that is morphologically realistic and includes provision for inputs from the SCs via a gap-junction coupled spike-initiation-zone (SIZ) compartments. To determine physiologically viable LC models in this realistic configuration, maximal conductances in three compartments of an LC are determined by random sampling from a biologically-characterized 9D-parameter space, followed by a three stage rejection protocol that checks for conformity with electrophysiological features from single cell traces. LC models that pass the single cell rejection protocol are then incorporated into a network model which is then used in a final rejection protocol stage. Using disparate experimental data, the study provides hitherto unknown structure-function insights related to the crustacean cardiac ganglion large cell, including predictions about morphology including the role of its SIZ, and the differential roles of active conductances in the three compartments. Further, we extend analyses of emergent conductance relationships and correlations in model neurons relative to their biological counterparts, allowing us to make inferences both with respect to the biological system as well as the implications of the ability to detect such relationships in populations of model neurons going forward.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Feature representation under crowding in V1 and V4 neuronal populations</a></h4>

              
                Visual perception depends strongly on spatial context. A profound example is visual crowding, whereby the presence of nearby stimuli impairs discriminability of object features. Despite extensive work on both perceptual crowding and the spatial integrative properties of visual cortical neurons, the link between these two aspects of visual processing remains unclear. To understand better the neural basis of crowding, we recorded simultaneously from neuronal populations in V1 and V4 of fixating macaque monkeys. We assessed the information about the orientation of a visual target available from the measured responses, both for targets presented in isolation and amid distractors. Both single neuron and population responses had less information about target orientation when distractors were present. Information loss was moderate in V1 and more substantial in V4. Information loss could be traced to systematic divisive and additive changes in neuronal tuning. Tuning changes were more severe in V4; in addition, tuning exhibited greater context-dependent distortions in V4, further restricting the ability of a fixed sensory readout strategy to extract accurate feature information across changing environments. Our results provide a direct test of crowding effects at different stages of the visual hierarchy, reveal how these effects alter the spiking activity of cortical populations by which sensory stimuli are encoded, and connect these changes to established mechanisms of neuronal spatial integration.

                Identifying the structure of motion relations in the environment is critical for navigation, tracking, prediction, and pursuit. Yet, little is known about the mental and neural computations that allow the visual system to infer this structure online from a volatile stream of visual information. We propose online hierarchical Bayesian inference as a principled solution for how the brain might solve this complex perceptual task. We derive an online Expectation-Maximization algorithm that explains human percepts qualitatively and quantitatively for a diverse set of stimuli, covering classical psychophysics experiments, ambiguous motion scenes, and illusory motion displays. We thereby identify normative explanations for the origin of human motion structure perception and make testable predictions for new psychophysics experiments. The algorithm furthermore affords a neural network implementation which shares properties with motion-sensitive cortical areas and motivates a novel class of experiments to reveal the neural representations of latent structure.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Allosteric stabilization of calcium and lipid binding engages three synaptotagmins in fast exocytosis</a></h4>

              
                The release of neurotransmitters from presynaptic terminals is a strongly Ca2+-dependent process controlled by synaptotagmins, especially by their C2B domains. Biochemical measurements have reported Ca2+ affinities of synaptotagmin too low to account for synaptic function. However, binding of the C2B domain to the membrane phospholipid PI(4,5)P2 increases the Ca2+ affinity and vice versa, indicating a positive allosteric stabilization of simultaneous binding. Here, we construct a mathematical model of the release-triggering mechanism of synaptotagmin based on measured Ca2+/PI(4,5)P2 affinities and reported protein copy numbers. The model reproduced the kinetics of synaptic transmission observed at the calyx of Held over the full range of Ca2+ stimuli, with each C2B domain crosslinking Ca2+ and PI(4,5)P2 lowering the energy barrier for fusion by 4.85 kBT. The allosteric stabilization of simultaneous Ca2+ and PI(4,5)P2 binding was crucial to form multiple crosslinks which enabled fast fusion rates. Only three crosslinking C2B domains were needed to reproduce physiological responses, but high copy numbers per vesicle sped up the collision-limited formation of crosslinks. In silico evaluation of theoretical mutants revealed that affection of the allosteric properties might be a determinant of the severity of synaptotagmin mutations and may underlie dominant-negative, disease-causing effects. We conclude that allostericity is a crucial feature of synaptotagmin action.

                The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) forms a continuous and dynamic network throughout a neuron, extending from dendrites to axon terminals, and axonal ER dysfunction is implicated in several neurological disorders. In addition, tight junctions between the ER and plasma membrane (PM) are formed by several molecules including Kv2 channels, but the cellular functions of many ER-PM junctions remain unknown. Dynamic Ca2+ uptake into the ER during electrical activity plays an essential role in synaptic transmission as failure to allow rapid ER Ca2+ filling during stimulation activates stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) and decreases both presynaptic Ca2+ influx and synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Our experiments demonstrate that Kv2.1 channels are necessary for enabling ER Ca2+ uptake during electrical activity as genetic depletion of Kv2.1 rendered both the somatic and axonal ER unable to accumulate Ca2+ during electrical stimulation. Moreover, our experiments show that the loss of Kv2.1 in the axon impairs synaptic vesicle fusion during stimulation via a mechanism unrelated to modulation of membrane voltage. Thus, our data demonstrate that the non-conducting role of Kv2.1 in forming stable junctions between the ER and PM via ER VAMP-associated protein (VAP) binding couples ER Ca2+ uptake with electrical activity. Our results further suggest that Kv2.1 has a critical function in neuronal cell biology for Ca2+-handling independent of voltage and reveals a novel and critical pathway for maintaining ER lumen Ca2+ levels and efficient neurotransmitter release. Taken together these findings reveal an essential non-classical role for both Kv2.1 and the ER-PM junctions in synaptic transmission.

                Homeostatic and circadian processes collaborate to appropriately time and consolidate sleep and wake. To understand how these processes are integrated, we scheduled brief sleep deprivation at different times of day in Drosophila and find elevated morning rebound compared to evening. These effects depend on discrete morning and evening clock neurons, independent of their roles in circadian locomotor activity. In the R5 ellipsoid body sleep homeostat, we identified elevated morning expression of activity dependent and presynaptic gene expression as well as the presynaptic protein BRUCHPILOT consistent with regulation by clock circuits. These neurons also display elevated calcium levels in response to sleep loss in the morning, but not the evening consistent with the observed time-dependent sleep rebound. These studies reveal the circuit and molecular mechanisms by which discrete circadian clock neurons program a homeostatic sleep center.

                Dynamic re-configuration of circuit function subserves the flexibility of innate behaviours tuned to physiological states. Internal energy stores adaptively regulate feeding-associated behaviours by integrating opposing hunger and satiety signals at the level of neural circuits. Across vertebrate lineages, the neuropeptides CART and NPY have potent anorexic and orexic functions, respectively, and show energy state-dependent expression in interoceptive neurons. However, how the antagonistic activities of these peptides modulate circuit plasticity remain unclear. Using behavioural, neuroanatomical and activity analysis in adult zebrafish, along with pharmacological interventions, we show that CART and NPY activities converge on a population of neurons in the dorsomedial telencephalon (Dm). While CART facilitates glutamatergic neurotransmission at the Dm, NPY dampens the response to glutamate. In energy-rich states, CART enhances NMDA receptor (NMDAR) function by PKA/PKC mediated phosphorylation of the NR1 subunit of the NMDAR complex. Conversely, starvation triggers NPY-mediated reduction in phosphorylated NR1 via calcineurin activation and inhibition of cAMP production leading to reduced responsiveness to glutamate. Our data identify convergent integration of CART and NPY inputs by the Dm neurons to generate nutritional state-dependent circuit plasticity that is correlated with the behavioural switch induced by the opposing actions of satiety and hunger signals.

                Hundreds of genes have been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. Previous studies have indicated that some phenotypes caused by decreased developmental function of select risk genes can be reversed by restoring gene function in adulthood. However, very few risk genes have been assessed for adult reversibility. We developed a strategy to rapidly assess the temporal requirements and phenotypic reversibility of neurodevelopmental disorder risk gene orthologs using a conditional protein degradation system and machine vision phenotypic profiling in Caenorhabditis elegans. Using this approach, we measured the effects of degrading and re-expressing orthologs of 3 neurodevelopmental risk genes EBF3, BRN3A, and DYNC1H1 across 30 morphological, locomotor, sensory, and learning phenotypes at multiple timepoints throughout development. We found some degree of phenotypic reversibility was possible for each gene studied. However, the temporal requirements of gene function and degree of phenotypic reversibility varied by gene and phenotype. The data reflects the dynamic nature of gene function and the importance of using multiple time windows of degradation and re-expression to understand the many roles a gene can play over developmental time. This work also demonstrates a strategy of using a high-throughput model system to investigate temporal requirements of gene function across a large number of phenotypes to rapidly prioritize neurodevelopmental disorder genes for re-expression studies in other organisms.

                Neuronal spiking activity is routinely recorded using genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs), but calcium imaging is limited in temporal resolution and does not report subthreshold voltage changes. Genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) offer better temporal resolution and subthreshold sensitivity, but spike detection with fast GEVIs has required specialized imaging equipment. Here, we report the ASAP4 subfamily of genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) that brighten in response to membrane depolarization, inverting the fluorescence-voltage relationship of previous ASAP GEVIs. Two variants, ASAP4b and ASAP4e, feature 128% and 178% fluorescence increases over 100-mV of depolarization, respectively, facilitating spike detection in single trials in vivo with standard 1 and 2-photon imaging systems. Simultaneous voltage and calcium imaging confirms improved temporal resolution and spike discernment by ASAP4 GEVIs. Thus, positively tuned ASAP4 voltage indicators enable recording of neuronal spiking activity using similar equipment as calcium imaging, while providing higher temporal resolution.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Safb1 regulates cell fate determination in adult neural stem cells by enhancing Drosha cleavage of NFIB mRNA</a></h4>

              
                During brain homeostasis, stem cell fate determination is crucial to guarantee function, adaptation and regeneration while preventing neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. How neural stem cells (NSCs) are instructed to generate neurons or glia is not well understood. Here we addressed how fate is resolved in multipotent adult hippocampal NSCs, and identify Scaffold Attachment Factor B1 (Safb1) as a determinant of neuron production by blocking glial commitment. Safb1 is sufficient to block oligodendrocytic differentiation of NSCs by preventing expression of the transcription factor NFIB at the post-transcriptional level. Detailed interrogation of the Drosha interactome and functional validation revealed that Safb1 enhances NFIB mRNA cleavage in a Drosha-dependent fashion. Thus, our study provides a cellular mechanism for selective NSC fate regulation by post-transcriptional destabilization of mRNAs. Given the importance of NSC maintenance and fate determination in the adult brain, our findings have major implications for cell-specific gene expression, brain disease and aging.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hippocampal spatio-temporal cognitive maps adaptively guide reward generalization</a></h4>

              
                The brain forms cognitive maps of relational knowledge, an organizing principle thought to underlie our ability to generalize and make inferences. However, how can a relevant map be selected in situations where a stimulus is embedded in multiple relational structures? Here, we find that both spatial and temporal cognitive maps influence generalization in a choice task, where spatial location determines reward magnitude. Mirroring behavior, the hippocampus not only builds a map of spatial relationships but also encodes temporal distances. As the task progresses, participants' choices become more influenced by spatial relationships, reflected in a strengthening of the spatial and a weakening of the temporal map. This change is driven by orbitofrontal cortex, which represents the evidence that an observed outcome is generated from the spatial rather than the temporal map and updates hippocampal representations accordingly. Taken together, this demonstrates how hippocampal cognitive maps are used and updated flexibly for inference.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Developmental Dynamics of RNA Translation in the Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                The precise regulation of gene expression is fundamental to neurodevelopment, plasticity, and cognitive function. While several studies have deeply profiled mRNA dynamics in the developing human brain, there is a fundamental gap in our understanding of accompanying translational regulation. We perform ribosome profiling from more than 70 human prenatal and adult cortex samples across ontogeny and into adulthood, mapping translation events at nucleotide resolution. In addition to characterizing the translational regulation of annotated open reading frames (ORFs), we identify thousands of previously unknown translation events, including small open reading frames (sORFs) that give rise to human- and/or brain-specific microproteins, many of which we independently verify using size-selected proteomics. Ribosome profiling in stem cell-derived human neuronal cultures further corroborates these findings and shows that several neuronal activity-induced long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), including LINC00473, a primate-specific lncRNA implicated in depression, encode previously undescribed microproteins. Physicochemical analysis of these brain microproteinss identifies a large class harboring arginine-glycine-glycine (RGG) repeats as strong candidates for regulating RNA metabolism. Moreover, we find that, collectively, these previously unknown human brain sORFs are enriched for variants associated with schizophrenia. In addition to significantly expanding the translational landscape of the developing brain, this atlas will serve as a rich resource for the annotation and functional interrogation of thousands of previously unknown brain-specific protein products.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reduced context updating but intact visual priors in autism</a></h4>

              
                A general consensus persists that sensory-perceptual differences in autism, such as hypersensitivities to light or sound, result from an overreliance on new (rather than prior) sensory observations. However, conflicting Bayesian accounts of autism remain unresolved as to whether such alterations are caused by more precise sensory observations (precise likelihood model) or by forming a less precise model of the sensory context (hypo-priors model). We used a decision-under-uncertainty paradigm that manipulated uncertainty in both likelihoods and priors. Contrary to model predictions we found no differences in reliance on likelihood in autistic group (AS) compared to neurotypicals (NT) and found no differences in subjective prior variance between groups. However, we found reduced context adjustment in the AS group compared to NT. Further, the AS group showed heightened variability in their relative weighting of sensory information (vs. prior) on a trial-by-trial basis. When participants were aligned on a continuum of autistic traits, we found no associations with likelihood reliance or prior variance but found an increased likelihood precision with autistic traits. These findings together provide empirical evidence for intact priors, precise likelihood, reduced context updating and heightened variability during sensory learning in autism.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Higher synaptic threshold for NMDA spike generation in human neurons</a></h4>

              
                Neurons receive synaptic input primarily onto their dendrites. While we know much about the electrical properties of dendrites in rodents, we have only just started to describe their properties in the human brain. Here we investigate the capacity of human neurons to generate NMDA spikes. We find that dendritic iontophoresis of glutamate, as well as local dendritic synaptic stimulation, can evoke NMDA spikes in dendrites of human layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons. Surprisingly, however, the capacity to evoke NMDA spikes in human neurons was significantly reduced compared to that in rodent neurons. Simulations in morphologically realistic models indicated that human neurons have a higher synaptic threshold for NMDA spike generation. Using a simplified model, we show that this is primarily due to the larger diameter of human dendrites. In summary, we find reduced NMDA spike generation in human compared to rodent neurons due to the larger diameter of human dendrites.

                Human understanding of the world can change rapidly when new information comes to light, such as when a plot twist occurs in a work of fiction. This flexible knowledge assembly requires few-shot reorganisation of neural codes for relations among objects and events. However, existing computational theories are largely silent about how this could occur. Here, participants learned a transitive ordering among novel objects within two distinct contexts, before exposure to new knowledge revealing how the contexts were linked. BOLD signals in dorsal frontoparietal cortical areas revealed that objects were rapidly and dramatically rearranged on the neural manifold after minimal exposure to the linking information. We then adapt stochastic online gradient descent to permit similar rapid knowledge assembly in a neural network model.

	<p>Background: Early biomarkers of prodromal Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are critical both to initiate interventions and to choose participants for clinical trials. Odor threshold, odor identification and odor familiarity are impaired in AD. Methods: We investigated the relative abilities of standard screening (MMSE) and olfactory measures to predict transitions from cognitively normal (CN) to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), from CN to AD, and MCI to AD. The archival sample of 497, from the UCSD ADRC, included participants who were CN, MCI, AD and converters to MCI or AD. Apoe ε4 status, a genetic risk factor, was available for 256 participants, 132 were ε4 carriers. A receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) curve plots the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. Area under the ROC curve (AUC) was used to determine diagnostic accuracy. Results: Different measures were better predictors at specific stages of disease risk; e.g., odor familiarity, odor identification and the combination showed higher predictive value for converting from MCI to AD in ε4 carriers than the MMSE. Combining odor familiarity and odor identification produced an AUC of 1.0 in ε4 carriers, MMSE alone was 0.58. Conclusions: Olfactory biomarkers show real promise as non-invasive indicators of prodromal AD. The results support the value of combining olfactory measures in assessment of risk for conversion to MCI and to AD.</p>

	<p>Objective: The effectiveness of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) for residual seizures after corpus callosotomy (CC) has not yet been fully investigated. We hypothesized that seizure control would be improved by VNS after CC. The purpose of this study was to compare seizure frequency between patients with implantation of a VNS generator (post-VNS group) or without VNS (non-post-VNS group) following CC. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent CC between January 2009 and May 2019 in our institution. We evaluated proportions of ≥50% reduction in seizure frequency (responders) and seizure reduction rate 1 and 2 years after VNS. To investigate factors related to responders, uni- and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed regarding age, number of anti-seizure medications (ASMs), addition of novel ASMs (levetiracetam, lacosamide or perampanel), and post-VNS or non-post-VNS status. Results: Thirteen post-VNS patients and 24 non-post-VNS patients were analyzed in this study. Responder rate at 1 year after VNS differed significantly between the post-VNS group (53.9%) and non-post-VNS group (12.5%, p = 0.017). Number of ASMs at the time of CC and post-VNS were significantly associated with responders in univariate analyses (odds ratio [OR] 0.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.13–0.88, p = 0.025 and OR 8.2, 95%CI 1.6–41.6, p = 0.011, respectively), whereas age, sex, seizure frequency, and addition of novel ASMs were not. In multivariate analysis, the presence of VNS procedures after CC was the only factor favorably associated with responder status (OR 82.2, 95%CI 1.55–4355.7, p = 0.03). Conclusions: VNS therapy after CC may increase the proportion of responders independent of the addition of novel ASMs.</p>

	<p>&amp;amp;nbsp;This study is aimed at the detection of single-trial feedback, perceived as erroneous by the user, using a transferable classification system while conducting a motor imagery brain–computer interfacing (BCI) task. The feedback received by the users are relayed from a functional electrical stimulation (FES) device and hence are somato-sensory in nature. The BCI system designed for this study activates an electrical stimulator placed on the left hand, right hand, left foot, and right foot of the user. Trials containing erroneous feedback can be detected from the neural signals in form of the error related potential (ErrP). The inclusion of neuro-feedback during the experiments indicated the possibility that ErrP signals can be evoked when the participant perceives an error from the feedback. Hence, to detect such feedback using ErrP, a transferable (offline) decoder based on optimal transport theory is introduced herein. The offline system detects single-trial erroneous trials from the feedback period of an online neuro-feedback BCI system. The results of the FES-based feedback BCI system were compared to a similar visual-based (VIS) feedback system. Using our framework, the error detector systems for both the FES and VIS feedback paradigms achieved an F1-score of 92.66% and 83.10%, respectively, and are significantly superior to a comparative system where an optimal transport was not used. It is expected that this form of transferable and automated error detection system compounded with a motor imagery system will augment the performance of a BCI and provide a better BCI-based neuro-rehabilitation protocol that has an error control mechanism embedded into it.&amp;amp;nbsp;</p>

	<p>Affective computing systems can decode cortical activities to facilitate emotional human–computer interaction. However, personalities exist in neurophysiological responses among different users of the brain–computer interface leads to a difficulty for designing a generic emotion recognizer that is adaptable to a novel individual. It thus brings an obstacle to achieve cross-subject emotion recognition (ER). To tackle this issue, in this study we propose a novel feature selection method, manifold feature fusion and dynamical feature selection (MF-DFS), under transfer learning principle to determine generalizable features that are stably sensitive to emotional variations. The MF-DFS framework takes the advantages of local geometrical information feature selection, domain adaptation based manifold learning, and dynamical feature selection to enhance the accuracy of the ER system. Based on three public databases, DEAP, MAHNOB-HCI and SEED, the performance of the MF-DFS is validated according to the leave-one-subject-out paradigm under two types of electroencephalography features. By defining three emotional classes of each affective dimension, the accuracy of the MF-DFS-based ER classifier is achieved at 0.50–0.48 (DEAP) and 0.46–0.50 (MAHNOBHCI) for arousal and valence emotional dimensions, respectively. For the SEED database, it achieves 0.40 for the valence dimension. The corresponding accuracy is significantly superior to several classical feature selection methods on multiple machine learning models.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">A Novel Neuron-Specific Regulator of the V-ATPase in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The V-ATPase is a highly conserved enzymatic complex that ensures appropriate levels of organelle acidification in virtually all eukaryotic cells. While the general mechanisms of this proton pump have been well studied, little is known about the specific regulations of neuronal V-ATPase. Here, we studied CG31030, a previously uncharacterized <I>Drosophila</I> protein predicted from its sequence homology to be part of the V-ATPase family. In contrast to its ortholog ATP6AP1/VhaAC45 which is ubiquitous, we observed that CG31030 expression is apparently restricted to all neurons, and using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene tagging, that it is mainly addressed to synaptic terminals. In addition, we observed that CG31030 is essential for fly survival and that this protein co-immunoprecipitates with identified V-ATPase subunits, and in particular ATP6AP2. Using a genetically-encoded pH probe (VMAT-pHluorin) and electrophysiological recordings at the larval neuromuscular junction, we show that <I>CG31030</I> knock-down induces a major defect in synaptic vesicle acidification and a decrease in quantal size, which is the amplitude of the postsynaptic response to the release of a single synaptic vesicle. These defects were associated with severe locomotor impairments. Overall, our data indicate that CG31030, which we renamed VhaAC45-related protein (VhaAC45RP), is a specific regulator of neuronal V-ATPase in <I>Drosophila</I> that is required for proper synaptic vesicle acidification and neurotransmitter release.</p>

                Fabry disease (FD) is an ultra-rare genetic lysosomal storage disease caused by pathologic gene variants resulting in insufficient expression of α-galactosidase A. This enzyme deficiency leads to accumulation of globotriaosylceramide and globotriaosylsphingosine in plasma and in different cells throughout the body, causing major cardiovascular, renal, and nervous system complications. Until 2018, reimbursed enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for FD was available in all European Union countries except Poland.             We present the preliminary results of the first two years of reimbursed ERT in Poland. We obtained data from the seven largest academic centers in Katowice, Cracow, Wrocław, Poznań, Gdańsk, Warsaw, and Łódź. The questionnaire included the following data: number of patients treated, number of patients qualified for ERT, and patient characteristics.             All centers returned completed questionnaires that included data for a total of 71 patients (28 men and 43 women) as of June 2021. Thirty-five patients with the diagnosis of FD confirmed by genetic testing (22 men and 13 women) had already qualified for reimbursed ERT. Mean (SD) age at the commencement of the ERT program was 39.6 (15.5) years (range 18-79 years). Mean time from the first clinical symptoms reported by the patients to the FD diagnosis was 21.1 (8.9) years, and the mean time from the final diagnosis of FD to the beginning of ERT was 4.7 (4.6) years.             FD is still underdiagnosed in Poland. To identify undiagnosed FD patients and to ensure that patients in Poland benefit fully from ERT, implementation of an effective nationwide screening strategy and close cooperation with a network of rare disease centers is advised.

                Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has been rapidly spreading. Several guideline therapies have been proposed as a possible treatment for SARS-CoV-2, however, these therapies are not sufficient to treat a severe condition of SARS-CoV-2 infection characterised by the increase of D-dimer and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and patchy ground-glass opacities (GGOs). Secretome-mesenchymal stem cells (S-MSCs) produced by MSCs under hypoxia could excessively release several anti-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors to control the COVID-19 cytokine storm and accelerate lung injury improvement. This is the first study investigating the clinical outcomes of three severe COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit of three different hospitals in Indonesia treated with S-MSCs. The decrease of D-dimer and CRP level was reported for all patients treated with S-MSCs. This was in line with improvement of pulmonary radiology, blood gas level, and hematologic assessment. In conclusion, these cases suggest that S-MSCs could effectively control D-dimer, CRP level and GGOs of severe COVID-19 patients associated with recovered pulmonary function.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">CAMAP: Artificial neural networks unveil the role of codon arrangement in modulating MHC-I peptides presentation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tariq Daouda, Maude Dumont-Lagacé, Albert Feghaly, Yahya Benslimane, Rébecca Panes, Mathieu Courcelles, Mohamed Benhammadi, Lea Harrington, Pierre Thibault, François Major, Yoshua Bengio, Étienne Gagnon, Sébastien Lemieux, Claude Perreault</p>

MHC-I associated peptides (MAPs) play a central role in the elimination of virus-infected and neoplastic cells by CD8 T cells. However, accurately predicting the MAP repertoire remains difficult, because only a fraction of the transcriptome generates MAPs. In this study, we investigated whether codon arrangement (usage and placement) regulates MAP biogenesis. We developed an artificial neural network called Codon Arrangement MAP Predictor (CAMAP), predicting MAP presentation solely from mRNA sequences flanking the MAP-coding codons (MCCs), while excluding the MCC <i>per se</i>. CAMAP predictions were significantly more accurate when using original codon sequences than shuffled codon sequences which reflect amino acid usage. Furthermore, predictions were independent of mRNA expression and MAP binding affinity to MHC-I molecules and applied to several cell types and species. Combining MAP ligand scores, transcript expression level and CAMAP scores was particularly useful to increase MAP prediction accuracy. Using an <i>in vitro</i> assay, we showed that varying the synonymous codons in the regions flanking the MCCs (without changing the amino acid sequence) resulted in significant modulation of MAP presentation at the cell surface. Taken together, our results demonstrate the role of codon arrangement in the regulation of MAP presentation and support integration of both translational and post-translational events in predictive algorithms to ameliorate modeling of the immunopeptidome.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">PaIRKAT: A pathway integrated regression-based kernel association test with applications to metabolomics and COPD phenotypes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Charlie M. Carpenter, Weiming Zhang, Lucas Gillenwater, Cameron Severn, Tusharkanti Ghosh, Russell Bowler, Katerina Kechris, Debashis Ghosh</p>

High-throughput data such as metabolomics, genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics have become familiar data types within the “-omics” family. For this work, we focus on subsets that interact with one another and represent these “pathways” as graphs. Observed pathways often have disjoint components, i.e., nodes or sets of nodes (metabolites, etc.) not connected to any other within the pathway, which notably lessens testing power. In this paper we propose the Pathway Integrated Regression-based Kernel Association Test (PaIRKAT), a new kernel machine regression method for incorporating known pathway information into the semi-parametric kernel regression framework. This work extends previous kernel machine approaches. This paper also contributes an application of a graph kernel regularization method for overcoming disconnected pathways. By incorporating a regularized or “smoothed” graph into a score test, PaIRKAT can provide more powerful tests for associations between biological pathways and phenotypes of interest and will be helpful in identifying novel pathways for targeted clinical research. We evaluate this method through several simulation studies and an application to real metabolomics data from the COPDGene study. Our simulation studies illustrate the robustness of this method to incorrect and incomplete pathway knowledge, and the real data analysis shows meaningful improvements of testing power in pathways. PaIRKAT was developed for application to metabolomic pathway data, but the techniques are easily generalizable to other data sources with a graph-like structure.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Optimal design for a psychosocial intervention on severely acute malnourished children in humanitarian settings: results of an expert survey [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Common psychosocial interventions focus on feeding, stimulation, emotional responsiveness and childcare and parenting. Inclusion of such a component in the outpatient management of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) children is recommended. However, clinical assessment of such interventions is tedious in humanitarian settings and modalities evidence on the impact of psychosocial interventions alongside nutrition protocol for SAM is scarce.  This survey aimed to gather expert opinions on the optimal design of a combined psychosocial and nutrition intervention feasible in humanitarian settings. Methods: From March to May 2018, an online survey was emailed to international experts in nutrition and mental health and psychosocial support, mainly from academia and international non-governmental organisations (INGOs). It included multiple choices questions on the key components of an optimal combined intervention. Results: Of the 76 experts targeted, 20 responded. 11 (55%) belonged to INGOs, 2 (10%) to academia, and 4 (20%) to international organizations and donors. For most respondents, a combined intervention should be provided in weekly 45-minuites counselling sessions, provided individually (rather than in a group) and at home (rather than at a health center). None of the proposed ideal duration (two, four or six months) gained the majority of votes. Experts thought that 35% staff training should be in “Active listening for psychosocial support”, and 30% in “Early child development”, 25% in “Maternal depression” and 9% in “Anthropometric measurements”. They estimated that a combined intervention could improve SAM recovery rate by 10% (min-max: 0-19%) vs. the nutritional protocol alone. Qualitative results highlighted the importance of tailoring the intervention to the individual, the population and the settings; as well as considering feasibility and scalability at the design stage. Conclusion: These findings could guide further research on the impact of psychosocial interventions on SAM children’s health and development, and help designing innovative approaches to treat undernutrition.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effectiveness of acute L-arginine supplementation on physical performance in strength training: a systematic review and meta-analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The oral administration of L-arginine has been related to improved physical performance due to a likely reduction in muscle fatigue, resulting from the vasodilator effect of nitric oxide on skeletal muscle. However, there is no precise and quantitative analysis of the information in the literature. The main objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of L-arginine supplementation on physical performance in strength training with a systematic review and meta-analysis. We hypothesized that L-arginine supplementation would improve performance capacity and the effects involved in strength training. Methods: The study period was from 2010 to 2020. The inclusion process established articles with well-designed human experiments that included only L-arginine supplementation (without any additional compounds) testing the effects of L-arginine supplementation on sports performance related to strength training; identical experimental conditions in placebo or control group; and publications in the last ten years (until December 31, 2020). Three studies were included that compared L-arginine supplementation with placebo in anaerobic performance tests. Test analysis supplementation with other supplements was removed and there was no gender, age, and ethnicity level. Results: There was no significant heterogeneity (p>0.05) in the analysis of the three selected articles and the effects of L-arginine supplementation in muscular endurance; performance had a mean of 0.26 (95% CI = -0.129; 0.649; p = 0.190), peak torque with a mean of -0.002 (95% CI = -0.531; 0.527; p = 0. 99) of the third series of exercises and, furthermore, when comparing the integrated effect (resistance rate with the peak torque) there was no difference with a mean of 0.168 (95% CI = -0.145; 0.481; p = 0.292). Conclusions: Acute L-arginine supplementation provides no ergogenic effect on strength training performance.

                Although the antimicrobial potential of nitric oxide (NO) is widely published, it is little used clinically. NO is a key signalling molecule modulating vascular, neuronal, inflammatory and immune responses. Endogenous antimicrobial activity is largely mediated by high local NO concentrations produced by cellular inducible nitric oxide synthase, and by derivative reactive nitrogen oxide species including peroxynitrite and S-nitrosothiols. NO may be taken as dietary substrate (inorganic nitrate, L-arginine), and therapeutically as gaseous NO, and transdermal, sublingual, oral, intranasal and intravenous nitrite or nitrate. Numerous preclinical studies have demonstrated that NO has generic static and cidal activities against viruses (including β-coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2), bacteria, protozoa and fungi/yeasts in vitro. Therapeutic effects have been seen in animal models in vivo, and phase II trials have demonstrated that NO donors can reduce microbial infection. Nevertheless, excess NO, as occurs in septic shock, is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. In view of the dose-dependent positive and negative effects of NO, safety and efficacy trials of NO and its donors are needed for assessing their role in the prevention and treatment of infections. Trials should test dietary inorganic nitrate for pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis and gaseous NO or oral, topical or intravenous nitrite and nitrate for treatment of mild-to-severe infections, including due to SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). This review summarises the evidence base from in vitro, in vivo and early phase clinical studies of NO activity in viral, bacterial, protozoal and fungal infections.

                Currently, the studies on sexual abuse trauma, and resilience in Confucian survivors are still limited. The purpose of this study is to explore the resilience of Confucian women after sexual abuse trauma to provide evidence to support in counseling and psychotherapy practices. The article describes the resiliency story of a Vietnamese Confucian female survivor who was abused by her brother from the age of 8 to 16. The life history approach used in qualitative narrative research was applied in this study. The researcher identified two factors that strongly influence the survivor’s resilience: (1) the effectiveness of passive education in the general education curriculum is oriented to both competence and quality development; and (2) an authentic understanding of the core Confucian philosophical doctrine: the neutrality and the self-nurture. Based on the findings, we propose a 7-stage flow diagram of a Confucian women's resilience following sexual abuse. These findings provide important evidence-based practice for counselors and clinicians in supporting and intervening for sexually abused Confucian women and contribute to the impact of studies on religious and spiritual factors affecting the resilience of sexual abuse survivors.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Pneumococcal carriage and antibiotic susceptibility patterns in mother-baby pairs in a rural community in Eastern Uganda: a cross-sectional study [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Pneumococcal carriage predisposes children to pneumonia. Pneumonia poses a significant threat to the lives of children below five years old worldwide, contributing to a high number of hospitalizations and death. Morbidity and morbidity are especially common in children under five and the elderly, although any age group can be affected. This study aimed to estimate pneumococcal carriage and determine antibiotic susceptibility patterns of the pneumococci isolated from mother-baby pairs in Ngora district after the rollout of the pneumococcal vaccine. We hypothesized that high carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae in mothers leads to carriage in their babies and hence a greater chance of contracting pneumonia. Methods: Consecutive sampling was used to select 152 mother-baby pairs from community visits and those seeking care at the health facility. We collected nasal swabs from both baby and mother for culture and sensitivity testing using Kirby-Bauer’s agar disc diffusion method. Data was also collected from the mothers who consented to take part in the study, using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Results: This study found that there was a low prevalence of pneumococcal carriage in the mother-baby pair in the Ngora district. Only one mother-baby pair (1/152) was found to be colonized with pneumococci in both mother and baby and the rest of S. pneumoniae colonized either the mother or baby. We also observed high rates of microbial resistance to penicillin, which is the first-line drug for the management of pneumonia in Uganda. Also, high resistance patterns were recorded with chloramphenicol (50%) and tetracycline (50%), whereas the lowest resistance was recorded in clindamycin (17%). Conclusions: The relationship between pneumococcal carriage and immunization status suggests that the pneumococcal vaccine is protective against the pneumococcal carriage. Resistance of S. pneumoniae to commonly used antibiotics was high.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prospective cohort study of the predictive value of inflammatory biomarkers over clinical variables in children and young people with cancer presenting with fever and neutropenia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Fever during chemotherapy induced neutropenia is a common and potentially life-threatening complication of the treatment of childhood cancer. Predictions of poor outcome could be enhanced by incorporating serum biomarkers of inflammation at presentation and reassessment. Methods A prospective cohort study was conducted of children under 18 years old, being treated for cancer or a cancer-like condition, who presented with fever (≥ 38.0°C) and neutropenia (neutrophil count < 0.5*109/L). Clinical features were recorded, along with three experimental inflammatory biomarkers: procalcitonin (PCT), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8). Outcomes included serious medical complications (SMC): any infection related mortality, critical care and organ support, severe sepsis, septic shock, significant microbiologically defined infection, or radiologically confirmed pneumonia. Results Biomarker assessments were undertaken in 43 episodes of fever and neutropenia, from 31 patients aged between four months and 17 years old (median six years): 20 were female and 22 had acute leukaemia. Five episodes of SMC were noted. PCT, IL-6 and IL-8 had poor individual discriminatory ability (C-statistic 0.48 to 0.60) and did not add to the value of clinical risk stratification tools. Insufficient data were collected to formally assess the value of repeated assessments. Conclusions Incorporating serum biomarkers of inflammation at presentation of episodes of fever with neutropenia in childhood does not clearly improve risk stratification. Repeated assessments over time may be of value.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Breastfeeding assessment tools for at-risk and malnourished infants aged under 6 months old: a systematic review [version 2; peer review: 3 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Many small and malnourished infants under 6 months of age have problems with breastfeeding and restoring effective exclusive breastfeeding is a common treatment goal. Assessment is a critical first step of case management, but most malnutrition guidelines do not specify how best to do this. We aimed to identify breastfeeding assessment tools for use in assessing at-risk and malnourished infants in resource-poor settings. Methods: We systematically searched: Medline and Embase; Web of Knowledge; Cochrane Reviews; Eldis and Google Scholar databases. Also the World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF), CAse REport guidelines, Emergency Nutrition Network, and Field Exchange websites. Assessment tool content was analysed using a framework describing breastfeeding ‘domains’ (baby’s behaviour; mother’s behaviour; position; latching; effective feeding; breast health; baby’s health; mother’s view of  feed; number, timing and length of feeds). Results: We identified 29 breastfeeding assessment tools and 45 validation studies. Eight tools had not been validated. Evidence underpinning most tools was low quality and mainly from high-income countries and hospital settings. The most comprehensive tools were the Breastfeeding, Evaluation and Education Tool, UNICEF Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative tools and CARE training package. The tool with the strongest evidence was the WHO/UNICEF B-R-E-A-S-T-Feed Observation Form. Conclusions: Despite many possible tools, there is currently no one gold standard. For assessing malnourished infants in resource-poor settings, UNICEF Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative tools, Module IFE and the WHO/UNICEF B-R-E-A-S-T-Feed Observation Form are the best available tools but could be improved by adding questions from other tools. Allowing for context, one tool for rapid community-based assessment plus a more detailed one for clinic/hospital assessment might help optimally identify breastfeeding problems and the support required. Further research is important to refine existing tools and develop new ones. Rigorous testing, especially against outcomes such as breastfeeding status and growth, is key.

     alt="Mapping the corticoreticular pathway from cortex-wide anterograde axonal tracing in the mouse"/>
<p>The mouse corticoreticular pathway (CRP) originates from widespread parts of the cortex, including the primary motor (M1), secondary motor (M2), anterior cingulate, medial prefrontal, and primary somatosensory (S1) areas. Compared with the corticospinal tract, the CRP is more distributed and bilaterally projecting, suggesting greater resilience to complete disruption.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The corticoreticular pathway (CRP) has been implicated as an important mediator of motor recovery and rehabilitation after central nervous system damage. However, its origins, trajectory and laterality are not well understood. This study mapped the mouse CRP in comparison with the corticospinal tract (CST). We systematically searched the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas (© 2011 Allen Institute for Brain Science) for experiments that used anterograde tracer injections into the right isocortex in mice. For each eligible experiment (<i>N</i> = 607), CRP and CST projection strength were quantified by the tracer volume reaching the reticular formation motor nuclei (RF<sub>motor</sub>) and pyramids, respectively. Tracer density in each brain voxel was also correlated with RF<sub>motor</sub> versus pyramids projection strength to explore the relative trajectories of the CRP and CST. We found significant CRP projections originating from the primary and secondary motor cortices, anterior cingulate, primary somatosensory cortex, and medial prefrontal cortex. Compared with the CST, the CRP had stronger projections from each region except the primary somatosensory cortex. Ipsilateral projections were stronger than contralateral for both tracts (above the pyramidal decussation), but the CRP projected more bilaterally than the CST. The estimated CRP trajectory was anteromedial to the CST in the internal capsule and dorsal to the CST in the brainstem. Our findings reveal a widespread distribution of CRP origins and confirm strong bilateral CRP projections, theoretically increasing the potential for partial sparing after brain lesions and contralesional compensation after unilateral injury.</p>

<p>MS had deleterious effects on a variety of assessments. EE could reverse MS-induced cognitive impairments.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Early-life experiences, including parental care, affect cognitive performance later in life. Being exposed to early-life maternal separation (MS) increases susceptibility to stress-related psychopathology. Previous studies suggest that MS could induce learning and memory impairments. Since enriched environment (EE) provides more opportunities for exploration and social interaction, in the present study we evaluated the effects of a short EE paradigm with a duration of 13 days on cognitive abilities of maternally separated rats (MS; 180 min/day, postnatal day (PND) 1–21) during adolescence in four experimental groups: Control, Control+EE, MS, and MS+EE. Plasma corticosterone (CORT) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels were also measured in experimental animals. We also studied the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the slices of hippocampal CA1 area. The behavioral and electrophysiological assessments were started at PND 35. MS caused higher basal CORT levels in plasma and impaired spatial learning, memory, and social interaction. LTP induction was also impaired in MS rats and plasma BDNF levels were reduced in these animals. MS also induced more anxiety-like behavior. Short EE reduced plasma CORT levels had the potential to improve locomotor activity and anxiety-like behavior in MS+EE rats and reversed MS-induced impairments of spatial learning, memory, and social behavior. LTP induction and plasma BDNF levels were also enhanced in MS+EE rats. We concluded that short EE might be considered as a therapeutic strategy for promoting cognition.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Therapeutic time windows of compounds against NMDA receptors signaling pathways for ischemic stroke</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Much evidence has proved that excitotoxicity induced by excessive release of glutamate contributes largely to damage caused by ischemia. In view of the key role played by NMDA receptors in mediating excitotoxicity, compounds against NMDA receptors signaling pathways have become the most promising type of anti-stroke candidate compounds. However, the limited therapeutic time window for neuroprotection is a key factor preventing NMDA receptor-related compounds from showing efficacy in all clinical trials for ischemic stroke. In this perspective, the determination of therapeutic time windows of these kinds of compounds is useful in ensuring a therapeutic effect and accelerating clinical application. This mini-review discussed the therapeutic time windows of compounds against NMDA receptors signaling pathways, described related influence factors and the status of clinical studies. The purpose of this review is to look for compounds with wide therapeutic time windows and better clinical application prospect.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Visual thalamocortical mechanisms of waking state-dependent activity and alpha oscillations</a></h4>

              
                Nestvogel and McCormick performed intra- and extracellular recordings in the visual thalamus and visual cortex of mice to reveal a crucial role of thalamocortical interactions in shaping movement/arousal-related signals in visual cortex and in regulating a 3–5 Hz oscillation thought to be an evolutionary precursor to the primate alpha rhythm.

                The brain contains multiple maps of visual space that are thought to preserve the 2D spatial relationships established in the retina. Sedigh-Sarvestani et al. discovered a new periodic map structure for visual space in V2 that violates this assumption and reveals an unexpected correspondence with periodic maps of stimulus features.

                Jung et al. show that Vgat-expressing neurons in the lateral hypothalamus are generally required for diverse thermoregulatory behaviors. A subpopulation of these neurons encodes motivational properties of thermal stimuli as well as the behavior itself and is largely separate from caloric reward-encoding subpopulation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A single synonymous nucleotide change impacts the male-killing phenotype of prophage WO gene wmk</a></h4>

              
                <i>Wolbachia</i> are the most widespread bacterial endosymbionts in animals. Within arthropods, these maternally-transmitted bacteria can selfishly hijack host reproductive processes to increase the relative fitness of their transmitting females. One such form of reproductive parasitism called male killing, or the selective killing of infected males, is recapitulated to degrees by transgenic expression of the <i>WO</i>-<i>mediated killing</i> (<i>wmk</i>) gene. Here, we characterize the genotype-phenotype landscape of <i>wmk-</i>induced male killing in <i>D. melanogaster </i>using transgenic expression. While phylogenetically distant <i>wmk</i> homologs induce no sex-ratio bias, closely-related homologs exhibit complex phenotypes spanning no death, male death, or death of all hosts. We demonstrate that alternative start codons, synonymous codons, and notably a single synonymous nucleotide in <i>wmk </i>can ablate killing. These findings reveal previously unrecognized features of transgenic <i>wmk</i>-induced killing and establish new hypotheses for the impacts of post-transcriptional processes in male killing variation. We conclude that synonymous sequence changes are not necessarily silent in nested endosymbiotic interactions with life-or-death consequences.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">mTORC1-induced retinal progenitor cell overproliferation leads to accelerated mitotic aging and degeneration of descendent Müller glia</a></h4>

              
                Retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) divide in limited numbers to generate the cells comprising vertebrate retina. The molecular mechanism that leads RPC to the division limit, however, remains elusive. Here, we find that the hyperactivation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) in an RPC subset by deletion of <i>tuberous sclerosis complex 1 </i>(<i>Tsc1</i>) makes the RPCs arrive at the division limit precociously and produce Müller glia (MG) that degenerate from senescence-associated cell death. We further show the hyperproliferation of <i>Tsc1</i>-deficient RPCs and the degeneration of MG in the mouse retina disappear by concomitant deletion of <i>hypoxia-induced factor 1-</i><i>a</i> (<i>Hif1</i><i>a</i>), which induces glycolytic gene expression to support mTORC1-induced RPC proliferation. Collectively, our results suggest that, by having mTORC1 constitutively active, an RPC divides and exhausts mitotic capacity faster than neighboring RPCs, and thus produces retinal cells that degenerate with aging-related changes.

                Intestinal goblet cells maintain the protective epithelial barrier through mucus secretion and yet sample lumenal substances for immune processing through formation of goblet cell associated antigen passages (GAPs). The cellular biology of GAPs and how these divergent processes are balanced and regulated by goblet cells remains unknown. Using high resolution light and electron microscopy, we found that in mice, GAPs were formed by an acetylcholine (ACh) dependent endocytic event remarkable for delivery of fluid phase cargo retrograde into the trans golgi network and across the cell by transcytosis - in addition to the expected transport of fluid phase cargo by endosomes to multi-vesicular bodies and lysosomes. While ACh also induced goblet cells to secrete mucins, ACh-induced GAP formation and mucin secretion were functionally independent and mediated by different receptors and signaling pathways, enabling goblet cells to differentially regulate these processes to accommodate the dynamically changing demands of the mucosal environment for barrier maintenance and sampling of lumenal substances.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Physical observables to determine the nature of membrane-less cellular sub-compartments</a></h4>

              
                The spatial organization of complex biochemical reactions is essential for the regulation of cellular processes. Membrane-less structures called foci containing high concentrations of specific proteins have been reported in a variety of contexts, but the mechanism of their formation is not fully understood. Several competing mechanisms exist that are difficult to distinguish empirically, including liquid-liquid phase separation, and the trapping of molecules by multiple binding sites. Here we propose a theoretical framework and outline observables to differentiate between these scenarios from single molecule tracking experiments. In the binding site model, we derive relations between the distribution of proteins, their diffusion properties, and their radial displacement. We predict that protein search times can be reduced for targets inside a liquid droplet, but not in an aggregate of slowly moving binding sites. We use our results to reject the multiple binding site model for Rad52 foci, and find a picture consistent with a liquid-liquid phase separation. These results are applicable to future experiments and suggest different biological roles for liquid droplet and binding site foci.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Molecular reconstruction of recurrent evolutionary switching in olfactory receptor specificity</a></h4>

              
                Olfactory receptor repertoires exhibit remarkable functional diversity, but how these proteins have evolved is poorly understood. Through analysis of extant and ancestrally-reconstructed drosophilid olfactory receptors from the Ionotropic receptor (Ir) family, we investigated evolution of two organic acid-sensing receptors, Ir75a and Ir75b. Despite their low amino acid identity, we identify a common 'hotspot' in their ligand-binding pocket that has a major effect on changing the specificity of both Irs, as well as at least two distinct functional transitions in Ir75a during evolution. Moreover, we show that odor specificity is refined by changes in additional, receptor-specific sites, including those outside the ligand-binding pocket. Our work reveals how a core, common determinant of ligand-tuning acts within epistatic and allosteric networks of substitutions to lead to functional evolution of olfactory receptors.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Short-chain fatty acids activate acetyltransferase p300</a></h4>

              
                Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) acetate, propionate, and butyrate are produced in large quantities by the gut microbiome and contribute to a wide array of physiological processes. While the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown, many effects of SCFAs have been traced to changes in the cell’s epigenetic state. Here, we systematically investigate how SCFAs alter the epigenome. Using quantitative proteomics of histone modification states, we identified rapid and sustained increases in histone acetylation after addition of butyrate or propionate, but not acetate. While decades of prior observations would have suggested that hyperacetylation induced by SCFAs are attributed to inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs), we found that propionate and butyrate instead activate the acetyltransferase p300. Propionate and butyrate are rapidly converted to the corresponding acyl-CoAs which are then used by p300 to catalyze auto-acylation of the autoinhibitory loop, activating the enzyme for histone/protein acetylation. This data challenges the long-held belief that SCFAs mainly regulate chromatin by inhibiting HDACs, and instead reveals a previously unknown mechanism of HAT activation that can explain how an influx of low levels of SCFAs alters global chromatin states.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">De novo motor learning of a bimanual control task over multiple days of practice</a></h4>

              
                Although much research on motor learning has focused on how we adapt our movements to maintain performance in the face of imposed perturbations, in many cases we must learn new skills from scratch, or de novo. In comparison to adaptation, relatively little is known about de novo learning. In part, this is because learning a new skill can involve many challenges, including learning to recognize new patterns of sensory input and generate new patterns of motor output. However, even with familiar sensory cues and well-practiced movements, the problem of quickly selecting the appropriate actions in response to the current state is challenging. Here, we devised a bimanual hand-to-cursor mapping which isolates this control problem. We find that participants' initially struggled to control the cursor under this bimanual mapping, despite explicit knowledge of the mapping. Performance improved steadily over multiple days of practice, however. Participants exhibited no aftereffects when reverting to a veridical cursor, confirming that participant's learned the new task de novo, rather than through adaptation. Corrective responses to mid-movement perturbations of the target were initially weak, but, with practice participants gradually became able to respond rapidly and robustly to these perturbations. After four days of practice, participants' behavior under the bimanual mapping almost matched performance with a veridically mapped cursor. However, there remained a small but persistent difference in performance level. Our findings illustrate the dynamics and limitations of learning a novel controller and introduce a promising paradigm for tractably investigating this aspect of motor skill learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">High-frequency hearing is required for generating a topographic map of auditory space in the mouse superior colliculus</a></h4>

              
                A topographic map of auditory space is a feature found in the superior colliculus (SC) of many species, including CBA/CaJ mice. In this genetic background, high-frequency monaural spectral cues and interaural level differences are used to generate spatial receptive fields (RFs) that form a topographic map along the azimuth. Unfortunately, C57BL/6 mice, a strain widely used for transgenic manipulation, display age-related hearing loss (AHL) due to an inbred mutation in the Cadherin 23 gene (Cdh23) that affects hair cell mechanotransduction. To overcome this problem, researchers have used young C57BL/6 mice in their studies, as they have been shown to have normal hearing thresholds. However, important details of the auditory response characteristics of the SC such as spectral responses and spatial localization, have not been characterized in young C57BL/6 mice. Here we show that 2-4-month C57BL/6 mice lack neurons with frontal auditory RFs and therefore lack a topographic representation of auditory space in the SC. Analysis of the spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRFs) of the SC auditory neurons shows that C57BL/6 mouse SC neurons lack the ability to detect the high-frequency(>40kHz) spectral cues that are needed to compute frontal RFs. We also show that crossing C57BL/6 mice with CBA/CaJ mice or introducing one copy of the wild-type Cdh23 to C57BL/6 mice rescues the high-frequency hearing deficit and improves the topographic map of auditory space. Taken together, these results demonstrate the importance of high-frequency hearing in computing a topographic map of auditory space.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Use-dependent biases primarily originate from a contaminated motor plan</a></h4>

              
                Repetition of a specific movement biases subsequent actions towards the recently practiced movement, a phenomenon referred to as use-dependent learning (UDL). UDL has been attributed to shifts in the tuning of neurons in the motor cortex. However, recent studies employing a forced reaction time task, including the eLife article by Marinovic et al (2017), indicate that these biases may also arise from a contaminated motor plan, one that is biased towards the practiced direction. We advanced this line of inquiry, seeking to establish the relative contribution of execution and planning processes to UDL in a center-out reaching task in which participants were able to initiate movements of their own volition. On most trials, the target appeared at a designated frequent location; on other trials, the target appeared at one of six rare locations. In Experiment 1, participants exhibited a robust movement bias towards the frequent target when movements were self-initiated quickly, but a small movement bias when movements were self-initiated slowly - the signature of a contaminated motor plan. Strikingly, the heading angles were bimodally distributed, with one peak at the frequent target location and the other at the rare target location - a finding reinforced by a re-analysis of two widely cited studies on UDL. Notably, the latter peak was shifted in the frequently practiced direction, a signature of a motor execution bias. To eliminate the contribution of planning-related UDL, we imposed a delay between target onset and movement initiation in Experiment 2. As predicted, the heading angles became unimodally distributed around the rare target. The peak of this distribution was again shifted towards the location of the frequent target, indicative of a persistent bias in motor execution. Taken together, these results highlight two distinct components of UDL even when movements are self-initiated: First, the temporal dynamics underlying movement planning, in which a default plan is progressively overridden by a new plan, produces a pronounced motor planning bias. Second, there is a small, temporally stable bias that may reflect shifts in motor unit tuning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The human frontal operculum is involved in visuomotor performance monitoring</a></h4>

              
                For adaptive goal-directed action, the brain needs to monitor action performance and detect errors. The corresponding information may be conveyed via different sensory modalities; for instance, visual and proprioceptive body position cues may inform about current manual action performance. Thereby, contextual factors such as the current task set may also determine the relative importance of each sensory modality for action guidance. Here, we analysed human behavioral, fMRI, and MEG data from two VR-based hand-target phase matching studies to identify the neuronal correlates of performance monitoring and error processing under instructed visual or proprioceptive task sets. Our main result was a general, modality-independent response of the bilateral FO to poor phase matching accuracy, as evident from increased BOLD signal and increased gamma power. Furthermore, functional connectivity of the bilateral FO to the right PPC increased under a visual vs proprioceptive task set. These findings suggest that the bilateral FO generally monitors manual action performance; and, moreover, that when visual action feedback is used to guide action, the FO may signal an increased need for control to visuomotor regions in the right PPC following errors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Early detection of cerebrovascular pathology and protective antiviral immunity by MRI</a></h4>

              
                Central nervous system (CNS) infections are a major cause of human morbidity and mortality worldwide. Even patients that survive CNS infections can have lasting neurological dysfunction resulting from immune and pathogen induced pathology. Developing approaches to noninvasively track pathology and immunity in the infected CNS is crucial for patient management and development of new therapeutics. Here, we develop novel MRI-based approaches to monitor virus-specific CD8+ T cells and their relationship to cerebrovascular pathology in the living brain. We studied a relevant murine model in which a neurotropic virus (vesicular stomatitis virus) was introduced intranasally and then entered the brain via olfactory sensory neurons - a route exploited by many pathogens in humans. Using T2*-weighted high-resolution MRI, we identified small cerebral microbleeds as the earliest form of pathology associated with viral entry into the brain. Mechanistically, these microbleeds occurred in the absence of peripheral immune cells and were associated with infection of vascular endothelial cells. We monitored the adaptive response to this infection by developing methods to iron label and track individual virus specific CD8+ T cells by MRI. Transferred antiviral T cells were detected in the brain within a day of infection and were able to reduce cerebral microbleeds. These data demonstrate the utility of MRI in detecting the earliest pathological events in the virally infected CNS as well as the therapeutic potential of antiviral T cells in mitigating this pathology.

                The mammalian retina engages a broad array of linear and nonlinear circuit mechanisms to convert natural scenes into retinal ganglion cell (RGC) spike outputs. Although many individual integration mechanisms are well understood, predictive models of natural scene encoding perform poorly, likely due to interactions among the active mechanisms. Here, we identified spatial integration mechanisms relevant for natural scene encoding and used computational modeling to predict spike outputs in primate parasol RGCs. Our approach was to simplify the structure of natural scenes and empirically ask whether these changes were reflected in RGC spike responses. We observed that reducing natural movies to 16 linearly integrated regions described ~80% of the structure of parasol RGC spike responses. We then used simplified stimuli to create high-dimensional metamers that recapitulated the spike response of full-field naturalistic movies. Finally, we identified the retinal computations that convert natural images in 16-dimensional space into 1-dimensional spike outputs.

                Saccadic eye movements rapidly shift our gaze over 100,000 times daily, enabling countless tasks ranging from driving to reading. Long regarded as a window to the mind and human information processing, they are thought to be cortically/cognitively controlled movements aimed at objects/words of interest. Saccades however involve a complex cerebral network wherein the contribution of phylogenetically older sensory-motor pathways remains unclear. Here we show using a neuro-computational approach that mindless visuo-motor computations, akin to reflexive orienting responses in neonates and vertebrates with little neocortex, guide humans' eye movements in a quintessentially cognitive task, reading. These computations occur in the superior colliculus, an ancestral midbrain structure, that integrates retinal and (sub)cortical afferent signals over retinotopically organized, and size-invariant, neuronal populations. Simply considering retinal and primary-visual-cortex afferents, which convey the distribution of luminance contrast over sentences (visual-saliency map), we find that collicular population-averaging principles capture readers' prototypical word-based oculomotor behavior, leaving essentially rereading behavior unexplained. These principles reveal that inter-word spacing is unnecessary, explaining metadata across languages and writing systems using only print size as a predictor. Our findings demonstrate that saccades, rather than being a window into cognitive/linguistic processes, primarily reflect rudimentary visuo-motor mechanisms in the midbrain that survived brain-evolution pressure.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An in-vivo digital atlas of the spatially reliable cerebral vasculature in mice</a></h4>

              
                Cerebral vascular abnormalities can have a large impact on brain function and have been frequently detected as a comorbidity in various neuropathologies. The mouse is the most common pre-clinical animal model used to investigate neuropathologies and thus cerebral vascular atlases of this species are indispensable. In particular, an atlas derived from multiple animals and that can address inter-subject variability is still absent. The current study presents a mouse cerebral vascular atlas developed from MR 2D-TOF angiograms acquired from a relatively high number (N=21) of 12 weeks old male C57BL/6 mice. The vascular atlas we present depicts large arteries, veins and sinuses that are more spatially reliable across animals than smaller vessels. The atlas is available for download and contains multiple datasets: i) a cerebral vascular atlas; ii) a digital segmentation of large vessels (arteries and veins); iii) a high resolution T2 anatomical background aligned to the atlas; iv) a skeletonized vascular atlas; and v) a vascular graph model. We suggest that these components provide a very potent analysis tool for mouse fMRI data and that the atlas can be used as a template for multimodal brain imaging studies. To this end, we also demonstrate an explicit application of the atlas for the investigation of vascular influences in resting-state fMRI.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Visualization of Sympathetic Neural Innervation in Human White Adipose Tissue</a></h4>

              
                Obesity, defined as an excess of adipose tissue that adversely affects health, is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. However, understanding the structure and function of human adipose tissue has been limited by the inability to visualize cellular components due to the innate structure of adipocytes, which are characterized by large lipid droplets. Combining the iDISCO and the CUBIC protocols for whole tissue staining and optical clearing, we developed a protocol to enable immunostaining and clearing of human subcutaneous white adipose tissue (WAT) obtained from individuals with severe obesity. We were able to perform immunolabeling of sympathetic nerve terminals in whole white adipose tissue and subsequent optical clearing by eliminating lipids to render the opaque tissue completely transparent. We then used light sheet confocal microscopy to visualize innervation of human WAT from obese individuals in a 3D manner. We demonstrate the visualization of sympathetic nerve terminals in human WAT. This protocol can be modified to visualize other structures such as blood vessels involved in the development, maintenance and function of human adipose tissue in health and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The 2D Ising model, criticality and AIT</a></h4>

              
                In this short note we study the 2D Ising model, a universal computational model which reflects phase transitions and critical phenomena, as a framework for establishing links between systems that exhibit criticality with the notions of complexity. This is motivated in the context of neuroscience applications stemming from algorithmic information theory (AIT). Starting with the original 2D Ising model, we show that --- together with correlation length of the spin lattice, susceptibility to a uniform external field --- the correlation time of the magnetization time series, the compression ratio of the spin lattice, the complexity of the magnetization time series --- as derived from Lempel-Ziv-Welch compression---, and the rate of information transmission in the lattice, all reflect the effects of the phase transition, which results in spacetime pockets of uniform magnetization at all scales. We also show that in the Ising model the insertion of sparse long-range couplings has a direct effect on the critical temperature and other parameters. The addition of positive links extends the ordered regime to higher critical temperatures, while negative links have a stronger, disordering influence at the global scale. We discuss some implications for the study of long-range (e.g., ephaptic) interactions in the human brain and the effects of weak perturbations in neural dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Learning the statistics of pain: computational and neural mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                Pain invariably changes over time, and these temporal fluctuations are riddled with uncertainty about body safety. In theory, statistical regularities of pain through time contain useful information that can be learned, allowing the brain to generate expectations and inform behaviour. To investigate this, we exposed healthy participants to probabilistic sequences of low and high-intensity electrical stimuli to the left hand, containing sudden changes in stimulus frequencies. We demonstrate that humans can learn to extract these regularities, and explicitly predict the likelihood of forthcoming pain intensities in a manner consistent with optimal Bayesian models with dynamic update of beliefs. We studied brain activity using functional MRI whilst subjects performed the task, which allowed us to dissect the underlying neural correlates of these statistical inferences from their uncertainty and update. We found that the inferred frequency (posterior probability) of high intensity pain correlated with activity in bilateral sensorimotor cortex, secondary somatosensory cortex and right caudate. The uncertainty of statistical inferences of pain was encoded in the right superior parietal cortex. An intrinsic part of this hierarchical Bayesian model is the way that unexpected changes in frequency lead to shift beliefs and update the internal model. This is reflected by the KL divergence between consecutive posterior distributions and associated with brain responses in the premotor cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and posterior parietal cortex. In conclusion, this study extends what is conventionally considered a sensory pain pathway dedicated to process pain intensity, to include the generation of Bayesian internal models of temporal statistics of pain intensity levels in sensorimotor regions, which are updated dynamically through the engagement of premotor, prefrontal and parietal regions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Automated and parallelized spike collision tests to identify spike signal projections</a></h4>

              
                The spike collision test is a highly reliable technique to identify axonal projection of a neuron recorded electrophysiologically for investigating functional spike information among brain areas. It is potentially applicable to more neuronal projections by combining multi-channel recording with optogenetic stimulation. Yet, it remains inefficient and laborious because an experimenter must visually select spikes in every channel and manually repeat spike collision tests for each neuron serially. Here, we established a novel technique to automatically perform spike collision tests for all channels in parallel (Multi-Linc analysis), employing two distinct protocols implemented in a multi-channel real-time processing system. The rat cortical neurons identified with this technique displayed physiological spike features consistent with excitatory projection neurons. Their antidromic spikes were similar in shape but slightly larger in amplitude compared with spontaneous spikes. In addition, we demonstrated simultaneous identification of reciprocal or bifurcating projections among cortical areas. Thus, our Multi-Linc analysis will be a powerful research approach to elucidate interareal spike communication.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in basolateral amygdala inputs to lateral septum is necessary for mice to identify socially novel individuals</a></h4>

              
                BACKGROUNDThe lateral septum (LS) is activated by social novelty, and perturbing LS activity impairs social recognition. However, the neural circuits and cell signaling pathways that converge on the LS to mediate social behaviors arent well understood. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that social behavior is influenced by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling through its receptor TrkB. However, whether BDNF-TrkB signaling mediates social behavior by affecting function in LS circuits is not known.

METHODSWe used single-molecule fluorescent in-situ hybridization to quantify expression of Ntrk2 (gene encoding TrkB) in LS. Viral transgenesis was used to induce cre-recombinase mediated TrkB knockdown in LS as well as for ablation and BDNF-depletion in neurons projecting from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) to the LS. We evaluated social recognition behavior using the three-chamber social interaction test, and assessed social novelty-induced c-Fos expression using fluorescence immunohistochemistry.

RESULTSThe majority of GABAergic neurons in LS express TrkB. TrkB knockdown in LS abolishes social novelty recognition, and decreases LS activation in response to social novelty. Ablating BLA-LS projection neurons abolishes social novelty recognition behavior, an effect that is phenocopied by selectively depleting BDNF in this circuit.

CONCLUSIONSSocial novelty recognition in the mouse requires both BDNF expression in BLA-LS projections neurons and intact TrkB signaling in the LS. These data support the hypothesis that BLA-LS projection neurons are a critical source of BDNF for activating LS TrkB signaling to control social novelty recognition.

	<p>Ecstatic epilepsy is a rare form of focal epilepsy in which the aura (beginning of the seizures) consists of a blissful state of mental clarity/feeling of certainty. Such a state has also been described as a “religious” or mystical experience. While this form of epilepsy has long been recognized as a temporal lobe epilepsy, we have accumulated evidence converging toward the location of the symptomatogenic zone in the dorsal anterior insula during the 10 last years. The neurocognitive hypothesis for the genesis of a mental clarity is the suppression of the interoceptive prediction errors and of the unexpected surprise associated with any incoming internal or external signal, usually processed by the dorsal anterior insula. This mimics a perfect prediction of the world and induces a feeling of certainty. The ecstatic epilepsy is thus an amazing model for the role of anterior insula in uncertainty and surprise.</p>

	<p>Background: Stroke is the leading cause of cortical deafness (CD), the most severe form of central hearing impairment. CD remains poorly characterized and perhaps underdiagnosed. We perform a systematic review to describe the clinical and radiological features of stroke-associated CD. Methods: PubMed and the Web of Science databases were used to identify relevant publications up to 30 June 2021 using the MeSH terms: “deafness” and “stroke”, or “hearing loss” and “stroke” or “auditory agnosia” and “stroke”. Results: We found 46 cases, caused by bilateral lesions within the central auditory pathway, mostly located within or surrounding the superior temporal lobe gyri and/or the Heschl’s gyri (30/81%). In five (13.51%) patients, CD was caused by the subcortical hemispheric and in two (0.05%) in brainstem lesions. Sensorineural hearing loss was universal. Occasionally, a misdiagnosis by peripheral or psychiatric disorders occurred. A few (20%) had clinical improvement, with a regained oral conversation or evolution to pure word deafness (36.6%). A persistent inability of oral communication occurred in 43.3%. A full recovery of conversation was restricted to patients with subcortical lesions. Conclusions: Stroke-associated CD is rare, severe and results from combinations of cortical and subcortical lesions within the central auditory pathway. The recovery of functional hearing occurs, essentially, when caused by subcortical lesions.</p>

	<p>I have reviewed studies on neural responses to pictured actions in the action observation network (AON) and the cognitive functions of these responses. Based on this review, I have analyzed the specific representational characteristics of action photographs. There has been consensus that AON responses provide viewers with knowledge of observed or pictured actions, but there has been controversy about the properties of this knowledge. Is this knowledge causally provided by AON activities or is it dependent on conceptual processing? What elements of actions does it refer to, and how generalized or specific is it? The answers to these questions have come from studies that used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to stimulate motor or somatosensory cortices. In conjunction with electromyography (EMG), TMS allows researchers to examine changes of the excitability in the corticospinal tract and muscles of people viewing pictured actions. The timing of these changes and muscle specificity enable inferences to be drawn about the cognitive products of processing pictured actions in the AON. Based on a review of studies using TMS and other neuroscience methods, I have proposed a novel hypothetical account that describes the characteristics of action photographs that make them effective cues to social perception. This account includes predictions that can be tested experimentally.</p>

	<p>The COVID-19 pandemic had imposed a variety of containment measures on the general population for prolonged periods. Confinement has had, and still has, social, economic, educational, health, and psychological consequences on the entire population. Objective: In this article, a systematic search has been performed based on studies carried out since the beginning of the pandemic, regarding the impact of these containment measures on the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) population and their caregivers. Method: We consulted six databases (i.e., PubMed, Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Science Direct) and selected ten studies that met the inclusion criteria. The chosen studies have been classified according to their theoretical focus, methodology, and target population. Results: We found an increase in stress and a decrease in psychological well-being among individuals diagnosed with ASD (i.e., parents and caregivers). Additionally, in studies focused on children, youth, and adults with ASD diagnosis, the results are contradictory depending on variables such as age, ASD severity, or type of family structure. Conclusions: The results show that the consequences of quarantine and social confinement are quite contradictory and depend on variables such as age, ASD severity, and family features.</p>

	<p>Accumulating evidence shows that brain functional deficits may be impacted by damage to remote brain regions. Recent advances in neuroimaging suggest that stroke impairment can be better predicted based on disruption to brain networks rather than from lesion locations or volumes only. Our aim was to explore the feasibility of predicting post-stroke somatosensory function from brain functional connectivity through the application of machine learning techniques. Somatosensory impairment was measured using the Tactile Discrimination Test. Functional connectivity was employed to model the global brain function. Behavioral measures and MRI were collected at the same timepoint. Two machine learning models (linear regression and support vector regression) were chosen to predict somatosensory impairment from disrupted networks. Along with two feature pools (i.e., low-order and high-order functional connectivity, or low-order functional connectivity only) engineered, four predictive models were built and evaluated in the present study. Forty-three chronic stroke survivors participated this study. Results showed that the regression model employing both low-order and high-order functional connectivity can predict outcomes based on correlation coefficient of r = 0.54 (p = 0.0002). A machine learning predictive approach, involving high- and low-order modelling, is feasible for the prediction of residual somatosensory function in stroke patients using functional brain networks.</p>

	<p>Anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (anti-NMDAR) encephalitis is a rare autoimmune illness characterized by a constellation of often severe, but treatable, psychiatric and neurological symptoms. Whereas symptoms such as psychosis and bizarre and abnormal motor behavior are common in adults, pediatric patients typically present with behavioral changes, irritability and sleep dysfunction. The recovery phase is usually slow and may be associated with longstanding adaptive, behavioral and neuropsychological problems. Very few studies explored the cognitive and adaptive sequelae in children with anti-NMDAR encephalitis. The present review article suggests that, although most children and adolescents return to their daily life and previous activities, they may have a low quality of life and show neuropsychological sequelae involving language, memory, especially verbal memory, and attentional resources, even after several months from the hospital discharge. In particular, the available results reveal difficulties in cognitive skills involving executive functions. This impairment is considered the “core” of the cognitive profile of young patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis. On the other hand, some cognitive skills, such as general intelligence, show good overall recovery over time. Additional neuropsychological research evaluating larger samples, more homogenous methods and longitudinal studies is required.</p>

	<p>Neuropsychiatric disorders are found to be associated with bullous pemphigoid (BP), an autoimmune subepidermal blistering disease. Antipsychotics have emerged as possible inducing factors of BP. However, large sample studies concerning BP associated with antipsychotics, as well as with specific mental disorders, are still lacking. Our review retrieved a few clinical studies and case reports on the topic, producing controversial results. We report for the first time a bipolar patient case presenting BP following five-month therapy with risperidone long-acting injectable (LAI). We hypothesize that the dermatological event is associated with the medication administered. The issue emerged during psychiatric consultation and was confirmed by histological examination, direct and indirect immunofluorescence studies, plus positive plasma and cutaneous BP180 and BP230 IgG. Neurodegeneration or neuroinflammation might represent a primary process leading to a cross-reactive immune response between neural and cutaneous antigens and contributing to self-tolerance failure. Furthermore, the time sequence of the shared biological mechanisms leading to clinical manifestations of the neuropsychiatric disorder and BP remains undefined. BP comorbid with bipolar disorder might occasionally represent a serious health risk and affect patients’ physical and psychosocial quality of life. Thus, clinicians treating psychiatric patients should consider BP as a possible adverse effect of psychotropic medications.</p>

Regulated by norepinephrine released from sympathetic nerve terminals, adrenergic receptors on pinealocytes activate aralkylamine N-acetyltransferase that converts 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) to N-acetylserotonin, the precursor of melatonin. Previous studies from our group and others reveal significant constitutive secretion of 5-HT from pinealocytes. Here,...

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Bidirectional Control of Orienting Behavior by the Substantia Nigra Pars Reticulata: Distinct Significance of Head and Whisker Movements</a></h4>

              
                <p>Detection of an unexpected, novel, or salient stimulus typically leads to an orienting response by which animals move the head, in concert with the sensors (e.g., eyes, pinna, whiskers), to evaluate the stimulus. The basal ganglia are known to control orienting movements through tonically active GABAergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) that project to the superior colliculus. Using optogenetics, we explored the ability of GABAergic SNr neurons on one side of the brain to generate orienting movements. In a strain of mice that express channelrhodopsin (ChR2) in both SNr GABAergic neurons and afferent fibers, we found that continuous blue light produced a robust sustained excitation of SNr neurons which generated ipsiversive orienting. Conversely, in the same animal, trains of blue light excited afferent fibers more effectively than continuous blue light, producing a robust sustained inhibition of SNr neurons which generated contraversive orienting. When ChR2 expression was restricted to either GABAergic SNr neurons or GABAergic afferent fibers from the striatum, blue light patterns in SNr produced only ipsiversive or contraversive orienting movements, respectively. Interestingly, whisker positioning and the reaction to an air-puff on the whiskers were incongruent between SNr-evoked ipsiversive and contraversive head movements, indicating that orienting driven by exciting or inhibiting SNr neurons have different behavioral significance. In conclusion, unilateral SNr neuron excitation and inhibition produce orienting movements in opposite directions and, apparently, with distinct behavioral significance.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Atypical sensory processing is currently included within the diagnostic criteria of autism. The cerebellum is known to integrate sensory inputs of different modalities through its connectivity to the cerebral cortex. Interestingly, cerebellar malformations are among the most replicated features found in postmortem brain of individuals with autism. We studied sensory processing in the cerebellum in a mouse model of autism, knock-out (KO) for the <I>Cntnap2</I> gene. <I>Cntnap2</I> is widely expressed in Purkinje cells (PCs) and has been recently reported to regulate their morphology. Further, individuals with <I>CNTNAP2</I> mutations display cerebellar malformations and CNTNAP2 antibodies are associated with a mild form of cerebellar ataxia. Previous studies in the <I>Cntnap2</I> mouse model show an altered cerebellar sensory learning. However, a physiological analysis of cerebellar function has not been performed yet. We studied sensory evoked potentials in cerebellar Crus I/II region on electrical stimulation of the whisker pad in alert mice and found striking differences between wild-type and <I>Cntnap2</I> KO mice. In addition, single-cell recordings identified alterations in both sensory-evoked and spontaneous firing patterns of PCs. These changes were accompanied by altered intrinsic properties and morphologic features of these neurons. Together, these results indicate that the <I>Cntnap2</I> mouse model could provide novel insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms of autism core sensory deficits.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prevalence study of intermittent hormonal therapy of Prostate Cancer patients in Spain [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Although intermittent androgen deprivation therapy was introduced many years ago to improve patients’ quality of life with the same carcinologic efficiency as continuous hormonal therapy, recent data suggest that those patients could be overtreated. This study aims to estimate the prevalence of prostate cancer patients receiving intermittent androgen deprivation therapy in Spain. Methods: A retrospective, longitudinal study was conducted using electronic drug dispensation data from four Spanish autonomous communities, which encompass 17.23 million inhabitants (36.22% of the total population in Spain). We estimated intermittent androgen therapy use (%IAD) and the prevalence of patients under intermittent androgen therapy (PIAD) overall and stratified by region. Other outcome variables included the pharmaceutical forms dispensed and the total direct annual expenditure on androgen deprivation therapy‐associated medications. Results: A total of 863,005 dispensations corresponding to a total of 65,752 men were identified, treated with either luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogues (353,162) administered alone or in combination with anti‐androgens (509,843). Overall, the mean (±SD) age of the patients was 76.9 (±10.4) years. Results revealed that the mean annual PIAD along the study was 6.6% in the total population studied, and the overall %IAD during the five‐year study period was 5.6%. The mean cost of hormonal therapy per year was 25 million euros for LHRH analogues and 6.3 million euros for anti-androgens. Conclusions:  An important proportion of prostate cancer patients in Spain could benefit from intermittent androgen therapy during the study period while avoiding overtreatment harms associated with continuous hormonal therapy.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Better tired than lost: Turtle ant trail networks favor coherence over short edges</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Arjun Chandrasekhar, James A. R. Marshall, Cortnea Austin, Saket Navlakha, Deborah M. Gordon</p>

Creating a routing backbone is a fundamental problem in both biology and engineering. The routing backbone of the trail networks of arboreal turtle ants (<i>Cephalotes goniodontus</i>) connects many nests and food sources using trail pheromone deposited by ants as they walk. Unlike species that forage on the ground, the trail networks of arboreal ants are constrained by the vegetation. We examined what objectives the trail networks meet by comparing the observed ant trail networks with networks of random, hypothetical trail networks in the same surrounding vegetation and with trails optimized for four objectives: minimizing path length, minimizing average edge length, minimizing number of nodes, and minimizing opportunities to get lost. The ants’ trails minimized path length by minimizing the number of nodes traversed rather than choosing short edges. In addition, the ants’ trails reduced the opportunity for ants to get lost at each node, favoring nodes with 3D configurations most likely to be reinforced by pheromone. Thus, rather than finding the shortest edges, turtle ant trail networks take advantage of natural variation in the environment to favor coherence, keeping the ants together on the trails.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Estimation of regional polygenicity from GWAS provides insights into the genetic architecture of complex traits</a></h4>

The number of variants that have a non-zero effect on a trait (<i>i.e</i>. polygenicity) is a fundamental parameter in the study of the genetic architecture of a complex trait. Although many previous studies have investigated polygenicity at a genome-wide scale, a detailed understanding of how polygenicity varies across genomic regions is currently lacking. In this work, we propose an accurate and scalable statistical framework to estimate regional polygenicity for a complex trait. We show that our approach yields approximately unbiased estimates of regional polygenicity in simulations across a wide-range of various genetic architectures. We then partition the polygenicity of anthropometric and blood pressure traits across 6-Mb genomic regions (<i>N</i> = 290K, UK Biobank) and observe that all analyzed traits are highly polygenic: over one-third of regions harbor at least one causal variant for each of the traits analyzed. Additionally, we observe wide variation in regional polygenicity: on average across all traits, 48.9% of regions contain at least 5 causal SNPs, 5.44% of regions contain at least 50 causal SNPs. Finally, we find that heritability is proportional to polygenicity at the regional level, which is consistent with the hypothesis that heritability enrichments are largely driven by the variation in the number of causal SNPs.

The ever increasing applications of bioinformatics in providing effective interpretation of large and complex biological data require expertise in the use of sophisticated computational tools and advanced statistical tests, skills that are mostly lacking in the Sudanese research community. This can be attributed to paucity in the development and promotion of bioinformatics, lack of senior bioinformaticians, and the general status quo of inadequate research funding in Sudan. In this paper, we describe the challenges that have encountered the development of bioinformatics as a discipline in Sudan. Additionally, we highlight on specific actions that may help develop and promote its education and training. The paper takes the National University Biomedical Research Institute (NUBRI) as an example of an institute that has tackled many of these challenges and strives to drive powerful efforts in the development of bioinformatics in the country.

Viruses are the most numerous biological entity, existing in all environments and infecting all cellular organisms. Compared with cellular life, the evolution and origin of viruses are poorly understood; viruses are enormously diverse, and most lack sequence similarity to cellular genes. To uncover viral sequences without relying on either reference viral sequences from databases or marker genes that characterize specific viral taxa, we developed an analysis pipeline for virus inference based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR). CRISPR is a prokaryotic nucleic acid restriction system that stores the memory of previous exposure. Our protocol can infer CRISPR-targeted sequences, including viruses, plasmids, and previously uncharacterized elements, and predict their hosts using unassembled short-read metagenomic sequencing data. By analyzing human gut metagenomic data, we extracted 11,391 terminally redundant CRISPR-targeted sequences, which are likely complete circular genomes. The sequences included 2,154 tailed-phage genomes, together with 257 complete crAssphage genomes, 11 genomes larger than 200 kilobases, 766 genomes of <i>Microviridae</i> species, 56 genomes of <i>Inoviridae</i> species, and 95 previously uncharacterized circular small genomes that have no reliably predicted protein-coding gene. We predicted the host(s) of approximately 70% of the discovered genomes at the taxonomic level of phylum by linking protospacers to taxonomically assigned CRISPR direct repeats. These results demonstrate that our protocol is efficient for <i>de novo</i> inference of CRISPR-targeted sequences and their host prediction.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Pinging the brain with visual impulses reveals electrically active, not activity-silent, working memories</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Joao Barbosa, Diego Lozano-Soldevilla, Albert Compte</p>

Persistently active neurons during mnemonic periods have been regarded as the mechanism underlying working memory maintenance. Alternatively, neuronal networks could instead store memories in fast synaptic changes, thus avoiding the biological cost of maintaining an active code through persistent neuronal firing. Such “activity-silent” codes have been proposed for specific conditions in which memories are maintained in a nonprioritized state, as for unattended but still relevant short-term memories. A hallmark of this “activity-silent” code is that these memories can be reactivated from silent, synaptic traces. Evidence for “activity-silent” working memory storage has come from human electroencephalography (EEG), in particular from the emergence of decodability (EEG reactivations) induced by visual impulses (termed pinging) during otherwise “silent” periods. Here, we reanalyze EEG data from such pinging studies. We find that the originally reported absence of memory decoding reflects weak statistical power, as decoding is possible based on more powered analyses or reanalysis using alpha power instead of raw voltage. This reveals that visual pinging EEG “reactivations” occur in the presence of an electrically active, not silent, code for unattended memories in these data. This crucial change in the evidence provided by this dataset prompts a reinterpretation of the mechanisms of EEG reactivations. We provide 2 possible explanations backed by computational models, and we discuss the relationship with TMS-induced EEG reactivations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The Plasmodium NOT1-G paralogue is an essential regulator of sexual stage maturation and parasite transmission</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kevin J. Hart, B. Joanne Power, Kelly T. Rios, Aswathy Sebastian, Scott E. Lindner</p>

Productive transmission of malaria parasites hinges upon the execution of key transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulatory events. While much is now known about how specific transcription factors activate or repress sexual commitment programs, far less is known about the production of a preferred mRNA homeostasis following commitment and through the host-to-vector transmission event. Here, we show that in <i>Plasmodium</i> parasites, the NOT1 scaffold protein of the CAF1/CCR4/Not complex is duplicated, and one paralogue is dedicated for essential transmission functions. Moreover, this NOT1-G paralogue is central to the sex-specific functions previously associated with its interacting partners, as deletion of <i>not1-g</i> in <i>Plasmodium yoelii</i> leads to a comparable or complete arrest phenotype for both male and female parasites. We show that, consistent with its role in other eukaryotes, PyNOT1-G localizes to cytosolic puncta throughout much of the <i>Plasmodium</i> life cycle. PyNOT1-G is essential to both the complete maturation of male gametes and to the continued development of the fertilized zygote originating from female parasites. Comparative transcriptomics of wild-type and <i>pynot1-g</i><sup>−</sup> parasites shows that loss of PyNOT1-G leads to transcript dysregulation preceding and during gametocytogenesis and shows that PyNOT1-G acts to preserve mRNAs that are critical to sexual and early mosquito stage development. Finally, we demonstrate that the tristetraprolin (TTP)-binding domain, which acts as the typical organization platform for RNA decay (TTP) and RNA preservation (ELAV/HuR) factors is dispensable for PyNOT1-G’s essential blood stage functions but impacts host-to-vector transmission. Together, we conclude that a NOT1-G paralogue in <i>Plasmodium</i> fulfills the complex transmission requirements of both male and female parasites.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">The structure of hippocampal circuitry relates to rapid category learning in humans</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Prior work suggests that complementary white matter pathways within the hippocampus (HPC) differentially support the learning of specific versus general information. In particular, while the trisynaptic pathway (TSP) rapidly forms memories for specific experiences, the monosynaptic pathway (MSP) slowly learns generalities. However, despite the theorized significance of such circuitry, characterizing how information flows within the HPC to support learning in humans remains a challenge. We leveraged diffusion-weighted imaging as a proxy for individual differences in white matter structure linking key regions along with TSP (HPC subfields CA<sub>3</sub> and CA<sub>1</sub>) and MSP (entorhinal cortex and CA<sub>1</sub>) and related these differences in hippocampal structure to category learning ability. We hypothesized that learning to categorize the “exception” items that deviated from category rules would benefit from TSP-supported mnemonic specificity. Participant-level estimates of TSP- and MSP-related integrity were constructed from HPC subfield connectomes of white matter streamline density. Consistent with theories of TSP-supported learning mechanisms, we found a specific association between the integrity of CA<sub>3</sub>–CA<sub>1</sub> white matter connections and exception learning. These results highlight the significant role of HPC circuitry in complex human learning.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">G protein‐coupled estrogen receptor‐1 enhances excitatory synaptic responses in the entorhinal cortex</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Activation of estrogen receptors is thought to modulate cognitive function in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and striatum by affecting both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission. The entorhinal cortex is a major source of cortical sensory and associational input to the hippocampus, but it is unclear whether either estrogens or progestogens may modulate cognitive function through effects on synaptic transmission in the entorhinal cortex. This study assessed the effects of the brief application of either 17-β estradiol (E2) or progesterone on excitatory glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the female rat entorhinal cortex in vitro. Rats were ovariectomized on postnatal day (PD) 63 and also received subdermal E2 implants to maintain constant low levels of circulating E2 on par with estrus. Electrophysiological recordings from brain slices were obtained between PD70 and PD86, and field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) reflecting the activation of the superficial layers of the entorhinal cortex were evoked by the stimulation of layer I afferents. The application of E2 (10 nM) for 20 min resulted in a small increase in the amplitude of fEPSPs that reversed during the 30-min washout period. The application of the ERα agonist propylpyrazoletriol (PPT) (100 nM) or the β agonist DPN (1 μM) did not significantly affect synaptic responses. However, the application of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor-1 (GPER1) agonist G1 (100 nM) induced a reversible increase in fEPSP amplitude similar to that induced by E2. Furthermore, the potentiation of responses induced by G1 was blocked by the GPER1 antagonist G15 (1 μM). Application of progesterone (100 nM) or its metabolite allopregnanolone (1 μM) did not significantly affect synaptic responses. The potentiation of synaptic transmission in the entorhinal cortex induced by the activation of GPER1 receptors may contribute to the modulation of cognitive function in female rats.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Hippocampal subfield volumes and memory discrimination in the developing brain</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The ability to keep distinct memories of similar events is underpinned by a type of neural computation called pattern separation (PS). Children typically report coarse-grained memories narratives lacking specificity and detail. This lack of memory specificity is illustrative of an immature or impaired PS. Despite its importance for the ontogeny of memory, data regarding the maturation of PS during childhood is still scarce. PS is known to rely on the hippocampus, particularly on hippocampal subfields DG and CA3. In this study, we used a memory discrimination task, a behavioral proxy for PS, and manually segmented hippocampal subfields volumes in the hippocampal body in a cohort of 26 children aged from 5 to 12 years. We examined the association between subfields volumes and memory discrimination performance. The main results were: (1) we showed age-related differences of memory discrimination suggesting a continuous increase of memory performance during early to late childhood. (2) We evidenced distinct associations between age and the volumes of hippocampal subfield, suggesting distinct developmental trajectories. (3) We showed a relationship between memory discrimination performance and the volumes of CA3 and subiculum. Our results further confirm the role of CA3 in memory discrimination, and suggest to scrutinize more closely the role of the subiculum. Overall, we showed that hippocampal subfields contribute distinctively to PS during development.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Direct synaptic excitation between hilar mossy cells revealed with a targeted voltage sensor</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The dentate gyrus not only gates the flow of information into the hippocampus, it also integrates and processes this information. Mossy cells (MCs) are a major type of excitatory neuron strategically located in the hilus of the dentate gyrus where they can contribute to this processing through networks of synapses with inhibitory neurons and dentate granule cells. Some prior work has suggested that MCs can form excitatory synapses with other MCs, but the role of these synapses in the network activity of the dentate gyrus has received little attention. Here, we investigated synaptic inputs to MCs in mouse hippocampal slices using a genetically encoded hybrid voltage sensor (hVOS) targeted to MCs by Cre-lox technology. This enabled optical recording of voltage changes from multiple MCs simultaneously. Stimulating granule cells and CA3 pyramidal cells activated well-established inputs to MCs and elicited synaptic responses as expected. However, the weak blockade of MC responses to granule cell layer stimulation by DCG-IV raised the possibility of another source of excitation. To evaluate synapses between MCs as this source, single MCs were stimulated focally. Stimulation of one MC above its action potential threshold evoked depolarizing responses in neighboring MCs that depended on glutamate receptors. Short latency responses of MCs to other MCs did not depend on release from granule cell axons. However, granule cells did contribute to the longer latency responses of MCs to stimulation of other MCs. Thus, MCs transmit their activity to other MCs both through direct synaptic coupling and through polysynaptic coupling with dentate granule cells. MC–MC synapses can redistribute information entering the dentate gyrus and thus shape and modulate the electrical activity underlying hippocampal functions such as navigation and memory, as well as excessive excitation during seizures.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Aberrant slow waves in the hippocampus during activation in mice with low cholinergic tone</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The effects of acetylcholine on cortical activation were studied in wild-type (WT) mice, compared to knockout (KO) mice depleted of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) gene in the basal forebrain, and knockdown (KD) mice with heterogeneous depletion of VAChT gene in the brain. Cortical activation was assessed by comparing power spectra of local field potentials (LFPs) during activated states of rapid-eye-movement sleep (REM) or walk (WLK), with those during non-activated states of slow-wave sleep (SWS) or awake-immobility (IMM). Activation-induced suppression of delta (1–4 Hz) and beta (13–30 Hz) power in the hippocampus, and delta power in frontal cortex, were reduced in KO and KD mice compared to WT mice. Mean theta frequency was higher in KD than KO mice during WLK and REM, but not different between WT and KO mice. Peak theta (4–12 Hz) and integrated gamma (30–150 Hz) power were not significantly different among mouse groups. However, theta-peak-frequency selected gamma2 (62–100 Hz) power was lower in KO than WT or KD mice during WLK, and theta-peak-frequency selected theta power during REM decreased faster with high theta frequency in KO than WT/ KD mice. Theta power increase during REM compared to WLK was lower in KO and KD mice compared to WT mice. Theta–gamma cross-frequency coherence, a measure of synchronization of gamma with theta phase, was not different among mouse groups. However, during REM, SWS, and IMM, delta-gamma coherence was significantly higher and proximal–distal delta coherence in CA1 was lower in KO than WT/KD mice. We conclude that a deficiency in basal forebrain acetylcholine release not only enhances slow waves and suppresses theta-associated gamma waves during activation, but also increases delta-gamma cross-frequency coherence during nonactivated states, with a possible effect of disrupting cognitive processing during any brain state.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">COVID-19 forecast for 13 Caribbean countries using ARIMA modeling for confirmed, death, and recovered cases [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The rapid spread of the Covid-19 virus in the Caribbean region has led to increased surveillance with an increasing trend of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in 13 Caribbean countries. Our study aims to analyze the impact of Covid-19 (SARS nCoV-2) in 13 Caribbean countries in terms of the number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recovered cases. Methods: The study uses the ARIMA model based on the time series pattern according to data retrieved from John Hopkins University. The data were analyzed using Stata 14 SE software for the period January 22, 2020, and August 16, 2021, and forecasted till December 31, 2021. All chosen models were compared with other models in terms of various factors like AIC/BIC, log-likelihood, p-value significance, coefficient < 1, and 5% significance. The ACF and PACF graphs were plotted to reduce bias and select the best-fitting model. Results: The results show the predicted trend in terms of confirmed, death, and recovered cases of COVID-19 for 13 Caribbean countries. The projected ARIMA model forecast for the period December 16, 2021, to December 31, 2021, shows 2470272 (95% CI 2438965 - 2501579) confirmed cases, 27220 (95% CI 26886 - 27555) deaths, and 818105 (95% CI 818085 - 818125) recovered cases related to Covid-19. The final ARIMA model chosen for confirmed COVID-19 cases, several deaths, and recovered cases are ARIMA (9,2,4), ARIMA (1,2,1), and ARIMA (1,2,1), respectively. Conclusions As per the results of the forecasted COVID-19 models, there is a steady rise in confirmed, death, and recovered cases during the period June 1, 2020, until November 30, 2020, and April 1, 2021, until June 15, 2021. It shows an increasing trend for confirmed and recovered COVID-19 cases and a slowing of the number of deaths.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Cognitive dysfunction is a core symptom of anti–N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis, but detailed studies on prevalence, characteristics of cognitive deficits, and the potential for recovery are missing. Here, we performed a prospective longitudinal study to assess cognitive long-term outcome and identify clinical predictors.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Standardized comprehensive neuropsychological assessments were performed in 43 patients with NMDAR encephalitis 2.3 years and 4.9 years (median) after disease onset. Cognitive assessments covered executive function, working memory, verbal/visual episodic memory, attention, subjective complaints, and depression and anxiety levels. Cognitive performance of patients was compared to that of 30 healthy participants matched for age, sex, and education.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>All patients had persistent cognitive deficits 2.3 years after onset, with moderate or severe impairment in &gt;80% of patients. Core deficits included memory and executive function. After 4.9 years, significant improvement of cognitive function was observed, but moderate to severe deficits persisted in two thirds of patients, despite favorable functional neurological outcomes (median modified Rankin Scale = 1). Delayed treatment, higher disease severity, and longer duration of the acute phase were predictors for impaired cognitive outcome. The recovery process was time dependent, with greater gains earlier after the acute phase, although improvements were possible for several years after disease onset.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Cognitive deficits are the main contributor to long-term morbidity in NMDAR encephalitis and persist beyond functional neurological recovery. Nonetheless, cognitive improvement is possible for several years after the acute phase and should be supported by continued cognitive rehabilitation. Cognition should be included as an outcome measure in future clinical studies. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Rapid synaptic plasticity contributes to a learned conjunctive code of position and choice-related information in the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Zhao et al. demonstrate that rapid plasticity in CA1 pyramidal cells creates cellular responses carrying information about position and choice-related factors during a cued, two-choice virtual navigation task. Prior learning is necessary to produce the upstream code for trial type, and subsequent plasticity enables flexible readout of the code.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Compartmentalized dynamics within a common multi-area mesoscale manifold represent a repertoire of human hand movements</a></h4>

              
                How does the human brain flexibly support a remarkably diverse repertoire of hand movements? Natraj et al. show that mesoscale activity, for movements ranging from grasps to finger individuation, lie within a common multi-area manifold spanning the “grasp network.” However, latent dynamics within this manifold were movement specific and compartmentalized into distinct behaviorally relevant submanifolds.

                It is widely believed that the brain represents prospective “cognitive maps” encoding statistical relationships in the world. Here, Namboodiri and Stuber discuss that cognitive maps can also be retrospective, thereby explaining numerous behavioral and neural findings in a unified framework.

                Pullen et al. characterize the functionality of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in maternal blood and breastmilk after SARS-CoV-2 infection. While infection elicits polyfunctional IgG in blood, breastmilk mostly contains neutralizing and neutrophil-activating IgA, IgM and IgG, suggesting a selection of specific, non-inflammatory antibody subsets in the breastmilk.

                <p>Nature Photonics, Published online: 21 October 2021; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-021-00895-8">doi:10.1038/s41566-021-00895-8</a></p>Practical on-chip optical isolators providing non-reciprocal propagation are still a challenge. Now, two independent groups show that a phonon-mediated break of the chiral symmetry in waveguide resonators may offer a solution.
