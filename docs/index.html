<p>Reliable spike detection and sorting, the process of assigning each detected
spike to its originating neuron, is an essential step in the analysis of
extracellular electrical recordings from neurons. The volume and complexity of
the data from recently developed large scale, high density microelectrode
arrays and probes, which allow recording from thousands of channels
simultaneously, substantially complicate this task conceptually and
computationally. This chapter provides a summary and discussion of recently
developed methods to tackle these challenges, and discuss the important aspect
of algorithm validation, and assessment of detection and sorting quality.

<p>The brain can display self-sustained activity (SSA), which is the persistent
firing of neurons in the absence of external stimuli. This spontaneous activity
shows low neuronal firing rates and is observed in diverse in vitro and in vivo
situations. In this work, we study the influence of excitatory/inhibitory
balance, connection density, and network size on the self-sustained activity of
a neuronal network model. We build a random network of adaptive exponential
integrate-and-fire (AdEx) neuron models connected through inhibitory and
excitatory chemical synapses. The AdEx model mimics several behaviours of
biological neurons, such as spike initiation, adaptation, and bursting
patterns. In an excitation/inhibition balanced state, if the mean connection
degree (K) is fixed, the firing rate does not depend on the network size (N),
whereas for fixed N, the firing rate decreases when K increases. However, for
large K, SSA states can appear only for large N. We show the existence of SSA
states with similar behaviours to those observed in experimental recordings,
such as very low and irregular neuronal firing rates, and spike-train power
spectra with slow fluctuations, only for balanced networks of large size.

<p>Pain remains a major concern in patients suffering from metastatic cancer to
the bone and more knowledge of the condition, as well as novel treatment
avenues, are called for. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a highly conserved peptide
that appears to play a central role in nociceptive signaling in inflammatory
and neuropathic pain. However, little is known about the peptide in
cancer-induced bone pain. Here, we evaluate the role of spinal NPY in the
MRMT-1 rat model of cancer-induced bone pain. Our studies revealed an
up-regulation of NPY-immunoreactivity in the dorsal horn of cancer-bearing rats
17 days after inoculation, which could be a compensatory antinociceptive
response. Consistent with this interpretation, intrathecal administration of
NPY to rats with cancer-induced bone pain caused a reduction in nociceptive
behaviors that lasted up to 150 min. This effect was diminished by both Y1
(BIBO3304) and Y2 (BIIE0246) receptor antagonists, indicating that both
receptors participate in mediating the antinociceptive effect of NPY. Y1 and Y2
receptor binding in the spinal cord was unchanged in the cancer state as
compared to sham-operated rats, consistent with the notion that increased NPY
results in a net antinociceptive effect in the MRMT-1 model. In conclusion, the
data indicate that NPY is involved in the spinal nociceptive signaling of
cancer-induced bone pain and could be a new therapeutic target for patients
with this condition.

<p>We analyze a large system of heterogeneous quadratic integrate-and-fire (QIF)
neurons with time delayed, all-to-all synaptic coupling. The model is exactly
reduced to a system of firing rate equations that is exploited to investigate
the existence, stability and bifurcations of fully synchronous, partially
synchronous, and incoherent states. In conjunction with this analysis we
perform extensive numerical simulations of the original network of QIF neurons,
and determine the relation between the macroscopic and microscopic states for
partially synchronous states. The results are summarized in two phase diagrams,
for homogeneous and heterogeneous populations, which are obtained analytically
to a large extent. For excitatory coupling, the phase diagram is remarkably
similar to that of the Kuramoto model with time delays, although here the
stability boundaries extend to regions in parameter space where the neurons are
not self-sustained oscillators. In contrast, the structure of the boundaries
for inhibitory coupling is different, and already for homogeneous networks
unveils the presence of various partially synchronized states not present the
Kuramoto model: Collective chaos, quasiperiodic partial synchronization (QPS),
and a novel state which we call modulated-QPS (M-QPS). In the presence of
heterogeneity partially synchronized states remininscent to collective chaos,
QPS and M-QPS persist. In addition, the presence of heterogeneity greatly
amplifies the differences between the incoherence stability boundaries of
excitaton and inhibition. Finally, we compare our results with those of a
traditional (Wilson Cowan-type) firing rate model with time delays. The
oscillatory instabilities of the traditional firing rate model qualitatively
agree with our results only for the case of inhibitory coupling with strong
heterogeneity.

We demonstrate a two-hybrid assay based on antibody micropatterns to study protein-protein interactions at the cell surface of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) proteins. Anti-tag and conformation-specific antibodies are used for individual capture of specific forms of MHC I proteins that allow for location- and conformation-specific analysis by fluorescence microscopy. The assay is used to study the <i>in cis</i> interactions of MHC I proteins at the cell surface under controlled conditions and to define the involved protein conformations. Our results show that homotypic <i>in cis</i> interactions occur exclusively between MHC I free heavy chains, and we identify the dissociation of the light chain from the MHC I protein complex as a condition for MHC I <i>in cis</i> interactions. The functional role of these MHC I protein-protein interactions at the cell surface needs further investigation. We propose future technical developments of our two-hybrid assay for further analysis of MHC I protein-protein interactions.

Genomic data are becoming increasingly valuable as we develop methods to utilize the information at scale and gain a greater understanding of how genetic information relates to biological function. Advances in synthetic biology and the decreased cost of sequencing are increasing the amount of privately held genomic data. As the quantity and value of private genomic data grows, so does the incentive to acquire and protect such data, which creates a need to store and process these data securely. We present an algorithm for the Secure Interrogation of Genomic DataBases (SIG-DB). The SIG-DB algorithm enables databases of genomic sequences to be searched with an encrypted query sequence without revealing the query sequence to the Database Owner or any of the database sequences to the Querier. SIG-DB is the first application of its kind to take advantage of locality-sensitive hashing and homomorphic encryption to allow generalized sequence-to-sequence comparisons of genomic data.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QHFLaNOp694" width="1" />

<p>by Davide Risso, Liam Purvis, Russell B. Fletcher, Diya Das, John Ngai, Sandrine Dudoit, Elizabeth Purdom</p>

Clustering of genes and/or samples is a common task in gene expression analysis. The goals in clustering can vary, but an important scenario is that of finding biologically meaningful subtypes within the samples. This is an application that is particularly appropriate when there are large numbers of samples, as in many human disease studies. With the increasing popularity of single-cell transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq), many more controlled experiments on model organisms are similarly creating large gene expression datasets with the goal of detecting previously unknown heterogeneity within cells. It is common in the detection of novel subtypes to run many clustering algorithms, as well as rely on subsampling and ensemble methods to improve robustness. We introduce a Bioconductor R package, clusterExperiment, that implements a general and flexible strategy we entitle Resampling-based Sequential Ensemble Clustering (RSEC). RSEC enables the user to easily create multiple, competing clusterings of the data based on different techniques and associated tuning parameters, including easy integration of resampling and sequential clustering, and then provides methods for consolidating the multiple clusterings into a final consensus clustering. The package is modular and allows the user to separately apply the individual components of the RSEC procedure, i.e., apply multiple clustering algorithms, create a consensus clustering or choose tuning parameters, and merge clusters. Additionally, clusterExperiment provides a variety of visualization tools for the clustering process, as well as methods for the identification of possible cluster signatures or biomarkers. The R package clusterExperiment is publicly available through the Bioconductor Project, with a detailed manual (vignette) as well as well documented help pages for each function.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6VQoRLwjR-s" width="1" />

<p>by Zeynep Ertem, Dorrie Raymond, Lauren Ancel Meyers</p>

Forecasting the emergence and spread of influenza viruses is an important public health challenge. Timely and accurate estimates of influenza prevalence, particularly of severe cases requiring hospitalization, can improve control measures to reduce transmission and mortality. Here, we extend a previously published machine learning method for influenza forecasting to integrate multiple diverse data sources, including traditional surveillance data, electronic health records, internet search traffic, and social media activity. Our hierarchical framework uses multi-linear regression to combine forecasts from multiple data sources and greedy optimization with forward selection to sequentially choose the most predictive combinations of data sources. We show that the systematic integration of complementary data sources can substantially improve forecast accuracy over single data sources. When forecasting the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) influenza-like-illness reports (ILINet) from week 48 through week 20, the optimal combination of predictors includes public health surveillance data and commercially available electronic medical records, but neither search engine nor social media data.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GOZzg2Ktwrg" width="1" />

Abstract<p>"Good science" means answering important questions convincingly, a challenging endeavor under the best of circumstances. Our inability to replicate many biomedical studies has been the subject of numerous commentaries both in the scientific and lay press. In response, statistics has re-emerged as a necessary tool to improve the objectivity of study conclusions. However, psychological aspects of decision–making introduce preconceived preferences into scientific judgment that cannot be eliminated by any statistical method. The psychology of decision making, expounded by Kahneman, Tversky and Thayer, is well known in the field of economics, but the underlying concepts of cognitive psychology are also relevant to scientific judgments. I repeated experiments carried out on undergraduates by Kahneman and colleagues four to five decades ago, but with scientists, and obtained essentially the same results. The experiments were in the form of written reactions to scenarios, and participants were scientists at all career stages. The findings reinforce the roles that two inherent intuitions play in scientific decision-making: our drive to create a coherent narrative from new data regardless of its quality or relevance, and our inclination to seek patterns in data whether they exist or not. Moreover, we do not always consider how likely a result is regardless of its P-value. Low statistical power and inattention to principles underpinning Bayesian statistics reduce experimental rigor, but mitigating skills can be learned. Overcoming our natural human tendency to make quick decisions and jump to conclusions is a deeper obstacle to doing good science; this too can be learned.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Societal approaches to improving the rigor and reproducibility of preclinical biomedical science have largely been technical in nature with a renewed focus on the role of statistics in good experimental designs. By contrast, the importance of preconceived notions introduced by our very human nature has been under-appreciated for their influence on scientific judgments. Explicitly recognizing and addressing these cognitive biases, and including such strategies as carrying out a "premortem" before embarking on new experimental directions, should improve scientific judgments and thereby improve the quality of published findings, eventually boosting public confidence in science.</p>

Abstract
<p>It is often assumed that during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep the cerebral cortex homogenously shows electroencephalogram (EEG) activity highly similar to wakefulness. However, to date no studies have compared neural oscillatory activity in human REM sleep to resting wakefulness with high spatial sampling. In the current study, we evaluated high-resolution topographical changes in neural oscillatory power between both early and late naturalistic REM sleep and resting wakefulness in adult humans. All-night recordings with 256-channel high-density EEG (hd-EEG) were collected in healthy volunteers (<i>N</i> = 12). Topographic analysis revealed that, compared to wake, both the first and last cycle of REM sleep were associated with increased low-frequency oscillations in local central and occipital regions. In contrast, high-frequency activity in both α and β bands (8–20 Hz) was globally decreased during both early and late REM sleep cycles compared to wakefulness. No significant differences in topographic power in any frequency band were observed between REM sleep cycles occurring early and late in the night. We replicated these findings in an independent dataset (<i>N</i> = 33). Together, our findings show that human REM sleep shows consistent topographical changes in oscillatory power across both early and late sleep cycles compared to resting wakefulness.</p>

Abstract<p>Advances in calcium imaging have made it possible to record from an increasingly larger number of neurons simultaneously. Neuroscientists can now routinely image hundreds to thousands of individual neurons. An emerging technical challenge that parallels the advancement in imaging a large number of individual neurons is the processing of correspondingly larger datasets. One important step is the identification of individual neurons. Traditional methods rely mainly on manual or semi-manual inspection, which cannot be scaled for processing large datasets. To address this challenge, we focused on developing an automated segmentation method, which we refer to as Automated Cell Segmentation by Adaptive Thresholding (ACSAT). ACSAT works with a time-collapsed image and includes an iterative procedure that automatically calculates global and local threshold values during successive iterations based on the distribution of image pixel intensities. Thus, the algorithm is capable of handling variations in morphological details and in fluorescence intensities in different calcium imaging datasets. Within this manuscript we demonstrate the utility of ACSAT by testing it on 500 simulated datasets, two wide-field hippocampus datasets, a wide-field striatum dataset, a wide-field cell culture dataset, and a two-photon hippocampus dataset. For the simulated datasets with truth, ACSAT achieved over 80% recall and precision when the signal-to-noise ratio was no less than ~24 dB.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> ACSAT aims at automatically segmenting cells in large-scale calcium imaging datasets. It is based on adaptive thresholding at both global and local levels and iteratively identifies individual neurons in a time-collapsed image. It is designed to address a variety of datasets, potentially involving variations in cell morphology and fluorescence intensity between different datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ACSAT by testing it under a variety of conditions. For the simulated datasets with truth, ACSAT achieved recall and precision rates over 80% when the signal-to-noise ratio was no less than ~24 dB. For the datasets from mouse hippocampus and striatum, ACSAT captured ~80% of human-identified ROIs and even detected some low-intensity neurons that were initially undetected by human referees.</p>

Dysfunction of the noradrenergic (NE) neurons is implicated in the pathogenesis of bipolar disorder (BPD). ErbB4 is highly expressed in NE neurons, and its genetic variation has been linked to BPD; however, how ErbB4 regulates NE neuronal function and contributes to BPD pathogenesis is unclear. Here we find that conditional deletion of ErbB4 in locus coeruleus (LC) NE neurons increases neuronal spontaneous firing through NMDA receptor hyperfunction, and elevates catecholamines in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Furthermore, <i>Erbb4</i>-deficient mice present mania-like behaviors, including hyperactivity, reduced anxiety and depression, and increased sucrose preference. These behaviors are completely rescued by the anti-manic drug lithium or antagonists of catecholaminergic receptors. Our study demonstrates the critical role of ErbB4 signaling in regulating LC-NE neuronal function, reinforcing the view that dysfunction of the NE system may contribute to the pathogenesis of mania-associated disorder.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38907">Poor coherence in older people's speech is explained by impaired semantic and executive processes</a></h4>

The ability to speak coherently is essential for effective communication but declines with age: older people more frequently produce tangential, off-topic speech. The cognitive factors underpinning this decline are poorly understood. We predicted that maintaining coherence relies on effective regulation of activated semantic knowledge about the world, and particularly on the selection of currently relevant semantic representations to drive speech production. To test this, we collected 840 speech samples along with measures of executive and semantic ability from 60 young and older adults, using a novel computational method to quantify coherence. Semantic selection ability predicted coherence, as did level of semantic knowledge and a measure of domain-general executive ability. These factors fully accounted for the age-related coherence deficit. Our results indicate that maintaining coherence in speech becomes more challenging as people age because they accumulate more knowledge but are less able to effectively regulate how it is activated and used.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38744">Metformin reverses early cortical network dysfunction and behavior changes in Huntington's disease</a></h4>

Catching primal functional changes in early, 'very far from disease onset' (VFDO) stages of Huntington's disease is likely to be the key to a successful therapy. Focusing on VFDO stages, we assessed neuronal microcircuits in premanifest Hdh150 knock-in mice. Employing <i>in vivo</i> two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, we revealed an early pattern of circuit dysregulation in the visual cortex- one of the first regions affected in premanifest Huntington's disease - characterized by an increase in activity, an enhanced synchronicity and hyperactive neurons. These findings are accompanied by aberrations in animal behavior. We furthermore show that the anti-diabetic drug metformin diminishes aberrant Huntingtin protein load and fully restores both, early network activity patterns and behavioral aberrations. This network-centered approach reveals a critical window of vulnerability far before clinical manifestation and establishes metformin as a promising candidate for a chronic therapy starting early in premanifest Huntington's disease pathogenesis long before the onset of clinical symptoms.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38181">The retromer complex safeguards against neural progenitor-derived tumorigenesis by regulating notch receptor trafficking</a></h4>

The correct establishment and maintenance of unidirectional Notch signaling are critical for the homeostasis of various stem cell lineages. However, the molecular mechanisms that prevent cell-autonomous ectopic Notch signaling activation and deleterious cell fate decisions remain unclear. Here we show that the retromer complex directly and specifically regulates Notch receptor retrograde trafficking in <i>Drosophila</i> neuroblast lineages to ensure the unidirectional Notch signaling from neural progenitors to neuroblasts. Notch polyubiquitination mediated by E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch/Su(dx) is inherently inefficient within neural progenitors, relying on retromer-mediated trafficking to avoid aberrant endosomal accumulation of Notch and cell-autonomous signaling activation. Upon retromer dysfunction, hypo-ubiquitinated Notch accumulates in Rab7<sup>+</sup> enlarged endosomes, where it is ectopically processed and activated in a ligand-dependent manner, causing progenitor-originated tumorigenesis. Our results therefore unveil a safeguard mechanism whereby retromer retrieves potentially harmful Notch receptors in a timely manner to prevent aberrant Notch activation-induced neural progenitor dedifferentiation and brain tumor formation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/37487">Manipulating midbrain dopamine neurons and reward-related behaviors with light-controllable nicotinic acetylcholine receptors</a></h4>

Dopamine (DA) neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) integrate cholinergic inputs to regulate key functions such as motivation and goal-directed behaviors. Yet the temporal dynamic range and mechanism of action of acetylcholine (ACh) on the modulation of VTA circuits and reward-related behaviors are not known. Here, we used a chemical-genetic approach for rapid and precise optical manipulation of nicotinic neurotransmission in VTA neurons in living mice. We provide direct evidence that the ACh tone fine-tunes the firing properties of VTA DA neurons through β2-containing (β2*) nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs). Furthermore, locally photo-antagonizing these receptors in the VTA was sufficient to reversibly switch nicotine reinforcement on and off. By enabling control of nicotinic transmission in targeted brain circuits, this technology will help unravel the various physiological functions of nAChRs and may assist in the design of novel therapies relevant to neuropsychiatric disorders.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/37345">The mobility of packaged phage genome controls ejection dynamics</a></h4>

The cell decision between lytic and lysogenic infection is strongly influenced by dynamics of DNA injection into a cell from a phage population, as phages compete for limited resources and progeny. However, what controls the timing of viral DNA ejection events was not understood. This in vitro study reveals that DNA ejection dynamics for phages can be synchronized (occurring within seconds) or desynchronized (displaying minutes-long delays in initiation) based on mobility of encapsidated DNA, which in turn is regulated by environmental factors, such as temperature and extra-cellular ionic conditions. This mechano-regulation of ejection dynamics is suggested to influence viral replication where the cell’s decision between lytic and latent infection is associated with synchronized or desynchronized delayed ejection events from phage population adsorbed to a cell. Our findings are of significant importance for understanding regulatory mechanisms of latency in phage and Herpesviruses, where encapsidated DNA undergoes a similar mechanical transition.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/37294">Tumor copy number alteration burden is a pan-cancer prognostic factor associated with recurrence and death</a></h4>

The level of copy number alteration (CNA), termed CNA burden, in the tumor genome is associated with recurrence of primary prostate cancer. Whether CNA burden is associated with prostate cancer survival or outcomes in other cancers is unknown. We analyzed the CNA landscape of conservatively treated prostate cancer in a biopsy and transurethral resection cohort, reflecting an increasingly common treatment approach. We find that CNA burden is prognostic for cancer-specific death, independent of standard clinical prognostic factors. More broadly, we find CNA burden is significantly associated with disease-free and overall survival in primary breast, endometrial, renal clear cell, thyroid, and colorectal cancer in TCGA cohorts. To assess clinical applicability, we validated these findings in an independent pan-cancer cohort of patients whose tumors were sequenced using a clinically-certified next generation sequencing assay (MSK-IMPACT), where prognostic value varied based on cancer type. This prognostic association was affected by incorporating tumor purity in some cohorts. Overall, CNA burden of primary and metastatic tumors is a prognostic factor, potentially modulated by sample purity and measurable by current clinical sequencing.

Lymphoid and myeloid cells are abundant in the tumor microenvironment, can be quantified by immunohistochemistry and shape the disease course of human solid tumors. Yet, there is no comprehensive understanding of spatial immune infiltration patterns ('topography') across cancer entities and across various immune cell types. In this study, we systematically measure the topography of multiple immune cell types in 965 histological tissue slides from N=177 patients in a pan-cancer cohort. We provide a definition of inflamed ('hot'), non-inflamed ('cold') and immune excluded patterns and investigate how these patterns differ between immune cell types and between cancer types. In an independent cohort of N=287 colorectal cancer patients, we show that hot, cold and excluded topographies for effector lymphocytes (CD8) and tumor-associated macrophages (CD163) alone are not prognostic, but that a bivariate classification system can stratify patients. Our study adds evidence to consider immune topographies as biomarkers for patients with solid tumors.

<i>Pdgfra</i>-expressing (<i>Pdgfra+</i>) cells have been implicated as progenitors in many mesenchymal tissues. To determine lineage potential, we generated <i>Pdgfra<sup>rtTA</sup></i> knockin mice using CRISPR/Cas9. During lung maturation, counter to a prior study reporting that <i>Pdgfra</i>+ cells give rise equally to myofibroblasts and lipofibroblasts, lineage tracing using <i>Pdgfra<sup>rtTA</sup>;tetO-cre</i> mice indicated that ~95% of the lineaged cells are myofibroblasts. Genetic ablation of <i>Pdgfra<sup>+</sup> </i>cells using <i>Pdgfra<sup>rtTA</sup></i>-driven diphtheria toxin (DTA) led to alveolar simplification, demonstrating that these cells are essential for building the gas exchange surface area. In the adult bleomycin model of lung fibrosis, lineaged cells increased to contribute to pathological myofibroblasts. In contrast, in a neonatal hyperoxia model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), lineaged cells decreased and do not substantially contribute to pathological myofibroblasts. Our findings revealed complexity in the behavior of the <i>Pdgfra</i>-lineaged cells as exemplified by their distinct contributions to myofibroblasts in normal maturation, BPD and adult fibrosis.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/33752">A neural-level model of spatial memory and imagery</a></h4>

We present a model of how neural representations of egocentric spatial experiences in parietal cortex interface with viewpoint-independent representations in medial temporal areas, via retrosplenial cortex, to enable many key aspects of spatial cognition. This account shows how previously reported neural responses (place, head-direction and grid cells, allocentric boundary- and object-vector cells, gain-field neurons) can map onto higher cognitive function in a modular way, and predicts new cell types (egocentric and head-direction-modulated boundary- and object-vector cells). The model predicts how these neural populations should interact across multiple brain regions to support spatial memory, scene construction, novelty-detection, ‘trace cells’, and mental navigation. Simulated behavior and firing rate maps are compared to experimental data, for example showing how object-vector cells allow items to be remembered within a contextual representation based on environmental boundaries, and how grid cells could update the viewpoint in imagery during planning and short-cutting by driving sequential place cell activity.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/408542v1?rss=1">Real-world expectations and their affective value modulate object processing</a></h4>

It is well known that expectations influence how we perceive the world. Yet the neural mechanisms underlying this process remain unclear. Studies have focused so far on artificial contingencies between simple neutral cues and events. Real-world expectations are however often generated from complex associations between potentially affective contexts and objects learned over a lifetime. In this study, we used fMRI to investigate how object processing is influenced by neutral and affective context-based expectations. First, we show that the precuneus and the inferotemporal cortex are more active during object recognition when expectations have been elicited a priori, irrespectively of their validity or their affective intensity. This result supports previous hypotheses according to which these brain areas integrate contextual expectations with object sensory information. Early visual areas, on the contrary, are more active during object recognition when no prior expectation has been elicited by a context. Finally, we show that BOLD activity is enhanced in early visual areas when objects are less expected, but only when contexts are neutral; the reverse effect is observed when contexts are affective. This result supports a recent proposal that affect modulates predictions in the brain. Together, our results help elucidate the neural mechanisms of real-world expectations.

The precise regulation of synaptic integrity is critical for neuronal network connectivity and proper brain function. Essential aspects of the activity and localization of synaptic proteins are regulated by posttranslational modifications. S-palmitoylation is a reversible covalent modification of the cysteine with palmitate. It modulates affinity of the protein for cell membranes and membranous compartments. Intracellular palmitoylation dynamics are regulated by other posttranslational modifications, such as S-nitrosylation. Still unclear, however, are the ways in which this crosstalk is affected in brain pathology, such as stress-related disorders. Using a newly developed mass spectrometry-based approach (Palmitoylation And Nitrosylation Interplay Monitoring), we analyzed the endogenous S-palmitoylation and S-nitrosylation of postsynaptic density proteins at the level of specific single cysteines in a mouse model of chronic stress. Our results suggest that atypical mechanism of crosstalk between the S-palmitoylation and S-nitrosylation of synaptic proteins might be one of the major events associated with chronic stress disorders.

Most research laboratories abide by guidelines and mandates set by their research institution regarding the administration of analgesics to control pain during the postoperative period. Unfortunately, measuring pain originating from the head is difficult, making adequate decisions regarding pain control following stereotaxic surgery problematic. In addition, most postsurgical analgesia protocols require multiple injections over several days, which may cause stress and distress during a critical recovery period. Here we sought to 1) assess the degree of postoperative pain following craniotomy in mice, 2) compare the efficacy of three common rodent analgesics (carprofen, meloxicam and buprenorphine) for reducing this pain and 3) determine whether the route of administration (injected or self-administered through the water supply) influenced pain relief post-craniotomy. Using the mouse grimace scale (MGS), we found that injectable analgesics were significantly more effective at relieving post-craniotomy pain, however, both routes of administration decreased pain scores in the first 24 h post-surgery. Specifically, buprenorphine administered independently of administration route was the most effective at reducing MGS scores, however, female mice showed greater sensitivity to carprofen when administered through the water supply. Although it is necessary to provide laboratory animals with analgesics after an invasive procedure, there remains a gap in the literature regarding the degree of craniotomy-related pain in rodents and the efficacy of alternative routes of administration. Our study highlights the limitations of administering drugs through the water supply, even at doses that are considered to be higher than those currently recommended by most research institutions for treating pain of mild to moderate severity.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/408385v1?rss=1">CORnet: Modeling the Neural Mechanisms of Core Object Recognition</a></h4>

Deep artificial neural networks with spatially repeated processing (a.k.a., deep convolutional ANNs) have been established as the best class of candidate models of visual processing in primate ventral visual processing stream. Over the past five years, these ANNs have evolved from a simple feedforward eight-layer architecture in AlexNet to extremely deep and branching NASNet architectures, demonstrating increasingly better object categorization performance and increasingly better explanatory power of both neural and behavioral responses. However, from the neuroscientist's point of view, the relationship between such very deep architectures and the ventral visual pathway is incomplete in at least two ways. On the one hand, current state-of-the-art ANNs appear to be too complex (e.g., now over 100 levels) compared with the relatively shallow cortical hierarchy (4-8 levels), which makes it difficult to map their elements to those in the ventral visual stream and to understand what they are doing. On the other hand, current state-of-the-art ANNs appear to be not complex enough in that they lack recurrent connections and the resulting neural response dynamics that are commonplace in the ventral visual stream. Here we describe our ongoing efforts to resolve both of these issues by developing a "CORnet" family of deep neural network architectures. Rather than just seeking high object recognition performance (as the state-of-the-art ANNs above), we instead try to reduce the model family to its most important elements and then gradually build new ANNs with recurrent and skip connections while monitoring both performance and the match between each new CORnet model and a large body of primate brain and behavioral data. We report here that our current best ANN model derived from this approach (CORnet-S) is among the top models on Brain-Score, a composite benchmark for comparing models to the brain, but is simpler than other deep ANNs in terms of the number of convolutions performed along the longest path of information processing in the model. All CORnet models are available at https://github.com/dicarlolab/CORnet, and we plan to update this manuscript and the available models in this family as they are produced.

The ability to estimate precisely the time to contact (TTC) of the objects is necessary for planning actions in dynamic environments. However, this ability is not the same for all kinds of movement. Sometimes tracking an object and estimating its TTC is easy and accurate and sometimes it is not. In this study, we asked human subjects to estimate TTC of an object in lateral motion and approach motion. The object became invisible shortly after movement initiation. The results proved that TTC estimation for lateral motion is more accurate than for approach motion. We used mathematical analysis to show why humans are better in estimating TTC for lateral motion than for approach motion.

Modularity is a ubiquitous topological feature of structural brain networks at various scales. While a varietyof potential mechanisms have been proposed, the fundamental principles by which modularity emerges in neural networks remain elusive. We tackle this question with a plasticity model of neural networks derived from a purely topological perspective. The topological reinforcement (TR) model acts by enhancing the topological overlap (TO) between nodes. Specifically, the TR rule iteratively connects a randomly selected node to a non-neighbor with the highest TO, while pruning another network link at random, hence preserving graph density. The topological reinforcement reliably evolves synthetic random networks toward a modular architecture. Additionally, the final modular structure reflects features of the initial networks, particularly, local density variations ('proto-modules'), thus allowing to predict the modules of the evolved graph. Subsequently, we show that this topological selection principle when implemented biologically is equivalent to the classic Hebbian rule. Concretely, we explore a simple model of excitable dynamics, the SER model, in which the activity of network nodes is described by discrete susceptible, excited and refractory states. In this case, the plasticity rule acts in a Hebbian-like fashion, i.e., based on the functional connectivity (FC) between nodes represented by co-activations. Results produced by the SER-based model are consistent with TR, showing a consistent final network configuration. Our findings suggest that the selective reinforcement of topological overlap may be a fundamental mechanism by which brain networks evolve toward modular structure.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/408112v1?rss=1">Aperiodic Rhythms of the Inferior Olive</a></h4>

Inferior olivary activity causes both short-term and long-term changes in cerebellar output underlying motor adaptation and motor learning, respectively. Many of its neurons engage in coherent subthreshold oscillations and are extensively coupled via gap junctions. Studies in reduced preparations suggest that these properties promote rhythmic, synchronized output. However, how these properties interact with synaptic inputs controlling inferior olivary output in intact, awake behaving animals is poorly understood. Here we combine electrophysiological recordings in awake mice with a novel and realistic tissue-scale computational model of the inferior olive to study the relative impact of intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms governing its activity. Our data and model suggest that oscillations are present in the awake state, but that the period of subthreshold oscillations is variable, resulting in semi-periodic activity, which result in the high unpredictability of sensory-triggered complex spikes occurring in windows of opportunity lasting a few tens of milliseconds. To test the resonant properties of complex spike firing we used different temporal patterns of sensory stimulation in awake mice. Resonance was found to be limited to short intervals no more than a few hundred milliseconds, which could be explained by our network model to be a result of synaptic input to the inferior olive. The model also shows how gap junctional coupling stiffens the olivary network response to sensory modulation of complex spike rhythmicity. Interactions between intrinsic properties and extrinsic inputs can explain short-lasting semi-periodic variations of the spiking rhythms of olivary neurons even though their long-term average firing rate is stable, providing a conceptual framework for the creation of both the short-term and long-term changes in cerebellar output.

Dopamine (DA) released from VTA neurons in response to external cues or rewards may represent a learning signal. Here we introduce a spatial task where a reward-predicting cue instructs mice to navigate to a specific location. Simultaneous in vivo single-unit recordings revealed that DA neurons multiplexed an internal representation of the animal's goal-directed actions (locomotion, licking, distance) with phasic responses to cue and reward. Neuronal activity discriminated between rewarded and failed trials, generating an error signal even in the absence of external cues. Following a contingency change, mice readily learned to move to a different location, which became impossible, if the internal error signal was jammed by optogenetic stimulation. We conclude that a multiplexed internal representation of the task modulates VTA DA neuron activity, engaging a learning process that leads to the behavioral adaptation of goal directed action.

Importance: Between-subject variability in brain structure is determined by gene-environment interactions, possibly reflecting differential sensitivity to environmental and genetic perturbations. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have revealed thinner cortices and smaller subcortical volumes in patients. However, such group-level comparisons may mask considerable within-group heterogeneity, which has largely remained unnoticed in the literature. Objective: To compare brain structural variability between individuals with SZ and healthy controls (HC) and to test if respective variability reflects the polygenic risk for SZ (PRS) in HC. Design, Setting, and Participants: We compared MRI derived cortical thickness and subcortical volumes between 2,010 healthy controls and 1,151 patients with SZ across 16 cohorts. Secondly, we tested for associations between PRS and MRI features in 12,490 participants from UK Biobank. Main Outcomes and Measures: We modeled mean and dispersion effects of SZ and PRS using double generalized linear models. We performed vertex-wise analyses for thickness, and region-of-interest analysis for cortical, subcortical and hippocampal subfield volumes. Follow-up analyses included within-sample analysis, controlling for intracranial volume and population covariates, test of robustness of PRS threshold, and outlier removal. Results: Compared to controls, patients with SZ showed higher heterogeneity in cortical thickness, cortical and ventricle volumes, and hippocampal subfields. Higher PRS was associated with thinner frontal and temporal cortices, as well as smaller left CA2/3, but was not significantly associated with dispersion. Conclusion and relevance: SZ is associated with substantial brain structural heterogeneity beyond the mean differences. These findings possibly reflect higher differential sensitivity to environmental and genetic perturbations in patients, supporting the heterogeneous nature of SZ. Higher PRS for SZ was associated with thinner fronto-temporal cortices and smaller subcortical volumes, but there were no significant associations with the heterogeneity in these measures, i.e. the variability among individuals with high PRS were comparable to the variability among individuals with low PRS. This suggests that brain variability in SZ results from interactions between environmental and genetic factors that are not captured by the PGR. Factors contributing to heterogeneity in fronto-temporal cortices and hippocampus are thus key to further our understanding of how genetic and environmental factors shape brain biology in SZ.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/407858v1?rss=1">Characterizing the nonlinear structure of shared variability in cortical neuron populations using neural networks</a></h4>

Sensory neurons often have variable responses to repeated presentations of the same stimulus. Simultaneous recordings of neural populations demonstrate that such variability is often shared across many neurons, and thus cannot be simply averaged away. Understanding the effects of this shared variability on neural coding requires an understanding of what the common drivers of variability are, and how they are related to each other and to stimulus processing. Latent variable models offer an approach for characterizing the structure of this shared variability in neural recordings, though most previous modeling approaches have either been linear or had to make very restrictive assumptions about the nonlinear structure. Here we demonstrate the use of an autoencoder neural network as a general means to fit nonlinear latent variable models for analyzing large-scale neural recordings. We first present a general nonlinear latent variable model that is agnostic to the stimulus tuning properties of the individual neurons, and is hence well suited for exploring neural populations whose tuning properties are not well characterized. This motivates a second class of model, the Generalized Affine Model, which simultaneously determines each neuron's stimulus selectivity and a set of latent variables that modulate these stimulus responses both additively and multiplicatively. Despite the general nonlinear relationships that can be uncovered with our approaches, we find that population variability in anesthetized primary visual cortex (V1) is best described by a single additive and single multiplicative latent variable. However, this is not generally the case, and to contrast the V1 results we apply the same models to recordings in awake macaque prefrontal cortex, where more general nonlinearities are needed to compactly describe the population response variability. These results thus demonstrate how nonlinear latent variable models can be used to describe population variability, and suggest that a range of methods is necessary to study different brain regions under different experimental conditions.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/407700v1?rss=1">A Flexible Model of Working Memory</a></h4>

Working memory is fundamental to cognition, allowing one to hold information 'in mind' and use it to guide behavior. A defining characteristic of working memory is its flexibility: we can hold anything in mind. However, typical models of working memory rely on finely tuned, content-specific, attractors to persistently maintain neural activity and therefore do not allow for the flexibility observed in behavior. Here we present a flexible model of working memory that maintains representations through random recurrent connections between two layers of neurons: a structured 'sensory' layer and a randomly connected, unstructured, layer. As the interactions are untuned with respect to the content being stored, the network is able to maintain any arbitrary input. However, this flexibility comes at a cost: the random connections overlap, leading to interference between representations and limiting the memory capacity of the network. Additionally, our model captures several other key behavioral and neurophysiological characteristics of working memory.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/407676v1?rss=1">Modular preprocessing pipelines can reintroduce artifacts into fMRI data</a></h4>

The preprocessing pipelines typically used in both task and resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) analysis are modular in nature: They are composed of a number of separate filtering/regression steps, including removal of head motion covariates and band-pass filtering, performed sequentially and in a flexible order. In this paper we illustrate the shortcomings of this approach, as we show how later preprocessing steps can reintroduce artifacts previously removed from the data in prior preprocessing steps. We show that each regression step is a geometric projection of data onto a subspace, and that performing a sequence of projections can move the data into subspaces no longer orthogonal to those previously removed, reintroducing signal related to nuisance covariates. Thus, linear filtering operations are not commutative, and the order in which the preprocessing steps are performed is critical. These issues can arise in practice when any combination of standard preprocessing steps - including motion regression, scrubbing, component-based correction, global signal regression, and temporal filtering - are performed sequentially. In this work we focus primarily on rs-fMRI. We illustrate the problem both theoretically and empirically through application to a test-retest rs-fMRI data set, and suggest remedies. These include (a) combining all steps into a single linear filter, or (b) sequential orthogonalization of covariates/linear filters performed in series.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/407668v1?rss=1">The accessible chromatin landscape of the hippocampus at single-cell resolution</a></h4>

Here we present a comprehensive map of the accessible chromatin landscape of the mouse hippocampus at single-cell resolution. Substantial advances of this work include the optimization of single-cell combinatorial indexing assay for transposase accessible chromatin (sci-ATAC-seq), a software suite, scitools, for the rapid processing and visualization of single-cell combinatorial indexing datasets, and a valuable resource of hippocampal regulatory networks at single-cell resolution. We utilized sci-ATAC-seq to produce 2,346 high-quality single-cell chromatin accessibility maps with a mean unique read count per cell of 29,201 from both fresh and frozen hippocampi, observing little difference in accessibility patterns between the preparations. Using this dataset, we identified eight distinct major clusters of cells representing both neuronal and non-neuronal cell types and characterized the driving regulatory factors and differentially accessible loci that define each cluster. We then applied a recently described co-accessibility framework, Cicero, which identified 146,818 links between promoters and putative distal regulatory DNA. Identified co-accessibility networks showed cell-type specificity, shedding light on key dynamic loci that reconfigure to specify hippocampal cell lineages. Lastly, we carried out an additional sci-ATAC-seq preparation from cultured hippocampal neurons (899 high-quality cells, 43,532 mean unique reads) that revealed substantial alterations in their epigenetic landscape compared to nuclei from hippocampal tissue. This dataset and accompanying analysis tools provide a new resource that can guide subsequent studies of the hippocampus.

Oligodendrocytes wrap around the axons and form the myelin. Myelin facilitates rapid neural signal transmission. Any damage to myelin disrupts neuronal communication leading to neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). There is no cure for MS. This is, in part, due to lack of an efficient method for myelin quantification during drug screening. In this study, an image analysis based myelin sheath detection method, DeepMQ, is developed. The method consists of a feature extraction step followed by a deep learning based binary classification module. The images, which were acquired on a confocal microscope contain three channels and multiple z-sections. Each channel represents either oligodendroyctes, neurons, or nuclei. During feature extraction, 26-neighbours of each voxel is mapped onto a 2D feature image. This image is, then, fed to the deep learning classifier, in order to detect myelin. Results indicate that 93.38% accuracy is achieved in a set of fluorescence microscope images of mouse stem cell-derived oligodendroyctes and neurons. To the best of authors' knowledge, this is the first study utilizing image analysis along with machine learning techniques to quantify myelination.

Retinal ganglion cells, the sole output neurons of the retina, exhibit surprising diversity. A recent study reported over 30 distinct types in the mouse retina, indicating that the processing of visual information is highly parallelised in the brain. The advent of high density multi-electrode arrays now enables recording from many hundreds to thousands of neurons from a single retina. Here we describe a method for automatic classification of large-scale retinal recordings using a simple stimulus paradigm and a spike train distance measure as a clustering metric. We evaluate this approach with synthetic spike trains, and demonstrate that the major known cell types are discovered in a high-density recording from a mouse retina. We find that the major known cell types are identified from a single high-density recording session from the mouse retina with about 1000 retinal ganglion cells. As a parameter-free method, it is broadly applicable for the physiological classification of sensory neurons.

Accurate, reliable prediction of risk for Alzheimers disease (AD) is essential for early, disease-modifying therapeutics. Multimodal MRI, such as structural and diffusion MRI, is likely to contain complementary information of neurodegenerative processes in AD. Here we tested the utility of commonly available multimodal MRI (T1-weighted structure and diffusion MRI), combined with high-throughput brain phenotyping-morphometry and connectomics-and machine learning, as a diagnostic tool for AD. We used, firstly, a clinical cohort at a dementia clinic (study 1: Ilsan Dementia Cohort; N=211; 110 AD, 64 mild cognitive impairment [MCI], and 37 subjective memory complaints [SMC]) to test and validate the diagnostic models; and, secondly, Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)-2 (study 2) to test the generalizability of the approach and the prognostic models with longitudinal follow up data. Our machine learning models trained on the morphometric and connectome estimates (number of features=34,646) showed optimal classification accuracy (AD/SMC: 97% accuracy, MCI/SMC: 83% accuracy; AD/MCI: 97% accuracy) with iterative nested cross-validation in a single-site study, outperforming the benchmark model (FLAIR-based white matter hyperintensity volumes). In a generalizability study using ADNI-2, the combined connectome and morphometry model showed similar or superior accuracies (AD/HC: 96%; MCI/HC: 70%; AD/MCI: 75% accuracy) as CSF biomarker model (t-tau, p-tau, and Amyloid beta;, and ratios). We also predicted MCI to AD progression with 69% accuracy, compared with the 70% accuracy using CSF biomarker model. The optimal classification accuracy in a single-site dataset and the reproduced results in multi-site dataset show the feasibility of the high-throughput imaging analysis of multimodal MRI and data-driven machine learning for predictive modeling in AD.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/407544v1?rss=1">The Human Default Consciousness and its Disruption: Insights from an EEG Study of Buddhist Jhana Meditation</a></h4>

While the brains default mode network (DMN) and the neural correlates of consciousness are familiar topics in neuroscience research, this paper focuses instead on the underlying human default consciousness, of which we consider the DMN to be the outer expression. Task-based studies of the DMN by their nature recruit one part of the cortical network to study another, and are therefore both limited and compromised as to what information they can reveal about consciousness itself. The only situations to give a glimpse of consciousness as a whole, or its absence, are severely disrupted states such as anaesthesia, coma, deep non-rapid eye movement (nREM) sleep, or some extreme pathological states, all of which are essentially involuntary, and generally regarded as unconscious. An exception to involuntary disruption can be found in Buddhist jh[a]na meditation, whose implicit aim is to intentionally withdraw attention from the everyday default consciousness to an inward-directed state of stillness, referred to as jh[a]na consciousness, as a basis from which to develop insight. In this context the human default consciousness is regarded as a sensory consciousness, where information about, and our experience of, the outer world is evaluated against personal and organic needs and forms the basis of our ongoing self-experience. This paper is a preliminary report on the first detailed EEG study of this form of meditation, with findings radically different to EEG studies of more familiar and less focused forms of meditation. A high proportion of subjects display spindle activity in their EEG, superficially similar to spindles seen in the approach to nREM sleep, while more-experienced subjects display high voltage slow-wave EEG activity reminiscent, but significantly different, to the slow waves of deep nREM sleep, or even high-voltage delta coma. Some others show brief posterior spike-wave bursts, again similar, but with significant differences, to absence epilepsy. Some subjects also develop the ability to consciously evoke clonic seizure-like activity at will, under full control. We suggest that the intensity and remarkable nature of these observations reflects a profound disruption of the human DCs when the personal element is progressively withdrawn.

Understanding how the heart influences brain dynamics will suppose a deep change for the neuroscience, psychology and medicine. A mainstay questions is the heart modulation of resting state brain networks and its relation with both the cardiac dynamics and the cognitive status. We evaluated the heart evoked basal networks for controls and two groups of mild cognitive impairment patients, stable and progressive to Alzheimer's disease without cardiovascular alteration symptoms. Our results in controls show that a healthy cognitive performance correlates with the heart modulation of brain dynamics in areas of the default mode network, and that the heart influence on brain networks varies along the cardiac cycle and the spectral band. However, the cognitive deficit produced by dementia correlates with the lack of heart modulation on brain activity. The heart influence on brain networks is disrupted in patients by producing hypersynchronization, accompanied by decreased cardiac complexity. We designed a surrogate and predictive procedure based on machine learning to compare the heart evoked results with the neural activity no locked to heartbeats. Based on our longitudinal data, we conclude that the prediction to progression to Alzheimer's disease is higher when considering the heart brain interaction than when taking into account only the brain dynamics. We can conclude that brain networks in control subjects were more responsive to the heart cycle, allowing a wealthier, more complex pattern of oscillations. Our results highlight the role of heart in cognitive neuroscience by showing that basal brain networks are modulated by the cardiac dynamics.

Background: Studies have suggested that aphasia rates are different in men and women following stroke. One hypothesis says that men have more lateralized language function than women. Given unilateral stroke, this would lead to a prediction of men having higher aphasia rates than women. Another line of observations suggest that women are more severely affected by stroke, which leads to a higher aphasia rate, but in an unspecific manner. An additional potential confounding variable could be age at stroke, given that women are typically older at the time of stroke. Methods &amp; Procedures: This study consists of two parts. First, a meta-analysis of the available reports of aphasia rates in the two genders was conducted. A comprehensive literature search yielded 25 studies with sufficient aphasia and gender information. These studies included a total of 48,362 stroke patients for which aphasia rates were calculated. Second, data were analysed from an American health database with 1,655,295 stroke patients, in order to include age differences at stroke between the genders and stroke severity into a regression analysis of gender differences in aphasia rates. Outcomes &amp; Results: Both analyses revealed significantly larger aphasia rates in women than in men. This speaks against the idea that women should be more lateralized in their language function. Furthermore, when age and stroke severity were included as covariates, gender failed to explain any aphasia rate gender difference above and beyond that which is explained by age differences at time of stroke.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/407270v1?rss=1">Coordinate based meta-analysis of networks in neuroimaging studies</a></h4>

Meta-analysis of published neuroimaging results is commonly performed using coordinate based meta-analysis (CBMA). Most commonly CBMA algorithms detect spatial clustering of reported coordinates across multiple studies by assuming that results relating to the common hypothesis fall in similar anatomical locations. The null hypothesis is that studies report uncorrelated results, which is simulated by random coordinates. It is assumed that multiple clusters are independent yet it is likely that multiple results reported per study are not, and in fact represent a network effect. Here the multiple reported effect sizes (reported peak Z scores) are assumed multivariate normal, and maximum likelihood used to estimate the parameters of the covariance matrix. The hypothesis is that the effect sizes are correlated. The parameters are covariance of effect size, considered as edges of a network, while clusters are considered as nodes. In this way coordinate based meta-analysis of networks (CBMAN) estimates a network of reported meta-effects, rather than multiple independent effects (clusters). CBMAN uses only the same data as CBMA, yet produces extra information in terms of the correlation between clusters. Here it is validated on numerically simulated data, and demonstrated on real data used previously to demonstrate CBMA. The CBMA and CBMAN clusters are similar, despite the very different hypothesis.

<p>In this paper, the deep learning (DL) approach is applied to a joint training
scheme for asynchronous motor imagery-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). The
proposed DL approach is a cascade of one-dimensional convolutional neural
networks and fully-connected neural networks (CNN-FC). The focus is mainly on
three types of brain responses: non-imagery EEG (\textit{background EEG}),
(\textit{pure imagery}) EEG, and EEG during the transitional period between
background EEG and pure imagery (\textit{transitional imagery}). The study of
transitional imagery signals should provide greater insight into real-world
scenarios. It may be inferred that pure imagery and transitional EEG are high
and low power EEG imagery, respectively. Moreover, the results from the CNN-FC
are compared to the conventional approach for motor imagery-BCI, namely the
common spatial pattern (CSP) for feature extraction and support vector machine
(SVM) for classification (CSP-SVM). Under a joint training scheme, pure and
transitional imagery are treated as the same class, while background EEG is
another class. Ten-fold cross-validation is used to evaluate whether the joint
training scheme significantly improves the performance task of classifying pure
and transitional imagery signals from background EEG. Using sparse of just a
few electrode channels ($C_{z}$, $C_{3}$ and $C_{4}$), mean accuracy reaches
71.52 % and 70.27 % for CNN-FC and CSP-SVM, respectively. On the other hand,
mean accuracy without the joint training scheme achieve only 62.68 % and 52.41
% for CNN-FC and CSP-SVM, respectively.

<p>From philosophers of ancient times to modern economists, biologists and other
researchers are engaged in revealing causal relations. The most challenging
problem is inferring the type of the causal relationship: whether it is uni- or
bi-directional or only apparent - implied by a hidden common cause only. Modern
technology provides us tools to record data from complex systems such as the
ecosystem of our planet or the human brain, but understanding their functioning
needs detection and distinction of causal relationships of the system
components without interventions. Here we present a new method, which
distinguishes and assigns probabilities to the presence of all the possible
causal relations between two or more time series from dynamical systems. The
new method is validated on synthetic datasets and applied to EEG
(electroencephalographic) data recorded in epileptic patients. Given the
universality of our method, it may find application in many fields of science.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38215">Adaptation after vastus lateralis denervation in rats demonstrates neural regulation of joint stresses and strains</a></h4>

In order to produce movements, muscles must act through joints. The translation from muscle force to limb movement is mediated by internal joint structures that permit movement in some directions but constrain it in others. Although muscle forces acting against constrained directions will not affect limb movements, such forces can cause excess stresses and strains in joint structures, leading to pain or injury. In this study, we hypothesized that the central nervous system (CNS) chooses muscle activations to avoid excess joint stresses and strains. We evaluated this hypothesis by examining adaptation strategies after selective paralysis of a muscle acting at the rat's knee. We show that the CNS compromises between restoration of task performance and regulation of joint stresses and strains. These results have significant implications to our understanding of the neural control of movements, suggesting that common theories emphasizing task performance are insufficient to explain muscle activations during behaviors.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/37429">An intrinsic cell cycle timer terminates limb bud outgrowth</a></h4>

The longstanding view of how proliferative outgrowth terminates following the patterning phase of limb development involves the breakdown of reciprocal extrinsic signalling between the distal mesenchyme and the overlying epithelium (e-m signalling). However, by grafting distal mesenchyme cells from late stage chick wing buds to the epithelial environment of younger wing buds, we show that this mechanism is not required. RNA sequencing reveals that distal mesenchyme cells complete proliferative outgrowth by an intrinsic cell cycle timer in the presence of e-m signalling. In this process, e-m signalling is required permissively to allow the intrinsic cell cycle timer to run its course. We provide evidence that a temporal switch from BMP antagonism to BMP signalling controls the intrinsic cell cycle timer during limb outgrowth. Our findings have general implications for other patterning systems in which extrinsic signals and intrinsic timers are integrated.

Though the last decade has seen accelerated advances in techniques and technologies to perturb neuronal circuitry in the brain, we are still poorly equipped to adequately dissect endogenous peptide release <i>in vivo</i>. To this end we developed a system that combines <i>in vivo</i> optogenetics with microdialysis and a highly sensitive mass spectrometry-based assay to measure opioid peptide release in freely moving rodents.

Active intracellular transport of organelles relies on the coordinated activities of cytoplasmic dynein and kinesin, ATP-dependent microtubule motor proteins. While axonemal dynein was discovered during the mid-1960s, it was not until the mid-1980s that kinesin was discovered by Ron Vale and colleagues, as reported in 1985. Their research demonstrated that the newly identified protein, isolated from both squid axoplasm and bovine brain, was independently capable of driving microtubule gliding or organelle movement.

Using new methods to functionally dissect circuits, two papers from 2015 found enhanced synaptic properties of the inputs and outputs of hippocampal adult-born neurons specifically during a critical period of their development. These studies provided a circuit-level view of unique roles for new neurons and how they cope with the ever-changing environment.

The ability of central synapses to undergo long-term potentiation (LTP) still captures the imagination of scientists and has become one of the most fascinating and deeply studied questions in modern neuroscience. By the mid-1990s, however, the field was deeply ensnarled in trying to answer a passionately dichotomous question: is LTP expressed by a pre- or a postsynaptic mechanism? Experimental results that could only be seen by many as being incontrovertibly contradictory presented a perplexing conundrum.

Is an amygdala necessary to experience and perceive fear? Intriguing evidence comes from patient S.M. who lost her left and right amygdalae to disease. Initial testing suggested that S.M.’s most defining symptom was an inability to recognize fear in other people’s facial expressions. A fascinating paper by Adolphs and colleagues in 2005 examined one potential mechanism for this impairment: a failure to spontaneously attend to widened eyes, the most distinctive physical feature portrayed in symbolic fear expressions.

<p>by David G. Mets, Michael S. Brainard</p>

Studies of learning mechanisms critically depend on the ability to accurately assess learning outcomes. This assessment can be impeded by the often complex, multidimensional nature of behavior. We present a novel, automated approach to evaluating imitative learning. Conceptually, our approach estimates how much of the content present in a reference behavior is absent from the learned behavior. We validate our approach through examination of songbird vocalizations, complex learned behaviors the study of which has provided many insights into sensory-motor learning in general and vocal learning in particular. Historically, learning has been holistically assessed by human inspection or through comparison of specific song features selected by experimenters (e.g. fundamental frequency, spectral entropy). In contrast, our approach uses statistical models to broadly capture the structure of each song, and then estimates the divergence between the two models. We show that our measure of song learning (the Kullback-Leibler divergence between two distributions corresponding to specific song data, or, Song <i>D</i><sub>KL</sub>) is well correlated with human evaluation of song learning. We then expand the analysis beyond learning and show that Song <i>D</i><sub>KL</sub> also detects the typical song deterioration that occurs following deafening. Finally, we illustrate how this measure can be extended to quantify differences in other complex behaviors such as human speech and handwriting. This approach potentially provides a framework for assessing learning across a broad range of behaviors like song that can be described as a set of discrete and repeated motor actions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YQeuwoUWgbQ" width="1" />

<p>by Athina Tzovara, Christoph W. Korn, Dominik R. Bach</p>

Learning to predict threat from environmental cues is a fundamental skill in changing environments. This aversive learning process is exemplified by Pavlovian threat conditioning. Despite a plethora of studies on the neural mechanisms supporting the formation of associations between neutral and aversive events, our computational understanding of this process is fragmented. Importantly, different computational models give rise to different and partly opposing predictions for the trial-by-trial dynamics of learning, for example expressed in the activity of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Here, we investigate human ANS responses to conditioned stimuli during Pavlovian fear conditioning. To obtain precise, trial-by-trial, single-subject estimates of ANS responses, we build on a statistical framework for psychophysiological modelling. We then consider previously proposed non-probabilistic models, a simple probabilistic model, and non-learning models, as well as different observation functions to link learning models with ANS activity. Across three experiments, and both for skin conductance (SCR) and pupil size responses (PSR), a probabilistic learning model best explains ANS responses. Notably, SCR and PSR reflect different quantities of the same model: SCR track a mixture of expected outcome and uncertainty, while PSR track expected outcome alone. In summary, by combining psychophysiological modelling with computational learning theory, we provide systematic evidence that the formation and maintenance of Pavlovian threat predictions in humans may rely on probabilistic inference and includes estimation of uncertainty. This could inform theories of neural implementation of aversive learning.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wAb--UbEeJA" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Acetylcholine (ACh) neurons in the pontomesencephalic tegmentum (PMT) are thought to play an important role in promoting cortical activation with waking and paradoxical (or REM) sleep (PS), but have yet to be proven to do so by selective stimulation and simultaneous recording of identified ACh neurons. Here, we employed optogenetics combined with juxtacellular recording and labeling of neurons in transgenic mice expressing ChR2 in choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-synthesizing neurons. We established <i>in vitro</i> then <i>in vivo</i> in anesthetized and unanesthetized, head-fixed mice that photostimulation elicited a spike with short latency in neurons which could be identified by immunohistochemical staining as ACh neurons within the laterodorsal/sublaterodorsal and pedunculopontine tegmental nuclei (LDT/SubLDT and PPT). Continuous light pulse stimulation during sleep evoked tonic spiking by ACh neurons that elicited a shift from irregular slow wave activity to rhythmic theta and enhanced gamma activity on the cortex without behavioral arousal. With theta frequency rhythmic light pulse stimulation, ACh neurons discharged in bursts that occurred in synchrony with evoked cortical theta. During natural sleep-wake states, they were virtually silent during slow wave sleep (SWS), discharged in bursts during PS and discharged tonically during waking (W). Yet, their bursting during PS was not rhythmic or synchronized with cortical theta, but associated with phasic whisker movements. We conclude that ACh PMT neurons promote theta and gamma cortical activity during W and PS by their tonic or phasic discharge through release of ACh onto local neurons within the PMT and/or more distant targets in the hypothalamus and thalamus.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> By selectively stimulating and recording acetylcholine (ACh) neurons in the pontomesencephalic tegmentum (PMT), we show that evoked tonic or theta rhythmic phasic firing by ACh neurons attenuates slow wave activity and stimulates theta and gamma activity on the cerebral cortex without eliciting behavioral arousal from sleep. During natural sleeping-waking, ACh neurons are virtually silent during slow wave sleep (SWS), discharge in bursts during paradoxical or REM sleep (PS) and discharge in a tonic manner during waking (W). We conclude that by tonic or burst discharge during W and PS, ACh PMT neurons promote theta with gamma activities that are known to be important for memory along with other cortical processes during these states.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0203-18.2018v1?rss=1">Myelination of axons corresponds with faster transmission speed in the prefrontal cortex of developing male rats</a></h4>

Abstract<p>Myelination of prefrontal circuits during adolescence is thought to lead to enhanced cognitive processing and improved behavioral control. However, while standard neuroimaging techniques commonly used in human and animal studies can measure large white matter bundles and residual conduction speed, they cannot directly measure myelination of individual axons or how fast electrical signals travel along these axons. Here we focused on a specific population of prefrontal axons to directly measure conduction velocity and myelin microstructure in developing male rats. An <i>in vitro</i> electrophysiological approach enabled us to isolate monosynaptic projections from the anterior branches of the corpus callosum (corpus callosum-forceps minor, CC<sub>FM</sub>) to the anterior cingulate subregion of the medial prefrontal cortex (Cg1) and to measure the speed and direction of action potentials propagating along these axons. We found that a large number of axons projecting from the CC<sub>FM</sub> to neurons in layer V of Cg1 are ensheathed with myelin between pre-adolescence (postnatal day 15) and mid-adolescence (postnatal day 43). This robust increase in axonal myelination is accompanied by a doubling of transmission speed. As there was no age difference in the diameter of these axons, myelin is likely the driving force behind faster transmission of electrical signals in older animals. These developmental changes in axonal microstructure and physiology may extend to other axonal populations as well, and could underlie some of the improvements in cognitive processing between childhood and adolescence.</p><p><b>Significance</b> Neural processing improves during childhood and adolescent development, but the specific factors contributing to these developmental changes are largely unknown. The present study shows that between two and six weeks of age in male rats, axons in the prefrontal cortex undergo microstructural and electrophysiological changes that speed up neural transmission. These axonal changes could contribute to some of the developmental improvements in behavioral control and cognitive abilities dependent on the prefrontal cortex.</p>

<p>Excessive noise exposure damages sensory hair cells, leading to permanent hearing loss. Zebrafish are a highly tractable model that have advanced our understanding of drug-induced hair cell death, yet no comparable model exists for noise exposure research. We demonstrate the utility of zebrafish as model to increase understanding of hair cell damage from acoustic trauma and develop protective therapies. We created an acoustic trauma system using underwater cavitation to stimulate lateral line hair cells. We found that acoustic stimulation resulted in exposure time- and intensity-dependent lateral line and saccular hair cell damage that is maximal at 48–72 h post-trauma. The number of TUNEL+ lateral line hair cells increased 72 h post-exposure, whereas no increase was observed in TUNEL+ supporting cells, demonstrating that acoustic stimulation causes hair cell-specific damage. Lateral line hair cells damaged by acoustic stimulation regenerate within 3 d, consistent with prior regeneration studies utilizing ototoxic drugs. Acoustic stimulation-induced hair cell damage is attenuated by pharmacological inhibition of protein synthesis or caspase activation, suggesting a requirement for translation and activation of apoptotic signaling cascades. Surviving hair cells exposed to acoustic stimulation showed signs of synaptopathy, consistent with mammalian studies. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of this platform to identify compounds that prevent acoustic trauma by screening a small redox library for protective compounds. Our data suggest that acoustic stimulation results in lateral line hair cell damage consistent with acoustic trauma research in mammals, providing a highly tractable model for high-throughput genetic and drug discovery studies.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40889">Insights into the key determinants of membrane protein topology enable the identification of new monotopic folds</a></h4>

Monotopic membrane proteins integrate into the lipid bilayer via reentrant hydrophobic domains that enter and exit on a single face of the membrane. Whereas many membrane-spanning proteins have been structurally characterized and transmembrane topologies can be predicted computationally, relatively little is known about the determinants of membrane topology in monotopic proteins. Recently, we reported the X-ray structure determination of PglC, a full-length monotopic membrane protein with phosphoglycosyl transferase (PGT) activity. The definition of this unique structure has prompted <i>in vivo</i>, biochemical, and computational analyses to understand and define two key motifs that contribute to the membrane topology and to provide insight into the dynamics of the enzyme in a lipid bilayer environment. Using the new information gained from studies on the PGT superfamily we demonstrate that the two motifs exemplify principles of topology determination that can be applied to the identification of reentrant domains among diverse monotopic proteins of interest.

Centrosome structure, function, and number are finely regulated at the cellular level to ensure normal mammalian development. Here, we characterize PPP1R35 as a novel bona fide centrosomal protein and demonstrate that it is critical for centriole elongation. Using quantitative super-resolution microscopy mapping and live-cell imaging we show that PPP1R35 is a resident centrosomal protein located in the proximal lumen above the cartwheel, a region of the centriole that has eluded detailed characterization. Loss of PPP1R35 function results in decreased centrosome number and shortened centrioles that lack centriolar distal and microtubule wall associated proteins required for centriole elongation. We further demonstrate that PPP1R35 acts downstream of, and forms a complex with, RTTN, a microcephaly protein required for distal centriole elongation. Altogether, our study identifies a novel step in the centriole elongation pathway centered on PPP1R35 and elucidates downstream partners of the microcephaly protein RTTN.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Studies of classical musicians have demonstrated that expertise modulates neural responses during auditory perception. However, it remains unclear whether such expertise-dependent plasticity is modulated by the instrument that a musician plays. To examine whether the recruitment of sensorimotor regions during music perception is modulated by instrument-specific experience, we studied nonclassical musicians—beatboxers, who predominantly use their vocal apparatus to produce sound, and guitarists, who use their hands. We contrast fMRI activity in 20 beatboxers, 20 guitarists, and 20 nonmusicians as they listen to novel beatboxing and guitar pieces. All musicians show enhanced activity in sensorimotor regions (IFG, IPC, and SMA), but only when listening to the musical instrument they can play. Using independent component analysis, we find expertise-selective enhancement in sensorimotor networks, which are distinct from changes in attentional networks. These findings suggest that long-term sensorimotor experience facilitates access to the posterodorsal “how” pathway during auditory processing.</span>

<p>by Hyoungkyu Kim, Joon-Young Moon, George A. Mashour, UnCheol Lee</p>

Hysteresis, the discrepancy in forward and reverse pathways of state transitions, is observed during changing levels of consciousness. Identifying the underlying mechanism of hysteresis phenomena in the brain will enhance the ability to understand, monitor, and control state transitions related to consciousness. We hypothesized that hysteresis in brain networks shares the same underlying mechanism of hysteresis as other biological and non-biological networks. In particular, we hypothesized that the principle of explosive synchronization, which can mediate abrupt state transitions, would be critical to explaining hysteresis in the brain during conscious state transitions. We analyzed high-density electroencephalogram (EEG) that was acquired in healthy human volunteers during conscious state transitions induced by the general anesthetics sevoflurane or ketamine. We developed a novel method to monitor the temporal evolution of EEG networks in a parameter space, which consists of the strength and topography of EEG-based networks. Furthermore, we studied conditions of explosive synchronization in anatomically informed human brain network models. We identified hysteresis in the trajectory of functional brain networks during state transitions. The model study and empirical data analysis explained various hysteresis phenomena during the loss and recovery of consciousness in a principled way: (1) more potent anesthetics induce a larger hysteresis; (2) a larger range of EEG frequencies facilitates transitions into unconsciousness and impedes the return of consciousness; (3) hysteresis of connectivity is larger than that of EEG power; and (4) the structure and strength of functional brain networks reconfigure differently during the loss vs. recovery of consciousness. We conclude that the hysteresis phenomena observed during the loss and recovery of consciousness are generic network features. Furthermore, the state transitions are grounded in the same principle as state transitions in complex non-biological networks, especially during perturbation. These findings suggest the possibility of predicting and modulating hysteresis of conscious state transitions in large-scale brain networks.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aUxmACj420A" width="1" />

Isolation profoundly influences social behavior in all animals. In humans, isolation has serious effects on health and disease. <i>Drosophila</i> melanogaster is a powerful model to study small-scale, temporally-transient social behavior. However, longer-term analysis of large groups of flies is hampered by the lack of effective and reliable tools. We built a new imaging arena and improved the existing tracking algorithm to reliably follow a large number of flies simultaneously. Next, based on the automatic classification of touch and graph-based social network analysis, we designed an algorithm to quantify changes in the social network in response to prior social isolation. We observed that isolation significantly and swiftly enhanced individual and local social network parameters depicting near-neighbor relationships. We explored the genome-wide molecular correlates of these behavioral changes and found that whereas behavior changed throughout the six days of isolation, gene expression alterations occurred largely on day one. These changes occurred mostly in metabolic genes, and we verified the metabolic changes by showing an increase of lipid content in isolated flies. In summary, we describe a highly reliable tracking and analysis pipeline for large groups of flies that we use to unravel the behavioral, molecular and physiological impact of isolation on social network dynamics in <i>Drosophila</i>.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Ng-D0RyUL7g" width="1" />

<p>by Assaf Amitai, Arup K. Chakraborty, Mehran Kardar</p>

The spikes on virus surfaces bind receptors on host cells to propagate infection. High spike densities (SDs) can promote infection, but spikes are also targets of antibody-mediated immune responses. Thus, diverse evolutionary pressures can influence virus SDs. HIV’s SD is about two orders of magnitude lower than that of other viruses, a surprising feature of unknown origin. By modeling antibody evolution through affinity maturation, we find that an intermediate SD maximizes the affinity of generated antibodies. We argue that this leads most viruses to evolve high SDs. T helper cells, which are depleted during early HIV infection, play a key role in antibody evolution. We find that T helper cell depletion results in high affinity antibodies when SD is high, but not if SD is low. This special feature of HIV infection may have led to the evolution of a low SD to avoid potent immune responses early in infection.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dcSOF7zmBHg" width="1" />

<p>by Jay S. Coggan, Daniel Keller, Corrado Calì, Heikki Lehväslaiho, Henry Markram, Felix Schürmann, Pierre J. Magistretti</p>

The mechanism of rapid energy supply to the brain, especially to accommodate the heightened metabolic activity of excited states, is not well-understood. We explored the role of glycogen as a fuel source for neuromodulation using the noradrenergic stimulation of glia in a computational model of the neural-glial-vasculature ensemble (NGV). The detection of norepinephrine (NE) by the astrocyte and the coupled cAMP signal are rapid and largely insensitive to the distance of the locus coeruleus projection release sites from the glia, implying a diminished impact for volume transmission in high affinity receptor transduction systems. Glucosyl-conjugated units liberated from glial glycogen by NE-elicited cAMP second messenger transduction winds sequentially through the glycolytic cascade, generating robust increases in NADH and ATP before pyruvate is finally transformed into lactate. This astrocytic lactate is rapidly exported by monocarboxylate transporters to the associated neuron, demonstrating that the astrocyte-to-neuron lactate shuttle activated by glycogenolysis is a likely fuel source for neuromodulation and enhanced neural activity. Altogether, the energy supply for both astrocytes and neurons can be supplied rapidly by glycogenolysis upon neuromodulatory stimulus.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6DA81-uUvVk" width="1" />

<p>by Martin Raden, Mostafa Mahmoud Mohamed, Syed Mohsin Ali, Rolf Backofen</p>

The investigation of RNA-based regulation of cellular processes is becoming an increasingly important part of biological or medical research. For the analysis of this type of data, RNA-related prediction tools are integrated into many pipelines and workflows. In order to correctly apply and tune these programs, the user has to have a precise understanding of their limitations and concepts. Within this manuscript, we provide the mathematical foundations and extract the algorithmic ideas that are core to state-of-the-art RNA structure and RNA–RNA interaction prediction algorithms. To allow the reader to change and adapt the algorithms or to play with different inputs, we provide an open-source web interface to JavaScript implementations and visualizations of each algorithm. The conceptual, teaching-focused presentation enables a high-level survey of the approaches, while providing sufficient details for understanding important concepts. This is boosted by the simple generation and study of examples using the web interface available at http://rna.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/Teaching/. In combination, we provide a valuable resource for teaching, learning, and understanding the discussed prediction tools and thus enable a more informed analysis of RNA-related effects.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1_pSZRr6Y0c" width="1" />

Workshops are used to explore a specific topic, to transfer knowledge, to solve identified problems, or to create something new. In funded research projects and other research endeavours, workshops are the mechanism used to gather the wider project, community, or interested people together around a particular topic. However, natural questions arise: how do we measure the impact of these workshops? Do we know whether they are meeting the goals and objectives we set for them? What indicators should we use? In response to these questions, this paper will outline rules that will improve the measurement of the impact of workshops.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gVu--tVzHZU" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>The mammalian visual system has a remarkable capacity to detect differences in contrast across time, which is known as temporal contrast sensitivity (TCS). Details of the underlying neural mechanisms are rapidly emerging as a result of a series of elegant electrophysiological studies performed largely with the mouse as an experimental model. However, rigorous psychophysical methods are necessary to pair the electrophysiology with temporal visual behavior in mouse. The optomotor response is frequently used as a proxy for retinal temporal processing in rodents. However, subcortical reflexive pathways drive the optomotor response rather than cortical decision-making areas. To address this problem, we have developed an operant behavior assay that measures TCS in behaving mice. Mice were trained to perform a forced-choice visual task and were tested daily on their ability to distinguish flickering from nonflickering overhead lights. Correct responses (Hit and Correct Rejections) were rewarded. Contrast, temporal frequency, and mean illumination of the flicker were the independent variables. We validated and applied the theory of signal detection to estimate the discriminability factor (<i>d</i>{acute}), a measure of performance that is independent of response bias and motivation. The empirical contrast threshold was defined as the contrast necessary to elicit <i>d</i>{acute} = 1 and TCS as the inverse of the contrast threshold. With this approach, we established in the mouse a model of human vision that shares fundamental properties of human temporal psychophysics such as Weber adaptation in response to low temporal frequency flicker and illumination-dependent increases in critical flicker frequency as predicted by the Ferry–Porter law.</p>

<p>L-selectin, a lectin-like receptor on all leukocyte classes, functions in adhesive and signaling roles in the recruitment of myeloid cells from the blood to sites of inflammation. Here, we consider L-selectin as a determinant of neurological recovery in a murine model of spinal cord injury (SCI). Spinal cord-injured, L-selectin knock-out (KO) mice (male) showed improved long-term recovery with greater white matter sparing relative to wild-type (WT) mice and reduced oxidative stress in the injured cord at 72 h post-SCI. There was a partial and transient reduction in accumulation of neutrophils in the injured spinal cords of KOs at 24 h post-injury. To complement these findings with KO mice, we sought a pharmacologic means for lowering L-selectin levels. We found that diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), induced the shedding of L-selectin from the cell surface of myeloid subsets, specifically neutrophils and non-classical monocytes, in the blood and the injured spinal cord. Diclofenac administration to injured WT mice enhanced neurological recovery to a level comparable to that of KOs but did not improve recovery in KOs. While diclofenac treatment had no effect on myeloid cell accumulation, there was a reduction in oxidative stress at 72 h post-SCI. These findings implicate L-selectin in secondary pathogenesis beyond a role in leukocyte recruitment and raise the possibility of repurposing diclofenac for the treatment of SCI.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38113">Intrinsically regulated learning is modulated by synaptic dopamine signaling</a></h4>

We recently provided evidence that an intrinsic reward-related signal-triggered by successful learning in absence of <i>any external feedback</i>-modulated the entrance of new information into long-term memory via the activation of the dopaminergic midbrain, hippocampus, and ventral striatum (the SN/VTA-Hippocampal loop; Ripollés et al., 2016). Here, we used a double-blind, within-subject randomized pharmacological intervention to test whether this learning process is indeed dopamine-dependent. A group of healthy individuals completed three behavioural sessions of a language-learning task after the intake of different pharmacological treatments: a dopaminergic precursor, a dopamine receptor antagonist or a placebo. Results show that the pharmacological intervention modulated behavioral measures of both learning and pleasantness, inducing memory benefits after 24 hours only for those participants with a high sensitivity to reward. These results provide causal evidence for a dopamine-dependent mechanism instrumental in intrinsically regulated learning and further suggest that subject-specific reward sensitivity drastically alters learning success.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/36758">Structures reveal opening of the store-operated calcium channel Orai</a></h4>

The store-operated calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) channel Orai governs Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through the plasma membrane of many non-excitable cells in metazoans. The channel opens in response to the depletion of Ca<sup>2+</sup> stored in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Loss- and gain-of-function mutants of Orai cause disease. Our previous work revealed the structure of Orai with a closed pore. Here, using a gain-of-function mutation that constitutively activates the channel, we present an X-ray structure of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> Orai in an open conformation. Well-defined electron density maps reveal that the pore is dramatically dilated on its cytosolic side in comparison to the slender closed pore. Cations and anions bind in different regions of the open pore, informing mechanisms for ion permeation and Ca<sup>2+</sup> selectivity. Opening of the pore requires the release of cytosolic latches. Together with additional X-ray structures of an unlatched-but-closed conformation, we propose a sequence for store-operated activation.

Tanaka et al. show that patterns of layer-specific thalamocortical axon activity involving signals from the basal ganglia and cerebellum evolve during learning of a self-initiated motor task. The progression of this activity is impaired by lesions to either region.

Busquets-Garcia et al. suggest that cannabinoid CB1 receptors signaling in the hippocampus, a brain structure involved in memory processes, underlines the mammalian ability to associate randomly encountered stimuli, allowing future inferred memories and possibly explaining seemingly ungrounded responses toward certain cues.

Heisler et al. demonstrate that prion protein intracellular transport is important for the progression of prion disease. They identify a regulatory mechanism of bidirectional prion protein vesicle trafficking and propose a novel transport pathway that connects intracellular lysosomal degradation with extracellular exosome trafficking under neurodegenerative conditions.

The precise anatomical location of gene expression is an essential component of the study of gene function. For most model organisms this task is usually undertaken via visual inspection of gene expression images by interested researchers. Computational analysis of gene expression has been developed in several model organisms, notably in <i>Drosophila</i> which exhibits a uniform shape and outline in the early stages of development. Here we address the challenge of computational analysis of gene expression in <i>Xenopus</i>, where the range of developmental stages of interest encompasses a wide range of embryo size and shape. Embryos may have different orientation across images, and, in addition, embryos have a pigmented epidermis that can mask or confuse underlying gene expression. Here we report the development of a set of computational tools capable of processing large image sets with variable characteristics. These tools efficiently separate the <i>Xenopus</i> embryo from the background, separately identify both histochemically stained and naturally pigmented regions within the embryo, and can sort images from the same gene and developmental stage according to similarity of gene expression patterns without information about relative orientation. We tested these methods on a large, but highly redundant, collection of 33,289 <i>in situ</i> hybridization images, allowing us to select representative images of expression patterns at different embryo orientations. This has allowed us to put a much smaller subset of these images into the public domain in an effective manner. The ‘isimage’ module and the scripts developed are implemented in Python and freely available on https://pypi.python.org/pypi/isimage/.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/BCC2oED3Kxg" width="1" />

<p>Newborn granule cells are continuously produced in the subgranular zone of dentate gyrus throughout life. Once these cells mature, they integrate into pre-existing circuits modulating hippocampus-dependent memory. Subsequently, mechanisms controlling generation and maturation of newborn cells are essential for proper hippocampal function. Therefore, we have studied the role of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a ligand-activated bHLH-PAS transcription factor, in hippocampus-dependent memory and granule neuronal morphology and function using genetic loss-of-function approaches based on constitutive and inducible-nestin AhR<sup>–/–</sup> mice. The results presented here show that the impaired hippocampus-dependent memory in AhR absence is not due to its effects on neurogenesis but to aberrant dendritic arborization and an increased spine density, albeit with a lower number of mature mushrooms spines in newborn granule cells, a finding that is associated with an immature electrophysiological phenotype. Together, our data strongly suggest that AhR plays a pivotal role in the regulation of hippocampal function, by controlling hippocampal granule neuron morphology and synaptic maturation.</p>

<p>Action potentials propagating along axons are often followed by prolonged afterdepolarization (ADP) lasting for several tens of milliseconds. Axonal ADP is thought to be an important factor in modulating the fidelity of spike propagation during repetitive firings. However, the mechanism as well as the functional significance of axonal ADP remain unclear, partly due to inaccessibility to small structures of axon for direct electrophysiological recordings. Here, we examined the ionic and electrical mechanisms underlying axonal ADP using whole-bouton recording from mossy fiber terminals in mice hippocampal slices. ADP following axonal action potentials was strongly enhanced by focal application of veratridine, an inhibitor of Na<sup>+</sup> channel inactivation. In contrast, tetrodotoxin (TTX) partly suppressed ADP, suggesting that a Na<sup>+</sup> channel–dependent component is involved in axonal ADP. The remaining TTX-resistant Na<sup>+</sup> channel–independent component represents slow capacitive discharge reflecting the shape and electrical properties of the axonal membrane. We also addressed the functional impact of axonal ADP on presynaptic function. In paired-pulse stimuli, we found that axonal ADP minimally affected the peak height of subsequent action potentials, although the rising phase of action potentials was slightly slowed, possibly due to steady-state inactivation of Na<sup>+</sup> channels by prolonged depolarization. Voltage clamp analysis of Ca<sup>2+</sup> current elicited by action potential waveform commands revealed that axonal ADP assists short-term facilitation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into the presynaptic terminals. Taken together, these data show that axonal ADP maintains reliable firing during repetitive stimuli and plays important roles in the fine-tuning of short-term plasticity of transmitter release by modulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into presynaptic terminals.</p>

<p>The arginine-rich dipeptide repeats (DPRs) are highly toxic products from the C9orf72 repeat expansion mutations, which are the most common causes of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). However, the effects of DPRs in the synaptic regulation and excitotoxicity remain elusive, and how they contribute to the development of FTD is primarily unknown. By expressing DPRs with different toxicity strength in various neuronal populations in a <i>Drosophila</i> model, we unexpectedly found that Glycine-Arginine/Proline-Arginine (GR/PR) with 36 repeats could lead to neurodegenerative phenotypes only when they were expressed in glutamatergic neurons, including motor neurons. We detected increased extracellular glutamate and intracellular calcium levels in GR/PR-expressing larval ventral nerve cord and/or adult brain, accompanied by significant increase of synaptic boutons and active zones in larval neuromuscular junctions. Inhibiting the vesicular glutamate transporter expression or blocking the NMDA receptor in presynaptic glutamatergic motor neurons could effectively rescue the motor deficits and shortened life span caused by poly GR/PR, thus indicating a cell-autonomous excitotoxicity mechanism. Therefore, our results have revealed a novel mode of synaptic regulation by arginine-rich C9 DPRs expressed at more physiologically relevant toxicity levels and provided a mechanism that could contribute to the development of C9-related ALS and FTD.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> C9orf72 dipeptide repeats (DPRs) are key toxic species causing ALS/FTD, but their roles in synaptic regulation and excitotoxicity are unclear. Using C9orf72 DPRs with various toxicity strength, we have found that the arginine-rich DPRs cause selective degeneration in <i>Drosophila</i> glutamatergic neurons and revealed an NMDA receptor-dependent cell-autonomous excitotoxicity mechanism. Therefore, this study has advanced our understanding of C9orf72 DPR functions in synaptic regulation and excitotoxicity and provided a new mechanism that could contribute to the development of C9-related ALS and FTD.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/35/7725?rss=1">Brainstem Steering of Locomotor Activity in the Newborn Rat</a></h4>

<p>Control of locomotion relies on motor loops conveying modulatory signals between brainstem and spinal motor circuits. We investigated the steering control of the brainstem reticular formation over the spinal locomotor networks using isolated brainstem–spinal cord preparations of male and female neonatal rats. First, we performed patch-clamp recordings of identified reticulospinal cells during episodes of fictive locomotion. This revealed that a spinal ascending phasic modulation of reticulospinal cell activity is already present at birth. Half of the cells exhibited tonic firing during locomotion, while the other half emitted phasic discharges of action potentials phase locked to ongoing activity. We next showed that mimicking the phasic activity of reticulospinal neurons by applying patterned electrical stimulation bilaterally at the ventral caudal medulla level triggered fictive locomotion efficiently. Moreover, the brainstem stimuli-induced locomotor rhythm was entrained in a one-to-one coupling over a range of cycle periods (2–6 s). Additionally, we induced turning like motor outputs by either increasing or decreasing the relative duration of the stimulation trains on one side of the brainstem compared to the other. The ability of the patterned descending command to control the locomotor output depended on the functional integrity of ventral reticulospinal pathways and the involvement of local spinal central pattern generator circuitry. Altogether, this study provides a mechanism by which brainstem reticulospinal neurons relay steering and speed commands to the spinal locomotor networks.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Locomotor function allows the survival of most animal species while sustaining the expression of fundamental behaviors. Locomotor activities adapt from moment to moment to behavioral and environmental changes. We show that the brainstem can control the spinal locomotor network outputs through phasic descending commands that alternate bilaterally. Manipulating the periodicity and/or the relative durations of the left and right descending commands at the brainstem level is efficient to set the locomotor speed and sustain directional changes.</p>

<p>CSF-contacting (CSF-c) cells are present in the walls of the brain ventricles and the central canal of the spinal cord and found throughout the vertebrate phylum. We recently identified ciliated somatostatin-/GABA-expressing CSF-c neurons in the lamprey spinal cord that act as pH sensors as well as mechanoreceptors. In the same neuron, acidic and alkaline responses are mediated through ASIC3-like and PKD2L1 channels, respectively. Here, we investigate the functional properties of the ciliated somatostatin-/GABA-positive CSF-c neurons in the hypothalamus by performing whole-cell recordings in hypothalamic slices. Depolarizing current pulses readily evoked action potentials, but hypothalamic CSF-c neurons had no or a very low level of spontaneous activity at pH 7.4. They responded, however, with membrane potential depolarization and trains of action potentials to small deviations in pH in both the acidic and alkaline direction. Like in spinal CSF-c neurons, the acidic response in hypothalamic cells is mediated via ASIC3-like channels. In contrast, the alkaline response appears to depend on connexin hemichannels, not on PKD2L1 channels. We also show that hypothalamic CSF-c neurons respond to mechanical stimulation induced by fluid movements along the wall of the third ventricle, a response mediated via ASIC3-like channels. The hypothalamic CSF-c neurons extend their processes dorsally, ventrally, and laterally, but as yet, the effects exerted on hypothalamic circuits are unknown. With similar neurons being present in rodents, the pH- and mechanosensing ability of hypothalamic CSF-c neurons is most likely conserved throughout vertebrate phylogeny.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> CSF-contacting neurons are present in all vertebrates and are located mainly in the hypothalamic area and the spinal cord. Here, we report that the somatostatin-/GABA-expressing CSF-c neurons in the lamprey hypothalamus sense bidirectional deviations in the extracellular pH and do so via different molecular mechanisms. They also serve as mechanoreceptors. The hypothalamic CSF-c neurons have extensive axonal ramifications and may decrease the level of motor activity via release of somatostatin. In conclusion, hypothalamic somatostatin-/GABA-expressing CSF-c neurons, as well as their spinal counterpart, represent a novel homeostatic mechanism designed to sense any deviation from physiological pH and thus constitute a feedback regulatory system intrinsic to the CNS, possibly serving a protective role from damage caused by changes in pH.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/35/7701?rss=1">The Drosophila Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Alk Constrains Long-Term Memory Formation</a></h4>

<p>In addition to mechanisms promoting protein-synthesis-dependent long-term memory (PSD-LTM), the process appears to also be specifically constrained. We present evidence that the highly conserved receptor tyrosine kinase dAlk is a novel PSD-LTM attenuator in <i>Drosophila</i>. Reduction of dAlk levels in adult α/β mushroom body (MB) neurons during conditioning elevates LTM, whereas its overexpression impairs it. Unlike other memory suppressor proteins and miRNAs, dAlk within the MBs constrains PSD-LTM specifically but constrains learning outside the MBs as previously shown. Dendritic dAlk levels rise rapidly in MB neurons upon conditioning, a process apparently controlled by the 3'UTR of its mRNA, and interruption of the 3'UTR leads to enhanced LTM. Because its activating ligand Jeb is dispensable for LTM attenuation, we propose that postconditioning elevation of dAlk within α/β dendrites results in its autoactivation and constrains formation of the energy costly PSD-LTM, acting as a novel memory filter.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In addition to the widely studied molecular mechanisms promoting protein-synthesis-dependent long-term memory (PSD-LTM), recent discoveries indicate that the process is also specifically constrained. We describe a role in PSD-LTM constraint for the first receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) involved in olfactory memory in <i>Drosophila</i>. Unlike other memory suppressor proteins and miRNAs, dAlk limits specifically PSD-LTM formation as it does not affect 3 h, or anesthesia-resistant memory. Significantly, we show conditioning-dependent dAlk elevation within the mushroom body dendrites and propose that its local abundance may activate its kinase activity, to mediate imposition of PSD-LTM constraints through yet unknown mechanisms.</p>

<p>Aging contributes to cellular stress and neurodegeneration. Our understanding is limited regarding the tissue-restricted mechanisms providing protection in postmitotic cells throughout life. Here, we show that spinal cord motoneurons exhibit a high abundance of asymmetric dimethyl arginines (ADMAs) and the presence of this posttranslational modification provides protection against environmental stress. We identify protein arginine methyltransferase 8 (PRMT8) as a tissue-restricted enzyme responsible for proper ADMA level in postmitotic neurons. Male PRMT8 knock-out mice display decreased muscle strength with aging due to premature destabilization of neuromuscular junctions. Mechanistically, inhibition of methyltransferase activity or loss of PRMT8 results in accumulation of unrepaired DNA double-stranded breaks and decrease in the cAMP response-element-binding protein 1 (CREB1) level. As a consequence, the expression of CREB1-mediated prosurvival and regeneration-associated immediate early genes is dysregulated in aging PRMT8 knock-out mice. The uncovered role of PRMT8 represents a novel mechanism of stress tolerance in long-lived postmitotic neurons and identifies PRMT8 as a tissue-specific therapeutic target in the prevention of motoneuron degeneration.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Although most of the cells in our body have a very short lifespan, postmitotic neurons must survive for many decades. Longevity of a cell within the organism depends on its ability to properly regulate signaling pathways that counteract perturbations, such as DNA damage, oxidative stress, or protein misfolding. Here, we provide evidence that tissue-specific regulators of stress tolerance exist in postmitotic neurons. Specifically, we identify protein arginine methyltransferase 8 (PRMT8) as a cell-type-restricted arginine methyltransferase in spinal cord motoneurons (MNs). PRMT8-dependent arginine methylation is required for neuroprotection against age-related increased of cellular stress. Tissue-restricted expression and the enzymatic activity of PRMT8 make it an attractive target for drug development to delay the onset of neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

<p>Spontaneous network activity (SNA) emerges in the spinal cord (SC) before the formation of peripheral sensory inputs and central descending inputs. SNA is characterized by recurrent giant depolarizing potentials (GDPs). Because GDPs in motoneurons (MNs) are mainly evoked by prolonged release of GABA, they likely necessitate sustained firing of interneurons. To address this issue we analyzed, as a model, embryonic Renshaw cell (V1<sup>R</sup>) activity at the onset of SNA (E12.5) in the embryonic mouse SC (both sexes). V1<sup>R</sup> are one of the interneurons known to contact MNs, which are generated early in the embryonic SC. Here, we show that V1<sup>R</sup> already produce GABA in E12.5 embryo, and that V1<sup>R</sup> make synaptic-like contacts with MNs and have putative extrasynaptic release sites, while paracrine release of GABA occurs at this developmental stage. In addition, we discovered that V1<sup>R</sup> are spontaneously active during SNA and can already generate several intrinsic activity patterns including repetitive-spiking and sodium-dependent plateau potential that rely on the presence of persistent sodium currents (<i>I</i><sub>Nap</sub>). This is the first demonstration that <i>I</i><sub>Nap</sub> is present in the embryonic SC and that this current can control intrinsic activation properties of newborn interneurons in the SC of mammalian embryos. Finally, we found that 5 μm riluzole, which is known to block <i>I</i><sub>NaP</sub>, altered SNA by reducing episode duration and increasing inter-episode interval. Because SNA is essential for neuronal maturation, axon pathfinding, and synaptogenesis, the presence of <i>I</i><sub>NaP</sub> in embryonic SC neurons may play a role in the early development of mammalian locomotor networks.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The developing spinal cord (SC) exhibits spontaneous network activity (SNA) involved in the building of nascent locomotor circuits in the embryo. Many studies suggest that SNA depends on the rhythmic release of GABA, yet intracellular recordings of GABAergic neurons have never been performed at the onset of SNA in the SC. We first discovered that embryonic Renshaw cells (V1<sup>R</sup>) are GABAergic at E12.5 and spontaneously active during SNA. We uncover a new role for persistent sodium currents (<i>I</i><sub>NaP</sub>) in driving plateau potential in V1<sup>R</sup> and in SNA patterning in the embryonic SC. Our study thus sheds light on a role for <i>I</i>NaP in the excitability of V1<sup>R</sup> and the developing SC.</p>

<p>Over the past few decades, neuroscience research has illuminated the neural mechanisms supporting learning from reward feedback. Learning paradigms are increasingly being extended to study mood and psychiatric disorders as well as addiction. However, one potentially critical characteristic that this research ignores is the effect of time on learning: human feedback learning paradigms are usually conducted in a single rapidly paced session, whereas learning experiences in ecologically relevant circumstances and in animal research are almost always separated by longer periods of time. In our experiments, we examined reward learning in short condensed sessions distributed across weeks versus learning completed in a single "massed" session in male and female participants. As expected, we found that after equal amounts of training, accuracy was matched between the spaced and massed conditions. However, in a 3-week follow-up, we found that participants exhibited significantly greater memory for the value of spaced-trained stimuli. Supporting a role for short-term memory in massed learning, we found a significant positive correlation between initial learning and working memory capacity. Neurally, we found that patterns of activity in the medial temporal lobe and prefrontal cortex showed stronger discrimination of spaced- versus massed-trained reward values. Further, patterns in the striatum discriminated between spaced- and massed-trained stimuli overall. Our results indicate that single-session learning tasks engage partially distinct learning mechanisms from distributed training. Our studies begin to address a large gap in our knowledge of human learning from reinforcement, with potential implications for our understanding of mood disorders and addiction.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Humans and animals learn to associate predictive value with stimuli and actions, and these values then guide future behavior. Such reinforcement-based learning often happens over long time periods, in contrast to most studies of reward-based learning in humans. In experiments that tested the effect of spacing on learning, we found that associations learned in a single massed session were correlated with short-term memory and significantly decayed over time, whereas associations learned in short massed sessions over weeks were well maintained. Additionally, patterns of activity in the medial temporal lobe and prefrontal cortex discriminated the values of stimuli learned over weeks but not minutes. These results highlight the importance of studying learning over time, with potential applications to drug addiction and psychiatry.</p>

<p>Memory retrieval induces a transient period of increased transcriptional and translational regulation in neurons called reconsolidation, which is regulated by the protein kinase B (AKT)–mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. However, it is currently unknown how activation of the AKT–mTOR pathway is regulated during the reconsolidation process. Here, we found that in male rats retrieval of a contextual fear memory transiently increased Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2) levels along with increased histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) levels, which correlated with decreased levels of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), a potent inhibitor of AKT–mTOR-dependent signaling in the hippocampus. Further experiments found increased H3K27me3 levels and DNA methylation across the <i>Pten</i> promoter and coding regions, indicating transcriptional silencing of the <i>Pten</i> gene. <i>Pten</i> H3K27me3 levels did not change following training or after the retrieval of a remote (old) fear memory, suggesting that this mechanism of <i>Pten</i> repression was specific to the reconsolidation of a new memory. <i>In vivo</i> siRNA-mediated knockdown of <i>Ezh2</i> in the hippocampus abolished retrieval-induced increases in H3K27me3 and prevented decreases in PTEN levels. <i>Ezh2</i> knockdown attenuated increases in the phosphorylation of AKT and mTOR following retrieval, which could be restored by simultaneously reducing <i>Pten</i>, suggesting that H3K27me3 regulates AKT–mTOR phosphorylation via repression of <i>Pten</i>. Consistent with these results, knockdown of <i>Ezh2</i> in area CA1 before retrieval impaired memory on later tests. Collectively, these results suggest that EZH2-mediated H3K27me3 plays a critical role in the repression of <i>Pten</i> transcription necessary for AKT–mTOR activation and memory reconsolidation following retrieval.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Understanding how critical translation pathways, like mTOR-mediated protein synthesis, are regulated during the memory storage process is necessary for improving memory impairments. This study tests whether mTOR activation is coupled to epigenetic mechanisms in the hippocampus following the retrieval of a contextual fear memory. Specifically, this study evaluates the role of epigenetic modifications in the form of histone methylation in downstream mTOR translational control during learning-dependent synaptic plasticity in neurons. Considering the broad implications of transcriptional and translational mechanisms in synaptic plasticity, psychiatric, and neurological and neurodegenerative disorders, these data are of interest to the neuroscience community due to the robust and specific regulation of mTOR signaling we found to be dependent on repressive histone methylation.</p>

<p>In the hemaphroditic sea snail, <i>Aplysia californica</i>, reproduction is initiated when the bag cell neurons secrete egg-laying hormone during a protracted afterdischarge. A source of depolarization for the afterdischarge is a voltage-gated, nonselective cation channel, similar to transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. Once the afterdischarge is triggered, phospholipase C (PLC) is activated to hydrolyze phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) into diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>). We previously reported that a DAG analog, 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-<i>sn</i>-glycerol (OAG), activates a prominent, inward whole-cell cationic current that is enhanced by IP<sub>3</sub>. To examine the underlying mechanism, we investigated the effect of exogenous OAG and IP<sub>3</sub>, as well as PLC activation, on cation channel activity and voltage dependence in excised, inside-out patches from cultured bag cell neurons. OAG transiently elevated channel open probability (P<sub>O</sub>) when applied to excised patches; however, coapplication of IP<sub>3</sub> prolonged the OAG-induced response. In patches exposed to OAG and IP<sub>3</sub>, channel voltage dependence was left-shifted; this was also observed with OAG, but not to the same extent. Introducing the PLC activator, m-3M3FBS, to patches increased channel P<sub>O</sub>, suggesting PLC may be physically linked to the channels. Accordingly, blocking PLC with U-73122 ablated the m-3M3FBS-induced elevation in P<sub>O</sub>. Treatment with m-3M3FBS left-shifted cation channel voltage dependence to a greater extent than exogenous OAG and IP<sub>3</sub>. Finally, OAG and IP<sub>3</sub> potentiated the stimulatory effect of PKC, which is also associated with the channel. Thus, the PLC-PKC signaling system is physically localized such that PIP<sub>2</sub> breakdown products liberated during the afterdischarge modulate the cation channel and temporally influence neuronal activity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Using excised patches from <i>Aplysia</i> bag cell neurons, we present the first evidence of a nonselective cation channel physically associating with phospholipase C (PLC) at the single-channel level. PLC-mediated breakdown of phospholipids generates diacylglycerol and inositol trisphosphate, which activate the cation channel. This is mimicked by exogenous lipids; furthermore, these second messengers left-shift channel voltage dependence and enhance the response of the channel to protein kinase C. PLC-mediated lipid signaling controls single-channel currents to ensure depolarization is maintained for an extended period of firing, termed the afterdischarge, when the bag cell neurons secrete egg-laying hormone to trigger reproduction.</p>

<p>Children with an extremely inhibited, anxious temperament (AT) are at increased risk for anxiety disorders and depression. Using a rhesus monkey model of early-life AT, we previously demonstrated that metabolism in the central extended amygdala (EAc), including the central nucleus of the amygdala (Ce) and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST), is associated with trait-like variation in AT. Here, we use fMRI to examine relationships between Ce–BST functional connectivity and AT in a large multigenerational family pedigree of rhesus monkeys (<i>n</i> = 170 females and 208 males). Results demonstrate that Ce–BST functional connectivity is heritable, accounts for a significant but modest portion of the variance in AT, and is coheritable with AT. Interestingly, Ce–BST functional connectivity and AT-related BST metabolism were not correlated and accounted for non-overlapping variance in AT. Exploratory analyses suggest that Ce–BST functional connectivity is associated with metabolism in the hypothalamus and periaqueductal gray. Together, these results suggest the importance of coordinated function within the EAc for determining individual differences in AT and metabolism in brain regions associated with its behavioral and neuroendocrine components.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Anxiety disorders directly impact the lives of nearly one in five people, accounting for substantial worldwide suffering and disability. Here, we use a nonhuman primate model of anxious temperament (AT) to understand the neurobiology underlying the early-life risk to develop anxiety disorders. Leveraging the same kinds of neuroimaging measures routinely used in human studies, we demonstrate that coordinated activation between the central nucleus of the amygdala and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis is correlated with, and coinherited with, early-life AT. Understanding how these central extended amygdala regions work together to produce extreme anxiety provides a neural target for early-life interventions with the promise of preventing lifelong disability in at-risk children.</p>

<p>Learning the statistical structure of the environment is crucial for adaptive behavior. Humans and nonhuman decision-makers seem to track such structure through a process of probabilistic inference, which enables predictions about behaviorally relevant events. Deviations from such predictions cause surprise, which in turn helps improve inference. Surprise about the timing of behaviorally relevant sensory events drives phasic responses of neuromodulatory brainstem systems, which project to the cerebral cortex. Here, we developed a computational model-based magnetoencephalography (MEG) approach for mapping the resulting cortical transients across space, time, and frequency, in the human brain (<i>N</i> = 28, 17 female). We used a Bayesian ideal observer model to learn the statistics of the timing of changes in a simple visual detection task. This model yielded quantitative trial-by-trial estimates of temporal surprise. The model-based surprise variable predicted trial-by-trial variations in reaction time more strongly than the externally observable interval timings alone. Trial-by-trial variations in surprise were negatively correlated with the power of cortical population activity measured with MEG. This surprise-related power suppression occurred transiently around the behavioral response, specifically in the beta frequency band. It peaked in parietal and prefrontal cortices, remote from the motor cortical suppression of beta power related to overt report (button press) of change detection. Our results indicate that surprise about sensory event timing transiently suppresses ongoing beta-band oscillations in association cortex. This transient suppression of frontal beta-band oscillations might reflect an active reset triggered by surprise, and is in line with the idea that beta-oscillations help maintain cognitive sets.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The brain continuously tracks the statistical structure of the environment to anticipate behaviorally relevant events. Deviations from such predictions cause surprise, which in turn drives neural activity in subcortical brain regions that project to the cerebral cortex. We used magnetoencephalography in humans to map out surprise-related modulations of cortical population activity across space, time, and frequency. Surprise was elicited by variable timing of visual stimulus changes requiring a behavioral response. Surprise was quantified by means of an ideal observer model. Surprise predicted behavior as well as a transient suppression of beta frequency-band oscillations in frontal cortical regions. Our results are in line with conceptual accounts that have linked neural oscillations in the beta-band to the maintenance of cognitive sets.</p>

<p>Speech is an inherently noisy and ambiguous signal. To fluently derive meaning, a listener must integrate contextual information to guide interpretations of the sensory input. Although many studies have demonstrated the influence of prior context on speech perception, the neural mechanisms supporting the integration of subsequent context remain unknown. Using MEG to record from human auditory cortex, we analyzed responses to spoken words with a varyingly ambiguous onset phoneme, the identity of which is later disambiguated at the lexical uniqueness point. Fifty participants (both male and female) were recruited across two MEG experiments. Our findings suggest that primary auditory cortex is sensitive to phonological ambiguity very early during processing at just 50 ms after onset. Subphonemic detail is preserved in auditory cortex over long timescales and re-evoked at subsequent phoneme positions. Commitments to phonological categories occur in parallel, resolving on the shorter timescale of ~450 ms. These findings provide evidence that future input determines the perception of earlier speech sounds by maintaining sensory features until they can be integrated with top-down lexical information.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The perception of a speech sound is determined by its surrounding context in the form of words, sentences, and other speech sounds. Often, such contextual information becomes available later than the sensory input. The present study is the first to unveil how the brain uses this subsequent information to aid speech comprehension. Concretely, we found that the auditory system actively maintains the acoustic signal in auditory cortex while concurrently making guesses about the identity of the words being said. Such a processing strategy allows the content of the message to be accessed quickly while also permitting reanalysis of the acoustic signal to minimize parsing mistakes.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/35/7562?rss=1">Identification of VAPA and VAPB as Kv2 Channel-Interacting Proteins Defining Endoplasmic Reticulum-Plasma Membrane Junctions in Mammalian Brain Neurons</a></h4>

<p>Membrane contacts between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plasma membrane (PM), or ER-PM junctions, are ubiquitous in eukaryotic cells and are platforms for lipid and calcium signaling and homeostasis. Recent studies have revealed proteins crucial to the formation and function of ER-PM junctions in non-neuronal cells, but little is known of the ER-PM junctions prominent in aspiny regions of mammalian brain neurons. The Kv2.1 voltage-gated potassium channel is abundantly clustered at ER-PM junctions in brain neurons and is the first PM protein that functions to organize ER-PM junctions. However, the molecular mechanism whereby Kv2.1 localizes to and remodels these junctions is unknown. We used affinity immunopurification and mass spectrometry-based proteomics on brain samples from male and female WT and Kv2.1 KO mice and identified the resident ER vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated proteins isoforms A and B (VAPA and VAPB) as prominent Kv2.1-associated proteins. Coexpression with Kv2.1 or its paralog Kv2.2 was sufficient to recruit VAPs to ER-PM junctions. Multiplex immunolabeling revealed colocalization of Kv2.1 and Kv2.2 with endogenous VAPs at ER-PM junctions in brain neurons from male and female mice <i>in situ</i> and in cultured rat hippocampal neurons, and KO of VAPA in mammalian cells reduces Kv2.1 clustering. The association of VAPA with Kv2.1 relies on a "two phenylalanines in an acidic tract" (FFAT) binding domain on VAPA and a noncanonical phosphorylation-dependent FFAT motif comprising the Kv2-specific clustering or PRC motif. These results suggest that Kv2.1 localizes to and organizes neuronal ER-PM junctions through an interaction with VAPs.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our study identified the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated proteins isoforms A and B (VAPA and VAPB) as proteins copurifying with the plasma membrane (PM) Kv2.1 ion channel. We found that expression of Kv2.1 recruits VAPs to ER-PM junctions, specialized membrane contact sites crucial to distinct aspects of cell function. We found endogenous VAPs at Kv2.1-mediated ER-PM junctions in brain neurons and other mammalian cells and that knocking out VAPA expression disrupts Kv2.1 clustering. We identified domains of VAPs and Kv2.1 necessary and sufficient for their association at ER-PM junctions. Our study suggests that Kv2.1 expression in the PM can affect ER-PM junctions via its phosphorylation-dependent association to ER-localized VAPA and VAPB.</p>

<p>The vast majority of experiments examining perception and behavior are conducted using experimental paradigms that adhere to a rigid trial structure: each trial consists of a brief and discrete series of events and is regarded as independent from all other trials. The assumptions underlying this structure ignore the reality that natural behavior is rarely discrete, brain activity follows multiple time courses that do not necessarily conform to the trial structure, and the natural environment has statistical structure and dynamics that exhibit long-range temporal correlation. Modern advances in statistical modeling and analysis offer tools that make it feasible for experiments to move beyond rigid independent and identically distributed trial structures. Here we review literature that serves as evidence for the feasibility and advantages of moving beyond trial-based paradigms to understand the neural basis of perception and cognition. Furthermore, we propose a synthesis of these efforts, integrating the characterization of natural stimulus properties with measurements of continuous neural activity and behavioral outputs within the framework of sensory-cognitive-motor loops. Such a framework provides a basis for the study of natural statistics, naturalistic tasks, and/or slow fluctuations in brain activity, which should provide starting points for important generalizations of analytical tools in neuroscience and subsequent progress in understanding the neural basis of perception and cognition.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/39468">Efficient single-copy HDR by 5' modified long dsDNA donors</a></h4>

CRISPR/Cas9 efficiently induces targeted mutations via non-homologous-end-joining but for genome editing, precise, homology-directed repair (HDR) of endogenous DNA stretches is a prerequisite. To favor HDR, many approaches interfere with the repair machinery or manipulate Cas9 itself. Using Medaka we show that the modification of 5' ends of long dsDNA donors strongly enhances HDR, favors efficient single-copy integration by retaining a monomeric donor conformation thus facilitating successful gene replacement or tagging.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/35453">Long read sequencing reveals poxvirus evolution through rapid homogenization of gene arrays</a></h4>

Poxvirus adaptation can involve combinations of recombination-driven gene copy number variation and beneficial single nucleotide variants (SNVs) at the same loci. How these distinct mechanisms of genetic diversification might simultaneously facilitate adaptation to host immune defenses is unknown. We performed experimental evolution with vaccinia virus populations harboring a SNV in a gene actively undergoing copy number amplification. Using long sequencing reads from the Oxford Nanopore Technologies platform, we phased SNVs within large gene copy arrays for the first time. Our analysis uncovered a mechanism of adaptive SNV homogenization reminiscent of gene conversion, which is actively driven by selection. This study reveals a new mechanism for the fluid gain of beneficial mutations in genetic regions undergoing active recombination in viruses and illustrates the value of long read sequencing technologies for investigating complex genome dynamics in diverse biological systems.

<p>by Stefano Zappacosta, Francesco Mannella, Marco Mirolli, Gianluca Baldassarre</p>

Learning in biologically relevant neural-network models usually relies on Hebb learning rules. The typical implementations of these rules change the synaptic strength on the basis of the co-occurrence of the neural events taking place at a certain time in the pre- and post-synaptic neurons. Differential Hebbian learning (DHL) rules, instead, are able to update the synapse by taking into account the temporal relation, captured with derivatives, between the neural events happening in the recent past. The few DHL rules proposed so far can update the synaptic weights only in few ways: this is a limitation for the study of dynamical neurons and neural-network models. Moreover, empirical evidence on brain spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) shows that different neurons express a surprisingly rich repertoire of different learning processes going far beyond existing DHL rules. This opens up a second problem of how capturing such processes with DHL rules. Here we propose a general DHL (G-DHL) rule generating the existing rules and many others. The rule has a high expressiveness as it combines in different ways the pre- and post- synaptic neuron signals and derivatives. The rule flexibility is shown by applying it to various signals of artificial neurons and by fitting several different STDP experimental data sets. To these purposes, we propose techniques to pre-process the neural signals and capture the temporal relations between the neural events of interest. We also propose a procedure to automatically identify the rule components and parameters that best fit different STDP data sets, and show how the identified components might be used to heuristically guide the search of the biophysical mechanisms underlying STDP. Overall, the results show that the G-DHL rule represents a useful means to study time-sensitive learning processes in both artificial neural networks and brain.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/avC1MDNSqOE" width="1" />

<p>Information in the central nervous system (CNS) is conducted via electrical
signals known as action potentials and is encoded in time. Several neurological
disorders including depression, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
(ADHD), originate in faulty brain signaling frequencies. Here, we present a
Hodgkin-Huxley model analog for a strongly correlated VO2 artificial neuron
system that undergoes an electrically-driven insulator-metal transition. We
demonstrate that tuning of the insulating phase resistance in VO2 threshold
switch circuits can enable direct mimicry of neuronal origins of disorders in
the central nervous system. The results introduce use of circuits based on
quantum materials as complementary to model animal studies for neuroscience,
especially when precise measurements of local electrical properties or
competing parallel paths for conduction in complex neural circuits can be a
challenge to identify onset of breakdown or diagnose early symptoms of disease.

<p>We compare the robustness of humans and current convolutional deep neural
networks (DNNs) on object recognition under twelve different types of image
degradations. First, using three well known DNNs (ResNet-152, VGG-19,
GoogLeNet) we find the human visual system to be more robust to nearly all of
the tested image manipulations, and we observe progressively diverging
classification error-patterns between humans and DNNs when the signal gets
weaker. Secondly, we show that DNNs trained directly on distorted images
consistently surpass human performance on the exact distortion types they were
trained on, yet they display extremely poor generalisation abilities when
tested on other distortion types. For example, training on salt-and-pepper
noise does not imply robustness on uniform white noise and vice versa. Thus,
changes in the noise distribution between training and testing constitutes a
crucial challenge to deep learning vision systems that can be systematically
addressed in a lifelong machine learning approach. Our new dataset consisting
of 83K carefully measured human psychophysical trials provide a useful
reference for lifelong robustness against image degradations set by the human
visual system.

<p>Autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity is altered in autism spectrum
disorder (ASD). Heart rate variability (HRV) derived from electrocardiogram
(ECG) has been a powerful tool to identify alterations in ANS due to a plethora
of pathophysiological conditions, including psychological ones such as
depression. ECG-derived HRV thus carries a yet to be explored potential to be
used as a diagnostic and follow-up biomarker of ASD. However, few studies have
explored this potential. In a cohort of boys (ages 8 - 11 years) with (n=18)
and without ASD (n=18), we tested a set of linear and nonlinear HRV measures,
including phase rectified signal averaging (PRSA), applied to a segment of ECG
collected under resting conditions for their predictive properties of ASD. We
identified HRV measures derived from time, frequency and geometric
signal-analytical domains which are changed in ASD children relative to peers
without ASD and correlate to psychometric scores (p&lt;0.05 for each). Receiver
operating curves area ranged between 0.71 - 0.74 for each HRV measure. Despite
being a small cohort lacking external validation, these promising preliminary
results warrant larger prospective validation studies.

<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder.
Finding the biomarkers associated with ASD is extremely helpful to understand
the underlying roots of the disorder and can lead to earlier diagnosis and more
targeted treatment. Although Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been applied in
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify ASD, understanding the
data-driven computational decision making procedure has not been previously
explored. Therefore, in this work, we address the problem of interpreting
reliable biomarkers associated with identifying ASD; specifically, we propose a
2-stage method that classifies ASD and control subjects using fMRI images and
interprets the saliency features activated by the classifier. First, we trained
an accurate DNN classifier. Then, for detecting the biomarkers, different from
the DNN visualization works in computer vision, we take advantage of the
anatomical structure of brain fMRI and develop a frequency-normalized sampling
method to corrupt images. Furthermore, in the ASD vs. control subjects
classification scenario, we provide a new approach to detect and characterize
important brain features into three categories. The biomarkers we found by the
proposed method are robust and consistent with previous findings in the
literature. We also validate the detected biomarkers by neurological function
decoding and comparing with the DNN activation maps.

<p>We introduce a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) approach to account for
temporal dynamics and dependencies in brain networks observed via functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Our approach directly parameterizes temporal
dynamics through recurrent connections, which can be used to formulate blind
source separation with a conditional (rather than marginal) independence
assumption, which we call RNN-ICA. This formulation enables us to visualize the
temporal dynamics of both first order (activity) and second order (directed
connectivity) information in brain networks that are widely studied in a static
sense, but not well-characterized dynamically. RNN-ICA predicts dynamics
directly from the recurrent states of the RNN in both task and resting state
fMRI. Our results show both task-related and group-differentiating directed
connectivity.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The human high-level visual cortex comprises regions specialized for the processing of distinct types of stimuli, such as objects, animals, and human actions. How does this specialization emerge? Here, we investigated the role of effector-specific visuomotor coupling experience in shaping the organization of the action observation network (AON) as a window on this question. Observed body movements are frequently coupled with corresponding motor codes, e.g., during monitoring one’s own movements and imitation, resulting in bidirectionally connected circuits between areas involved in body movements observation (e.g., of the hand) and the motor codes involved in their execution. If the organization of the AON is shaped by this effector-specific visuomotor coupling, then, it should not form for body movements that do not belong to individuals’ motor repertoire. To test this prediction, we used fMRI to investigate the spatial arrangement and functional properties of the hand and foot action observation circuits in individuals born without upper limbs. Multivoxel pattern decoding, pattern similarity, and univariate analyses revealed an intact hand AON in the individuals born without upper limbs. This suggests that the organization of the AON does not require effector-specific visuomotor coupling.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Subplate (SP) neurons exhibit spontaneous plateau depolarizations mediated by connexin hemichannels. Postnatal (P1–P6) mice show identical voltage pattern and drug-sensitivity as observed in slices from human fetal cortex; indicating that the mouse is a useful model for studying the cellular physiology of the developing neocortex. In mouse SP neurons, spontaneous plateau depolarizations were insensitive to blockers of: synaptic transmission (glutamatergic, GABAergic, or glycinergic), pannexins (probenecid), or calcium channels (mibefradil, verapamil, diltiazem); while highly sensitive to blockers of gap junctions (octanol), hemichannels (La<sup>3+</sup>, lindane, Gd<sup>3+</sup>), or glial metabolism (DLFC). Application of La<sup>3+</sup> (100 μM) does not exert its effect on electrical activity by blocking calcium channels. Intracellular application of Gd<sup>3+</sup> determined that Gd<sup>3+</sup>-sensitive pores (putative connexin hemichannels) reside on the membrane of SP neurons. Immunostaining of cortical sections (P1–P6) detected connexins 26, and 45 in neurons, but not connexins 32 and 36. Vimentin-positive glial cells were detected in the SP zone suggesting a potential physiological interaction between SP neurons and radial glia. SP spontaneous activity was reduced by blocking glial metabolism with DFLC or by blocking purinergic receptors by PPADS. Connexin hemichannels and ATP release from vimentin-positive glial cells may underlie spontaneous plateau depolarizations in the developing mammalian cortex.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Previous in vivo studies revealed robust age-related variations in structural properties of the human cerebral cortex during adolescence. Neurobiology underlying these maturational phenomena is largely unknown. Here we employ a virtual-histology approach to gain insights into processes associated with inter-regional variations in cortical microstructure and its maturation, as indexed by magnetization transfer ratio (MTR). Inter-regional variations in MTR correlate with inter-regional variations in expression of genes specific to pyramidal cells (CA1) and ependymal cells; enrichment analyses indicate involvement of these genes in dendritic growth. On the other hand, inter-regional variations in the change of MTR during adolescence correlate with inter-regional profiles of oligodendrocyte-specific gene expression. Complemented by a quantitative hypothetical model of the contribution of surfaces associated with dendritic arbor (1631 m<sup>2</sup>) and myelin (48 m<sup>2</sup>), these findings suggest that MTR signals are driven mainly by macromolecules associated with dendritic arbor while maturational changes in the MTR signal are associated with myelination.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Neural responses to small manipulable objects (“tools”) in high-level visual areas in ventral temporal cortex (VTC) provide an opportunity to test how anatomically remote regions modulate ventral stream processing in a domain-specific manner. Prior patient studies indicate that grasp-relevant information can be computed about objects by dorsal stream structures independently of processing in VTC. Prior functional neuroimaging studies indicate privileged functional connectivity between regions of VTC exhibiting tool preferences and regions of parietal cortex supporting object-directed action. Here we test whether lesions to parietal cortex modulate tool preferences within ventral and lateral temporal cortex. We found that lesions to the left anterior intraparietal sulcus, a region that supports hand-shaping during object grasping and manipulation, modulate tool preferences in left VTC and in the left posterior middle temporal gyrus. Control analyses demonstrated that neural responses to “place” stimuli in left VTC were unaffected by lesions to parietal cortex, indicating domain-specific consequences for ventral stream neural responses in the setting of parietal lesions. These findings provide causal evidence that neural specificity for “tools” in ventral and lateral temporal lobe areas may arise, in part, from online inputs to VTC from parietal areas that receive inputs via the dorsal visual pathway.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Becoming a proficient reader requires substantial learning over many years. However, it is unknown how learning to read affects development of distributed visual representations across human ventral temporal cortex (VTC). Using fMRI and a data-driven, computational approach, we quantified the development of distributed VTC responses to characters (pseudowords and numbers) versus other domains in children, preteens, and adults. Results reveal anatomical- and hemisphere-specific development. With development, distributed responses to words and characters became more distinctive and informative in lateral but not medial VTC, and in the left but not right hemisphere. While the development of voxels with both positive and negative preference to words affected distributed information, only development of voxels with positive preference to words (i.e., word-selective) was correlated with reading ability. These data show that developmental increases in informativeness of distributed left lateral VTC responses are related to proficient reading and have important implications for both developmental theories and for elucidating neural mechanisms of reading disabilities.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Information that is shared widely can profoundly shape society. Evidence from neuroimaging suggests that activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), a core region of the brain’s valuation system tracks with this sharing. However, the mechanisms linking vmPFC responses in individuals to population behavior are still unclear. We used a multilevel brain-as-predictor approach to address this gap, finding that individual differences in how closely vmPFC activity corresponded with population news article sharing related to how closely its activity tracked with social consensus about article value. Moreover, how closely vmPFC activity corresponded with population behavior was linked to daily life news experience: frequent news readers tended to show high vmPFC across all articles, whereas infrequent readers showed high vmPFC only to articles that were more broadly valued and heavily shared. Using functional connectivity analyses, we found that superior tracking of consensus value was related to decreased connectivity of vmPFC with a dorsolateral PFC region associated with controlled processing. Taken together, our results demonstrate variability in the brain’s capacity to track crowd wisdom about information value, and suggest (lower levels of) stimulus experience and vmPFC–dlPFC connectivity as psychological and neural sources of this variability.</span>

The biological stress response of the body forms one of the foundations of adaptive behavior, including promoting (and impairing) different forms of memory. This response transcends stressful experiences and underlies reactions to challenges and even reinforcers such as addictive substances. Nevertheless, drug-induced stress responses are rarely incorporated into models of addiction. We propose here that drug-induced stress responses (particularly glucocorticoids) play a crucial role in addictive behavior by modulating the formation of memories for substance-use experiences.

<p>by Vito Paolo Pastore, Paolo Massobrio, Aleksandar Godjoski, Sergio Martinoia</p>

Functional-effective connectivity and network topology are nowadays key issues for studying brain physiological functions and pathologies. Inferring neuronal connectivity from electrophysiological recordings presents open challenges and unsolved problems. In this work, we present a cross-correlation based method for reliably estimating not only excitatory but also inhibitory links, by analyzing multi-unit spike activity from large-scale neuronal networks. The method is validated by means of realistic simulations of large-scale neuronal populations. New results related to functional connectivity estimation and network topology identification obtained by experimental electrophysiological recordings from high-density and large-scale (i.e., 4096 electrodes) microtransducer arrays coupled to <i>in vitro</i> neural populations are presented. Specifically, we show that: (i) functional inhibitory connections are accurately identified in <i>in vitro</i> cortical networks, providing that a reasonable firing rate and recording length are achieved; (ii) small-world topology, with scale-free and rich-club features are reliably obtained, on condition that a minimum number of active recording sites are available. The method and procedure can be directly extended and applied to <i>in vivo</i> multi-units brain activity recordings.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/I7N0_alGOGE" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>The transfer-appropriate processing (TAP) account holds that episodic memory depends on the overlap between encoding and retrieval processing. In the current study, we employed multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) of electroencephalography to examine the relevance of spontaneously engaged visual processing during encoding for later retrieval. Human participants encoded word-picture associations, where the picture could be a famous face, a landmark, or an object. At test, we manipulated the retrieval demands by asking participants to retrieve either visual or verbal information about the pictures. MVPA revealed classification between picture categories during early perceptual stages of encoding (~170 ms). Importantly, these visual category-specific neural patterns were predictive of later episodic remembering, but the direction of the relationship was contingent on the particular retrieval demand of the memory task: a benefit for the visual and a cost for the verbal. A reinstatement of the category-specific neural patterns established during encoding was observed during retrieval, and again the relationship with behavior varied with retrieval demands. Reactivation of visual representations during retrieval was associated with better memory in the visual task, but with lower performance in the verbal task. Our findings support and extend the TAP account by demonstrating that processing of particular aspects during memory formation can also have detrimental effects on later episodic remembering when other aspects of the event are called-for and shed new light on encoding and retrieval interactions in episodic memory.</p>

<p>Until recently, hypocretin (Hcrt) neurons were the only known wake-promoting neuronal population in the lateral hypothalamus (LH), but subpopulations of inhibitory neurons in this area and glutamatergic neurons in the nearby supramammillary nucleus (SuM) have recently been found that also promote wakefulness. We performed chemogenetic excitation of LH neurons in mice and observed increased wakefulness that lasted more than 4 h without unusual behavior or EEG anomalies. The increased wakefulness was similar in the presence or absence of the dual orexin receptor blocker almorexant (ALM). Analysis of hM3Dq transfection and c-FOS expression in LH inhibitory neurons and in the SuM failed to confirm that the increased wakefulness was due to these wake-promoting populations, although this possibility cannot be completely excluded. To evaluate the relationship to the Hcrt system, we repeated the study in <i>Orexin-tTA</i> mice in the presence or absence of dietary doxycycline (DOX), which enabled us to manipulate the percentage of Hcrt neurons that expressed hM3Dq. In DOX-fed mice, 18% of Hcrt neurons as well as many other LH neurons expressed hM3Dq; these mice showed a profound increase in wake after hM3Dq activation even in the presence of ALM. In mice switched to normal chow, 62% of Hcrt neurons expressed hM3Dq along with other LH cells; chemogenetic activation produced even more sustained arousal which could be reduced to previous levels by ALM treatment. Together, these results indicate an LH neuron population that promotes wakefulness through an Hcrt-independent pathway that can act synergistically with the Hcrt system to prolong arousal.</p>

Abstract
<p>Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIα (CaMKIIα) is a key mediator of activity-dependent neuronal modifications and has been implicated in the molecular mechanisms of learning and memory. Indeed, several types of CaMKIIα knock-in (KI) and knock-out (KO) mice revealed impairments in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and behavioral learning. On the other hand, a similar role for CaMKIIα has been implicated in amygdala-dependent memory, but detailed analyses have not much been performed yet. To better understand its involvement in amygdala-dependent memory as compared to hippocampus-dependent memory, here we performed biochemical analyses and behavioral memory tests using the kinase-dead CaMKIIα (K42R)-KI mouse. In the Morris water maze tasks, homozygous mutants performed well in the visible platform trials, while they failed to form spatial memory in the hippocampus-dependent hidden platform trials. In fear conditioning, these mice were impaired but showed a certain level of amygdala-dependent cued fear memory, which lasted four weeks, while they showed virtually no hippocampus-dependent context discrimination. Neither stronger stimulation nor repetitive stimulation compensated for their memory deficits. The differential outcome of hippocampus- and amygdala-dependent memory in the mutant mouse was not due to differential expression of CaMKIIα between the hippocampus and the amygdala, because biochemical analyses revealed that both kinase activity and protein levels of CaMKII were indistinguishable between the two brain regions. These results indicate that kinase activity of CaMKIIα is indispensable for hippocampus-dependent memory, but not necessarily for amygdala-dependent memory. There may be a secondary, CaMKIIα activity-independent pathway, in addition to the CaMKIIα activity-dependent pathway, in the acquisition of amygdala-dependent memory.</p>

Abstract<p>LGI1 is a secreted neuronal protein and a Nogo Receptor 1 (NgR1) ligand. Mutations in LGI1 in humans causes autosomal dominant lateral temporal lobe epilepsy and homozygous deletion of LGI1 in mice results in severe epileptic seizures that cause early postnatal death. NgR1 plays an important role in the development of central nervous system synapses and circuitry by limiting plasticity in the adult cortex via the activation of RhoA. These relationships and functions prompted us to examine the effect of LGI1 on synapse formation <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. We report that application of LGI1 increases synaptic density in neuronal culture and that LGI1 null hippocampus has fewer dendritic mushroom spines than in wild-type littermates. Further, our electrophysiological investigations demonstrate that LGI1 null hippocampal neurons possess fewer and weaker synapses. RhoA activity is significantly increased in cortical cultures derived from LGI1 null mice and using a reconstituted system, we show directly that LGI1 antagonizes NgR1-TROY signaling. Our data suggests that LGI1 enhances synapse formation in cortical and hippocampal neurons by reducing NgR1 signaling.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Mutations in leucine-rich glioma inactivated protein 1 (LGI1) causes autosomal dominant lateral temporal lobe epilepsy in humans. In the present study we used a combination of cellular imaging, electrophysiology, protein analysis and cell biology assays to show that LGI1 promotes synapse formation and maturation. LGI1 deletion in mice results in fewer synapses and causes synaptic activity defects. Mechanistically, LGI1 regulates RhoA signaling through a receptor complex containing NgR1 and TROY. Our experiments provide evidence that NgR1 and LGI1 balance regulates RhoA activity during synapse formation and thus impacts on synapse maturation, number and activity.</p>

Abstract<p>Individual hippocampal neurons selectively increase their firing rates in specific spatial locations. As a population these neurons provide a decodable representation of space that is robust against changes to sensory- and path-related cues. This neural code is sparse and distributed, theoretically rendering it undetectable with population recording methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Existing studies nonetheless report decoding spatial codes in the human hippocampus using such techniques. Here we present results from a virtual navigation experiment in humans in which we eliminated visual- and path-related confounds and statistical limitations present in existing studies, ensuring that any positive decoding results would represent a voxel-place code. Consistent with theoretical arguments derived from electrophysiological data and contrary to existing fMRI studies, our results show that although participants were fully oriented during the navigation task, there was no statistical evidence for a place code.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> More than four decades of research have demonstrated that hippocampal place cells in the mammalian brain play a central role in representing the spatial environment. Their encoding of location is both sparse and anatomically distributed, theoretically rendering it undetectable with population recording methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Here we present results showing that if visual confounds and statistical shortcomings are carefully eliminated, there is no evidence for the detectability of a human hippocampal place code using fMRI. Moreover, we discuss in detail how these confounds, amongst others, are manifest in existing studies and are themselves enough to produce false positive results. Our findings have important implications for research on mental representations of space.</p>

Abstract<p>Modeling is a useful tool for investigating various biophysical characteristics of neurons. Recent simulation studies of propagating action potentials (spike conduction) along axons include the investigation of neuronal activity evoked by electrical stimulation from implantable prosthetic devices. In contrast to point-neuron simulations, where a large variety of models are readily available, Hodgkin-Huxley (HH)-type conductance-based models have been almost the only option for simulating axonal spike conduction, as simpler models cannot faithfully replicate the waveforms of propagating spikes. Since the amount of available physiological data, especially in humans, is usually limited, calibration and justification of the large number of parameters of a complex model is generally difficult. In addition, not all simulation studies of axons require detailed descriptions of nonlinear ionic dynamics. In this study, we construct a simple model of spike generation and conduction based on the exponential integrate-and-fire model, which can simulate the rapid growth of the membrane potential at spike initiation. In terms of the number of parameters and equations, this model is much more compact than conventional models, but can still reliably simulate spike conduction along myelinated and unmyelinated axons that were stimulated intracellularly or extracellularly. Our simulations of auditory nerve fibers with this new model suggest that, because of the difference in intrinsic membrane properties, the axonal spike conduction of high-frequency nerve fibers is faster than that of low-frequency fibers. The simple model developed in this study can serve as a computationally efficient alternative to more complex models for future studies, including simulations of neuroprosthetic devices.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Conduction of electrical impulses (action potentials) along the axon is essential for information transfer between neurons. Simulation studies of propagating action potentials, which earlier focused on the biophysical mechanisms of conduction, have progressed to investigations of pathological malfunctions of nerves and electrical stimulations via prostheses. In contrast to dimensionless, single-neuron modeling, for which a number of different approaches are available, simulation of nerve conduction generally requires a complex model of ionic conductances to reproduce propagating action potentials. In this study, we present a simplified phenomenological model of axonal conduction with increased computational efficiency and a reduced number of parameters. This simple model can be used as an alternative to conventional models, especially for applications including prosthetic simulations of nerve conduction.</p>

Abstract<p>With the advent of optogenetics, it became possible to change the activity of a targeted population of neurons in a temporally controlled manner. To combine the advantages of sixty-channel in vivo tetrode recording and laser-based optogenetics, we have developed a closed-loop recording system that allows for the actual electrophysiological signal to be used as a trigger for the laser light mediating the optogenetic intervention. We have optimized the weight, size, and shape of the corresponding implant to make it compatible with the size, force, and movements of a behaving mouse, and we have shown that the system can efficiently block sharp wave ripple (SWR) events using those events themselves as a trigger. To demonstrate the full potential of the optogenetic recording system we present a pilot study addressing the contribution of SWR events to learning in a complex behavioral task.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Our custom optogenetic microdrive design takes into consideration the small size and force of the mice and offers an unusually high number of channels to collect murine electrophysiological data. The laser delivery is optimized to irradiate the brain at four points so targeting structures as large as the dorsal CA1 region becomes possible. The described technique provides a cutting-edge tool to study several aspects of cognition, learning, memory, sleep and decision making. All types of experiments where a larger brain area needs to be illuminated during extracellular recordings could exploit our newly developed implant. The preliminary data on the effect of SWR-blockade, presented here as an illustration of the new method, could inspire further experiments using larger number of animals.</p>

<p>by Xing Chen, Jun Yin, Jia Qu, Li Huang</p>

Recently, a growing number of biological research and scientific experiments have demonstrated that microRNA (miRNA) affects the development of human complex diseases. Discovering miRNA-disease associations plays an increasingly vital role in devising diagnostic and therapeutic tools for diseases. However, since uncovering associations via experimental methods is expensive and time-consuming, novel and effective computational methods for association prediction are in demand. In this study, we developed a computational model of Matrix Decomposition and Heterogeneous Graph Inference for miRNA-disease association prediction (MDHGI) to discover new miRNA-disease associations by integrating the predicted association probability obtained from matrix decomposition through sparse learning method, the miRNA functional similarity, the disease semantic similarity, and the Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity for diseases and miRNAs into a heterogeneous network. Compared with previous computational models based on heterogeneous networks, our model took full advantage of matrix decomposition before the construction of heterogeneous network, thereby improving the prediction accuracy. MDHGI obtained AUCs of 0.8945 and 0.8240 in the global and the local leave-one-out cross validation, respectively. Moreover, the AUC of 0.8794+/-0.0021 in 5-fold cross validation confirmed its stability of predictive performance. In addition, to further evaluate the model's accuracy, we applied MDHGI to four important human cancers in three different kinds of case studies. In the first type, 98% (Esophageal Neoplasms) and 98% (Lymphoma) of top 50 predicted miRNAs have been confirmed by at least one of the two databases (dbDEMC and miR2Disease) or at least one experimental literature in PubMed. In the second type of case study, what made a difference was that we removed all known associations between the miRNAs and Lung Neoplasms before implementing MDHGI on Lung Neoplasms. As a result, 100% (Lung Neoplasms) of top 50 related miRNAs have been indexed by at least one of the three databases (dbDEMC, miR2Disease and HMDD V2.0) or at least one experimental literature in PubMed. Furthermore, we also tested our prediction method on the HMDD V1.0 database to prove the applicability of MDHGI to different datasets. The results showed that 50 out of top 50 miRNAs related with the breast neoplasms were validated by at least one of the three databases (HMDD V2.0, dbDEMC, and miR2Disease) or at least one experimental literature.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zmqWoqKvbTA" width="1" />

Cell-type specific gene expression is regulated by the combinatorial action of transcription factors (TFs). In this study, we predict transcription factor (TF) combinations that cooperatively bind in a cell-type specific manner. We first divide DNase hypersensitive sites into cell-type specifically open vs. ubiquitously open sites in 64 cell types to describe possible cell-type specific enhancers. Based on the pattern contrast between these two groups of sequences we develop “co-occurring TF predictor on Cell-Type specific Enhancers” (coTRaCTE) - a novel statistical method to determine regulatory TF co-occurrences. Contrasting the co-binding of TF pairs between cell-type specific and ubiquitously open chromatin guarantees the high cell-type specificity of the predictions. coTRaCTE predicts more than 2000 co-occurring TF pairs in 64 cell types. The large majority (70%) of these TF pairs is highly cell-type specific and overlaps in TF pair co-occurrence are highly consistent among related cell types. Furthermore, independently validated co-occurring and directly interacting TFs are significantly enriched in our predictions. Focusing on the regulatory network derived from the predicted co-occurring TF pairs in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) we find that it consists of three subnetworks with distinct functions: maintenance of pluripotency governed by OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG, regulation of early development governed by KLF4, STAT3, ZIC3 and ZNF148 and general functions governed by MYC, TCF3 and YY1. In summary, coTRaCTE predicts highly cell-type specific co-occurring TFs which reveal new insights into transcriptional regulatory mechanisms.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9JI8ApvfZSc" width="1" />

Optimal decision-making is based on integrating information from several dimensions of decisional space (e.g., reward expectation, cost estimation, effort exertion). Despite considerable empirical and theoretical efforts, the computational and neural bases of such multidimensional integration have remained largely elusive. Here we propose that the current theoretical stalemate may be broken by considering the computational properties of a cortical-subcortical circuit involving the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and the brainstem neuromodulatory nuclei: ventral tegmental area (VTA) and locus coeruleus (LC). From this perspective, the dACC optimizes decisions about stimuli and actions, and using the same computational machinery, it also modulates cortical functions (meta-learning), via neuromodulatory control (VTA and LC). We implemented this theory in a novel neuro-computational model–the Reinforcement Meta Learner (RML). We outline how the RML captures critical empirical findings from an unprecedented range of theoretical domains, and parsimoniously integrates various previous proposals on dACC functioning.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pRztMdJh6VU" width="1" />

<p>Energy landscapes are a useful aid for the understanding of dynamical
systems, and a valuable tool for their analysis. For a broad class of rate
models of neural networks, we derive a global Lyapunov function which provides
an energy landscape without any symmetry constraint. This newly obtained
`nonequilibrium potential' (NEP) predicts with high accuracy the outcomes of
the dynamics in the globally stable cases studied here. Common features of the
models in this class are bistability --with implications for working memory and
slow neural oscillations --and `population burst', also relevant in
neuroscience. Instead, limit cycles are not found. Their nonexistence can be
proven by resort to the Bendixson--Dulac theorem, at least when the NEP remains
positive and in the (also generic) singular limit of these models. Hopefully,
this NEP will help understand average neural network dynamics from a more
formal standpoint, and will also be of help in the description of large
heterogeneous neural networks.

<p>With respect to biological findings underlying fly's physiology in the past
decade, we present a directionally selective neural network, with a
feed-forward structure and entirely low-level visual processing, so as to
implement direction selective neurons in the fly's visual system, which are
mainly sensitive to wide-field translational movements in four cardinal
directions. In this research, we highlight the functionality of ON and OFF
pathways, separating motion information for parallel computation corresponding
to light-on and light-off selectivity. Through this modeling study, we
demonstrate several achievements compared with former bio-plausible
translational motion detectors, like the elementary motion detectors. First, we
thoroughly mimic the fly's preliminary motion-detecting pathways with newly
revealed fly's physiology. Second, we improve the speed response to moving
dark/light features via the design of ensembles of same polarity cells in the
dual-pathways. Moreover, we alleviate the impact of irrelevant motion in a
visually cluttered environment like the shifting of background and windblown
vegetation, via the modeling of spatiotemporal dynamics. We systematically
tested the DSNN against stimuli ranging from synthetic and real-world scenes,
to notably a visual modality of a ground micro robot. The results demonstrated
that the DSNN outperforms former bio-plausible translational motion detectors.
Importantly, we verified its computational simplicity and effectiveness
benefiting the building of neuromorphic vision sensor for robots.

<p>A common practice to account for psychophysical biases in vision is to frame
them as consequences of a dynamic process relying on optimal inference with
respect to a generative model. The present study details the complete
formulation of such a generative model intended to probe visual motion
perception with a dynamic texture model. It is first derived in a set of
axiomatic steps constrained by biological plausibility. We extend previous
contributions by detailing three equivalent formulations of this texture model.
First, the composite dynamic textures are constructed by the random aggregation
of warped patterns, which can be viewed as 3D Gaussian fields. Secondly, these
textures are cast as solutions to a stochastic partial differential equation
(sPDE). This essential step enables real time, on-the-fly texture synthesis
using time-discretized auto-regressive processes. It also allows for the
derivation of a local motion-energy model, which corresponds to the
log-likelihood of the probability density. The log-likelihoods are essential
for the construction of a Bayesian inference framework. We use the dynamic
texture model to psychophysically probe speed perception in humans using
zoom-like changes in the spatial frequency content of the stimulus. The human
data replicates previous findings showing perceived speed to be positively
biased by spatial frequency increments. A Bayesian observer who combines a
Gaussian likelihood centered at the true speed and a spatial frequency
dependent width with a "slow speed prior" successfully accounts for the
perceptual bias. More precisely, the bias arises from a decrease in the
observer's likelihood width estimated from the experiments as the spatial
frequency increases. Such a trend is compatible with the trend of the dynamic
texture likelihood width.

Behavioral adaptations occur through remodeling of brain circuits, as arising, for instance, from experience-dependent synaptic plasticity. Drugs of abuse and aversive stimuli, such as stress, act on the mesocorticolimbic system, dysregulating adaptive mechanisms and leading to a variety of aberrant behaviors associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. Until recently, research in the field has commonly focused on experience-dependent synaptic plasticity at excitatory synapses. However, there is growing evidence that synaptic plasticity within inhibitory circuits is an important contributor to maladaptive behaviors.

<p>by Richard E. Rosch, Paul R. Hunter, Torsten Baldeweg, Karl J. Friston, Martin P. Meyer</p>

Pathophysiological explanations of epilepsy typically focus on either the micro/mesoscale (e.g. excitation-inhibition imbalance), or on the macroscale (e.g. network architecture). Linking abnormalities across spatial scales remains difficult, partly because of technical limitations in measuring neuronal signatures concurrently at the scales involved. Here we use light sheet imaging of the larval zebrafish brain during acute epileptic seizure induced with pentylenetetrazole. Spectral changes of spontaneous neuronal activity during the seizure are then modelled using neural mass models, allowing Bayesian inference on changes in effective network connectivity and their underlying synaptic dynamics. This dynamic causal modelling of seizures in the zebrafish brain reveals concurrent changes in synaptic coupling at macro- and mesoscale. Fluctuations of both synaptic connection strength and their temporal dynamics are required to explain observed seizure patterns. These findings highlight distinct changes in local (intrinsic) and long-range (extrinsic) synaptic transmission dynamics as a possible seizure pathomechanism and illustrate how our Bayesian model inversion approach can be used to link existing neural mass models of seizure activity and novel experimental methods.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kBUcHrhwctQ" width="1" />

<p>by Niru Maheswaranathan, David B. Kastner, Stephen A. Baccus, Surya Ganguli</p>

A central challenge in sensory neuroscience involves understanding how neural circuits shape computations across cascaded cell layers. Here we attempt to reconstruct the response properties of experimentally unobserved neurons in the interior of a multilayered neural circuit, using cascaded linear-nonlinear (LN-LN) models. We combine non-smooth regularization with proximal consensus algorithms to overcome difficulties in fitting such models that arise from the high dimensionality of their parameter space. We apply this framework to retinal ganglion cell processing, learning LN-LN models of retinal circuitry consisting of thousands of parameters, using 40 minutes of responses to white noise. Our models demonstrate a 53% improvement in predicting ganglion cell spikes over classical linear-nonlinear (LN) models. Internal nonlinear subunits of the model match properties of retinal bipolar cells in both receptive field structure and number. Subunits have consistently high thresholds, supressing all but a small fraction of inputs, leading to sparse activity patterns in which only one subunit drives ganglion cell spiking at any time. From the model’s parameters, we predict that the removal of visual redundancies through stimulus decorrelation across space, a central tenet of efficient coding theory, originates primarily from bipolar cell synapses. Furthermore, the composite nonlinear computation performed by retinal circuitry corresponds to a boolean OR function applied to bipolar cell feature detectors. Our methods are statistically and computationally efficient, enabling us to rapidly learn hierarchical non-linear models as well as efficiently compute widely used descriptive statistics such as the spike triggered average (STA) and covariance (STC) for high dimensional stimuli. This general computational framework may aid in extracting principles of nonlinear hierarchical sensory processing across diverse modalities from limited data.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oIPwD8-KVAo" width="1" />

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Maternal folic acid supplementation during pregnancy is associated with improved cognitive performances in offspring. However, the effect of supplementation on offspring’s neurogenesis and synaptogenesis is unknown, and whether supplementation should be continued throughout pregnancy is controversial. In present study, 3 groups of female rats were fed a folate-normal diet, folate-deficient diet, or folate-supplemented diet from 1 week before mating until the end of pregnancy. A fourth group fed folate-normal diet from 1 week before mating until mating, then fed folate-supplemented diet for 10 consecutive days, then fed folate-normal diet until the end of pregnancy. Offspring were sacrificed on postnatal day 0 for measurement of neurogenesis and synaptogenesis by immunofluorescence and western blot. Additionally neural stem cells (NSCs) were cultured from offspring’s hippocampus for immunocytochemical measurement of their rates of proliferation and neuronal differentiation. The results demonstrated that maternal folic acid supplementation stimulated hippocampal neurogenesis by increasing proliferation and neuronal differentiation of NSCs, and also enhanced synaptogenesis in cerebral cortex of neonatal offspring. Hippocampal neurogenesis was stimulated more when supplementation was continued throughout pregnancy instead of being limited to the periconceptional period. In conclusion, maternal folic acid supplementation, especially if continued throughout pregnancy, improves neurogenesis and synaptogenesis in neonatal offspring.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are increasingly prevalent neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by sociocommunicative impairments. Growing consensus indicates that neurobehavioral abnormalities require explanation in terms of interconnected networks. Despite theoretical speculations about increased local and reduced distal connectivity, links between local and distal functional connectivity have not been systematically investigated in ASDs. Specifically, it remains open whether hypothesized local overconnectivity may reflect isolated versus overly integrative processing. Resting state functional MRI data from 57 children and adolescents with ASDs and 51 typically developing (TD) participants were included. In regional homogeneity (ReHo) analyses, pericalcarine visual cortex was found be locally overconnected (ASD &gt; TD). Using this region as seed in whole-brain analyses, we observed overconnectivity in distal regions, specifically middle frontal gyri, for an ASD subgroup identified through <span style="font-style: italic;">k</span>-means clustering. While in this subgroup local occipital to distal frontal overconnectivity was associated with greater symptom severity, a second subgroup showed the opposite pattern of connectivity and symptom severity correlations. Our findings suggest that increased local connectivity in ASDs is region-specific and may be partially associated with more integrative long-distance connectivity. Results also highlight the need to test for subtypes, as differential patterns of brain–behavior links were observed in two distinct subgroups of our ASD cohort.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Memory retrieval can strengthen, but also distort memories. Parietal cortex is a candidate region involved in retrieval-induced memory changes as it reflects retrieval success and represents retrieved content. Here, we conducted an fMRI experiment to test whether different forms of parietal reactivation predict distinct consequences of retrieval. Subjects studied associations between words and pictures of faces, scenes, or objects, and then repeatedly retrieved half of the pictures, reporting the vividness of the retrieved pictures (“retrieval practice”). On the following day, subjects completed a recognition memory test for individual pictures. Critically, the test included lures highly similar to studied pictures. Behaviorally, retrieval practice increased both hit and false alarm (FA) rates to similar lures, confirming a causal influence of retrieval on subsequent memory. Using pattern similarity analyses, we measured two different levels of reactivation during retrieval practice: generic “category-level” reactivation and idiosyncratic “item-level” reactivation. Vivid remembering during retrieval practice was associated with stronger category- and item-level reactivation in parietal cortex. However, these measures differentially predicted subsequent recognition memory performance: whereas higher category-level reactivation tended to predict FAs to lures, item-level reactivation predicted correct rejections. These findings indicate that parietal reactivation can be decomposed to tease apart distinct consequences of memory retrieval.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Lead (Pb) causes significant adverse effects on the developing brain, resulting in cognitive and learning disabilities in children. The process by which lead produces these negative changes is largely unknown. The fact that children with these syndromes also show deficits in central auditory processing, however, indicates a speculative but disturbing relationship between lead-exposure, impaired auditory processing, and behavioral dysfunction. Here we studied in rats the changes in cortical spatial tuning impacted by early lead-exposure and their potential restoration to normal by auditory training. We found animals that were exposed to lead early in life displayed significant behavioral impairments compared with naïve controls while conducting the sound-azimuth discrimination task. Lead-exposure also degraded the sound-azimuth selectivity of neurons in the primary auditory cortex. Subsequent sound-azimuth discrimination training, however, restored to nearly normal the lead-degraded cortical azimuth selectivity. This reversal of cortical spatial fidelity was paralleled by changes in cortical expression of certain excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter receptor subunits. These results in a rodent model demonstrate the persisting neurotoxic effects of early lead-exposure on behavioral and cortical neuronal processing of spatial information of sound. They also indicate that attention-demanding auditory training may remediate lead-induced cortical neurological deficits even after these deficits have occurred.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The phenomenon of cortical thinning with age has been well established; however, the measured rate of change varies between studies. The source of this variation could be image acquisition techniques including hardware and vendor specific differences. Databases are often consolidated to increase the number of subjects but underlying differences between these datasets could have undesired effects. We explore differences in cerebral cortex thinning between 4 databases, totaling 1382 subjects. We investigate several aspects of these databases, including: 1) differences between databases of cortical thinning rates versus age, 2) correlation of cortical thinning rates between regions for each database, and 3) regression bootstrapping to determine the effect of the number of subjects included. We also examined the effect of different databases on age prediction modeling. Cortical thinning rates were significantly different between databases in all 68 parcellated regions (ANCOVA, <span style="font-style: italic;">P</span> &lt; 0.001). Subtle differences were observed in correlation matrices and bootstrapping convergence. Age prediction modeling using a leave-one-out cross-validation approach showed varying prediction performance (0.64 &lt; <span style="font-style: italic;">R</span><sup>2</sup> &lt; 0.82) between databases. When a database was used to calibrate the model and then applied to another database, prediction performance consistently decreased. We conclude that there are indeed differences in the measured cortical thinning rates between these large-scale databases.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Musical training has been demonstrated to benefit speech-in-noise perception. It is however unknown whether this effect translates to selective listening in cocktail party situations, and if so what its neural basis might be. We investigated this question using magnetoencephalography-based speech envelope reconstruction and a sustained selective listening task, in which participants with varying amounts of musical training attended to 1 of 2 speech streams while detecting rare target words. Cortical frequency-following responses (FFR) and auditory working memory were additionally measured to dissociate musical training-related effects on low-level auditory processing versus higher cognitive function. Results show that the duration of musical training is associated with a reduced distracting effect of competing speech on target detection accuracy. Remarkably, more musical training was related to a robust neural tracking of both the to-be-attended and the to-be-ignored speech stream, up until late cortical processing stages. Musical training-related increases in FFR power were associated with a robust speech tracking in auditory sensory areas, whereas training-related differences in auditory working memory were linked to an increased representation of the to-be-ignored stream beyond auditory cortex. Our findings suggest that musically trained persons can use additional information about the distracting stream to limit interference by competing speech.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is an RNA-binding protein involved in translational regulation of mRNAs that play key roles in synaptic morphology and plasticity. The functional absence of FMRP causes the fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common form of inherited intellectual disability and the most common monogenic cause of autism. No effective treatment is available for FXS. We recently identified the <span style="font-style: italic;">Phosphodiesterase 2A</span> (<span style="font-style: italic;">Pde2a</span>) mRNA as a prominent target of FMRP. PDE2A enzymatic activity is increased in the brain of <span style="font-style: italic;">Fmr1</span>-KO mice, a recognized model of FXS, leading to decreased levels of cAMP and cGMP. Here, we pharmacologically inhibited PDE2A in <span style="font-style: italic;">Fmr1</span>-KO mice and observed a rescue both of the maturity of dendritic spines and of the exaggerated hippocampal mGluR-dependent long-term depression. Remarkably, PDE2A blockade rescued the social and communicative deficits of both mouse and rat <span style="font-style: italic;">Fmr1-</span>KO animals. Importantly, chronic inhibition of PDE2A in newborn <span style="font-style: italic;">Fmr1</span>-KO mice followed by a washout interval, resulted in the rescue of the altered social behavior observed in adolescent mice. Altogether, these results reveal the key role of PDE2A in the physiopathology of FXS and suggest that its pharmacological inhibition represents a novel therapeutic approach for FXS.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The hierarchical nature of language requires human brain to internally parse connected-speech and incrementally construct abstract linguistic structures. Recent research revealed multiple neural processing timescales underlying grammar-based configuration of linguistic hierarchies. However, little is known about where in the whole cerebral cortex such temporally scaled neural processes occur. This study used novel magnetoencephalography source imaging techniques combined with a unique language stimulation paradigm to segregate cortical maps synchronized to 3 levels of linguistic units (i.e., words, phrases, and sentences). Notably, distinct ensembles of cortical loci were identified to feature structures at different levels. The superior temporal gyrus was found to be involved in processing all 3 linguistic levels while distinct ensembles of other brain regions were recruited to encode each linguistic level. Neural activities in the right motor cortex only followed the rhythm of monosyllabic words which have clear acoustic boundaries, whereas the left anterior temporal lobe and the left inferior frontal gyrus were selectively recruited in processing phrases or sentences. Our results ground a multi-timescale hierarchical neural processing of speech in neuroanatomical reality with specific sets of cortices responsible for different levels of linguistic units.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Acupuncture can provide therapeutic analgesic benefits but is limited by its cost and scheduling difficulties. Guided imagery is a commonly used method for treating many disorders, such as chronic pain. The present study examined a novel intervention for pain relief that integrates acupuncture with imagery called video-guided acupuncture imagery treatment (VGAIT). A total of 27 healthy subjects were recruited for a crossover-design study that included 5 sessions administered in a randomized order (i.e., baseline and 4 different interventions). We investigated changes in pain threshold and fMRI signals modulated by: 1) VGAIT, watching a video of acupuncture previously administered on the participant’s own body at baseline while imagining it being concurrently applied; 2) a VGAIT control condition, watching a video of a cotton swab touching the skin; 3) real acupuncture; and 4) sham acupuncture. Results demonstrated that real acupuncture and VGAIT significantly increased pain threshold compared with respective control groups. Imaging showed that real acupuncture produced greater activation of the insula compared with VGAIT. VGAIT produced greater deactivation at the rostral anterior cingulate cortex. Our findings demonstrate that VGAIT holds potential clinical value for pain management.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Aging is characterized by substantial average decline in memory performance. Yet contradictory explanations have been given for how the brains of high-performing older adults work: either by engagement of compensatory processes such as recruitment of additional networks or by maintaining young adults’ patterns of activity. Distinguishing these components requires large experimental samples and longitudinal follow-up. Here, we investigate which features are key to high memory in aging, directly testing these hypotheses by studying a large sample of adult participants (<span style="font-style: italic;">n</span> &gt; 300) with fMRI during an episodic memory experiment where item-context relationships were implicitly encoded. The analyses revealed that low levels of activity in frontal networks—known to be involved in memory encoding—were associated with low memory performance in the older adults only. Importantly, older participants with low memory performance and low frontal activity exhibited a strong longitudinal memory decline in an independent verbal episodic memory task spanning 8 years back (<span style="font-style: italic;">n</span> = 52). These participants were also characterized by lower hippocampal volumes and steeper rates of cortical atrophy. Altogether, maintenance of frontal brain function during encoding seems to be a primary characteristic of preservation of memory function in aging, likely reflecting intact ability to integrate information.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The heterogeneous neuronal subgroups of the basal forebrain corticopetal system (BFcs) have been shown to modulate cortical functions through their cholinergic, gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic, and glutamatergic projections to the entire cortex. Although previous studies suggested that the basalo-cortical projection system influences various cognitive functions, particularly via its cholinergic component, these studies only focused on certain parts of the BFcs or nearby structures, leaving aside a more systematic picture of the functional connectivity of BFcs subcompartments. Moreover, these studies lacked the high-spatial resolution and the probability maps needed to identify specific subcompartments. Recent advances in the ultra-high field 7T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provided potentially unprecedented spatial resolution of functional MRI images to study the subdivision of the BFcs. In this study, the BF space containing corticopetal cells was divided into 3 functionally distinct subdivisions based on functional connection to cortical regions derived from fMRI. The overall functional connection of each BFcs subdivision was examined with a test-retest study. Finally, a meta-analysis was used to study the related functional topics of each BF subdivision. Our results demonstrate distinct functional connectivity patterns of these subdivisions along the rostrocaudal axis of the BF. All three compartments have shown consistent segregation and overlap at specific target regions including the hippocampus, insula, thalamus, and the cingulate gyrus, suggesting functional integration and separation in BFcs.</span>

Arousal is an important conserved behavioral state where animals show increased sensory responsiveness and locomotor hyperactivity. Chew et al. identify a neuromodulatory pathway that enables mechanosensory neurons to promote both sensory and locomotor arousal via activation of a neuroendocrine center.

In rats performing reward-oriented action selection, we demonstrate that striatal direct pathway neurons encode chosen action-associated reward and indirect pathway neurons encode no-reward outcomes and next selection. Activation of direct or indirect pathways biases toward repeating or switching actions, respectively.

Treatment-naive MDD patients have increased levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory markers, but overall the balance shifts toward immunosuppression of immune cells. Consistent with these findings, absence of response to antidepressant treatments has been associated with defective anti-inflammatory response.

Abstract<p>Oscillations in local field potentials (LFPs) are prevalent and contribute to brain function. An understanding of the cellular correlates and pathways affecting LFPs is needed but many overlapping pathways in vivo make this difficult to achieve. A prevalent LFP rhythm in the hippocampus associated with memory processing and spatial navigation is the theta (3-12 Hz) oscillation. Theta rhythms emerge intrinsically in an in vitro whole hippocampus preparation and this reduced preparation makes it possible to assess the contribution of different cell types to LFP generation. We focus on oriens-lacunosum/moleculare (OLM) cells as a major class of interneurons in the hippocampus. OLM cells can influence pyramidal (PYR) cells through two distinct pathways: by direct inhibition of PYR cell distal dendrites, and by indirect disinhibition of PYR cell proximal dendrites. We use previous inhibitory network models and build biophysical LFP models using volume conductor theory. We examine the effect of OLM cells to ongoing intrinsic LFP theta rhythms by directly comparing our model LFP features with experiment. We find that OLM cell inputs regulate the robustness of LFP responses without affecting their average power and that this robust response depends on co-activation of distal inhibition and basal excitation. We use our models to estimate the spatial extent of the region generating LFP theta rhythms, leading us to predict that about 22,000 PYR cells participate in intrinsic theta generation. Besides obtaining an understanding of OLM cell contributions to intrinsic LFP theta rhythms, our work can help decipher cellular correlates of in vivo LFPs.</p><p><b>Significance</b> Oscillatory local field potentials (LFPs) are extracellularly recorded signals that are widely used to interpret information processing in the brain. Theta (3-12 Hz) LFP rhythms are correlated with memory processing, and inhibitory cell subtypes contribute in particular ways to theta. While a precise biophysical modeling scheme linking cellular activity to LFP signals has been established, it is difficult to assess cellular contributions <i>in vivo</i> to LFPs because of spatiotemporally overlapping pathways that prevent the unambiguous separation of signals. Using an <i>in vitro</i> preparation that exhibits theta rhythms and where there is much less overlap, we build biophysical LFP models and uncover distinct inhibitory cellular contributions. This work brings us closer to obtaining cellular correlates of LFPs and brain function.</p>

<p>Fractional extensions of the cable equation have been proposed in the
literature to describe transmembrane potential in spiny dendrites. The
anomalous behavior has been related in the literature to the geometrical
properties of the system, in particular, the density of spines, by experiments,
computer simulations, and in comb-like models.~The same PDE can be related to
more than one stochastic process leading to anomalous diffusion behavior. The
time-fractional diffusion equation can be associated to a continuous time
random walk (CTRW) with power-law waiting time probability or to a special case
of the Erd\'ely-Kober fractional diffusion, described by the ggBm. In this
work, we show that time fractional generalization of the cable equation arises
naturally in the CTRW by considering a superposition of Markovian processes and
in a {\it ggBm-like} construction of the random variable.

<p>Continuous attractor neural networks generate a set of smoothly connected
attractor states. In memory systems of the brain, these attractor states may
represent continuous pieces of information such as spatial locations and head
directions of animals. However, during the replay of previous experiences,
hippocampal neurons show a discontinuous sequence in which discrete transitions
of neural state are phase-locked with the slow-gamma (30-40 Hz) oscillation.
Here, we explored the underlying mechanisms of the discontinuous sequence
generation. We found that a continuous attractor neural network has several
phases depending on the interactions between external input and local
inhibitory feedback. The discrete-attractor-like behavior naturally emerges in
one of these phases without any discreteness assumption. We propose that the
dynamics of continuous attractor neural networks is the key to generate
discontinuous state changes phase-locked to the brain rhythm.

Many internal organs change volume periodically. For example, the stomach accommodates ingested food and drink, the bladder stores urine, the heart fills with blood, and the lungs expand with every breath. Specialized peripheral sensory neurons function as mechanoreceptors that detect tissue stretch to infer changes in organ volume and then relay this information to the brain. Central neural circuits process this information and evoke perceptions (satiety, nausea), control physiology (breathing, heart rate), and impact behavior (feeding, micturition).

Melanopsin is a photopigment expressed by certain types of retinal ganglion cells that mediate non-image-forming visual functions, such as circadian photoentrainment. In this issue of Neuron, Sonoda et al. (2018) reveal how melanopsin also regulates the sensitivity of conventional image-forming vision.

Current evidence challenges the traditional view of attention as a continuously active spotlight, suggesting instead a rhythmic operation at around 4–8 Hz. New intracranial recordings in monkeys and humans, including two papers in this issue of Neuron, by Helfrich et al. (2018) and Fiebelkorn et al. (2018), now validate this alternative notion and characterize its oscillatory neural bases.

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0051-18.2018v1?rss=1">A Brain without Brakes: reduced Inhibition Is Associated with Enhanced but Dysregulated Plasticity in the Aged Rat Auditory Cortex</a></h4>

Abstract<p>During early developmental windows known as critical periods (CP) of plasticity, passive alterations in the quality and quantity of sensory inputs are sufficient to induce profound and long-lasting distortions in cortical sensory representations. With CP closure those representations are stabilized, a process requiring the maturation of inhibitory networks and the maintenance of sufficient GABAergic tone in the cortex. In humans and rodents however, cortical inhibition progressively decreases with advancing age, raising the possibility that the regulation of plasticity could be altered in older individuals. Here we tested the hypothesis that aging results in a destabilization of sensory representations and maladaptive dysregulated plasticity in the rat primary auditory cortex (A1). Consistent with this idea, we found that passive tone exposure is sufficient to distort frequency tuning in the A1 of older but not younger adult rats. However, we also found that these passive distortions decayed rapidly, indicating an ongoing instability of A1 tuning in the aging cortex. These changes were associated with a decrease in GABA neurotransmitter concentration and a reduction in parvalbumin and perineuronal net expression in the cortex. Finally, we show that artificially increasing GABA tone in the aging A1 is sufficient to restore representational stability and improve the retention of learning.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> In this study, we examined brain plasticity in the auditory cortex of young adult and older adult rats in the context of different types of auditory stimulation and training. Surprisingly, older brains retained an equal or even higher potential for plasticity compared to young adults. In older brains, however, changes elicited by auditory stimulation and training were rapidly lost, suggesting that such increased plasticity might be detrimental as the older brains were unable to consolidate these changes. This increased but poorly regulated plasticity was associated with a reduction in cortical inhibition which normally maintains the stability of sensory representations in the young adult brain. Importantly, increasing inhibition artificially with clinically available drugs restored stability and improved the retention of learning.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06578">Paradoxical LTP maintenance with inhibition of protein synthesis and the proteasome suggests a novel protein synthesis requirement for early LTP reversal. (arXiv:1808.06578v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>The transition from early long-term potentiation (E-LTP) to late LTP (L-LTP)
involves protein synthesis and degradation. L-LTP is blocked by inhibiting
either protein synthesis or proteasome-dependent degradation prior to and
during a tetanic stimulus, but paradoxically, L-LTP is not blocked when
synthesis and degradation are inhibited simultaneously, suggesting
counter-acting positive and negative proteins regulate L-LTP. To investigate
this paradox, we modeled LTP at the Schaffer collateral synapse. Nine
differential equations describe the levels of positive and negative regulator
proteins (PP and NP) and transitions among five discrete synaptic states, a
basal state (BAS), three E-LTP states (EP1, EP2, ED), and a L-LTP state (LP). A
stimulus initiates the transition from BAS to EP1 and from EP1 to EP2,
initiates the synthesis of PP and NP, and activates the ubiquitin-proteasome
system (UPS). UPS mediates transitions of EP1 and EP2 to ED and the degradation
of NP. The conversion of E-LTP to L-LTP is mediated by a PP-dependent
transition from ED to LP. NP mediates reversal of EP2 to BAS. This model
simulates empirical observations: 1) normal L-LTP, 2) block by either
proteasome inhibitor or protein synthesis inhibitor alone, and 3) preservation
of L-LTP when both inhibitors are applied together. Elements of this abstract
model can be correlated with specific molecules and processes. Moreover, the
model makes testable predictions, such as a unique synaptic state ED that
precedes the transition to L-LTP, and a time window for the action of the UPS
(during the transitions from EP1 and EP2 to ED). Tests of these predictions
will provide insights into the processes of long-term synaptic plasticity.

Abstract
<p>Noise exposure is one of the most common causes of hearing loss and peripheral damage to the auditory system. A growing literature suggests that the auditory system can compensate for peripheral loss through increased central neural activity. The current study sought to investigate the link between noise exposure, increases in central gain, synaptic reorganization, and auditory function. All axons of the auditory nerve project to the cochlear nucleus, making it a requisite nucleus for sound detection. As the first synapse in the central auditory system, the cochlear nucleus is well positioned to respond plastically to loss of peripheral input. To investigate noise-induced compensation in the central auditory system, we measured auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) and auditory perception and collected tissue from mice exposed to broadband noise. Noise-exposed mice showed elevated ABR thresholds, reduced ABR wave 1 amplitudes, and spiral ganglion neuron loss. Despite peripheral damage, noise-exposed mice were hyperreactive to loud sounds and showed nearly normal behavioral sound detection thresholds. Ratios of late ABR peaks (2–4) relative to the first ABR peak indicated that brainstem pathways were hyperactive in noise-exposed mice, while anatomical analysis indicated there was an imbalance between expression of excitatory and inhibitory proteins in the ventral cochlear nucleus. The results of the current study suggest that a reorganization of excitation and inhibition in the ventral cochlear nucleus may drive hyperactivity in the central auditory system. This increase in central gain can compensate for peripheral loss to restore some aspects of auditory function.</p>

<p>In this paper we address the memory demands that come with the processing of
3-dimensional, high-resolution, multi-channeled medical images in deep
learning. We exploit memory-efficient backpropagation techniques, to reduce the
memory complexity of network training from being linear in the network's depth,
to being roughly constant $ - $ permitting us to elongate deep architectures
with negligible memory increase. We evaluate our methodology in the paradigm of
Image Quality Transfer, whilst noting its potential application to various
tasks that use deep learning. We study the impact of depth on accuracy and show
that deeper models have more predictive power, which may exploit larger
training sets. We obtain substantially better results than the previous
state-of-the-art model with a slight memory increase, reducing the
root-mean-squared-error by $ 13\% $. Our code is publicly available.
