	<p>Continuous positive airway pressure therapy (CPAP) is a highly effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), but CPAP adherence remains suboptimal. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly altered sleep medicine services and aspects of daily living for sleep medicine patients, which may further compromise CPAP adherence. Sleep medicine patients were distributed an online survey at baseline and six months later (January&amp;amp;ndash;May 2021). Participants answered questions regarding CPAP use (any changes in CPAP use, sleep quality with CPAP use, CPAP use as advised, and changes in daily habits). Eighty-one adults completed the baseline survey, and 54 adults completed the follow-up survey. Twenty-seven participants reported a diagnosis of OSA and were prescribed CPAP (mean age 58 &amp;amp;plusmn; 18.2 years, 48% female, 67% Caucasian). Longitudinal analysis with chi-square association testing showed significant changes in CPAP use as advised and significant improvements in sleep quality with CPAP use when comparing the baseline to six-month follow-up survey. Additionally, logistic regression was performed to determine if pre-pandemic sleep study results (apnea-hypopnea index and respiratory disturbance index) predicted self-reported CPAP use during the pandemic, though no association was found. Throughout the pandemic, sleep medicine patients improved their CPAP use as advised and reported significant improvements in sleep quality with CPAP use.</p>

	<p>Background: Aberrant motor behaviour or wandering refers to aimless movement without a specific purpose. Wandering is common in patients with dementia and leads to early institutionalization and caregivers&amp;amp;rsquo; burden. Non-pharmacological interventions should be also considered as a first-line solution for the wandering because current pharmacological treatment has serious side-effects. Methods: A cross-over randomised controlled trial (RCT) with 60 participants of all stages and different types of dementia was conducted in Greece. The sample was randomly assigned in 6 different groups of 10 participants each. Every intervention lasted for 5 days, and there were 2 days as a wash-out period. There was no drop-out rate. The measurements used were the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Addenbrooke&amp;amp;rsquo;s Cognitive Examination Revised (ACE-R), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Functional Rating Scale for Symptoms in Dementia (FRSSD), and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). The interventions that were evaluated were reminiscence therapy (RT), music therapy (MT), and physical exercise (PE). Results: NPI scores were reduced in the group receiving PE (p = 0.006). When MT (p = 0.018) follows PE, wandering symptoms are reduced further. RT should follow MT in order to reduce wandering more (p = 0.034). The same combination was effective for the caregivers&amp;amp;rsquo; burden as well; PE (p = 0.004), MT (p = 0.036), RT (p = 0.039). Conclusions: An effective combination that can reduce wandering symptoms in all stages and types of dementia was found: The best order was PH-MT-RT. The same combination in the same order reduced caregivers&amp;amp;rsquo; burden.</p>

                Rapid diversification is often observed when founding species invade isolated or newly formed habitats that provide ecological opportunity for adaptive radiation. However, most of the Earth’s diversity arose in diverse environments where ecological opportunities appear to be more constrained. Here, we present a striking example of a rapid radiation in...

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>A metanalysis identified regulator of G-protein signaling 6 (<I>RGS6</I>) as one of 23 loci with pleiotropic effects on four or more human psychiatric disorders. This finding is significant as it confirms/extends the findings of numerous other studies implicating RGS6 in CNS function and pathology. RGS6 is a highly conserved member of the RGS protein family whose cellular roles are likely affected by mRNA splicing and alternative domain inclusion/exclusion. Indeed, we previously identified multiple RGS6 splice variants predicted to produce 36 distinct protein isoforms containing either long (RGS6L) or short (RGS6S) N-terminal domains, an incomplete or intact GGL domain, and nine alternative C termini. Unfortunately, sequence similarities between the isoforms have made it difficult to confirm their individual existence and/or to determine their unique functions. Here, we developed three RGS6-specific antibodies that recognize all RGS6 protein isoforms (RGS6-fl), the N-terminus of RGS6L isoforms (RGS6-L), and an 18-amino acid alternate C-terminal sequence (RGS6-18). Using these antibodies, we demonstrate that RGS6L(+GGL) isoforms, predominating in both mouse (both sexes) CNS and peripheral tissues, are most highly expressed in the CNS. We further identify three novel RGS6 protein bands that are larger (61, 65, and 69-kDa) than the ubiquitously expressed 53- to 57-kDa RGS6L(+GGL) proteins. Importantly, we show that the 69-kDa protein is a brain-specific dephospho form of the 65-kDa band, the first identified phosphorylated RGS6 isoform. Together, these data begin to define the functional significance behind the complexity of <I>RGS6</I> gene processing and further clarifies RGS6&rsquo;s physiological roles by resolving tissue-specific RGS6 protein expression.</p>

                Cell-to-cell gene expression variability is an inherent feature of complex biological systems, such as immunity and development. Single-cell RNA sequencing is a powerful tool to quantify this heterogeneity, but it is prone to strong technical noise. In this article, we describe a step-by-step computational workflow that uses the BASiCS Bioconductor package to robustly quantify expression variability within and between known groups of cells (such as experimental conditions or cell types). BASiCS uses an integrated framework for data normalisation, technical noise quantification and downstream analyses, propagating statistical uncertainty across these steps. Within a single seemingly homogeneous cell population, BASiCS can identify highly variable genes that exhibit strong heterogeneity as well as lowly variable genes with stable expression. BASiCS also uses a probabilistic decision rule to identify changes in expression variability between cell populations, whilst avoiding confounding effects related to differences in technical noise or in overall abundance. Using a publicly available dataset, we guide users through a complete pipeline that includes preliminary steps for quality control, as well as data exploration using the scater and scran Bioconductor packages. The workflow is accompanied by a Docker image that ensures the reproducibility of our results.

                Lipid droplets (LDs) are the major lipid storage organelles of eukaryotic cells and together with mitochondria key regulators of cell bioenergetics. LDs communicate with mitochondria and other organelles forming “metabolic synapse” contacts to ensure that lipid supply occurs where and when necessary. Although transmission electron microscopy analysis allows an accurate and precise analysis of contacts, the characterization of a large number of cells and conditions can become a long-term process. In order to extend contact analysis to hundreds of cells and multiple conditions, we have combined confocal fluorescence microscopy with advanced image analysis methods. In this work, we have developed the ImageJ macro script ContactJ, a novel and straight image analysis method to identify and quantify contacts between LD and mitochondria in fluorescence microscopy images allowing the automatic analysis. This image analysis workflow combines colocalization and skeletonization methods, enabling the quantification of LD-mitochondria contacts together with a complete characterization of organelles and cellular parameters. The correlation and normalization of these parameters contribute to the complex description of cell behavior under different experimental energetic states. ContactJ is available here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5810874

                Background: The burden of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is increasing in low- and middle-income countries, including sub-Sahara Africa (SSA). However, awareness of and access to T2DM diagnosis and care remain low in SSA, leading to delayed treatment, early morbidity, and mortality. Particularly in rural settings with long distances to health care facilities, community-based care models may contribute to increased timely diagnosis and care. This scoping review aims to summarize and categorize existing models of community-based care for T2DM among non-pregnant adults in SSA, and to synthesize the evidence on acceptance, clinical outcomes, and engagement in care. Method and analysis: This review will follow the framework suggested by Arskey and O’Malley, which has been further refined by Levac et al. and the Joanna Briggs Institute. Electronic searches will be performed in Medline, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and Scopus, supplemented with backward and forward citation searches. We will include cohort studies, randomized trials and case-control studies that report cases of non-pregnant individuals diagnosed with T2DM in SSA who receive a substantial part of care in the community. Our outcomes of interest will be model acceptability, blood sugar control, end organ damage, and patient engagement in care. A narrative analysis will be conducted, and comparisons made between community-based and facility-based models, where within-study comparison is reported. Conclusion: Care for T2DM has become a global health priority. Community-based care may be an important add-on approach especially in populations with poor access to health care facilities. This review will inform policy makers and program implementers on different community-based models for care of T2DM in SSA, and critically appraise their acceptability and clinical outcomes. It will further identify evidence gaps and future research priorities in community-based T2DM care.

                We introduce the ProSGPV R package, which implements a variable selection algorithm based on second-generation p-values (SGPV) instead of traditional p-values. Most variable selection algorithms shrink point estimates to arrive at a sparse solution. In contrast, the ProSGPV algorithm accounts for the estimation uncertainty – via confidence intervals – in the selection process. This additional information leads to better inference and prediction performance in finite sample sizes. ProSGPV maintains good performance even in the high dimensional case where $p>n$, or when explanatory variables are highly correlated. Moreover, ProSGPV is a unifying algorithm that works with continuous, binary, count, and time-to-event outcomes. No cross-validation or iterative processes are needed and thus ProSGPV is very fast to compute. Visualization tools are available in this package for assessing the variable selection process. Here we present simulation studies and a real-world example to demonstrate ProSGPV’s inference and prediction performance in relation to the current standards in variable selection procedures.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Do Maya women have the chance to improve their quality of life? [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Maya families suffered greatly during the henequen industry in the Yucatan, but the lives of the Maya women at the time were perhaps worse than anywhere in the world. Changes in Maya body height over the 20th century were assessed in order to show secular changes. The use of the sexual dimorphism index (SDI) allowed for the evaluation of the living conditions prevailing during the existence of the henequen haciendas to the Mexican revolution and a gradual improvement of these conditions by the end of the 20th century. Methods: In 1994, 364 men and 320 women aged 20-98 years were studied in Merida, Yucatan, Mexico. They were divided into six age groups and by sex: 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69 and 70+ years. Stature for both sexes, and age at menarche for women were considered. SDI in stature was calculated to assess living conditions. Results: There were smaller (0.25 cm/10 years) changes in height in men than in women (0.9 cm/10 years) and no significant changes in acceleration of maturation. SDI results showed changes from 9.9 to 7.6, and this may indicate a constant, but very small improvement of living conditions. The age at menarche of women did not show statistically significant acceleration with age. Conclusions: In the colonial period of the late 19th century until the Mexican Revolution, women were worse off than men. Previous research has shown that when living conditions change, men always react faster than women, e.g. by lowering or increasing body height. Our study of the Maya population in the 20th century showed otherwise; female height increased more than male height. This may reflect that the living conditions of Maya men have not changed over the 20th century, but have improved for women.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The indigenous meaning of dysmenorrhea: using modified photovoice to document perspectives of traditional health practitioners (THPs) and indigenous knowledge holders (IKHs) [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Globally, health understanding and beliefs vary across sub-cultural groups, depending on geographical location. Increasingly, various parts of the world recognize these perspectives to offer culturally sensitive healthcare services at primary level. Understanding the indigenous perspectives of dysmenorrhea meaning from the custodians of knowledge holders may add to the value of literature that may be used to advocate humanized culturally sensitive healthcare. This article aimed to explore and describe the perspectives regarding the meaning of indigenous dysmenorrhea among Batlokwa traditional health practitioners (THPs) and indigenous knowledge holders (IKHs). Methods: A qualitative, explorative study with a modified photovoice design, which included photographs, interviews and lekgotla discussion was employed to engage THPs and IKHs residing in Botlokwa Limpopo province, South Africa. Initially, a purposive sampling technique was used to select the participants, followed by snowball sampling. The participants themselves analyzed the photographs and described their meaning during individual interview using the acronym “PHOTO”. The researchers employed thematic analysis of interviews and Lekgotla discussion, in which themes were identified, formulated and analyzed from the codified data set. Results: In total, eight women participated in the photovoice study. The findings showed that indigenous understanding of dysmenorrhea stems from the African belief about health and illness with special emphasis on importance of holistic meaning. To the THPs and IKHs dysmenorrhea was a broad and integrated trend of a normal or abnormal process of illness that occurs periodically during menstruation. Conclusions: The THP’s and IKH’s indigenous meaning of dysmenorrhea reflects physical, mental, emotional, social, environmental, political and economic dimensions. Therefore, dysmenorrhea should be understood from a holistic approach. With appropriate partnerships and processes in place, this knowledge may be well represented in dominant healthcare systems and health research.

                Background: The lack of real-time monitoring is one of the reasons for the lack of awareness among drivers of their dangerous driving behavior. This work aims to develop a driver profiling system where a smartphone’s built-in sensors are used alongside machine learning algorithms to classify different driving behaviors. Methods: We attempt to determine the optimal combination of smartphone sensors such as accelerometer, gyroscope, and GPS in order to develop an accurate machine learning algorithm capable of identifying different driving events (e.g. turning, accelerating, or braking). Results: In our preliminary studies, we encountered some difficulties in obtaining consistent driving events, which had the potential to add “noise” to the observations, thus reducing the accuracy of the classification. However, after some pre-processing, which included manual elimination of extraneous and erroneous events, and with the use of the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), we have been able to distinguish different driving events with an accuracy of about 95%. Conclusions: Based on the results of preliminary studies, we have determined that proposed approach is effective in classifying different driving events, which in turn will allow us to determine driver’s driving behavior.

                Averrhoa bilimbi is a fast-growing tree widely found in countries of tropical Asia. Due to easy accessibility and traditional knowledge, various parts of this plant are adopted as folk medicine and a natural health remedy. Recently, beneficial effects of bilimbi in combating obesity including its potential antihyperlipidemic and hypoglycemic activities have been discovered. This paper reports the successive extraction, partitioning and fractionation of bioactive compounds from the leaf of bilimbi that corresponds to brown adipocyte activation. In this study, the bilimbi crude ethanolic extract underwent bioassay-guided partitioning with increading polarity namely n-hexane (n-Hex), ethyl acetate (EtOAc), n-butanol (n-BuOH) and aqueous (H2O). The n-hexane partition extract exhibited highest brown adipogenesis potential via adipomyocytes differentiation. Further fractionation of this active partition extract yielded 10 fractions. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS was used to analyse the chemical constituents of active fractions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">DeLTA 2.0: A deep learning pipeline for quantifying single-cell spatial and temporal dynamics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Owen M. O’Connor, Razan N. Alnahhas, Jean-Baptiste Lugagne, Mary J. Dunlop</p>

Improvements in microscopy software and hardware have dramatically increased the pace of image acquisition, making analysis a major bottleneck in generating quantitative, single-cell data. Although tools for segmenting and tracking bacteria within time-lapse images exist, most require human input, are specialized to the experimental set up, or lack accuracy. Here, we introduce DeLTA 2.0, a purely Python workflow that can rapidly and accurately analyze images of single cells on two-dimensional surfaces to quantify gene expression and cell growth. The algorithm uses deep convolutional neural networks to extract single-cell information from time-lapse images, requiring no human input after training. DeLTA 2.0 retains all the functionality of the original version, which was optimized for bacteria growing in the mother machine microfluidic device, but extends results to two-dimensional growth environments. Two-dimensional environments represent an important class of data because they are more straightforward to implement experimentally, they offer the potential for studies using co-cultures of cells, and they can be used to quantify spatial effects and multi-generational phenomena. However, segmentation and tracking are significantly more challenging tasks in two-dimensions due to exponential increases in the number of cells. To showcase this new functionality, we analyze mixed populations of antibiotic resistant and susceptible cells, and also track pole age and growth rate across generations. In addition to the two-dimensional capabilities, we also introduce several major improvements to the code that increase accessibility, including the ability to accept many standard microscopy file formats as inputs and the introduction of a Google Colab notebook so users can try the software without installing the code on their local machine. DeLTA 2.0 is rapid, with run times of less than 10 minutes for complete movies with hundreds of cells, and is highly accurate, with error rates around 1%, making it a powerful tool for analyzing time-lapse microscopy data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Characterizing non-exponential growth and bimodal cell size distributions in fission yeast: An analytical approach</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Chen Jia, Abhyudai Singh, Ramon Grima</p>

Unlike many single-celled organisms, the growth of fission yeast cells within a cell cycle is not exponential. It is rather characterized by three distinct phases (elongation, septation, and reshaping), each with a different growth rate. Experiments also showed that the distribution of cell size in a lineage can be bimodal, unlike the unimodal distributions measured for the bacterium <i>Escherichia coli</i>. Here we construct a detailed stochastic model of cell size dynamics in fission yeast. The theory leads to analytic expressions for the cell size and the birth size distributions, and explains the origin of bimodality seen in experiments. In particular, our theory shows that the left peak in the bimodal distribution is associated with cells in the elongation phase, while the right peak is due to cells in the septation and reshaping phases. We show that the size control strategy, the variability in the added size during a cell cycle, and the fraction of time spent in each of the three cell growth phases have a strong bearing on the shape of the cell size distribution. Furthermore, we infer all the parameters of our model by matching the theoretical cell size and birth size distributions to those from experimental single-cell time-course data for seven different growth conditions. Our method provides a much more accurate means of determining the size control strategy (timer, adder or sizer) than the standard method based on the slope of the best linear fit between the birth and division sizes. We also show that the variability in added size and the strength of size control in fission yeast depend weakly on the temperature but strongly on the culture medium. More importantly, we find that stronger size homeostasis and larger added size variability are required for fission yeast to adapt to unfavorable environmental conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Simulated poaching affects global connectivity and efficiency in social networks of African savanna elephants—An exemplar of how human disturbance impacts group-living species</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Maggie Wiśniewska, Ivan Puga-Gonzalez, Phyllis Lee, Cynthia Moss, Gareth Russell, Simon Garnier, Cédric Sueur</p>

Selective harvest, such as poaching, impacts group-living animals directly through mortality of individuals with desirable traits, and indirectly by altering the structure of their social networks. Understanding the relationship between disturbance-induced, structural network changes and group performance in wild animals remains an outstanding problem. To address this problem, we evaluated the immediate effect of disturbance on group sociality in African savanna elephants—an example, group-living species threatened by poaching. Drawing on static association data from ten free-ranging groups, we constructed one empirically based, population-wide network and 100 virtual networks; performed a series of experiments ‘poaching’ the oldest, socially central or random individuals; and quantified the immediate change in the theoretical indices of network connectivity and efficiency of social diffusion. Although the social networks never broke down, targeted elimination of the socially central conspecifics, regardless of age, decreased network connectivity and efficiency. These findings hint at the need to further study resilience by modeling network reorganization and interaction-mediated socioecological learning, empirical data permitting. The main contribution of our work is in quantifying connectivity together with global efficiency in multiple social networks that feature the sociodemographic diversity likely found in wild elephant populations. The basic design of our simulation makes it adaptable for hypothesis testing about the consequences of anthropogenic disturbance or lethal management on social interactions in a variety of group-living species with limited, real-world data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Ictal wavefront propagation in slices and simulations with conductance-based refractory density model</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Anton V. Chizhov, Dmitry V. Amakhin, Elena Yu. Smirnova, Aleksey V. Zaitsev</p>

The mechanisms determining ictal discharge (ID) propagation are still not clear. In the present study, we aimed to examine these mechanisms in animal and mathematical models of epileptiform activity. Using double-patch and extracellular potassium ion concentration recordings in rat hippocampal-cortical slices, we observed that IDs moved at a speed of about 1 mm/s or less. The mechanisms of such slow propagation have been studied with a mathematical, conductance-based refractory density (CBRD) model that describes the GABA- and glutamatergic neuronal populations’ interactions and ion dynamics in brain tissue. The modeling study reveals two main factors triggerring IDs: (i) increased interneuronal activity leading to chloride ion accumulation and a consequent depolarizing GABAergic effect and (ii) the elevation of extracellular potassium ion concentration. The local synaptic transmission followed by local potassium ion extrusion and GABA receptor-mediated chloride ion accumulation underlies the ID wavefront’s propagation. In contrast, potassium ion diffusion in the extracellular space is slower and does not affect ID’s speed. The short discharges, constituting the ID, propagate much faster than the ID front. The accumulation of sodium ions inside neurons due to their hyperactivity and glutamatergic currents boosts the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pump, which terminates the ID. Knowledge of the mechanism of ID generation and propagation contributes to the development of new treatments against epilepsy.

                <p>by Alexander J. Bryer, Tyler Reddy, Edward Lyman, Juan R. Perilla</p>

Enveloped viruses are enclosed by a lipid membrane inside of which are all of the components necessary for the virus life cycle; viral proteins, the viral genome and metabolites. Viral envelopes are lipid bilayers that adopt morphologies ranging from spheres to tubes. The envelope is derived from the host cell during viral replication. Thus, the composition of the bilayer depends on the complex constitution of lipids from the host-cell’s organelle(s) where assembly and/or budding of the viral particle occurs. Here, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of authentic, asymmetric HIV-1 liposomes are used to derive a unique level of resolution of its full-scale structure, mechanics and dynamics. Analysis of the structural properties reveal the distribution of thicknesses of the bilayers over the entire liposome as well as its global fluctuations. Moreover, full-scale mechanical analyses are employed to derive the global bending rigidity of HIV-1 liposomes. Finally, dynamical properties of the lipid molecules reveal important relationships between their 3D diffusion, the location of lipid-rafts and the asymmetrical composition of the envelope. Overall, our simulations reveal complex relationships between the rich lipid composition of the HIV-1 liposome and its structural, mechanical and dynamical properties with critical consequences to different stages of HIV-1’s life cycle.

The clinical outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection varies widely between individuals. Machine learning models can support decision making in healthcare by assessing fatality risk in patients that do not yet show severe signs of COVID-19. Most predictive models rely on static demographic features and clinical values obtained upon hospitalization. However, time-dependent biomarkers associated with COVID-19 severity, such as antibody titers, can substantially contribute to the development of more accurate outcome models. Here we show that models trained on immune biomarkers, longitudinally monitored throughout hospitalization, predicted mortality and were more accurate than models based on demographic and clinical data upon hospital admission. Our best-performing predictive models were based on the temporal analysis of anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike IgG titers, white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil and lymphocyte counts. These biomarkers, together with C-reactive protein and blood urea nitrogen levels, were found to correlate with severity of disease and mortality in a time-dependent manner. Shapley additive explanations of our model revealed the higher predictive value of day post-symptom onset (PSO) as hospitalization progresses and showed how immune biomarkers contribute to predict mortality. In sum, we demonstrate that the kinetics of immune biomarkers can inform clinical models to serve as a powerful monitoring tool for predicting fatality risk in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, underscoring the importance of contextualizing clinical parameters according to their time post-symptom onset.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Ultrafast population coding and axo-somatic compartmentalization</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Chenfei Zhang, David Hofmann, Andreas Neef, Fred Wolf</p>

Populations of cortical neurons respond to common input within a millisecond. Morphological features and active ion channel properties were suggested to contribute to this astonishing processing speed. Here we report an exhaustive study of ultrafast population coding for varying axon initial segment (AIS) location, soma size, and axonal current properties. In particular, we studied their impact on two experimentally observed features 1) precise action potential timing, manifested in a wide-bandwidth dynamic gain, and 2) high-frequency boost under slowly fluctuating correlated input. While the density of axonal channels and their distance from the soma had a very small impact on bandwidth, it could be moderately improved by increasing soma size. When the voltage sensitivity of axonal currents was increased we observed ultrafast coding and high-frequency boost. We conclude that these computationally relevant features are strongly dependent on axonal ion channels’ voltage sensitivity, but not their number or exact location. We point out that ion channel properties, unlike dendrite size, can undergo rapid physiological modification, suggesting that the temporal accuracy of neuronal population encoding could be dynamically regulated. Our results are in line with recent experimental findings in AIS pathologies and establish a framework to study structure-function relations in AIS molecular design.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Diversity of synaptic protein complexes as a function of the abundance of their constituent proteins: A modeling approach</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Marcell Miski, Bence Márk Keömley-Horváth, Dorina Rákóczi Megyeriné, Attila Csikász-Nagy, Zoltán Gáspári</p>

The postsynaptic density (PSD) is a dense protein network playing a key role in information processing during learning and memory, and is also indicated in a number of neurological disorders. Efforts to characterize its detailed molecular organization are encumbered by the large variability of the abundance of its constituent proteins both spatially, in different brain areas, and temporally, during development, circadian rhythm, and also in response to various stimuli. In this study we ran large-scale stochastic simulations of protein binding events to predict the presence and distribution of PSD complexes. We simulated the interactions of seven major PSD proteins (NMDAR, AMPAR, PSD-95, SynGAP, GKAP, Shank3, Homer1) based on previously published, experimentally determined protein abundance data from 23 different brain areas and 43 patients (altogether 524 different simulations). Our results demonstrate that the relative ratio of the emerging protein complexes can be sensitive to even subtle changes in protein abundances and thus explicit simulations are invaluable to understand the relationships between protein availability and complex formation. Our observations are compatible with a scenario where larger supercomplexes are formed from available smaller binary and ternary associations of PSD proteins. Specifically, Homer1 and Shank3 self-association reactions substantially promote the emergence of very large protein complexes. The described simulations represent a first approximation to assess PSD complex abundance, and as such, use significant simplifications. Therefore, their direct biological relevance might be limited but we believe that the major qualitative findings can contribute to the understanding of the molecular features of the postsynapse.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Controlling gene expression timing through gene regulatory architecture</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Md Zulfikar Ali, Robert C. Brewster</p>

Gene networks typically involve the regulatory control of multiple genes with related function. This connectivity enables correlated control of the levels and timing of gene expression. Here we study how gene expression timing in the single-input module motif can be encoded in the regulatory DNA of a gene. Using stochastic simulations, we examine the role of binding affinity, TF regulatory function and network size in controlling the mean first-passage time to reach a fixed fraction of steady-state expression for both an auto-regulated TF gene and a target gene. We also examine how the variability in first-passage time depends on these factors. We find that both network size and binding affinity can dramatically speed up or slow down the response time of network genes, in some cases predicting more than a 100-fold change compared to that for a constitutive gene. Furthermore, these factors can also significantly impact the fidelity of this response. Importantly, these effects do not occur at “extremes” of network size or binding affinity, but rather in an intermediate window of either quantity.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The evolutionary maintenance of Lévy flight foraging</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Winston Campeau, Andrew M. Simons, Brett Stevens</p>

Lévy flight is a type of random walk that characterizes the behaviour of many natural phenomena studied across a multiplicity of academic disciplines; within biology specifically, the behaviour of fish, birds, insects, mollusks, bacteria, plants, slime molds, t-cells, and human populations. The Lévy flight foraging hypothesis states that because Lévy flights can maximize an organism’s search efficiency, natural selection should result in Lévy-like behaviour. Empirical and theoretical research has provided ample evidence of Lévy walks in both extinct and extant species, and its efficiency across models with a diversity of resource distributions. However, no model has addressed the maintenance of Lévy flight foraging through evolutionary processes, and existing models lack ecological breadth. We use numerical simulations, including lineage-based models of evolution with a distribution of move lengths as a variable and heritable trait, to test the Lévy flight foraging hypothesis. We include biological and ecological contexts such as population size, searching costs, lifespan, resource distribution, speed, and consider both energy accumulated at the end of a lifespan and averaged over a lifespan. We demonstrate that selection often results in Lévy-like behaviour, although conditional; smaller populations, longer searches, and low searching costs increase the fitness of Lévy-like behaviour relative to Brownian behaviour. Interestingly, our results also evidence a bet-hedging strategy; Lévy-like behaviour reduces fitness variance, thus maximizing geometric mean fitness over multiple generations.

We introduce a framework for end-to-end integrative modeling of 3D single-cell multi-channel fluorescent image data of diverse subcellular structures. We employ stacked conditional <i>β</i>-variational autoencoders to first learn a latent representation of cell morphology, and then learn a latent representation of subcellular structure localization which is conditioned on the learned cell morphology. Our model is flexible and can be trained on images of arbitrary subcellular structures and at varying degrees of sparsity and reconstruction fidelity. We train our full model on 3D cell image data and explore design trade-offs in the 2D setting. Once trained, our model can be used to predict plausible locations of structures in cells where these structures were not imaged. The trained model can also be used to quantify the variation in the location of subcellular structures by generating plausible instantiations of each structure in arbitrary cell geometries. We apply our trained model to a small drug perturbation screen to demonstrate its applicability to new data. We show how the latent representations of drugged cells differ from unperturbed cells as expected by on-target effects of the drugs.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Occludin is a target of Src kinase and promotes lipid secretion by binding to BTN1a1 and XOR</a></h4>

Lipid droplets (LDs) have increasingly been recognized as an essential organelle for eukaryotes. Although the biochemistry of lipid synthesis and degradation is well characterized, the regulation of LD dynamics, including its formation, maintenance, and secretion, is poorly understood. Here, we report that mice lacking <i>Occludin</i> (<i>Ocln</i>) show defective lipid metabolism. We show that LDs were larger than normal along its biogenesis and secretion pathway in <i>Ocln</i> null mammary cells. This defect in LD size control did not result from abnormal lipid synthesis or degradation; rather, it was because of secretion failure during the lactation stage. We found that OCLN was located on the LD membrane and was bound to essential regulators of lipid secretion, including BTN1a1 and XOR, in a C-terminus–dependent manner. Finally, OCLN was a phosphorylation target of Src kinase, whose loss causes lactation failure. Together, we demonstrate that <i>Ocln</i> is a downstream target of Src kinase and promotes LD secretion by binding to BTN1a1 and XOR.

Genome editing can introduce designed mutations into a target genomic site. Recent research has revealed that it can also induce various unintended events such as structural variations, small indels, and substitutions at, and in some cases, away from the target site. These rearrangements may result in confounding phenotypes in biomedical research samples and cause a concern in clinical or agricultural applications. However, current genotyping methods do not allow a comprehensive analysis of diverse mutations for phasing and mosaic variant detection. Here, we developed a genotyping method with an on-target site analysis software named Determine Allele mutations and Judge Intended genotype by Nanopore sequencer (DAJIN) that can automatically identify and classify both intended and unintended diverse mutations, including point mutations, deletions, inversions, and <i>cis</i> double knock-in at single-nucleotide resolution. Our approach with DAJIN can handle approximately 100 samples under different editing conditions in a single run. With its high versatility, scalability, and convenience, DAJIN-assisted multiplex genotyping may become a new standard for validating genome editing outcomes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Measuring the motives of informal entrepreneurs [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background - Handling non-observed activities pose major challenges to the governments and other stakeholders. Non-observed activities refer to underground activities, illegal activities, informal sector and any other activities that result in goods or services consumed by the household. The impact of these non-observed activities shows that the volume of people involved in the informal sector will rapidly increase. Informal economic activities are technically illegal yet are not intended as antisocial,   thereby remaining acceptable to many individuals within the society. This research aimed to identify the factors that lead to entrepreneurial necessity and opportunity.   Methods – The data of 51 respondents who were employed as informal entrepreneurs in Klang Valley areas in Malaysia was collected with the use of a questionnaire and convenient and proportionate sampling techniques. The data were analysed using SPSS software.   Results – The two primary drivers of informal entrepreneurial activity were necessity and opportunity. The inability to find a formal job was an example of being driven by necessity. Meanwhile, individuals that are driven by opportunity chose to work independently in these informal sectors. Between necessity and engagement, refinement acted as a mediator. Often, necessity and opportunity do not automatically translate into successful entrepreneurship; further refinement is required in terms of market potential, technology usage, location preferences, and capital requirements. Improved refinement results in increased entrepreneurial engagement.  Conclusions - The role and contribution of the informal sector entrepreneurship in economic development need to be evaluated and not just observed as an opportunity for individuals who choose this type of career. Therefore, further research is required in a wider variety of contexts to evaluate whether the same remains true in different populations. The results of this study can be useful for the government to set policies to encourage the transition of informal to formal entrepreneurships in Malaysia.

                I propose two suggestions on Stojcic et al.’s (2020) Study 3, which examined ethnic differences in individualism between Chinese Mongolian and Han Chinese cultures in China. The authors analyzed the names of all residents in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China and found that the percentages of common names among Chinese Mongolians were smaller than those among Han Chinese. The authors concluded that Chinese Mongolians are more independent than Han Chinese. However, two questions remain unanswered. First, although the authors analyzed the names of people in all age groups together and did not analyze the names by birth year, how was the effect of time controlled? Second, although the authors treated name indices, which have been used as group-level indicators in previous research, as individual-level indicators, how did the authors confirm whether name indices can be used as individual-level indicators? Addressing these two questions would contribute to a better understanding of ethnic differences in individualism in China.

While parvalbumin interneurons reduce locomotor encoding, cholinergic interneurons strengthen their interactions with projecting neurons.

                One year after SARS-CoV-2 infection, despite declining antibody titers, Balachandran et al report a disease severity associated maintenance of antibody functions and memory B cell magnitude. The convalescent serum could neutralise most VOCs, and the initial CD4 T cell levels predict the antibody neutralisation breadth and memory B cell durability.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/inpress.rss">Mutations that adapt SARS-CoV-2 to mink or ferret do not increase fitness in the human airway.</a></h4>

              
                Here Zhou et al. show that common mink/ferret adaptations of SARS-CoV-2 enhance the use of the otherwise poorly used ferret ACE2 receptor, while weakening virus replication in human airway cells. However, many SARS-CoV-2 variants can intrinsically enter cells via ferret ACE2 implying these hosts may be more susceptible to novel strains.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Hippocampal sharp wave-ripples and the associated sequence replay emerge from structured synaptic interactions in a network model of area CA3</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal place cells are activated sequentially as an animal explores its environment. These activity sequences are internally recreated ('replayed'), either in the same or reversed order, during bursts of activity (sharp wave-ripples; SWRs) that occur in sleep and awake rest. SWR-associated replay is thought to be critical for the creation and maintenance of long-term memory. In order to identify the cellular and network mechanisms of SWRs and replay, we constructed and simulated a data-driven model of area CA3 of the hippocampus. Our results show that the chain-like structure of recurrent excitatory interactions established during learning not only determines the content of replay, but is essential for the generation of the SWRs as well. We find that bidirectional replay requires the interplay of the experimentally confirmed, temporally symmetric plasticity rule, and cellular adaptation. Our model provides a unifying framework for diverse phenomena involving hippocampal plasticity, representations, and dynamics, and suggests that the structured neural codes induced by learning may have greater influence over cortical network states than previously appreciated.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Genetic basis and dual adaptive role of floral pigmentation in sunflowers</a></h4>

              
                Variation in floral displays, both between and within species, has been long known to be shaped by the mutualistic interactions that plants establish with their pollinators. However, increasing evidence suggests that abiotic selection pressures influence floral diversity as well. Here, we analyse the genetic and environmental factors that underlie patterns of floral pigmentation in wild sunflowers. While sunflower inflorescences appear invariably yellow to the human eye, they display extreme diversity for patterns of ultraviolet pigmentation, which are visible to most pollinators. We show that this diversity is largely controlled by <i>cis</i>-regulatory variation affecting a single MYB transcription factor, HaMYB111, through accumulation of ultraviolet (UV)-absorbing flavonol glycosides in ligules (the ‘petals’ of sunflower inflorescences). Different patterns of ultraviolet pigments in flowers are strongly correlated with pollinator preferences. Furthermore, variation for floral ultraviolet patterns is associated with environmental variables, especially relative humidity, across populations of wild sunflowers. Ligules with larger ultraviolet patterns, which are found in drier environments, show increased resistance to desiccation, suggesting a role in reducing water loss. The dual role of floral UV patterns in pollinator attraction and abiotic response reveals the complex adaptive balance underlying the evolution of floral traits.

                Attempts to minimize scarring remain among the most difficult challenges facing surgeons, despite the use of optimal wound closure techniques. Previously, we reported improved healing of dermal excisional wounds in circadian clock neuronal PAS domain 2 (<i>Npas2</i>)-null mice. In this study, we performed high-throughput drug screening to identify a compound that downregulates <i>Npas2 </i>activity. The hit compound (Dwn1) suppressed circadian <i>Npas2</i> expression, increased murine dermal fibroblast cell migration, and decreased collagen synthesis <i>in vitro</i>. Based on the <i>in vitro</i> results, Dwn1 was topically applied to iatrogenic full-thickness dorsal cutaneous wounds in a murine model. The Dwn1-treated dermal wounds healed faster with favorable mechanical strength and developed less granulation tissue than the controls. The expression of type I collagen, Tgfb1, and a-smooth muscle actin was significantly decreased in Dwn1-treated wounds, suggesting that hypertrophic scarring and myofibroblast differentiation are attenuated by Dwn1 treatment. NPAS2 may represent an important target for therapeutic approaches to optimal surgical wound management.

                Cell-surface receptors control how cells respond to their environment. Many cell-surface receptors recycle from endosomes to the plasma membrane via a recently discovered pathway, which includes sorting-nexin SNX17, Retriever, WASH and CCC complexes. Here, using mammalian cells, we discover that PIKfyve and its upstream PI3-kinase VPS34 positively regulate this pathway. VPS34 produces PI3P, which is the substrate for PIKfyve to generate PI3,5P<sub>2</sub>. We show that PIKfyve controls recycling of cargoes including integrins, receptors that control cell migration. Furthermore, endogenous PIKfyve colocalizes with SNX17, Retriever, WASH and CCC complexes on endosomes. Importantly, PIKfyve inhibition results displacement of Retriever and CCC from endosomes. In addition, we show that recruitment of SNX17 is an early step and requires VPS34. These discoveries suggest that VPS34 and PIKfyve coordinate an ordered pathway to regulate recycling from endosomes and suggest how PIKfyve functions in cell migration.

                Clonally transmissible cancers are tumour lineages that are transmitted between individuals via the transfer of living cancer cells. In marine bivalves, leukaemia-like transmissible cancers, called hemic neoplasia (HN), have demonstrated the ability to infect individuals from different species. We performed whole-genome sequencing in eight warty venus clams that were diagnosed with HN, from two sampling points located more than 1000 nautical miles away in the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea Coasts of Spain. Mitochondrial genome sequencing analysis from neoplastic animals revealed the coexistence of haplotypes from two different clam species. Phylogenies estimated from mitochondrial and nuclear markers confirmed this leukaemia originated in striped venus clams and later transmitted to clams of the species warty venus, in which it survives as a contagious cancer. The analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear gene sequences supports all studied tumours belong to a single neoplastic lineage that spreads in the Seas of Southern Europe.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Identification of differential hypothalamic DNA methylation and gene expression associated with sexual partner preferences in rams</a></h4>

              
                The sheep is a valuable model to test whether hormone mechanisms that sexually differentiate the brain underlie the expression of sexual partner preferences because as many as 8% of rams prefer same-sex partners. Epigenetic factors such as DNA methylation act as mediators in the interaction between steroid hormones and the genome. Variations in the epigenome could be important in determining morphological or behavior differences among individuals of the same species. In this study, we explored DNA methylation differences in the hypothalamus of male oriented rams (MORs) and female oriented rams (FORs). We employed reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) to generate a genome-wide map of DNA methylation and RNA-Seq to profile the transcriptome.  We found substantial DNA methylation and gene expression differences between FORs and MORs.  Although none of the differentially methylated genes yielded significant functional terms directly associated with sex development, there were three differentially expressed genes that have been associated previously with sexual behaviors. We hypothesize that these differences are involved in the phenotypic variation in ram sexual partner preferences, whereas future studies will have to find the specific mechanisms. Our results add an intriguing new dimension to sheep behavior that should be useful for further understanding epigenetic and transcriptomic involvement.

                Increased needs in mobile phone communications have raised successive generations (G) of wireless technologies, which could differentially affect biological systems. We have assessed how a single 2h head-only exposure to a 4G long term evolution (LTE)-1800 MHz electromagnetic field (EMF) impacts on the microglial space coverage and the electrophysiological neuronal activity in the primary auditory cortex (ACx) in rats submitted to an acute neuroinflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide. The mean specific absorption rate in the ACx was 0.5 W/kg. Multiunit recording revealed that LTE-EMF triggered reduction in the response strength to pure tones and to natural vocalizations, together with an increase in acoustic threshold in the low and medium frequencies. Iba1 immunohistochemistry showed no change in the area covered by microglia cell bodies and processes. In healthy rats, the same LTE-exposure induced no change in response strength and acoustic threshold. Our data indicate that an acute neuroinflammation sensitize neuronal responses to LTE-EMF, which leads to an altered processing of acoustic stimuli in the ACx.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Bayesian stroke modeling details sex biases in the white matter substrates of aphasia</a></h4>

              
                Ischemic cerebrovascular events often lead to aphasia. Previous work provided hints that such strokes may affect women and men in distinct ways. Women tend to suffer strokes with more disabling language impairment, even if the lesion size is comparable to men. In 1,401 patients, we isolated data-led representations of anatomical lesion patterns and hand-tailored a Bayesian analytical solution to carefully model the degree of sex divergence in predicting language outcomes ~3 months after stroke. We located lesion-outcome effects in the left-dominant language network that highlight the ventral pathway as a core lesion focus across different tests of language performance. We provide newly detailed evidence for sex-specific brain-behavior associations in the domain-general networks associated with cortico-subcortical pathways, with unique contributions of the fornix in women and cingular fiber bundles in men. Our collective findings suggest diverging white matter substrates in how stroke causes language deficits in women and men. Clinically acknowledging such sex disparities has the potential to improve personalized treatment for stroke patients worldwide.

                Starting with the classical biophysical Morris-Lecar model of neuronal excitability, we introduce a functional analog of the Hutchinson equation initially obtained for population dynamics with delayed negative feedback. It is shown that the resulting equation with a fixed time delay qualitatively reproduces the dynamics of the original model upon direct current stimulation, preserving both the initial type of neuronal excitability and biophysically realistic spike shape within a wide range of the delay values. If the delay becomes very small (2 ms or less), the simplified delay-based model exhibits a distinct transition from the 1st to the 2nd excitability type.

                Anxiety over perceived threats triggers avoidance behavior, but the underlying neural circuit mechanism remains poorly understood. Taking hints from the deep connection between anxiety and predator defense, we examined the role of the anterior hypothalamic nucleus (AHN), a critical node in the predator defense network, in anxiety-related behaviors. By recording Ca2+ transients in behaving mice, we found that activity of AHN GABAergic (AHNVgat+) neurons showed individually stable increases when animals approached unfamiliar objects in an open field (OF) or explored the open arm of an elevated plus-maze (EPM). Moreover, AHNVgat+ neuron activity foreshadowed behavioral retreats and correlated with object and open-arm avoidance. Crucially, exploration-triggered optogenetic inhibition of AHNVgat+ neurons dramatically reduced avoidance behaviors. Furthermore, retrograde viral tracing identified the ventral subiculum (vSub) of the hippocampal formation as a significant input to AHNVgat+ neurons in driving avoidance behaviors. Thus, the activity of the hippocampal-hypothalamic pathway promotes idiosyncratic anxiety-related behavioral avoidance.

                Oxytocin and vasopressin are pleiotropic neuropeptides with well-established roles in the regulation of social behavior and homeostatic functions. Their structural similarity and conserved functions in vertebrate social behavior suggest that neurohypophyseal peptides may represent a single integrative neuromodulatory system, yet both peptides subserve sexually dimorphic functions at the behavioral level. The extent to which central oxytocin and vasopressin systems share similar circuit architecture has not been previously studied. Sex differences in the central circuitry of the oxytocin and vasopressin systems may underlie sex-variant behaviors, but it is currently unknown whether the synaptic inputs or outputs of each neuropeptidergic system vary across males and females. To close this gap, we generated quantitative anterograde and retrograde maps of the paraventricular oxytocin and vasopressin systems in mice. We observed that both oxytocinergic and vasopressinergic neurons share highly similar synaptic inputs that are sex-conserved. Projection patterns differed across systems and showed sex differences, more pronounced in the vasopressin neurons. Together our data represent the first comparative study of oxytocin and vasopressin input-output architecture highlighting how these neurohypopheseal peptides can play complementary and overlapping roles that are sex-dependent.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Criticality and network structure drive emergent oscillations in a stochastic whole-brain model</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the relation between the structure of brain networks and its functions is a fundamental open question. Simple models of neural activity based on real anatomical networks have proven effective in describing features of whole-brain spontaneous activity when tuned at their critical point. In this work, we show that indeed structural networks are a crucial ingredient in the emergence of synchronized oscillations in a whole-brain stochastic model at criticality. We study such model in the mean-field limit, providing an analytical understanding of the associated first-order phase transition, arising from the presence of a bistable region in the parameters space. Then, we derive the power spectrum in the linear noise approximation and we show that, in the mean-field limit, no global oscillations emerge. Finally, by adding back an underlying brain network structure with homeostatic normalization, we numerically show how the bi-stability region is disrupted and concomitantly a synchronized phase with maximal dynamic range is observed. Hence, both the structure of brain networks and criticality are fundamental in driving the collective coordinated responses and maximal sensitivity of whole-brain stochastic models.

                Cognitive control involves flexibly combining multiple sensory inputs with task-dependent goals during decision making. Several tasks have been proposed to examine cognitive control, including Stroop, Eriksen-Flanker, and the Multi-source interference task. Because these tasks have been studied independently, it remains unclear whether the neural signatures of cognitive control reflect abstract control mechanisms or specific combinations of sensory and behavioral aspects of each task. To address this question, here we recorded invasive neurophysiological signals from 16 subjects and directly compared the three tasks against each other. Neural activity patterns in the theta and high-gamma frequency bands differed between incongruent and congruent conditions, revealing strong modulation by conflicting task demands. These neural signals were specific to each task, generalizing within a task but not across tasks. These results highlight the complex interplay between sensory inputs, motor outputs, and task demands and argue against a universal and abstract representation of conflict.

	<p>Cognitive Remediation Training (CRT) in schizophrenia has made great strides since its introduction in the 1990s. CRT was developed with the aim of improving the everyday functioning of individuals living with cognitive impairment. MEDLINE, PsychINFO, and Google Scholar were searched to extract peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials to produce the current review article. The aim of the present review is to summarize CRT effects on addressing cognitive changes in patients undergoing CRT as defined by the Cognitive Remediation Experts Workshop and to describe the areas of greatest impact in specific cognitive domains. Another area of this review aims to summarize the modalities of intervention (paper and pencil; computerized; home bound), the persistence of improvements, and their generalization to other domains of functioning. Finally, this review delineates barriers for wider dissemination of CRT, such as the transfer of research findings into clinical everyday practice and future developments of CRT.</p>

	<p>The olfactory bulb (OB) plays a key role in the processing of olfactory information. A large body of research has shown that OB volumes correlate with olfactory function, which provides diagnostic and prognostic information in olfactory dysfunction. Still, the potential value of the OB shape remains unclear. Based on our clinical experience we hypothesized that the shape of the OB predicts olfactory function, and that it is linked to olfactory loss, age, and gender. The aim of this study was to produce a classification of OB shape in the human brain, scalable to clinical and research applications. Results from patients with the five most frequent causes of olfactory dysfunction (n = 192) as well as age/gender-matched healthy controls (n = 77) were included. Olfactory function was examined in great detail using the extended &amp;amp;ldquo;Sniffin&amp;amp;rsquo; Sticks&amp;amp;rdquo; test. A high-resolution structural T2-weighted MRI scan was obtained for all. The planimetric contours (surface in mm2) of OB were delineated manually, and then all surfaces were added and multiplied to obtain the OB volume in mm3. OB shapes were outlined manually and characterized on a selected slice through the posterior coronal plane tangential to the eyeballs. We looked at OB shapes in terms of convexity and defined two patterns/seven categories based on OB contours: convex (olive, circle, and plano-convex) and non-convex (banana, irregular, plane, and scattered). Categorization of OB shapes is possible with a substantial inter-rater agreement (Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s Kappa = 0.73). Our results suggested that non-convex OB patterns were significantly more often observed in patients than in controls. OB shapes were correlated with olfactory function in the whole group, independent of age, gender, and OB volume. OB shapes seemed to change with age in healthy subjects. Importantly, the results indicated that OB shapes were associated with certain causes of olfactory disorders, i.e., an irregular OB shape was significantly more often observed in post-traumatic olfactory loss. Our study provides evidence that the shape of the OB can be used as a biomarker for olfactory dysfunction.</p>

	<p>Research has shown that dyslexia and attention deficit (hyperactivity) disorder (AD(H)D) are characterized by specific neuroanatomical and neurofunctional differences in the auditory cortex. These neurofunctional characteristics in children with ADHD, ADD and dyslexia are linked to distinct differences in music perception. Group-specific differences in the musical performance of patients with ADHD, ADD and dyslexia have not been investigated in detail so far. We investigated the musical performance and neurophysiological correlates of 21 adolescents with dyslexia, 19 with ADHD, 28 with ADD and 28 age-matched, unaffected controls using a music performance assessment scale and magnetoencephalography (MEG). Musical experts independently assessed pitch and rhythmic accuracy, intonation, improvisation skills and musical expression. Compared to dyslexic adolescents, controls as well as adolescents with ADHD and ADD performed better in rhythmic reproduction, rhythmic improvisation and musical expression. Controls were significantly better in rhythmic reproduction than adolescents with ADD and scored higher in rhythmic and pitch improvisation than adolescents with ADHD. Adolescents with ADD and controls scored better in pitch reproduction than dyslexic adolescents. In pitch improvisation, the ADD group performed better than the ADHD group, and controls scored better than dyslexic adolescents. Discriminant analysis revealed that rhythmic improvisation and musical expression discriminate the dyslexic group from controls and adolescents with ADHD and ADD. A second discriminant analysis based on MEG variables showed that absolute P1 latency asynchrony |R-L| distinguishes the control group from the disorder groups best, while P1 and N1 latencies averaged across hemispheres separate the control, ADD and ADHD groups from the dyslexic group. Furthermore, rhythmic improvisation was negatively correlated with auditory-evoked P1 and N1 latencies, pointing in the following direction: the earlier the P1 and N1 latencies (mean), the better the rhythmic improvisation. These findings provide novel insight into the differences between music processing and performance in adolescents with and without neurodevelopmental disorders. A better understanding of these differences may help to develop tailored preventions or therapeutic interventions.</p>

	<p>The search for a biological marker predicting the future failure or success of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) remains highly challenging for patients with treatment-resistant depression. Evidence suggests that Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), a protein known to be involved in brain plasticity mechanisms, can play a key role in both the clinical efficacy of ECT and the pathophysiology of depressive disorders. We hypothesized that mature BDNF (mBDNF), an isoform of BDNF involved in the neural plasticity and survival of neural networks, might be a good candidate for predicting the efficacy of ECT. Total BDNF (tBDNF) and mBDNF levels were measured in 23 patients with severe treatment-resistant depression before (baseline) they received a course of ECT. More precisely, tBDNF and mBDNF measured before ECT were compared between patients who achieved the criteria of remission after the ECT course (remitters, n = 7) and those who did not (non-remitters, n = 16). We found that at baseline, future remitters displayed significantly higher mBDNF levels than future non-remitters (p = 0.04). No differences were observed regarding tBDNF levels at baseline. The multiple logistic regression model controlled for age and sex revealed that having a higher baseline mBDNF level was significantly associated with future remission after ECT sessions (odd ratio = 1.38; 95% confidence interval = 1.07&amp;amp;ndash;2.02, p = 0.04). Despite the limitations of the study, current findings provide additional elements regarding the major role of BDNF and especially the mBDNF isoform in the clinical response to ECT in major depression.</p>

	<p>Background: Epilepsy surgery failure is not uncommon, with several explanations having been proposed. In this series, we detail cases of epilepsy surgery failure subsequently attributed to insular involvement. Methods: We retrospectively identified patients investigated at the epilepsy monitoring units of two Canadian tertiary care centers (2004&amp;amp;ndash;2020). Included patients were adults who had undergone epilepsy surgeries with recurrence of seizures post-operatively and who were subsequently determined to have an insular epileptogenic focus. Clinical, electrophysiological, neuroimaging, and surgical data were synthesized. Results: We present 14 patients who demonstrated insular epileptic activity post-surgery-failure as detected by intracranial EEG, MEG, or seizure improvement after insular resection. Seven patients had manifestations evoking possible insular involvement prior to their first surgery. Most patients (8/14) had initial surgeries targeting the temporal lobe. Seizure recurrence ranged from the immediate post-operative period to one year. The main modality used to determine insular involvement was MEG (8/14). Nine patients underwent re-operations that included insular resection; seven achieved a favorable post-operative outcome (Engel I or II). Conclusions: Our series suggests that lowering the threshold for suspecting insular epilepsy may be necessary to improve epilepsy surgery outcomes. Detecting insular epilepsy post-surgery-failure may allow for re-operations which may lead to good outcomes.</p>

	<p>Neurobiological measures underlying aggressive behavior have gained attention due to their potential to inform risk assessment and treatment interventions. Aberrations in responsivity of the autonomic nervous system and electrophysiological responses to arousal-inducing stimuli have been related to emotional dysregulation and aggressive behavior. However, studies have often been performed in community samples, using tasks that induce arousal but not specifically depict aggression. In this study, we examined differences in psychophysiological (i.e., heart rate, respiratory sinus arrhythmia, skin conductance level) and electrophysiological responses (i.e., P3, late positive potential, mu suppression) to aggressive versus neutral scenes in a sample of 118 delinquent young adults and 25 controls (all male, aged 18&amp;amp;ndash;27). With respect to group differences, we only found significant higher SCL reactivity during the task in the delinquent group compared to controls, but this was irrespective of condition (aggressive and neutral interactions). Within the delinquent group, we also examined associations between the neurobiological measures and reactive and proactive aggression. No significant associations were found. Therefore, although we found some indication of emotional dysregulation in these delinquent young adults, future studies should further elucidate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying emotional dysregulation in relation to different types of aggression.</p>

	<p>Acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) has a high risk of recurrence, particularly in the early stage. Our study aimed to assess the clinical characteristics and risk factors of in-hospital ischaemic recurrence in AIS patients in different periods. This study was a retrospective, single-center analysis. The patients were divided into two stages based on their admission time. The primary endpoint was recurrent stroke during hospitalization. In total, 978 patients in Stage 1 and 1047 patients in Stage 2 were included in this study. The in-hospital recurrence rate in Stage 1 was 5.9%, while that in Stage 2 was 4.0% (p = 0.046). A recurrence rate reduction mainly occurred in the minor stroke and large-artery atherosclerosis (LAA) stroke patients. Infection was an independent risk factor despite amelioration by antiplatelet therapy (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Diabetes patients also had a higher risk of in-hospital ischaemic recurrence among the minor stroke and large-artery atherosclerosis patients. A positive attitude towards antiplatelet therapy failed to completely halt recurrence of the disease. In conclusion, the rate of in-hospital ischaemic recurrence in AIS patients showed a decreasing trend over time, especially in the minor stroke and large-artery atherosclerosis stroke patients. Infection and diabetes were associated with a higher risk of stroke recurrence.</p>

                Background: In Malaysia, residential electricity consumption has shown a steady upward trend year by year. Due to this increase in energy consumption, it is important to forecast the value of electricity consumption until the year 2032 to accommodate the electricity demand. Methods: Three exponential smoothing models were compared to identify the most appropriate model in forecasting electricity consumption. The three exponential smoothing models are Simple, Holt, and Brown exponential smoothing. To identify the most appropriate model, a mean absolute percentage (MAPE) was chosen. Results: The results show that Holt’s exponential smoothing has the best performance with the lowest MAPE score of 2.299. Conclusions: Consequently, it was found that electricity consumption would substantially increase from 2647 ktoe (kilotonne of oil equivalent) to 3873 ktoe within the period of 2019 to 2032.

                In this study, we present 77 transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of human brainstem tissue from 11 cases of late onset Parkinson’s disease (PD). The tissues were fixed, embedded, sectioned, and stained for TEM application. In addition, we present 11 images from autopsy specimens of 1 case of human poliomyelitis infection as positive controls and 12 images from 8 cases of autopsy specimens of other conditions as negative controls. In the TEM images of the PD cases there were cytoplasmic inclusion bodies consisting of virus-like particles (VLP) 30 nm in diameter that were associated with endoplasmic reticulum membranes.  In the nuclei of the PD neurons there were VLP ranging from 40 nm to 50 nm in diameter. In the poliomyelitis cases, similar particles as were observed in PD which were interpreted to be poliomyelitis virus particles. In the negative controls one case was identified which showed similar VLP (Figure 1, controls).  A Lewy body was found in this “control” case (Figure 10) suggesting that this was an undiagnosed case of PD. Cytoplasmic ribosomes measuring approximately 17 nm were observed in the control neurons.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Changing the method of consent to increase the numbers of cadaveric donors in Saudi Arabia: the autonomy paradox [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In Saudi Arabia, the gap between the demand for and availability of organs persists, with a total of 13,731 patients on the waiting list in 2019. Family refusal is a major obstacle limiting donation since their consent must be obtained prior to the retrieval of organs. The cause of family refusal is mainly due to their lack of knowledge of their loved ones' wish to become a donor. This paper aimed to compare three systems of obtaining consent in terms of effectiveness, respect for autonomy, and the cultural role of families in Saudi Arabia to ensure feasibility and effectiveness in increasing the number of donors. Policy alternatives and implications: The consent systems include informed consent, presumed consent, and mandated choice. The mandated choice policy might be the optimal solution since it is the most likely to balance the respect for individual autonomy and the cultural role of families in Saudi Arabia. Conclusions and recommendations: Mandated choice ensures the respect of autonomy while influencing the next of kin's decision to donate the organs. Additionally, a recommendation to decision makers is to utilize the Tawakkalna app to send alerts to the next of kin when a user registers as a donor with the users' consent. Moreover, more research should be dedicated to investigating the Saudi public's current culture and perceptions towards organ donation to ensure feasibility.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effects of Antigravity Treadmill Training on Gait and Balance in Patients with Diabetic Polyneuropathy: A Randomized Controlled Trial [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) is the most prevalent consequence of diabetes mellitus, and it has a significant impact on the patient's health. This study aims to evaluate effects of antigravity treadmill training on gait and balance in patients with DPN. Methods: The study included 45 males with type 2 diabetes who were randomly assigned to one of two groups: the experimental group (n=23) or the control group (n=22). For a period of 12 weeks, the experimental group received antigravity treadmill training (75% weight bearing, 30 min per session, three times per week) combined with traditional physical therapy. During the same time period, the control group received only traditional physical therapy. The Biodex Balance System was used to assess postural stability indices, while the GAITRite Walkway System was used to assess spatiotemporal gait parameters. All measurements were obtained before and at the end of the study after 12 weeks of treatment. Results: The mean values of all measured variables improved significantly in both groups (P<0.05), with the experimental group showing significantly greater improvements than the control group. The post-treatment gait parameters (i.e., step length, step time, double support time, velocity, and cadence) were 61.3 cm, 0.49 sec, 0.25 sec, 83.09 cm/sec, and 99.78 steps/min as well as 56.14 cm, 0.55 sec, 0.29 sec, 75.73 cm/sec, and 88.14 steps/min for the experimental and control group, respectively. The post-treatment overall stability index was 0.32 and 0.70 for the experimental and control group, respectively. Conclusions: Antigravity treadmill training in combination with traditional physical therapy appears to be superior to traditional physical therapy alone in terms of gait and balance training. As a result, the antigravity treadmill has been found to be an effective device for the rehabilitation of DPN patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A feasibility study of training in a local community aimed upon health promotion with special emphasis on musculoskeletal health effects [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: To minimize fracture risk, multimodal training regimens are recommended. However, their effectiveness in community settings remains uncertain. This study evaluated the feasibility of 19-weeks of multimodal training in a local community center with emphasis on musculoskeletal health in postmenopausal women. Methods: In a controlled trial, 28 postmenopausal women (53-68-years-old) were assigned to a multimodal training group (MMT, n=15) or a control group (CON, n=13). The training consisted of high- and odd-impact, resistance and balance-coordination training 1-2 hours weekly. The outcomes were attendance rate, regional and total bone mineral density (BMD), bone mineral content (BMC), bone turnover markers (BTM), body composition, functional muscle strength and power, and dynamic balance. All were determined at baseline and after 19 weeks of training. BTM was assessed after three weeks. Results: Overall, 22(79%) participants (MMT, n=9; CON, n=13) completed the study, and the mean attendance rate for MMT was 65.5% of the maximum sessions (2) offered. Only right trochanter BMD increased (p<0.05) by 1.0±1.1% in MMT, which was higher(p<0.05) than CON. While whole-body BMC was not changed at 19 weeks from baseline in MMT, it decreased (p<0.05) in CON resulting in a significant difference (p<0.05) in whole-body BMC delta values between the two groups. Compared to baseline, body fat percentage(%BF), fat mass(FM), and visceral adipose tissue (VAT)-mass and -volume were decreased (p<0.01) in MMT, and were larger (p<0.05) than CON. No significant changes were observed in BTM, muscle strength and power, and dynamic balance after 19 weeks. Conclusions: Nineteen weeks of multimodal training 1-2 hours per week in a local community had a health-enhancing effect on %BF, FM, and VAT, whereas the musculoskeletal health impact was modest. We hypothesize that the reason might be too low training volume and frequency and supposedly too low musculoskeletal training intensity for some participants. Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05164679 (21/12/2021).

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: ASI intervention on a child with autism in Saudi Arabia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Ayres Sensory Integration (ASI) is widely employed by occupational therapists working with clients who experience challenges in sensory integration, including those with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, there is a dearth of research examining the feasibility of ASI outside of Western nations. This study documented the barriers associated with ASI in Saudi Arabia and assessed whether the intervention could improve process and participation skills. Methods: A pre-test/post-test case study design was used. The participant was a 4-year-old girl with ASD from Saudi Arabia. Data were gathered on sensory processing, motor skills, and participation in activities of daily living. The study used semi-structured interviews and assessments (Sensory Integration and Praxis Tests, the Sensory Processing Measure-Preschool, and the Peabody Developmental Motor Scale-2) to develop goals, identify outcome measures, and plan an ASI intervention. Results: Despite the limited availability of resources (e.g., toys, treatment spaces) and Arabic measures, improvements were observed on motor and sensory tasks and in occupational performance. Conclusion: ASI that adheres to the ASI fidelity tool can be of value for Saudi Arabian children with ASD. Additionally, the study provides a stepping-stone to further research for occupational therapists in Saudi Arabia working with children with ASD.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Association of smoking status with hospitalisation for COVID-19 compared with other respiratory viruses a year previous: a case-control study at a single UK National Health Service trust [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: It is unclear whether smoking increases the risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation. We first examined the association of smoking status with hospitalisation for COVID-19 compared with hospitalisation for other respiratory viral infections a year previous. Second, we examined the concordance between smoking status recorded on the electronic health record (EHR) and the contemporaneous medical notes. Methods: This case-control study enrolled adult patients (446 cases and 211 controls) at a single National Health Service trust in London, UK. The outcome variable was type of hospitalisation (COVID-19 vs. another respiratory virus a year previous). The exposure variable was smoking status (never/former/current smoker). Logistic regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic position and comorbidities were performed. The study protocol and analyses were pre-registered in April 2020 on the Open Science Framework. Results: Current smokers had lower odds of being hospitalised with COVID-19 compared with other respiratory viruses a year previous (ORadj=0.55, 95% CI=0.31-0.96, p=.04). There was no significant association among former smokers (ORadj=1.08, 95% CI=0.72-1.65, p=.70). Smoking status recorded on the EHR (compared with the contemporaneous medical notes) was incorrectly recorded for 168 (79.6%) controls (χ2(3)=256.5, p=<0.001) and 60 cases (13.5%) (χ2(3)=34.2, p=<0.001). Conclusions: In a single UK hospital trust, current smokers had reduced odds of being hospitalised with COVID-19 compared with other respiratory viruses a year previous, although it is unclear whether this association is causal. Targeted post-discharge recording of smoking status may account for the greater EHR-medical notes concordance observed in cases compared with controls.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A deep learning segmentation strategy that minimizes the amount of manually annotated images [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Deep learning has revolutionized the automatic processing of images. While deep convolutional neural networks have demonstrated astonishing segmentation results for many biological objects acquired with microscopy, this technology's good performance relies on large training datasets. In this paper, we present a strategy to minimize the amount of time spent in manually annotating images for segmentation. It involves using an efficient and open source annotation tool, the artificial increase of the training dataset with data augmentation, the creation of an artificial dataset with a conditional generative adversarial network and the combination of semantic and instance segmentations. We evaluate the impact of each of these approaches for the segmentation of nuclei in 2D widefield images of human precancerous polyp biopsies in order to define an optimal strategy.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Clinical inflammatory biomarkers associated with the tumor stage of gastric cancer: retrospective analysis of a Hospital in Peru during the years 2018–2020 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Gastric cancer is a disease with a high rate of morbidity and mortality in the world. Objective: To determine which clinical inflammatory biomarkers are associated with the tumor stage of gastric cancer of the oncology service of the Hospital María Auxiliadora in Lima, Peru, during the years 2018-2020. Methodology: Observational, analytical, cross-sectional and retrospective study. There was a sample of 110 patients. The PR values ​​were obtained from the absolute frequencies of the variables: serum albumin, Platelet-Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR) and Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR). Results: The average age was 63,727±13.85. 55.45% were female. The most frequent histopathological type was intestinal adenocarcinoma with 62.73%. In the bivariate analysis, an association was found between INL (PR:6.88 CI95% 2.36-20 p<0.001), IPL (PR:2.55 CI95% 1.68-3.86 p<0.001) and serum albumin (PR:3.16 CI95% 1.91-5.24 p<0.001) in the advanced clinical stage. The multivariate analysis found a relationship between INL and clinical stage (PR:4.11 CI95% 1.25-13.49 p=0.020) Conclusion: INL is an independent predictive factor in relation to the clinical stage of gastric cancer in this study.

                Rolotti et al. combine calcium imaging and electrophysiology to study somatic-dendritic dynamics across behavior and network states in mouse hippocampus. Sharp-wave ripples modulate dendritic activity, inducing long-term changes in soma-dendrite coupling. Reinforcement alters ripple recruitment and dissociates dendritic-somatic spatial tuning. Ripples may facilitate dendritic reorganization to stabilize hippocampal computations.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A phospho-switch at Acinus-Serine437 controls autophagic responses to Cadmium exposure and neurodegenerative stress</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal health depends on quality control functions of autophagy, but mechanisms regulating neuronal autophagy are poorly understood. Previously, we showed that in Drosophila starvation-independent quality control autophagy is regulated by Acinus and the Cdk5-dependent phosphorylation of its serine<sup>437</sup> (Nandi et al., 2017). Here, we identify the phosphatase that counterbalances this activity and provides for the dynamic nature of Acinus-S437 phosphorylation. A genetic screen identified six phosphatases that genetically interacted with an Acinus gain-of-function model. Among these, loss of function of only one, the PPM-type phosphatase Nil (CG6036), enhanced pS437-Acinus levels. Cdk5-dependent phosphorylation of Acinus serine<sup>437</sup> in <i>nil</i><sup>1</sup> animals elevates neuronal autophagy and reduces the accumulation of polyQ proteins in a Drosophila Huntington's disease model. Consistent with previous findings that Cd<sup>2+</sup> inhibits PPM-type phosphatases, Cd<sup>2+</sup>-exposure elevated Acinus-serine<sup>437</sup> phosphorylation which was necessary for increased neuronal autophagy and protection against Cd<sup>2+</sup>-induced cytotoxicity. Together, our data establish the Acinus-S437 phospho-switch as critical integrator of multiple stress signals regulating neuronal autophagy.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The NDNF-like factor Nord is a Hedgehog-induced extracellular BMP modulator that regulates Drosophila wing patterning and growth</a></h4>

              
                Hedgehog (Hh) and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) pattern the developing <i>Drosophila</i> wing by functioning as short- and long-range morphogens, respectively. Here, we show that a previously unknown Hh-dependent mechanism fine-tunes the activity of BMPs. Through genome-wide expression profiling of the <i>Drosophila</i> wing imaginal discs, we identify <i>nord</i> as a novel target gene of the Hh signaling pathway. Nord is related to the vertebrate Neuron Derived Neurotrophic Factor (NDNF) involved in Congenital Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism and several types of cancer. Loss- and gain-of-function analyses implicate Nord in the regulation of wing growth and proper crossvein patterning. At the molecular level, we present biochemical evidence that Nord is a secreted BMP-binding protein and localizes to the extracellular matrix. Nord binds to Decapentaplegic (Dpp) or the heterodimer Dpp-Glass bottom boat (Gbb) to modulate their release and activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Nord is a dosage-depend BMP modulator, where low levels of Nord promote and high levels inhibit BMP signaling. Taken together, we propose that Hh-induced Nord expression fine tunes both the range and strength of BMP signaling in the developing <i>Drosophila</i> wing.

                We developed an image-computable observer model of the initial visual encoding that operates on natural image input, based on the framework of Bayesian image reconstruction from the excitations of the retinal cone mosaic. Our model extends previous work on ideal observer analysis and evaluation of performance beyond psychophysical discrimination, takes into account the statistical regularities of the visual environment, and provides a unifying framework for answering a wide range of questions regarding the visual front end. Using the error in the reconstructions as a metric, we analyzed variations of the number of different photoreceptor types on human retina as an optimal design problem. In addition, the reconstructions allow both visualization and quantification of information loss due to physiological optics and cone mosaic sampling, and how these vary with eccentricity. Furthermore, in simulations of color deficiencies and interferometric experiments, we found that the reconstructed images provide a reasonable proxy for modeling subjects' percepts. Lastly, we used the reconstruction-based observer for the analysis of psychophysical threshold, and found notable interactions between spatial frequency and chromatic direction in the resulting spatial contrast sensitivity function. Our method is widely applicable to experiments and applications in which the initial visual encoding plays an important role.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A human-based multi-gene signature enables quantitative drug repurposing for metabolic disease</a></h4>

              
                Insulin resistance (IR) contributes to the pathophysiology of diabetes, dementia, viral infection, and cardiovascular disease. Drug repurposing (DR) may identify treatments for IR; however, barriers include uncertainty whether in vitro transcriptomic assays yield quantitative pharmacological data, or how to optimise assay design to best reflect in vivo human disease. We developed a clinical-based human tissue IR signature by combining lifestyle-mediated treatment responses (&gt;500 human adipose and muscle biopsies) with biomarkers of disease status (fasting IR from &gt;1200 biopsies). The assay identified a chemically diverse set of &gt;130 positively acting compounds, highly enriched in true positives, that targeted 73 proteins regulating IR pathways. Our multi-gene RNA assay score reflected the quantitative pharmacological properties of a set of epidermal growth factor receptor-related tyrosine kinase inhibitors, providing insight into drug target specificity; an observation supported by deep learning-based genome-wide predicted pharmacology. Several drugs identified are suitable for evaluation in patients, particularly those with either acute or severe chronic IR.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Repeated origins, widespread gene flow, and allelic interactions of target-site herbicide resistance mutations</a></h4>

              
                Causal mutations and their frequency in agricultural fields are well-characterized for herbicide resistance. However, we still lack understanding of their evolutionary history: the extent of parallelism in the origins of target-site resistance (TSR), how long these mutations persist, how quickly they spread, and allelic interactions that mediate their selective advantage. We addressed these questions with genomic data from 18 agricultural populations of common waterhemp (<i>Amaranthus tuberculatus</i>), which we show to have undergone a massive expansion over the past century, with a contemporary effective population size (N<sub>e</sub>) estimate of 8x10<sup>7</sup>. We found variation at seven characterized TSR loci, two of which had multiple amino acid substitutions, and three of which were common. These three common resistance variants show parallelism in their mutational origins, with gene flow having shaped their distribution across the landscape. Allele age estimates supported a strong role of adaptation from <i>de novo </i>mutations, with a median allele age of 30 suggesting that most resistance alleles arose soon after the onset of herbicide use. However, resistant lineages varied in both their age and evidence for selection over two different timescales, implying considerable heterogeneity in the forces that govern their persistence. The evolutionary history of TSR has also been shaped by both intra- and inter-locus allelic interactions. We report a signal of extended haplotype competition between two common TSR alleles, and extreme linkage with genome-wide alleles with known functions in resistance adaptation. Together, this work reveals a remarkable example of spatial parallel evolution in a metapopulation, with important implications for the management of herbicide resistance.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Emergence of a geometric pattern of cell fates from tissue-scale mechanics in the Drosophila eye</a></h4>

              
                Pattern formation of biological structures involves the arrangement of different types of cells in an ordered spatial configuration. In this study, we investigate the mechanism of patterning the <i>Drosophila</i> eye epithelium into a precise triangular grid of photoreceptor clusters called ommatidia. Previous studies had led to a long-standing biochemical model whereby a reaction-diffusion process is templated by recently formed ommatidia to propagate a molecular prepattern across the eye. Here, we find that the templating mechanism is instead, mechanochemical in origin; newly born columns of differentiating ommatidia serve as a template to spatially pattern flows that move epithelial cells into position to form each new column of ommatidia. Cell flow is generated by a source and sink, corresponding to narrow zones of cell dilation and contraction respectively, that straddle the growing wavefront of ommatidia. The newly formed lattice grid of ommatidia cells are immobile, deflecting and focusing the flow of other cells. Thus, the self-organization of a regular pattern of cell fates in an epithelium is mechanically driven.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A qnr-plasmid allows aminoglycosides to induce SOS in Escherichia coli</a></h4>

              
                The plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes have been shown to promote high-level bacterial resistance to fluoroquinolone antibiotics, potentially leading to clinical treatment failures. In <i>Escherichia coli</i>, sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations (sub-MICs) of the widely used fluoroquinolones are known to induce the SOS response. Interestingly, the expression of several PMQR <i>qnr</i> genes is controlled by the SOS master regulator, LexA. During the characterization of a small <i>qnrD</i>-plasmid carried in <i>E. coli,</i> we observed that the aminoglycosides become able to induce the SOS response in this species, thus leading to the elevated transcription of <i>qnrD</i>. Our findings show that induction of the SOS response is due to nitric oxide (NO) accumulation in presence of sub-MIC of aminoglycosides. We demonstrated that the NO accumulation is driven by two plasmid genes, ORF3 and ORF4, whose products act at two levels. ORF3 encodes a putative flavin adenine dinucleotide (<i>FAD)</i>-binding oxidoreductase which helps NO synthesis, while ORF4 codes for a putative fumarate and nitrate reductase (<i>FNR)</i>-type transcription factor, related to an O<sub>2</sub>-responsive regulator of <i>hmp</i> expression, able to repress the Hmp-mediated NO detoxification pathway of <i>E. coli</i><i>. </i>Thus, this discovery, that other major classes of antibiotics may induce the SOS response could have worthwhile implications for antibiotic stewardship efforts in preventing the emergence of resistance.

                Voltage-gated Cav Ca2+ channels are critical for the development and mature function of the nervous system. Variants in the CACNA2D4 gene encoding the a2d-4 auxiliary subunit of these channels are associated with neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. a2d-4 is prominently expressed in the retina and is crucial for vision, but extra-retinal functions of a2d-4 have not been investigated. Here, we sought to fill this gap by analyzing the behavioral phenotypes of a2d-4 knockout (KO) mice. a2d-4 KO mice (both males and females) exhibited significant impairments in prepulse inhibition that were unlikely to result from the modestly elevated auditory brainstem response thresholds.  Whereas a2d-4 KO mice of both sexes were hyperactive in various assays, only females showed impaired motor learning/coordination in the rotarod assay. Female but not male a2d-4 KO mice exhibited anxiolytic and anti-depressive behaviors in the elevated plus maze and tail suspension tests, respectively. Our results reveal an unexpected role for a2d-4 in cognitive and motor function and identify a2d-4 KO mice as a novel model for studying the pathophysiology associated with CACNA2D4 variants.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Activation of the dorsal septum increases alcohol consumption in male C57BL/6J mice.</a></h4>

              
                Binge drinking is a common pattern of excessive alcohol consumption associated with Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) and unraveling the neurocircuitry that promotes this type of drinking is critical to the development of novel therapeutic interventions. The septal region was once a focal point of alcohol research yet has seen limited study over the last decade in relation to binge drinking. Numerous studies point to involvement of the dorsal septum (dSep) in excessive drinking and withdrawal, but few studies have manipulated this region in the context of binge drinking behavior. The present experiments were primarily designed to determine the effect of chemogenetic manipulation of the dSep on binge-like alcohol drinking in male and female C57BL/6J mice. Mice received bilateral infusion of AAVs harboring hM4Di, hM3Dq, or mCherry into the dSep and subjects were challenged with systemic administration of clozapine-N-oxide (CNO; 3 mg/kg) or vehicle (saline; 0.9%) in the context of binge-like alcohol consumption, locomotor activity, and sucrose drinking. CNO-mediated activation (hM3Dq) of the dSep resulted in a significant increase in binge-like alcohol consumption, locomotor activity, and sucrose intake in male mice. DSep activation promoted sucrose drinking in female mice, but alcohol intake and locomotor activity were unaffected. Conversely, silencing (hM4Di) of the dSep modestly decreased locomotor activity in males and did not influence alcohol or sucrose intake in either sex. Lastly, CNO was without effect in mCherry-expressing control groups. These data support a role for the dSep in promoting excessive, binge-like drinking behavior in a sex-dependent fashion and suggests a broad role for the region in the modulation of locomotor activity as well as general appetitive behavior such as sucrose drinking.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Absence of the fragile X mental retardation protein alters response patterns to sounds in the auditory midbrain</a></h4>

              
                Among the different autism spectrum disorders, Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause of mental retardation. Sensory and especially auditory hypersensitivity is a key symptom in patients, which is well mimicked in the Fmr1 -/- mouse model. However, the physiological mechanisms underlying FXS acoustic hypersensitivity in particular remain poorly understood. Here, we categorized spike response patterns to pure tones of different frequencies and intensities from neurons in the Inferior Colliculus (IC), a central integrator in the ascending auditory pathway. Based on this categorization we analyzed differences in response patterns between IC neurons of WT and Fmr1 -/- mice. Our results report broadening of frequency tuning, an increased firing in response to monaural as well as binaural stimuli, an altered balance of excitation-inhibition, and reduced response latencies, all expected features of acoustic hypersensitivity. Furthermore, we were surprised to notice that all neuron response types in Fmr1 -/- mice displayed enhanced offset-rebound activity outside their excitatory frequency response area. These results provide evidence that the loss of Fmr1 not only increases spike responses in IC neurons similar to auditory brainstem neurons, but also changes response patterns such as offset spiking. One can speculate this to be an underlying aspect of the receptive language problems associated with Fragile X syndrome.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Glycation renders alpha-synuclein oligomeric strain and modulates microglia activation</a></h4>

              
                Alpha-synuclein is known to involve in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's diseases (PD) and related disorders. However, it is unclear how its aggregation causes neuronal degeneration and neuroinflammation. Due to intrinsic disorder nature, -synuclein produces a large number of structural ensembles and produces diverse aggregation intermediates. The post-translational modifications add a new layer of complexity to the aggregation mechanism. Recently, it has been demonstrated that glycation of -synuclein restricts into oligomeric intermediates and causes neuronal toxicity. However, the understanding of aggregation mechanism, dopaminergic neuronal death, and neuroinflammation by the glycated -synuclein is yet to be elucidated. The present study aims to address how glycated synuclein differs in oligomerization and neuroinflammation. The glycation of -synuclein perturbs the aggregation kinetics and prevents the fibrilization through the alteration of surface charges of N-terminal domain residues which prevents membrane binding and seed amplification mechanism. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis of BV2 cells treated with glycated oligomers provides evidence of alteration of endocytic mechanism, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammatory cascade. Here, we show that -synuclein oligomers strongly bind to TLR2 and activate the TLR2 mediated signaling. However, glycated -synuclein oligomers impair the TLR2 binding and compromise TLR2 signaling. Interestingly, we also find that the glycated -synuclein oligomers favor NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated neuroinflammation compared to non-glycated -synuclein oligomers. In conclusion, our findings suggest that microglia response towards -synuclein is conformation-specific and glycated oligomers can contribute to neurodegeneration differently.

                Neuropeptides are contained in nearly every neuron in the central nervous system and can be released from somatodendritic sites as well as from nerve terminals. Cholecystokinin (CCK), among the most abundant neuropeptides in the brain, is expressed in the majority of midbrain dopamine neurons. Here we report that ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons release CCK from somatodendritic regions, where it triggers long-term potentiation of GABAergic synapses. The somatodendritic release occurs with trains of action potentials or prolonged but modest depolarization and is dependent on synaptotagmin 7 and T-type Ca2+ channels. Depolarization-induced LTP is blocked by the CCK2R antagonist, LY225910, and mimicked by exogenously added CCK. To test the behavioral role of CCK, we infused it into the mouse VTA. Ca2+ imaging in vivo demonstrated that infused CCK reduced dopamine cell signals during fasted food consumption. Moreover, local infusion of CCK also inhibited food consumption and decreased distance traveled in an open field test. Together our experiments introduce somatodendritic neuropeptide release as a previously unknown feedback regulator of VTA dopamine cell excitability and dopamine-related behaviors.

                Background: Neural prosthetics often use intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) for sensory restoration. To restore natural and functional feedback, we must first understand how stimulation parameters influence the recruitment of neural populations. ICMS waveform asymmetry modulates the spatial activation of neurons around an electrode at 10 Hz; however, it is unclear how asymmetry may differentially modulate population activity at frequencies typically employed in the clinic (e.g. 100 Hz). Objective: We hypothesized that stimulation waveform asymmetry would differentially modulate preferential activation of certain neural populations, and the differential population activity would be frequency-dependent. Methods: We quantified how asymmetric stimulation waveforms delivered at 10 Hz or 100 Hz for 30s modulated spatiotemporal activity of cortical layer II/III pyramidal neurons using in vivo two-photon and mesoscale calcium imaging in anesthetized mice. Asymmetry is defined in terms of the ratio of the leading phase to the return phase of charge-balanced cathodal- and anodal-first waveforms. Results: Neurons within 40-60 micron of the electrode display stable stimulation-induced activity indicative of direct activation, which was independent of waveform asymmetry. The stability of 72% of activated neurons and the preferential activation of 20-90 % of neurons depended on waveform asymmetry. Additionally, this asymmetry-dependent activation of different neural populations was associated with differential progression of population activity. Specifically, neural activity increased over time for some waveforms at 10 Hz, but decreased more at 100 Hz than other waveforms. Conclusion: These data demonstrate that at frequencies commonly used for sensory restoration, stimulation waveform alters the pattern of activation of different but overlapping populations of excitatory neurons. The impact of these waveform specific responses on the activation of different subtypes of neurons as well as sensory perception merits further investigation.

                Neural population dynamics, presumably fundamental computational units in the brain, provide a key framework for understanding information processing in the sensory, cognitive, and motor functions. However, neural population dynamics is not explicitly related to the conventional analytic framework for single-neuron activity, i.e., representational models that analyze neuronal modulations associated with cognitive and motor parameters. In this study, we applied a recently developed state-space analysis to incorporate the representational models into the dynamic model in combination with these parameters. We compared neural population dynamics between continuous and categorical task parameters during two visual recognition tasks, using the datasets originally designed for a single-neuron approach. We successfully extracted neural population dynamics in the regression subspace, which represent modulation dynamics for both continuous and categorical task parameters with reasonable temporal characteristics. Furthermore, we combined the classical optimal-stimulus analysis paradigm for the single-neuron approach (i.e., stimulus identified as maximum neural responses) into the dynamic model, and found that the most prominent modulation dynamics at the lower dimension were derived from these optimal responses. Thus, our approach provides a unified framework for incorporating knowledge acquired with the single-neuron approach into the dynamic model as a standard procedure for describing neural modulation dynamics in the brain.

                Meningeal lymphatic vessels (MLVs) contribute to waste product elimination and immune surveillance in brain tissues. MLVs were identified in the dorsal and caudo-basal regions of the dura mater, where they ensure the clearance of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Whether MLVs exist in the complex anterior part of the murine and human skull, and how they connect with the glymphatic system and extracranial lymphatic vasculature remained unclear. Here, we generated three-dimensional (3D) maps of MLV drainage by light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) imaging of mouse whole-head preparations following fluorescent OVA-A555 tracer injections into the CSF. In humans, we performed real-time magnetic resonance vessel wall imaging (MR-VWI) after systemic gadobutrol injections. We observed a conserved 3D-anatomy of MLVs in mice and humans, and we discovered an extended anterior network around the dural cavernous sinus including multiple capillary beds and exit routes through the foramina of emissary veins. MR-VWI may provide a diagnostic tool for patients with CSF drainage defects and neurological diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Maternal immune activation accelerates puberty initiation and alters mechanical allodynia in male and female C57BL6/J mice.</a></h4>

              
                The mechanisms that link maternal immune activation (MIA) with the onset of neurodevelopmental disorders remain largely unclear. Accelerated puberty is also associated with a heightened risk for psychopathology in later life but there is a dearth of evidence on the impacts of maternal infection on pubertal timing. We examined the effects of MIA on reproductive development, mechanical allodynia, and sensorimotor gating in juvenile, adolescent, and adult male and female mice. Moreover, we investigated hypothalamic neural markers associated with the reproductive and stress axes. Finally, we tested the mitigating effects of environmental enrichment (EE), which has clinical relevancy in human rehabilitation settings. Our results show that administration of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) on gestational day 12.5 led to early preputial separation, vaginal openings, and age of first estrus in offspring. MIA exposure altered pain sensitivity across development and modestly altered prepulse inhibition. The downregulation of Nr3c1 and Oprk mRNA in the hypothalamus of juvenile mice suggests that the effects of MIA may be mediated through disruption of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity. In contrast, life-long housing with EE rescued many of these MIA-induced consequences. Overall, our findings suggest that accelerated puberty may be associated with the deleterious effects of infection during pregnancy and the onset of psychopathology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinct Inhibitory Pathways Control Velocity and Directional Tuning in the Retina</a></h4>

              
                The sensory periphery is responsible for detecting ethologically relevant features of the external world, using compact, predominantly feedforward circuits. Visual motion is a particularly prevalent sensory feature, the presence of which can be a signal to enact diverse behaviors ranging from gaze stabilization reflexes, to predator avoidance or prey capture. To understand how the retina constructs the distinct neural representations required for these diverse behaviors, we investigated two circuits responsible for encoding different aspects of image motion: ON and ON-OFF direction selective ganglion cells (DSGCs). Using a combination of 2-photon targeted whole cell electrophysiology, pharmacology, and conditional knockout mice, we show that distinct inhibitory pathways independently control tuning for motion velocity and motion direction in these two cell types. We further employ dynamic clamp and numerical modeling techniques to show that asymmetric inhibition provides a velocity-invariant mechanism of directional tuning, despite the strong velocity dependence of classical models of direction selectivity. We therefore demonstrate that invariant representations of motion features by inhibitory interneurons act as computational building blocks to construct distinct, behaviorally relevant signals at the earliest stages of the visual system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Age-induced changes in Mu Opioid Receptor signaling in the midbrain Periaqueductal Gray of male and female rats</a></h4>

              
                The analgesic effects of opioids are attenuated in aged rats. Opioids such as morphine produce attenuated analgesia in aged rodents compared to adults; however, the neural mechanisms underlying this attenuated response are not yet known. The present study investigated the impact of advanced age and biological sex on opioid signaling in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) in the presence of chronic inflammatory pain. Assays measuring mu opioid receptor (MOR) radioligand binding, GTPyS binding, receptor phosphorylation, cAMP inhibition, and regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) protein expression were performed on vlPAG tissue from adult (2-3mos) and aged (16-18mos), male and female rats. Persistent inflammatory pain was induced by intraplantar injection of Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA). Adult males exhibited the highest MOR binding potential and the highest G-protein activation (activation efficiency ratio) in comparison to aged males and females (adult and aged). No impact of advanced age or sex on MOR phosphorylation state was observed. DAMGO-induced cAMP inhibition was highest in the vlPAG of adult males compared to aged males and females (adult and aged). vlPAG levels of RGS4 and RGS9-2, critical for terminating G-protein signaling, were assessed using RNAscope. Adult rats (both males and females) exhibited lower levels of vlPAG RGS4 and RGS9-2 mRNA expression compared to aged males and females. The observed age-related reductions in vlPAG MOR binding potential, G-protein activation efficiency, and cAMP inhibition, along with the observed age-related increases in RGS4 and RGS9-2 vlPAG expression, provide potential mechanisms whereby the response to opioids is attenuated in the aged population. These results have significant implications for pain management in this population.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis: Task-based fMRI Studies in Youths with Irritability</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Childhood irritability, operationalized as disproportionate and frequent temper tantrums and low frustration tolerance relative to peers, is a transdiagnostic symptom across many pediatric disorders. Studies using task-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to probe neural dysfunction in irritability have increased. However, an integrated review summarizing the published methods and synthesized fMRI results remains lacking. Method: We conducted a systematic search using irritability terms and task functional neuroimaging in key databases in March 2021, and identified 30 studies for our systematic review. Sample characteristics and fMRI methods were summarized. A subset of 28 studies met the criteria for extracting coordinate-based data for quantitative meta-analysis. Ten activation-likelihood estimations were performed to examine neural convergence across irritability measures and fMRI task domains. Results: Systematic review revealed small sample sizes (median = 58, mean age range = 8 to 16 years) with heterogeneous sample characteristics, irritability measures, tasks, and analytical procedures. Meta-analyses found no evidence for neural activation convergence of irritability across neurocognitive functions related to emotional reactivity, cognitive control, and reward processing, nor within each domain. Sensitivity analyses partialing out variances driven by heterogeneous tasks, irritability measures, stimulus types, and developmental ages all yielded null findings. Conclusion: The lack of neural convergence suggests a need for common, standardized irritability assessments and more homogeneous fMRI tasks. Thoughtfully designed fMRI studies probing commonly defined neurocognitive functions may be more fruitful to elucidate the neural mechanisms of irritability. Open science practices, data mining in large neuroscience databases, and standardized analytical methods promote meaningful collaboration in irritability research.
