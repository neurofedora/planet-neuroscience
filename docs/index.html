	<p>Background: The efficacy of interlimb-coordinated training on gait and upper limb functional improvement remains unclear. The latest published randomized controlled trials have supported the potential benefits of interlimb-coordinated training to enhance gait function. Upper limb functional recovery may also benefit from interlimb-coordinated training since most everyday activities require the coordinated use of both hands to complete a task. This study investigates the efficacy of interlimb-coordinated training on gait and upper limb functional recovery over a short-medium term period. Methods: A total of 226 acute stroke patients will be recruited from four centres over four years. Patients will be randomly allocated to either conventional therapy or conventional therapy plus interlimb-coordinated training. Outcomes will be recorded at baseline, after 2 weeks of intervention, and at 3- and 6-months post-intervention. Gait speed is the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcome measures include Fugl–Meyer Assessment of Motor Recovery, Berg Balance Scale, Timed Up and Go test, Action Research Arm Test, electroencephalography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Conclusion: The results of this trial will provide an in-depth understanding of the efficacy of early interlimb-coordinated intervention on gait and upper functional rehabilitation and how it may relate to the neural plasticity process.</p>

	<p>Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) a few milliseconds after this cortical activity following electrical stimulation (ES) result in an inhibition comparable to that by TMS alone; this is called short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI). Cortical activity is observed after mechanical tactile stimulation (MS) and is affected by the number of stimuli by ES. We determined the effects of somatosensory stimulus methods and multiple conditioning stimuli on SAI in 19 participants. In experiment 1, the interstimulus intervals between the conditioning stimulation and TMS were 25, 27 and 29 ms for ES and 28, 30 and 32 ms for MS. In experiment 2, we used 1, 2, 3 and 4 conditioning stimulations of ES and MS. The interstimulus interval between the ES or MS and TMS was 27 or 30 ms, respectively. In experiment 1, MEPs were significantly decreased in both the ES and MS conditions. In experiment 2, MEPs after ES were significantly decreased in all conditions. Conversely, MEPs after MS were significantly decreased after one stimulus and increased after four stimulations, indicating the SAI according to the number of stimuli. Therefore, the somatosensory stimulus methods and multiple conditioning stimuli affected the SAI.</p>

	<p>Stroke causes balance dysfunction, leading to decreased physical activity and increased falls. Thus, effective balance exercises are needed to improve balance dysfunction. This single-blind, single-center randomized controlled trial evaluated the long-term and continuous effects of balance exercise using a real-time postural feedback system to improve balancing ability safely. Thirty participants were randomized into intervention (n = 15) and control (n = 15) groups; 11 in each group completed the final evaluation. The effect of the intervention was evaluated by muscle strength of knee extension, physical performance (short physical performance battery, the center of pressure trajectory length per second, and Timed Up and Go test [TUG]), and self-reported questionnaires (modified Gait Efficacy Scale [mGES] and the Fall Efficacy Scale) at pre (0 week), post (6-week), and at follow-up (10-week) visits. The TUG and mGES showed a significant interactive (group * time) effect (p = 0.007 and p = 0.038, respectively). The intervention group showed significant decreasing time to perform TUG from pre- to post-intervention (p = 0.015) and pre-intervention to follow-up (p = 0.016); mGES showed a significant change from pre-intervention to follow-up (p = 0.036). Thus, balance exercise using a real-time postural feedback system can confer a positive effect on the walking ability in patients with chronic stroke and increase their self-confidence in gait performance.</p>

	<p>Although the cerebellum has long been believed to be involved uniquely in sensorimotor processes, recent research works pointed to its participation in a wide range of cognitive predictive functions. Here, we review the available evidence supporting a generalized role of the cerebellum in predictive computation. We then discuss the anatomo-physiological properties that make the cerebellum the ideal hub of the predictive brain. We further argue that cerebellar involvement in cognition may follow a continuous gradient, with higher cerebellar activity occurring for tasks relying more on predictive processes, and outline the empirical scenarios to probe this hypothesis.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Prior Acoustic Trauma Alters Type II Afferent Activity in the Mouse Cochlea</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Auditory stimuli travel from the cochlea to the brainstem through type I and type II cochlear afferents. While type I afferents convey information about the frequency, intensity, and timing of sounds, the role of type II afferents remains unresolved. Limited recordings of type II afferents from cochlear apex of prehearing rats reveal they are activated by widespread outer hair cell stimulation, ATP, and by the rupture of nearby outer hair cells. Altogether, these lines of evidence suggest that type II afferents sense loud, potentially damaging levels of sound. To explore this hypothesis further, calcium imaging was used to determine the impact of acoustic trauma on the activity of type II cochlear afferents of young adult mice of both sexes. Two known marker genes (<I>Th</I>, <I>Drd2</I>) and one new marker gene (<I>Tac1</I>), expressed in type II afferents and some other cochlear cell types, drove GCaMP6f expression to reveal calcium transients in response to focal damage in the organ of Corti in all turns of the cochlea. Mature type II afferents responded to acute photoablation damage less often but at greater length compared with prehearing neurons. In addition, days after acoustic trauma, acute photoablation triggered a novel response pattern in type II afferents and surrounding epithelial cells, delayed bursts of activity occurring minutes after the initial response subsided. Overall, calcium imaging can report type II afferent responses to damage even in mature and noise-exposed animals and reveals previously unknown tissue hyperactivity subsequent to acoustic trauma.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Identification of potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 S protein–ACE2 interaction by in silico drug repurposing [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a new coronavirus discovered that appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, causes COVID-19 disease which have resulted in cases similar to SARS-atypical pneumonia. Worldwide, around 116 million cases and 2.57 million deaths are reported with new cases and increasing mortality every day. To date, there is no specific commercial treatment to control the infection. Repurpose drugs targeting the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor represents an alternative strategy to block the binding of SARS-CoV-2 protein S and forestall virus adhesion, internalization, and replication in the host cell. Methods: We performed a rigid molecular docking using the receptor binding domain of the S1 subunit of S protein (RBD S1)-ACE2 (PDB ID: 6VW1) interaction site and 1,283 drugs FDA approved. The docking score, frequency of the drug in receptor site, and interactions at the binding site residues were used as analyzing criteria. Results: This research yielded 40 drugs identified as a potential inhibitor of RBD S1-ACE2 interaction. Among the inhibitors, compounds such as ipratropium, formoterol, and fexofenadine can be found. Specialists employ these drugs as therapies to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and virtually any respiratory infection. Conclusions: Our results will serve as the basis for in vitro and in vivo studies to evaluate the potential use of those drugs to generate affordable and convenient therapies to treat COVID-19.

                Background: Acceptable food processing techniques require the removal of water contents from the crop or food sample without destroying the nutritional qualities of the food sample. This poses a strict requirement on the dehydrator or oven that will be used in the dehydrating techniques to have the ability to control both temperature and humidity of its drying chamber. Methods: This work centres on how an autonomous multi-farm produce dehydrator that can also serve as an oven can be designed with a raspberry pi and a low-cost programmable logic controller (PLC). The dehydrator gives the users the flexibility to control both the drying chamber’s temperature and humidity from its web interface via a mobile device or the dehydrator’s HMI. Heat energy from the Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) is used so that the dehydrator can be readily available for commercial or industrial use.  The small electricity required to power the electronics devices is obtained from the hybrid power solution with an electric energy source from either the mains electricity supply or solar.. The design was tested by creating an operation profile from the proposed web application for the dehydrator. The operation trend was analysed from the web application’s Trendlines page. Results: The report showed that both the temperature and humidity of the dehydrator could be controlled, and access to historical operation data will give insight to the user on how to create a better operation profile. Conclusion: The setup described in this work, when implemented was able to produce a dehydrator/oven whose temperature and humidity can be perfectly controlled and its generated heat is evenly distributed in its drying chamber to ensure efficient and effective drying techniques use in crop preservation and food processing.

                Currently, the studies on sexual abuse trauma, and resilience in Confucian survivors are still limited. The purpose of this study is to explore the resilience of Confucian women after sexual abuse trauma to provide evidence to support in counseling and psychotherapy practices. The article describes the resiliency story of a Vietnamese Confucian female survivor who was abused by her brother from the age of 8 to 16. The life history approach used in qualitative narrative research was applied in this study. The researcher identified two factors that strongly influence the survivor’s resilience: (1) the effectiveness of passive education in the general education curriculum is oriented to both competence and quality development; and (2) an authentic understanding of the core Confucian philosophical doctrine: the neutrality and the self-nurture. Based on the findings, we propose a 7-stage flow diagram of a Confucian women's resilience following sexual abuse. These findings provide a new approach to psychological counseling for female survivors of any religion by using Confucian philosophy and contribute to the impact of studies on religious and spiritual factors affecting the resilience of sexual abuse survivors.

                This study sought to determine the effect of fermented medicinal herbs (FMH), i.e. cutchery (Kaempferia galanga), turmeric (Curcuma longa) and curcuma (Curcuma xanthorrhiza) in combination with molasses and probiotic drink (Yakult), administered orally on the hematological and physiological profile of striped catfish (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus). A complete randomized design (CRD) experiment was used with four levels of treatments, namely P0 (control), P1 (FMH 100 mL/kg), P2 (FMH 200 mL/kg) and P3 (FMH 300 mL/kg) of feed. The fish were kept in a farm in cages at 75 fish/m3 and fed with the experimental diets for 60 days. The results revealed that FMH (P2) dietary administration improved hematological and physiological profile of catfish, i.e total erythrocytes of 2.81 x 106 cells/mm3, hematocrit values of 39.00%, hemoglobin levels of 10.73 g/dL, total leukocytes of 11.41 x 104 cells/mm3, blood glucose 97.33 mg/dL, and total serum protein 4.10 mg/dL compared to controls with 1.89 x 106 cells/mm3, 32.33 %, g/dL, 9.67 x 104 cells/mm3, 67.33 mg/dL, and total serum protein of 3.10 mg/dL, respectively. Moreover, the diet improved special growth rate, feed conversion ratio, feed efficiency and the survival rate of catfish. The hematological and physiological profile of catfish improvement are considered to be due to the content of secondary metabolites of FMH, namely curcuminoids, vitamin C, essential oils, tannins, and flavonoids, which trigger immunostimulation. The presence of curcuminoids provide an antioxidant effect on cell membranes reducing erythrocyte cell membrane damage due to oxidation. Similarly, flavonoids are natural antioxidants, which are credited with the ability of reducing free radicals and anti-free radicals.

The growing number of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data presents a unique opportunity to study the combined impact of mitochondrial and nuclear-encoded genetic variation in complex disease. Mitochondrial DNA variants and in particular, heteroplasmic variants, are critical for determining human disease severity. While there are approaches for obtaining mitochondrial DNA variants from NGS data, these software do not account for the unique characteristics of mitochondrial genetics and can be inaccurate even for homoplasmic variants. We introduce MitoScape, a novel, big-data, software for extracting mitochondrial DNA sequences from NGS. MitoScape adopts a novel departure from other algorithms by using machine learning to model the unique characteristics of mitochondrial genetics. We also employ a novel approach of using rho-zero (mitochondrial DNA-depleted) data to model nuclear-encoded mitochondrial sequences. We showed that MitoScape produces accurate heteroplasmy estimates using gold-standard mitochondrial DNA data. We provide a comprehensive comparison of the most common tools for obtaining mtDNA variants from NGS and showed that MitoScape had superior performance to compared tools in every statistically category we compared, including false positives and false negatives. By applying MitoScape to common disease examples, we illustrate how MitoScape facilitates important heteroplasmy-disease association discoveries by expanding upon a reported association between hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and mitochondrial haplogroup T in men (adjusted p-value = 0.003). The improved accuracy of mitochondrial DNA variants produced by MitoScape will be instrumental in diagnosing disease in the context of personalized medicine and clinical diagnostics.

                <p>by Júlia V. Gallinaro, Claudia Clopath</p>

Cell assemblies are thought to be the substrate of memory in the brain. Theoretical studies have previously shown that assemblies can be formed in networks with multiple types of plasticity. But how exactly they are formed and how they encode information is yet to be fully understood. One possibility is that memories are stored in silent assemblies. Here we used a computational model to study the formation of silent assemblies in a network of spiking neurons with excitatory and inhibitory plasticity. We found that even though the formed assemblies were silent in terms of mean firing rate, they had an increased coefficient of variation of inter-spike intervals. We also found that this spiking irregularity could be read out with support of short-term plasticity, and that it could contribute to the longevity of memories.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A conserved expression signature predicts growth rate and reveals cell & lineage-specific differences</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Zhisheng Jiang, Serena F. Generoso, Marta Badia, Bernhard Payer, Lucas B. Carey</p>

Isogenic cells cultured together show heterogeneity in their proliferation rate. To determine the differences between fast and slow-proliferating cells, we developed a method to sort cells by proliferation rate, and performed RNA-seq on slow and fast proliferating subpopulations of pluripotent mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and mouse fibroblasts. We found that slowly proliferating mESCs have a more naïve pluripotent character. We identified an evolutionarily conserved proliferation-correlated transcriptomic signature that is common to all eukaryotes: fast cells have higher expression of genes for protein synthesis and protein degradation. This signature accurately predicted growth rate in yeast and cancer cells, and identified lineage-specific proliferation dynamics during development, using <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i> scRNA-seq data. In contrast, sorting by mitochondria membrane potential revealed a highly cell-type specific mitochondria-state related transcriptome. mESCs with hyperpolarized mitochondria are fast proliferating, while the opposite is true for fibroblasts. The mitochondrial electron transport chain inhibitor antimycin affected slow and fast subpopulations differently. While a major transcriptional-signature associated with cell-to-cell heterogeneity in proliferation is conserved, the metabolic and energetic dependency of cell proliferation is cell-type specific.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Diverse processing underlying frequency integration in midbrain neurons of barn owls</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Julia C. Gorman, Oliver L. Tufte, Anna V. R. Miller, William M. DeBello, José L. Peña, Brian J. Fischer</p>

Emergent response properties of sensory neurons depend on circuit connectivity and somatodendritic processing. Neurons of the barn owl’s external nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICx) display emergence of spatial selectivity. These neurons use interaural time difference (ITD) as a cue for the horizontal direction of sound sources. ITD is detected by upstream brainstem neurons with narrow frequency tuning, resulting in spatially ambiguous responses. This spatial ambiguity is resolved by ICx neurons integrating inputs over frequency, a relevant processing in sound localization across species. Previous models have predicted that ICx neurons function as point neurons that linearly integrate inputs across frequency. However, the complex dendritic trees and spines of ICx neurons raises the question of whether this prediction is accurate. Data from <i>in vivo</i> intracellular recordings of ICx neurons were used to address this question. Results revealed diverse frequency integration properties, where some ICx neurons showed responses consistent with the point neuron hypothesis and others with nonlinear dendritic integration. Modeling showed that varied connectivity patterns and forms of dendritic processing may underlie observed ICx neurons’ frequency integration processing. These results corroborate the ability of neurons with complex dendritic trees to implement diverse linear and nonlinear integration of synaptic inputs, of relevance for adaptive coding and learning, and supporting a fundamental mechanism in sound localization.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">DNA methylation-based classifier and gene expression signatures detect BRCAness in osteosarcoma</a></h4>

Although osteosarcoma (OS) is a rare cancer, it is the most common primary malignant bone tumor in children and adolescents. BRCAness is a phenotypical trait in tumors with a defect in homologous recombination repair, resembling tumors with inactivation of BRCA1/2, rendering these tumors sensitive to poly (ADP)-ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi). Recently, OS was shown to exhibit molecular features of BRCAness. Our goal was to develop a method complementing existing genomic methods to aid clinical decision making on administering PARPi in OS patients. OS samples with DNA-methylation data were divided to BRCAness-positive and negative groups based on the degree of their genomic instability (n = 41). Methylation probes were ranked according to decreasing variance difference between two groups. The top 2000 probes were selected for training and cross-validation of the random forest algorithm. Two-thirds of available OS RNA-Seq samples (n = 17) from the top and bottom of the sample list ranked according to genome instability score were subjected to differential expression and, subsequently, to gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). The combined accuracy of trained random forest was 85% and the average area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.95. There were 449 upregulated and 1,079 downregulated genes in the BRCAness-positive group (fdr < 0.05). GSEA of upregulated genes detected enrichment of DNA replication and mismatch repair and homologous recombination signatures (FWER < 0.05). Validation of the BRCAness classifier with an independent OS set (n = 20) collected later in the course of study showed AUC of 0.87 with an accuracy of 90%. GSEA signatures computed for this test set were matching the ones observed in the training set enrichment analysis. In conclusion, we developed a new classifier based on DNA-methylation patterns that detects BRCAness in OS samples with high accuracy. GSEA identified genome instability signatures. Machine-learning and gene expression approaches add new epigenomic and transcriptomic aspects to already established genomic methods for evaluation of BRCAness in osteosarcoma and can be extended to cancers characterized by genome instability.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The experience of teaching introductory programming skills to bioscientists in Brazil</a></h4>

Computational biology has gained traction as an independent scientific discipline over the last years in South America. However, there is still a growing need for bioscientists, from different backgrounds, with different levels, to acquire programming skills, which could reduce the time from data to insights and bridge communication between life scientists and computer scientists. Python is a programming language extensively used in bioinformatics and data science, which is particularly suitable for beginners. Here, we describe the conception, organization, and implementation of the Brazilian Python Workshop for Biological Data. This workshop has been organized by graduate and undergraduate students and supported, mostly in administrative matters, by experienced faculty members since 2017. The workshop was conceived for teaching bioscientists, mainly students in Brazil, on how to program in a biological context. The goal of this article was to share our experience with the 2020 edition of the workshop in its virtual format due to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and to compare and contrast this year’s experience with the previous in-person editions. We described a hands-on and live coding workshop model for teaching introductory Python programming. We also highlighted the adaptations made from in-person to online format in 2020, the participants’ assessment of learning progression, and general workshop management. Lastly, we provided a summary and reflections from our personal experiences from the workshops of the last 4 years. Our takeaways included the benefits of the learning from learners’ feedback (LLF) that allowed us to improve the workshop in real time, in the short, and likely in the long term. We concluded that the Brazilian Python Workshop for Biological Data is a highly effective workshop model for teaching a programming language that allows bioscientists to go beyond an initial exploration of programming skills for data analysis in the medium to long term.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Ten simple rules on writing clean and reliable open-source scientific software</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Haley Hunter-Zinck, Alexandre Fioravante de Siqueira, Váleri N. Vásquez, Richard Barnes, Ciera C. Martinez</p>

Functional, usable, and maintainable open-source software is increasingly essential to scientific research, but there is a large variation in formal training for software development and maintainability. Here, we propose 10 “rules” centered on 2 best practice components: clean code and testing. These 2 areas are relatively straightforward and provide substantial utility relative to the learning investment. Adopting clean code practices helps to standardize and organize software code in order to enhance readability and reduce cognitive load for both the initial developer and subsequent contributors; this allows developers to concentrate on core functionality and reduce errors. Clean coding styles make software code more amenable to testing, including unit tests that work best with modular and consistent software code. Unit tests interrogate specific and isolated coding behavior to reduce coding errors and ensure intended functionality, especially as code increases in complexity; unit tests also implicitly provide example usages of code. Other forms of testing are geared to discover erroneous behavior arising from unexpected inputs or emerging from the interaction of complex codebases. Although conforming to coding styles and designing tests can add time to the software development project in the short term, these foundational tools can help to improve the correctness, quality, usability, and maintainability of open-source scientific software code. They also advance the principal point of scientific research: producing accurate results in a reproducible way. In addition to suggesting several tips for getting started with clean code and testing practices, we recommend numerous tools for the popular open-source scientific software languages Python, R, and Julia.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Optimizing network propagation for multi-omics data integration</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Konstantina Charmpi, Manopriya Chokkalingam, Ronja Johnen, Andreas Beyer</p>

Network propagation refers to a class of algorithms that integrate information from input data across connected nodes in a given network. These algorithms have wide applications in systems biology, protein function prediction, inferring condition-specifically altered sub-networks, and prioritizing disease genes. Despite the popularity of network propagation, there is a lack of comparative analyses of different algorithms on real data and little guidance on how to select and parameterize the various algorithms. Here, we address this problem by analyzing different combinations of network normalization and propagation methods and by demonstrating schemes for the identification of optimal parameter settings on real proteome and transcriptome data. Our work highlights the risk of a ‘topology bias’ caused by the incorrect use of network normalization approaches. Capitalizing on the fact that network propagation is a regularization approach, we show that minimizing the bias-variance tradeoff can be utilized for selecting optimal parameters. The application to real multi-omics data demonstrated that optimal parameters could also be obtained by either maximizing the agreement between different omics layers (e.g. proteome and transcriptome) or by maximizing the consistency between biological replicates. Furthermore, we exemplified the utility and robustness of network propagation on multi-omics datasets for identifying ageing-associated genes in brain and liver tissues of rats and for elucidating molecular mechanisms underlying prostate cancer progression. Overall, this work compares different network propagation approaches and it presents strategies for how to use network propagation algorithms to optimally address a specific research question at hand.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Respiration modulates oscillatory neural network activity at rest</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Daniel S. Kluger, Joachim Gross</p>

Despite recent advances in understanding how respiration affects neural signalling to influence perception, cognition, and behaviour, it is yet unclear to what extent breathing modulates brain oscillations at rest. We acquired respiration and resting state magnetoencephalography (MEG) data from human participants to investigate if, where, and how respiration cyclically modulates oscillatory amplitudes (2 to 150 Hz). Using measures of phase–amplitude coupling, we show respiration-modulated brain oscillations (RMBOs) across all major frequency bands. Sources of these modulations spanned a widespread network of cortical and subcortical brain areas with distinct spectrotemporal modulation profiles. Globally, delta and gamma band modulations varied with distance to the head centre, with stronger modulations at distal (versus central) cortical sites. Overall, we provide the first comprehensive mapping of RMBOs across the entire brain, highlighting respiration–brain coupling as a fundamental mechanism to shape neural processing within canonical resting state and respiratory control networks (RCNs).

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Acquisition of ionic copper by the bacterial outer membrane protein OprC through a novel binding site</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Satya Prathyusha Bhamidimarri, Tessa R. Young, Muralidharan Shanmugam, Sandra Soderholm, Arnaud Baslé, Dirk Bumann, Bert van den Berg</p>

Copper, while toxic in excess, is an essential micronutrient in all kingdoms of life due to its essential role in the structure and function of many proteins. Proteins mediating ionic copper import have been characterised in detail for eukaryotes, but much less so for prokaryotes. In particular, it is still unclear whether and how gram-negative bacteria acquire ionic copper. Here, we show that <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> OprC is an outer membrane, TonB-dependent transporter that is conserved in many Proteobacteria and which mediates acquisition of both reduced and oxidised ionic copper via an unprecedented CxxxM-HxM metal binding site. Crystal structures of wild-type and mutant OprC variants with silver and copper suggest that acquisition of Cu(I) occurs via a surface-exposed “methionine track” leading towards the principal metal binding site. Together with whole-cell copper quantitation and quantitative proteomics in a murine lung infection model, our data identify OprC as an abundant component of bacterial copper biology that may enable copper acquisition under a wide range of conditions.

                Background: Health technology assessment (HTA) is an effective tool for supporting priority setting (PS) in health. Stakeholder groups need to understand HTA appropriate to their role and to interpret and critique the evidence produced. We aimed to rapidly assess current health system priorities and policy areas of demand for HTA in Sub-Saharan Africa, and identify key gaps in data and skills to inform targeted capacity building. Methods: We revised an existing survey, delivered it to 357 participants, then analysed responses and explored key themes. Results: There were 51 respondents (14%, 30 full completions) across 14 countries. HTA was considered an important and valuable PS tool with a key role in the design of health benefits packages, clinical guideline development, and service improvement. Medicines were identified as a technology type that would especially benefit from the application of HTA. Using HTA to address safety issues (e.g. low-quality medicines) and value for money concerns was particularly highlighted. The perceived availability and accessibility of suitable local data to support HTA varied widely but was mostly considered inadequate and limited. Respondents also noted a need for training support in research methodology and data gathering. Conclusions: While important in raising awareness of HTA as a tool for PS, this study had a low response rate, and that respondents were self-selected. A more refined survey will be developed to support engagement strategies and capacity building.

                A 57-year-old male who had been working in masonry for 33 years was hospitalized for renal function decline associated with exertional dyspnea. He presented with hypertension and limb edema. Urinalysis revealed an active urine sediment with glomerular proteinuria at 1.5 g/24h and the renal biopsy identified mesangial IgA Nephropathy. Chest tomography scans showed signs of silicosis. The patient received Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors with stable renal function. To our knowledge, the association of silicosis-IgA nephropathy has rarely been reported in the literature. This case highlights the effect of chronic exposure to silica dust and its association with both silica and renal disease.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Nutrient dynamics in water and soil under conventional rice cultivation in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The evaluation of nutrient variability plays a crucial role in accessing soil potentials and practical intervention responses in rice production systems. Synthetic fertilizer applications and cultivation practices are considered key factors affecting nutrient dynamics and availability. Here, we assessed the nutrient dynamics in surface, subsurface water and soil under local water management and conventional rice cultivation practices in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta. Methods We implemented a field experiment (200 m 2) in the 2018 wet season and the 2019 dry season in a triple rice-cropping field. Eight samples of surface water, subsurface water (30–45 cm), and topsoil (0–20 cm) were collected and analysed during the rice-growing seasons. Results The results showed that N-NH 4+, P-PO 43- and total P peaks were achieved after fertilizing. Irrespective of seasons, the nutrient content in surface water was always greater than that of subsurface water (P<0.001), with the exception of N-NO 3-, which was insignificant (P>0.05). When comparing the wet and dry seasons, nutrient concentrations exhibited minor differences (P>0.05). Under conventional rice cultivation, the effects of synthetic fertilizer topdressing on the total N, soil organic matter (SOM), and total P were negligible in the soil. Higher rates of N fertilizer application did not significantly increase soil N-NH 4+, total N, yet larger P fertilizer amounts substantially enhanced soil total P (P<0.001). Conclusions Under conventional rice cultivation, N-NH 4+, P-PO 43- and total P losses mainly occur through runoff rather than leaching. While N-NO 3- loss is similar in surface water and subsurface water. Notably, nutrient content in soil was high; whilst SOM was seen to be low-to-medium between seasons. Future work should consider the nutrient balance and dynamic simulation in the lowland soil of the Vietnamese Mekong Delta’s paddy fields.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A Machine Learning Approach to Predictive Modelling of Student Performance [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background - Many factors affect student performance such as the individual’s background, habits, absenteeism and social activities. Using these factors, corrective actions can be determined to improve their performance. This study looks into the effects of these factors in predicting student performance from a data mining approach. This study presents a data mining approach in identify significant factors and predict student performance, based on two datasets collected from two secondary schools in Portugal. Methods – In this study, two datasets collected from two secondary schools in Portugal. First, the data used in the study is augmented to increase the sample size by merging the two datasets. Following that, data pre-processing is performed and the features are normalized with linear scaling to avoid bias on heavy weighted attributes.  The selected features are then assigned into four groups comprising of student background, lifestyle, history of grades and all features. Next, Boruta feature selection is performed to remove irrelevant features. Finally, the classification models of Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) origins are designed and their performances evaluated. Results - The models were trained and evaluated on an integrated dataset comprising 1044 student records with 33 features, after feature selection. The classification was performed with SVM, NB and MLP with 60-40 and 50-50 train-test splits and 10-fold cross validation. GridSearchCV was applied to perform hyperparameter tuning. The performance metrics were accuracy, precision, recall and F1-Score. SVM obtained the highest accuracy with scores of 77%, 80%, 91% and 90% on background, lifestyle, history of grades and all features respectively in 50-50 train-test splits for binary classification (pass or fail). SVM also obtained highest accuracy for five class classification (grade A, B, C, D and F) with 39%, 38%, 73% and 71% for the four categories respectively.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">An intelligent decision support system for crop yield prediction using hybrid machine learning algorithms [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In recent times, digitization is gaining importance in different domains of knowledge such as agriculture, medicine, recommendation platforms, the Internet of Things (IoT), and weather forecasting. In agriculture, crop yield estimation is essential for improving productivity and decision-making processes such as financial market forecasting, and addressing food security issues. The main objective of the article is to predict and improve the accuracy of crop yield forecasting using hybrid machine learning (ML) algorithms. Methods: This article proposes hybrid ML algorithms that use specialized ensembling methods such as stacked generalization, gradient boosting, random forest, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. Stacked generalization is a new model which learns how to best combine the predictions from two or more models trained on the dataset. To demonstrate the applications of the proposed algorithm, aerial-intel datasets from the github data science repository are used. Results: Based on the experimental results done on the agricultural data, the following observations have been made. The performance of the individual algorithm and hybrid ML algorithms are compared using cross-validation to identify the most promising performers for the agricultural dataset.  The accuracy of random forest regressor, gradient boosted tree regression, and stacked generalization ensemble methods are 87.71%, 86.98%, and 88.89% respectively. Conclusions: The proposed stacked generalization ML algorithm statistically outperforms with an accuracy of 88.89% and hence demonstrates that the proposed approach is an effective algorithm for predicting crop yield. The system also gives fast and accurate responses to the farmers.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Isolated, unilateral oculomotor palsy with anti-GQ1b antibody following COVID-19 vaccination [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Neurological complications following vaccinations are extremely rare, but cannot be eliminated. Here, we report the first case of unilateral oculomotor nerve palsy (ONP) with anti-GQ1b antibody after receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 (BNT162b2) mRNA vaccine. A 65-year-old man developed diplopia and ptosis in the right eye 17 days after vaccination, without preceding infection. Neurological examination revealed mild blepharoptosis, limitation of adduction, and vertical gaze on the right side. Increased levels of anti-GQ1b ganglioside antibody in the serum and albuminocytologic dissociation in the cerebrospinal fluid were detected. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging showed swelling and enhancement of the right oculomotor nerve. The patient was diagnosed with right ONP accompanied with anti-GQ1b antibody, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy for 5 days was administered. The limitation of adduction and vertical gaze improved, and ptosis markedly resolved after IVIG treatment. Given the temporal sequence of disease progression, laboratory findings, and a favorable response to IVIG, a causal relationship cannot be ruled out between the occurrence of ONP and COVID-19 immunization. Since immunomodulatory treatments significantly hasten the recovery and minimize the residual symptoms in anti-GQ1b antibody syndrome, clinicians should be aware of this clinical condition following COVID-19 vaccination.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of rurioctocog alfa pegol for prophylactic treatment in previously treated patients with severe hemophilia A: a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials [version 2; peer review: 1 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Patients with severe hemophilia often present with painful joint and soft tissue bleeding which may restrict them from their daily activities. The current standard of care still relies on a regular prophylactic factor VIII (FVIII), which has a high daily treatment burden. Recently, rurioctocog alfa pegol, a third-generation recombinant FVIII with a modification in its polyethylene glycol (PEG) component, has been developed. Several trials have studied this synthetic drug as bleeding prophylaxis in severe hemophilia A. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of rurioctocog alfa pegol for previously treated patients with severe hemophilia A. Methods: This study was conducted in conformity with the PRISMA guidelines. Data were retrieved from PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Wiley Online Library, and CINAHL (via EBSCOhost). Study qualities were assessed using the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) and Modified Jadad scales. Results: Four studies involving 517 previously treated severe hemophilia A patients were included in this study. The pooled mean of total annualized bleeding rate (ABR) and hemostatic efficacy was 2.59 (95% CI = 2.04–3.14) and 92% (95% CI = 85%–97%), respectively. Only 30 (2.3%) non-serious and one (1.4%) serious adverse events were considered related to rurioctocog alfa pegol treatment. At the end of the studies, no development of FVIII inhibitory antibodies was observed. None of the developed binding antibodies to FVIII, PEG-FVIII, or PEG was correlated to the treatment efficacy and safety. Conclusions: Despite the limited availability of direct comparison studies, our analyses indicate that rurioctocog alfa pegol could serve as a safe and effective alternative for bleeding prophylaxis in previously treated hemophilia A patients. Moreover, it appears to have low immunogenicity, which further increases the safety profile of the drug in such clinical conditions.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Small fiber neuropathy (SFN) is clinically and etiologically heterogeneous. While autoimmunity has been postulated to be pathophysiologically important in SFN, few autoantibodies have been described. We aimed to identify autoantibodies associated with idiopathic SFN (iSFN) by a novel high-throughput protein microarray platform that captures autoantibodies expressed in native conformational state.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Sera from 58 SFN patients and 20 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC) were screened against more than 1,600 immune-related antigens. Fluorescent unit readout and post-assay imaging were performed followed by composite data normalization, and protein fold change (pFC) analysis. Analysis of an independent validation cohort of 33 SFN patients against the same 20 HC was conducted to identify reproducible proteins in both cohorts.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Nine autoantibodies were screened with statistical significance and pFC criteria in both cohorts, with at least 50% change in serum levels. Three proteins showed consistently high fold changes in main and validation cohorts - MX1 (FC = 2.99 and 3.07, <i>p</i> = 0.003 and q = 0.076 respectively), DBNL (FC = 2.11 and 2.16, <i>p</i> =0.009 and q = &lt;0.003 respectively), and KRT8 (FC = 1.65 and 1.70, <i>p</i> = 0.043 and q &lt;0.003 respectively). Further subgroup analysis into iSFN and secondary causes of SFN (sSFN) in the main cohort showed that MX1 is higher in iSFN compared to sSFN (FC = 1.61 vs. 0.106, <i>p</i> = 0.009).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Novel autoantibodies MX1, DBNL and KRT8 are found in iSFN. MX1 may allow diagnostic subtyping of iSFN patients.</p>

                Microglia play a major role in certain neuropathological conditions. In a recent paper, Reusch et al. demonstrated how signaling pathways downstream of cannabinoid type 2 (CB2) and toll-like receptors (TLRs) converge in these cells. The findings suggest that CB2 receptors play a permissive role in microglia activation mediated by TLRs.

                Dopamine is a key neuromodulator for the control of striatal circuit function. Banerjee et al. show that evoked dopamine secretion occurs at release hotspots that contain active zone proteins. Munc13, Liprin-α, and RIM cooperate to mediate vesicle priming and release, while other known active zone proteins are dispensable.

                Lost sensations, such as touch, could be restored by microstimulation (MiSt) along the sensory neural substrate. Such neuroprosthetic sensory information can be used as feedback from an invasive brain-machine interface (BMI) to control a robotic arm/hand, such that tactile and proprioceptive feedback from the sensorized robotic arm/hand is directly given to the BMI user. Microstimulation in the human somatosensory thalamus (Vc) has been shown to produce somatosensory perceptions. However, until recently, systematic methods for using thalamic stimulation to evoke naturalistic touch perceptions were lacking. We have recently presented rigorous methods for determining a mapping between ventral posterior lateral thalamus (VPL) MiSt, and neural responses in the somatosensory cortex (S1), in a rodent model (Choi et al., 2016; Choi and Francis, 2018). Our technique minimizes the difference between S1 neural responses induced by natural sensory stimuli and those generated via VPL MiSt. Our goal is to develop systems that know what MiSt will produce a given neural response and possibly a more natural "sensation." To date, our optimization has been conducted in the rodent model and simulations. Here we present data from simple non-optimized thalamic MiSt during peri-operative experiments, where we MiSt in the VPL of macaques with a somatosensory system more like humans. We implanted arrays of microelectrodes across the hand area of the macaque S1 cortex as well as in the VPL thalamus. Multi and single-unit recordings were used to compare cortical responses to natural touch and thalamic MiSt in the anesthetized state. Post stimulus time histograms were highly correlated between the VPL MiSt and natural touch modalities, adding support to the use of VPL MiSt towards producing a somatosensory neuroprosthesis in humans.

                Successful behavior relies on the ability to use information obtained from past experience to predict what is likely to occur in the future. A salient example of predictive encoding comes from the vertebrate retina, where neural circuits encode information that can be used to estimate the trajectory of a moving object. Predictive computations should be a general property of sensory systems, but the features needed to identify these computations across neural systems are not well understood. Here, we identify several properties of predictive computations in the primate retina that likely generalize across sensory systems. These features include calculating the derivative of incoming signals, sparse signal integration, and delayed response suppression. These findings provide a deeper understanding of how the brain carries out predictive computations and identify features that can be used to recognize these computations throughout the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An Infant Sleep Electroencephalographic Marker of Thalamocortical Connectivity Predicts Behavioral Outcome in Late Infancy</a></h4>

              
                Infancy represents a critical period during which thalamocortical brain connections develop and mature. Deviations in the maturation of thalamocortical connectivity are linked to neurodevelopmental disorders. There is a lack of early biomarkers to detect and localize neuromaturational deviations, which can be overcome with mapping through high-density electroencephalography (hdEEG) assessed in sleep. Specifically, slow waves and spindles in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep are generated by the thalamocortical system, and their characteristics, slow wave slope and spindle density, are closely related to neuroplasticity and learning. Recent studies further suggest that information processing during sleep underlying sleep-dependent learning is promoted by the temporal coupling of slow waves and spindles, yet slow wave-spindle coupling remains unexplored in infancy. Thus, we evaluated three potential biomarkers: 1) slow wave slope, 2) spindle density, and 3) the temporal coupling of slow waves with spindles. We use hdEEG to first examine the occurrence and spatial distribution of these three EEG features in healthy infants and second to evaluate a predictive relationship with later behavioral outcomes. We report four key findings: First, infants' EEG features appear locally: slow wave slope is maximal in occipital and frontal areas, whereas spindle density is most pronounced frontocentrally. Second, slow waves and spindles are temporally coupled in infancy, with maximal coupling strength in the occipital areas of the brain. Third, slow wave slope, spindle density, and slow wave-spindle coupling are not associated with concurrent behavioral status (6 months). Fourth, spindle density in central and frontocentral regions at age 6 months predicts later behavioral outcomes at 12 and 24 months. Neither slow wave slope nor slow wave-spindle coupling predict behavioral development. Our results propose spindle density as an early EEG biomarker for identifying thalamocortical maturation, which can potentially be used for early diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorders in infants. These findings are complemented by our companion paper that demonstrates the linkage of spindle density to infant nighttime movement, framing the possible role of spindles in sensorimotor microcircuitry development. Together, our studies suggest that early sleep habits, thalamocortical maturation, and behavioral outcome are closely interwoven. A crucial next step will be to evaluate whether early therapeutic interventions may be effective to reverse deviations in identified individuals at risk.

                Dogma holds that Toxoplasma gondii persists in neurons because neurons cannot clear intracellular parasites, even with IFN-{gamma} stimulation. As several recent studies questioned this idea, we used primary murine neuronal cultures from wild-type and transgenic mice in combination with IFN-{gamma} stimulation and parental and transgenic parasites to reassess IFN-{gamma} dependent neuronal clearance of intracellular parasites. We found that neurons respond to IFN-{gamma} and that a subset of neurons clear intracellular parasites via immunity regulated GTPases. Whole neuron reconstructions from mice infected with parasites that trigger neuron GFP expression only after full invasion revealed that ~40% of these T. gondii-invaded neurons no longer harbor parasites. Finally, IFN-{gamma} stimulated human stem cell derived neurons showed a ~ 50% decrease in parasite infection rate when compared to unstimulated cultures. This work highlights the capability of human and murine neurons to mount cytokine-dependent anti-T. gondii defense mechanisms in vitro and in vivo.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An essential role for a discrete parasubthalamic nucleus subpopulation in appetite suppression</a></h4>

              
                Food intake behavior is regulated by a network of appetite-inducing and appetite-suppressing neuronal populations throughout the brain. The parasubthalamic nucleus (PSTN), a relatively unexplored population of neurons in the posterior hypothalamus, has been hypothesized to regulate appetite due to its connectivity with other anorexigenic neuronal populations and because these neurons express Fos, a marker of neuronal activation, following a meal. However, the individual cell types that make up the PSTN are not well characterized, nor are their functional roles in food intake behavior. Here we identify and distinguish between two discrete PSTN subpopulations, those that express tachykinin-1 (PSTNTac1 neurons) and those that express corticotropin-releasing hormone (PSTNCRH neurons), and use a panel of genetically encoded tools in mice to show that PSTNTac1 neurons play an essential role in appetite suppression. Both subpopulations increase activity following a meal and in response to administration of the anorexigenic hormones amylin, cholecystokinin (CCK), and peptide YY (PYY). Interestingly, chemogenetic inhibition of PSTNTac1, but not PSTNCRH neurons, reduces the appetite-suppressing effects of these hormones. Consistently, optogenetic and chemogenetic stimulation of PSTNTac1 neurons, but not PSTNCRH neurons, is sufficient to reduce food intake in hungry mice. PSTNTac1 and PSTNCRH neurons project to distinct downstream brain regions, and stimulation of PSTNTac1 projections to individual anorexigenic populations reduces food consumption. Taken together, these results reveal the functional properties and projection patterns of distinct PSTN cell types and demonstrate an essential, anorexigenic role for PSTNTac1 neurons in the hormonal and central regulation of appetite.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Realistic alpha oscillations and transient responses in a cortical microcircuit model</a></h4>

              
                Neural-mass modeling of neural population data (EEG, ECoG, or LFPs) has shown promise both in elucidating the neural processes underlying cortical rhythms and changes in brain state, as well as offering a framework for testing the interplay between these rhythms and information processing. Models of cortical alpha rhythms (8 - 12 Hz) and their impact in visual sensory processing have been at the forefront of this effort, with the Jansen-Rit being one of the more popular models in this domain. The Jansen-Rit model, however, fails in reproducing key physiological observations including the level of inputs that cortical neurons receive and their responses to visual transients. To address these issues we generated a neural mass model that complies better with synaptic mediated dynamics, intrinsic alpha behavior, and produces realistic responses. The model is robust to many changes in parameter values but critically depends on the ratio of excitation to inhibition, producing response transients whose features are dependent on this ratio and alpha phase and power. The model is sufficiently flexible so as to be able to easily replicate the range of low frequency oscillations observed in different studies. Consistent with experimental observations, we find phase-dependent response dynamics to both visual and electrical stimulation using this model. The model suggests that stimulation facilitates alpha at particular phases and suppresses it in others due to a phase dependent lag in inhibitory responses. Hence, the model generates insight into the physiological parameters responsible for intrinsic oscillations and testable hypotheses regarding the interactions between visual and electrical stimulation on those oscillations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sequence learning attenuates cortical responses in both frontal and perceptual cortices in early infancy</a></h4>

              
                Prior work using a variety of imaging modalities has found that the frontal lobe is involved in higher-order sequential and statistical learning in young infants. Separate lines of work have found evidence of modulation of posterior sensory cortices during and after learning tasks. How do these processes relate together? Here, we build from a well-regarded EEG task that found evidence that the frontal lobe of young infants tracked higher-order sequential information (Basirat et al., 2014) and ask whether posterior perceptual cortices respond differentially to predictable vs. unpredictable sequences as well. First, replicating and extending past work, we found evidence of frontal lobe involvement in this task. Second, consistent with our hypotheses, we found that there is a corresponding attenuation of neural responses in the posterior perceptual cortices (temporal and occipital) to predictable compared to unpredictable audiovisual sequences. This study provides convergent evidence that the frontal lobe is crucial for higher-level learning in young infants but that it likely works as part of a large, distributed network of regions to modulate infant neural responses as a result of learning. Overall, this work challenges the view that the infant brain is not dynamic and disconnected, lacking in long-range neural connections. Instead, this paper reveals patterns of a highly dynamic and interconnected infant brain that change rapidly as a result of new, learnable experiences.

While genetic hearing loss is highly heterogeneous, understanding the requirement of each gene will lead to a better understanding of the molecular basis of hearing and also to therapeutic opportunities for deafness. The Neuroplastin (Nptn) gene, which encodes two protein isoforms Np55 and Np65, is required for hearing, and homozygous loss-of-function mutations that affect both isoforms lead to profound deafness in mice. Here we have utilised several distinct mouse models to elaborate upon the spatial, temporal, and functional requirement of Nptn for hearing. While we demonstrate that both Np55 and Np65 are present in cochlear cells, characterisation of a Np65-specific mouse knockout shows normal hearing thresholds indicating that Np65 is functionally redundant for hearing. In contrast, we find that Nptn-knockout mice have significantly reduced maximal MET currents and MET channel open probabilities in mature OHCs, with both OHCs and IHCs also failing to develop fully mature basolateral currents. Furthermore, comparing the hearing thresholds and IHC synapse structure of Nptn-knockout mice with those of mice that lack Nptn only in IHCs and OHCs shows that the majority of the auditory deficit is explained by hair cell dysfunction, with abnormal afferent synapses contributing only a small proportion of the hearing loss. Finally, we show that continued expression of NEUROPLASTIN in OHCs of adult mice is required for membrane localisation of Plasma Membrane Ca2+ ATPase 2 (PMCA2), which is essential for hearing function. Moreover, Nptn haploinsufficiency phenocopies Atp2b2 (encodes PMCA2) mutations, with heterozygous Nptn-knockout mice exhibiting hearing loss through genetic interaction with the Cdh23ahl allele. Together, our findings provide further insight to the functional requirement of Neuroplastin for mammalian hearing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">High-frequency changes in single-trial visual evoked potentials for unattended stimuli in chronic schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                Patients with schizophrenia reveal changes in information processing associated with external stimuli, which is reflected in the measurements of brain evoked potentials. We discuss actual knowledge on electro- (EEG) and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) changes in schizophrenia. The commonly used averaging technique entails the loss of information regarding the generation of evoked responses. We propose a methodology to describe single-trial (non-averaged) visual evoked potentials (VEP) using spectral and statistical analyses. We analysed EEG data registered in the O1-Cz and O2-Cz leads during unattended pattern-reversal stimulation, collected from a group of adult patients with chronic schizophrenia, and compared them to those of healthy individuals. Short-time single-trial VEP were transformed to the frequency domain using the FFT algorithm. Changes of the spectral power were visualized using spectrograms which were created by stacking single-trial spectra across all trials. Measures of the absolute and the relative spectral power were calculated and compared statistically. In schizophrenia, the energy density of VEP oscillations is shifted towards higher (gamma) frequencies, compared to healthy individuals. These differences are statistically significant in all analysed frequency bands for the relative power. This indicates distorted early processing of visual stimuli in schizophrenia. The presented observations complement the knowledge on gamma oscillations acquired from computationally more complex methods of time--frequency analysis.

                The cortico-basal ganglia circuit is needed to suppress prepotent actions and to facilitate controlled behavior. Under conditions of response conflict, the frontal cortex and subthalamic nucleus [STN] exhibit increased spiking and theta band power, which are linked to adaptive regulation of behavioral output. The electrophysiological mechanisms underlying these neural signatures of impulse control remain poorly understood. To address this lacuna, we constructed a novel large-scale, biophysically principled model of the subthalamopallidal [STN-Globus Pallidus externus (GPe)] network, and examined the mechanisms that modulate theta power and spiking in response to cortical input. Simulations confirmed that theta power does not emerge from intrinsic network dynamics but is robustly elicited in response to cortical input as burst events representing action selection dynamics. Rhythmic burst events of multiple cortical populations, representing a state of conflict where cortical motor plans vacillate in the theta range, led to prolonged STN theta and increased spiking, consistent with empirical literature. Notably, theta band signaling required NMDA, but not AMPA, currents, which were in turn related to a triphasic STN response characterized by spiking, silence and bursting periods. Finally, theta band resonance was also strongly modulated by architectural connectivity, with maximal theta arising when multiple cortical populations project to individual STN "conflict detector" units, due to an NMDA-dependent supralinear response. Our results provide insights into the biophysical principles and architectural constraints that give rise to STN dynamics during response conflict, and how their disruption can lead to impulsivity and compulsivity.

                Non-human primates, especially rhesus macaques, have been a dominant model to study sensorimotor control of the upper limbs. Indeed, human and macaques have similar hands and homologous neural circuits to mediate manual behavior. However, few studies have systematically and quantitatively compared the manual behaviors of the two species. Such comparison is critical for assessing the validity of using the macaque sensorimotor system as a model of its human counterpart. In this study, we systematically compared the prehensile behaviors of humans and rhesus macaques using an identical experimental setup. We found human and macaque prehension kinematics to be generally similar but with a few subtle differences. Humans and macaques have similar major axes of movements and similar kinematics subspaces. Human grasps are more object-specific and the movement of human digits are less correlated with each other. Monkeys demonstrate more stereotypical grasping behaviors that are common across all grasp conditions. Our results bolster the use of the macaque model to understand the neural mechanisms of manual dexterity.

                Many age-dependent neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, are characterised by abundant inclusions of amyloid filaments. Filamentous inclusions of the proteins tau, amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}), -synuclein and TDP-43 are the most common. Here, we used electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) structure determination to show that residues 120-254 of the lysosomal type II transmembrane protein 106B (TMEM106B) also form amyloid filaments in the human brain. We solved cryo-EM structures of TMEM106B filaments from the brains of 22 individuals with neurodegenerative conditions, including sporadic and inherited tauopathies, A{beta}-amyloidoses, synucleinopathies and TDP-43opathies, as well as from the brains of two neurologically normal individuals. We observed three different TMEM106B folds, with no clear relationship between folds and diseases. The presence of TMEM106B filaments correlated with that of a 29 kDa sarkosyl-insoluble fragment of the protein on Western blots. The presence of TMEM106B filaments in the brains of older, but not younger, neurologically normal individuals indicates that they form in an age-dependent manner.

                TWIK1 is a widely expressed pH-gated two-pore domain K+ channel (K2P) that contributes to cardiac rhythm generation and insulin release from pancreatic beta cells. TWIK1 displays unique properties among K2Ps including low basal activity and inhibition by extracellular protons through incompletely understood mechanisms. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of TWIK1 in lipid nanodiscs at high and low pH that reveal a novel gating mechanism at the K+ selectivity filter. At high pH, TWIK1 adopts an open conformation. At low pH, protonation of an extracellular histidine results in a cascade of conformational changes that close the channel by sealing the top of the selectivity filter, displacing the helical cap to block extracellular ion access pathways, and opening gaps for lipid block of the intracellular cavity. These data provide a mechanistic understanding for extracellular pH-gating of TWIK1 and show how diverse mechanisms have evolved to gate the selectivity filter of K+ channels.

                In everyday behavior, sensory systems are in constant competition for attentional resources, but the cellular and circuit-level mechanisms of modality-selective attention remain largely uninvestigated. We conducted translaminar recordings in mouse auditory cortex (AC) during an audiovisual (AV) attention shifting task. Attending to sound elements in an AV stream reduced both pre-stimulus and stimulus-evoked spiking activity, primarily in deep layer neurons. Despite reduced spiking, stimulus decoder accuracy was preserved, suggesting improved sound encoding efficiency. Similarly, task-irrelevant probe stimuli during intertrial intervals evoked fewer spikes without impairing stimulus encoding, indicating that these attention influences generalized beyond training stimuli. Importantly, these spiking reductions predicted trial-to-trial behavioral accuracy during auditory attention, but not visual attention. Together, these findings suggest auditory attention facilitates sound discrimination by filtering sound-irrelevant spiking in AC, and that the deepest cortical layers may serve as a hub for integrating extramodal contextual information.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Functional but not obligatory link between microsaccades and neural modulation by covert spatial attention</a></h4>

              
                Covert spatial attention is associated with spatially specific modulation of neural activity as well as with directional biases in fixational eye-movements known as microsaccades. Recently, this link has been suggested to be obligatory, such that modulation of neural activity by covert spatial attention occurs only when paired with microsaccades toward the attended location. Here we revisited this link between microsaccades and neural modulation by covert spatial attention in humans. We investigated spatial modulation of 8-12 Hz EEG alpha activity and microsaccades in a context with no incentive for overt gaze behaviour: when attention is directed internally within the spatial layout of visual working memory. In line with a common attentional origin, we show that spatial modulations of alpha activity and microsaccades co-vary: alpha lateralisation is stronger in trials with microsaccades toward compared to away from the memorised location of the to-be-attended item and occurs earlier in trials with earlier microsaccades toward this item. Critically, however, trials without attention-driven microsaccades nevertheless showed clear spatial modulation of alpha activity - comparable to the neural modulation observed in trials with attention-driven microsaccades. Thus, directional biases in microsaccades are correlated with neural signatures of covert spatial attention, but they are not a prerequisite for neural modulation by covert spatial attention to be manifest.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortico-striatal activity characterizes human safety learning via Pavlovian conditioned inhibition</a></h4>

              
                Safety learning generates associative links between neutral stimuli and the absence of threat, promoting the inhibition of fear and security-seeking behaviours. Precisely how safety learning is mediated at the level of underlying brain systems, particularly in humans, remains unclear. Here, we integrated a novel Pavlovian conditioned inhibition task with ultra-high field (UHF) fMRI to examine the neural basis of inhibitory safety learning in 49 healthy participants. In our task, participants were conditioned to two safety signals: a conditioned inhibitor that predicted threat-omission when paired with a known threat signal (A+/AX-), and a standard safety signal that generally predicted threat-omission (BC-). Both safety signals evoked equivalent autonomic and subjective learning responses but diverged strongly in terms of underlying brain activation. The conditioned inhibitor was characterized by more prominent activation of the dorsal striatum, anterior insular and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex compared to the standard safety signal, whereas the latter evoked greater activation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate and hippocampus, among other regions. Further analyses of the conditioned inhibitor indicated that its initial learning was characterized by consistent engagement of dorsal striatal, midbrain, thalamic, premotor, and prefrontal subregions. These findings suggest that safety learning via conditioned inhibition involves a distributed cortico-striatal circuitry, separable from broader cortical regions involved with processing standard safety signals (e.g., CS-). This cortico-striatal system could represent a novel neural substrate of safety learning, underlying the initial generation of stimulus-safety associations, distinct from wider cortical correlates of safety processing, which facilitate the behavioral outcomes of learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Depth-targeted intracortical microstroke by two-photon photothrombosis in rodent brain</a></h4>

              
                Significance: Photothrombosis is a widely used model of ischemic stroke in rodent experiments. In the photothromboris model, the photosensitizer Rose Bengal is systemically introduced to the blood stream and activated by green light to induce aggregation of platelets that eventually cause vessel occlusion. Since the activation of Rose Bengal is a one-photon phenomenon and the molecules in the illuminated area (light path) are subject to excitation, targeting of thrombosis is unspecific especially in the depth dimension. We have developed a photothrombosis protocol that can target a single vessel in the cortical parenchyma by two-photon excitation. Aim: We aim to induce a thrombotic stroke in the cortical parenchyma by two-photon activation of Rose Bengal so that we confine photothrombosis within a vessel of a target depth. Approach: FITC-dextran is injected into the blood stream to visualize the cerebral blood flow in anesthetized adult mice with a cranial window. After a target vessel is chosen by two-photon imaging (950 nm), Rose Bengal is injected into the blood stream. The scanning wavelength is changed to 720 nm and photothrombosis was induced by scanning the target vessel. Results: Two-photon depth-targeted single vessel photothrombosis was achieved with a success rate of 84.9+/-1.7% within 80 s. Attempts without Rose Bengal (i.e., only with FITC) did not result in photothrombosis at the excitation wavelength of 720 nm. Conclusions: We described a protocol that achieves depth-targeted single vessel photothrombosis by two-photon excitation. Simultaneous imaging of blood flow in the targeted vessel using FITC dextran enabled the confirmation of vessel occlusion and prevention of excess irradiation that possibly induces unintended photodamage.

                Modelling sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD) with patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is challenging yet remains an important step in understanding the disease. Here we report a novel approach of sAD modelling with patient iPSC-derived neurons by integrating cellular and clinical phenotypes from individual early symptomatic sAD patients. We establish a correlation between cellular vulnerability to extrinsic amyloid-beta in vitro measured by synapse loss with clinical vulnerability to amyloid-beta burden in vivo measured by cognitive decline and brain activity levels. Our findings indicate that patient iPSC-derived neurons not only preserve some pathological phenotypes of disease measured in the people they were derived from, but also preserve, from people to cells, the impact of those pathological phenotypes on function. Cellular models that reflect an individual's in-life clinical vulnerability thus represent a tractable method of sAD modelling using clinical data in combination with cellular phenotypes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Semantic relation priming is not constituent-specific: Evidence from ERP</a></h4>

              
                It is humankind's unique wisdom to compose a limited number of words together through specific rules to convey endless information. Researchers have found that this composition process also plays a vital role in the comprehension of compounds. The specific manifestation is relation priming; that is, the previously used relation will promote subsequent word processing using the same relation. This priming phenomenon is bound to morpheme repetition (modifier or head). This study combines a self-paced priming paradigm with electrophysiological technology to explore whether relation priming will occur without sharing morphemes and its time course. We found that relation priming can occur independently of morpheme-repetition, which shows an independent representation of relation information. And it has been activated at a very early stage (about 200ms). As the word processing progresses, this activation gradually strengthens, indicating that the relation's role is slowly increasing in the process of compound word recognition. It may first be used as a kind of context information to help determine the constituent morphemes' meaning. After the meaning access of the constituent morphemes, they begin to play a role in the semantic composition process. This study uses electrophysiological technology to precisely describe the representation of relation and its time course for the first time. Which gives us a deeper understanding of the relation priming process, and at the same time, sheds light on the meaning construction process of compounds.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">NIfTI-MRS: A standard format for magnetic resonance spectroscopic data</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: The use of multiple data formats in the MRS community currently hinders data sharing and integration. NIfTI-MRS is proposed as a standard MR spectroscopy data format, which is implemented as an extension to the neuroimaging informatics technology initiative (NIfTI) format. Using this standardised format will facilitate data sharing, ease algorithm development, and encourage the integration of MRS analysis with other imaging modalities. Methods: A file format based on the NIfTI header extension framework was designed to incorporate essential spectroscopic metadata and additional encoding dimensions. A detailed description of the specification is provided. An open-source command-line conversion program is implemented to enable conversion of single-voxel and spectroscopic imaging data to NIfTI-MRS. To provide visualisation of data in NIfTI-MRS, a dedicated plugin is implemented for FSLeyes, the FSL image viewer. Results: Alongside online documentation, ten example datasets are provided in the proposed format. In addition, minimal examples of NIfTI-MRS readers have been implemented. The conversion software, spec2nii, currently converts fourteen formats to NIfTI-MRS, including DICOM and vendor proprietary formats. Conclusion: The proposed format aims to solve the issue of multiple data formats being used in the MRS community. By providing a single conversion point, it aims to simplify the processing and analysis of MRS data, thereby lowering the barrier to use of MRS. Furthermore, it can serve as the basis for open data sharing, collaboration, and interoperability of analysis programs. It also opens possibility of greater standardisation and harmonisation. By aligning with the dominant format in neuroimaging, NIfTI-MRS enables the use of mature tools present in the imaging community, demonstrated in this work by using a dedicated imaging tool, FSLeyes, as a viewer.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">What happened when? Brain and behavioral responses to violated expectations about the structure and content of episodic memories</a></h4>

              
                Episodic memories are not static but can be modified on the basis of new experiences, potentially allowing us to make valid predictions in the face of an ever-changing environment. Recent research has identified mnemonic prediction errors as a possible trigger for such modifications. In the present study, we investigated the influence of different types of mnemonic prediction errors on brain activity and subsequent memory performance using a novel paradigm for episodic modification. Participants encoded different episodes which consisted of short toy stories. During a subsequent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) session, episodic retrieval was cued by presenting videos showing the original episodes, or modified versions thereof. In modified videos either the order of two subsequent action steps was changed (violating structure expectancy) or an object was exchanged for another (violating content expectancy). While brain responses to structure expectancy violations were only subtle, content expectancy violations recruited brain areas relevant for processing of new object information. In a post-fMRI memory test, the participants' tendency to accept modified episodes as originally encoded increased significantly when they had experienced expectancy violations during the fMRI session. Our study provides valuable initial insights into the neural processing of different types of mnemonic prediction errors and their influence on subsequent memory.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Lipophorin receptors regulate mushroom bodies development and participate in learning, memory, and sleep in flies</a></h4>

              
                Drosophila melanogaster Lipophorin Receptors, LpR1 and LpR2, mediate lipid uptake. The orthologs of these receptors in vertebrates, ApoER2 and VLDL-R, bind Reelin, a glycoprotein not present in flies. These receptors are associated with the development and function of the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, important association areas in the mammalian brain. It is currently unknown whether LpRs play similar roles in the Drosophila brain. We report that LpR-deficient flies exhibit impaired olfactory memory and sleep patterns, which seem to reflect anatomical defects found in a critical brain association area, the Mushroom Bodies (MB). Moreover, cultured MB neurons respond to mammalian Reelin by increasing the complexity of their neurites. This effect depends on LpRs and Dab, the Drosophila ortholog of the reelin signaling adaptor protein Dab1. In vitro, two of the long isoforms of LpRs allow the internalization of Reelin. Overall, these findings demonstrate that LpRs contribute to MB development and function, supporting the existence of LpR-dependent signaling in Drosophila.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Necroptosis inhibition counteracts axonal degeneration, cognitive decline and key hallmarks of aging, promoting brain rejuvenation.</a></h4>

              
                Age is the main risk factor for cognitive impairment and the development of neurodegenerative diseases. In the aged brain, axonal degeneration is an early pathological event, preceding neuronal dysfunction and brain disabilities in humans, primates, rodents, and invertebrates. Necroptosis activation mediates degeneration of mechanical and chemically injured axons, but whether this pathway triggers axonal degeneration and cognitive impairment during brain aging has not been studied. Here we show that necroptosis is activated in the hippocampus during aging, especially in axonal tracts. Loss of the main necroptotic effector, Mlkl, was sufficient to delay age-associated axonal degeneration. Accordingly, aged Mlkl-KO mice also displayed a youthful phenotype at the synaptic and functional level, protecting against decreased synaptic transmission and memory decline. Short-term pharmacologic inhibition of necroptosis by targeting RIPK3 in aged mice, proved to be extraordinarily effective at reverting axonal degeneration and hippocampal-dependent functional impairment at the electrophysiological and behavioral level. Remarkably, a comprehensive quantitative proteomic analysis uncovered a set of aging hallmarks that were recovered in both, the genetic and pharmacologic models of necroptosis inhibition, including molecular biofunctions associated with brain rejuvenation. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that necroptosis contributes to the age-associated deterioration of axonal integrity, affecting hippocampal neuronal connectivity and cognitive function in aged individuals. We therefore propose necroptosis as an attractive target for the future development of geroprotective tools to treat age-related disabilities.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reliability of quantitative multiparameter maps is high for MT and PD but attenuated for R1 and R2* in healthy young adults</a></h4>

              
                We investigate the reliability of individual differences of four quantities measured by magnetic resonance imaging based multiparameter mapping (MPM): magnetization transfer (MT), proton density (PD), longitudinal relaxation rate (R1), and effective transverse relaxation rate (R2*). A total of four MPM datasets, two on each of two consecutive days, were acquired in healthy young adults. On Day 1, no repositioning occurred; on Day 2, participants were repositioned between MPM datasets. Using intra-class correlation effect decomposition (ICED), we assessed the contributions of session-specific, day-specific, and residual sources of measurement error. For whole-brain gray and white matter, all four MPM parameters showed high reproducibility and high reliability, as indexed by the coefficient of variation (CoV) and the intra-class correlation (ICC). However, MT, PD, R1, and R2* differed markedly in the extent to which reliability varied across brain regions. MT and PD showed high reliability in almost all regions. In contrast, R1 and R2* showed low reliability in some regions outside the basal ganglia, such that the sum of the measurement error estimates in our structural equation model was higher than estimates of between-person differences. In sum, in this sample of healthy young adults, the four MPM parameters showed very little variability over four measurements over two days but differed in how well they could assess between-person differences. We conclude that R1 and R2* might carry only limited person-specific information in samples of healthy young adults, and, by implication, might be of restricted utility for studying associations to between-person differences in behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Real-time computation of transcranial magnetic stimulation electric fields using self-supervised deep learning</a></h4>

              
                Background: Electric fields (E-fields) induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can be modeled using partial differential equations (PDEs) with boundary conditions. However, existing numerical methods to solve PDEs for computing E-fields are usually computationally expensive. It often takes minutes to compute a high-resolution E-field using state-of-the-art finite-element methods (FEM). Methods: We developed a self-supervised deep learning (DL) method to compute precise TMS E-fields in real-time. Given a head model and the primary E-field generated by TMS coils, a self-supervised DL model was built to generate a E-field by minimizing a loss function that measures how well the generated E-field fits the governing PDE and Neumann boundary condition. The DL model was trained in a self-supervised manner, which does not require any external supervision. We evaluated the DL model using both a simulated sphere head model and realistic head models of 125 individuals and compared the accuracy and computational efficiency of the DL model with a state-of-the-art FEM. Results: In realistic head models, the DL model obtained accurate E-fields with significantly smaller PDE residual and boundary condition residual than the FEM (p<0.002, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). The DL model was computationally efficient, which took about 0.30 seconds on average to compute the E-field for one testing individual. The DL model built for the simulated sphere head model also obtained an accurate E-field whose difference from the analytical E-fields was 0.004, more accurate than the solution obtained using the FEM. Conclusions: We have developed a self-supervised DL model to directly learn a mapping from the magnetic vector potential of a TMS coil and a realistic head model to the TMS induced E-fields, facilitating real-time, precise TMS E-field modeling.

                Imaging the infant brain with MRI has improved our understanding of early stages of neurodevelopment. However, head motion during MRI acquisition is detrimental to both functional and structural MRI scan quality. Though infants are commonly scanned while asleep, they commonly exhibit motion during scanning, causing data loss. Our group has shown that providing MRI technicians with real-time motion estimates via Framewise Integrated Real-Time MRI Monitoring (FIRMM) software helps obtain high-quality, low motion fMRI data. By estimating head motion in real time and displaying motion metrics to the MR technician during an fMRI scan, FIRMM can improve scanning efficiency. Hence, we compared average framewise displacement (FD), a proxy for head motion, and the amount of usable fMRI data (FD [&le;] 0.2mm) in infants scanned with (n = 407) and without FIRMM (n = 295). Using a mixed-effects model, we found that the addition of FIRMM to current state-of-the-art infant scanning protocols significantly increased the amount of usable fMRI data acquired per infant, demonstrating its value for research and clinical infant neuroimaging.

                Bidirectional transmission of mechanical and biochemical signals is integral to cell-environment communication and underlies the function of Schwann cells, the myelinating glia of the peripheral nervous system. As major integrators of "outside-in" signaling, Rho GTPases link actin cytoskeleton dynamics with cellular architecture to regulate adhesion and cell deformation. Using Schwann cell-specific gene inactivation, we discovered that RhoA promotes the initiation of myelination, axonal wrapping and axial spreading of Schwann cells, and is later required to restrict myelin growth in peripheral nerves. These effects are mediated by modulation of actomyosin contractility, actin dynamics and cortical actin-membrane attachment, which collectively couple tensional forces to intracellular signaling that regulate axon-Schwann cell interaction and myelin synthesis. This work establishes RhoA as an intrinsic regulator of a biomechanical response that controls the switch of Schwann cells towards the myelinating and the homeostatic states.

                Patterns of endogenous activity in the brain reflect a stochastic exploration of the neuronal state space that is constrained by the underlying assembly organization of neurons. Yet it remains to be shown that this interplay between neurons and their assembly dynamics indeed suffices to generate whole-brain data statistics. Here we recorded the activity from ~40,000 neurons simultaneously in zebrafish larvae, and show that a data-driven network model of neuron-assembly interactions can accurately reproduce the mean activity and pairwise correlation statistics of their spontaneous activity. This model, the compositional Restricted Boltzmann Machine, unveils ~200 neural assemblies, which compose neurophysiological circuits and whose various combinations form successive brain states. From this, we mathematically derived an interregional functional connectivity matrix, which is conserved across individual animals and correlates well with structural connectivity. This novel, assembly-based generative model of brain-wide neural dynamics enables physiology-bound perturbation experiments in silico.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Learning enhances behaviorally relevant representations in apical dendrites</a></h4>

              
                Learning alters cortical representations and improves perception. Apical tuft dendrites in Layer 1, which are unique in their connectivity and biophysical properties, may be a key site of learning-induced plasticity. We used both two-photon and SCAPE microscopy to longitudinally track tuft-wide calcium spikes in apical dendrites of Layer 5 pyramidal neurons as mice learned a tactile behavior. Mice were trained to discriminate two orthogonal directions of whisker stimulation. Reinforcement learning, but not repeated stimulus exposure, enhanced tuft selectivity for both directions equally, even though only one was associated with reward. Selective tufts emerged from initially unresponsive or low-selectivity populations. Animal movement and choice did not account for changes in stimulus selectivity. Enhanced selectivity persisted even after rewards were removed and animals ceased performing the task. We conclude that learning produces long-lasting realignment of apical dendrite tuft responses to behaviorally relevant dimensions of a task.

	<p>The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a paracrine RAS within the central nervous system (CNS) and is closely related to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The endogenous hexapeptide angiotensin IV (Ang IV), an important component of the brain RAS, was found to rescue cognitive impairment and recover memory in previous studies. In our study, we used different doses of Dihexa, which can be orally administered and cross the BBB in APP/PS1 mice. We found that the amount of AngIV in mouse tissue increased after the administration of Dihexa compared to that in the WT group. Meanwhile, Dihexa restored spatial learning and cognitive functions in the Morris water maze test. Dihexa increased the neuronal cells and the expression of SYP protein in APP/PS1 mice in Nissl staining. Furthermore, Dihexa decreased the activation of astrocytes and microglia, markedly reduced levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α and increased the levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Dihexa activated the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, while PI3K inhibitor wortmannin significantly reversed the anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects of APP/PS1 mice. These findings highlight the brain AngIV/PI3K/AKT axis as a potential target for the treatment of AD.</p>

	<p>MRI studies have consistently identified atrophy patterns in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) through a whole-brain voxel-based analysis, but efforts to investigate morphometric profiles using anatomically standardized and automated whole-brain ROI analyses, performed at the individual subject space, are still lacking. In this study we aimed (i) to utilize atlas-derived measurements of cortical thickness and subcortical volumes, including of the hippocampal subfields, to identify atrophy patterns in early-stage AD, and (ii) to compare cognitive profiles at baseline and during a one-year follow-up of those previously identified morphometric AD subtypes to predict disease progression. Through a prospectively recruited multi-center study, conducted at four Austrian sites, 120 patients were included with probable AD, a disease onset beyond 60 years and a clinical dementia rating of ≤1. Morphometric measures of T1-weighted images were obtained using FreeSurfer. A principal component and subsequent cluster analysis identified four morphometric subtypes, including (i) hippocampal predominant (30.8%), (ii) hippocampal-temporo-parietal (29.2%), (iii) parieto-temporal (hippocampal sparing, 20.8%) and (iv) hippocampal-temporal (19.2%) atrophy patterns that were associated with phenotypes differing predominately in the presentation and progression of verbal memory and visuospatial impairments. These morphologically distinct subtypes are based on standardized brain regions, which are anatomically defined and freely accessible so as to validate its diagnostic accuracy and enhance the prediction of disease progression.</p>

	<p>Persecutory ideations are self-referential delusions of being the target of malevolence despite a lack of evidence. Wisner et al. (2021) found that reduced connectivity between the left frontoparietal (lFP) network and parts of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) correlated with increased persecutory behaviors among psychotic patients performing in an economic social decision-making task that can measure the anticipation of a partner’s spiteful behavior. If this pattern could be observed in the resting state, it would suggest a functional-structural prior predisposing individuals to persecutory ideation. Forty-four patients in the early course of a psychotic disorder provided data for resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging across nine brain networks that included the FP network and a similar OFC region. As predicted, we found a significant and negative correlation between the lFP–OFC at rest and the level of suspicious mistrust on the decision-making task using a within-group correlational design. Additionally, self-reported persecutory ideation correlated significantly with the connectivity between the right frontoparietal (rFP) network and the OFC. We extended the previous finding of reduced connectivity between the lFP network and the OFC in psychosis patients to the resting state, and observed a possible hemispheric difference, such that greater rFP–OFC connectivity predicted elevated self-reported persecutory ideation, suggesting potential differences between the lFP and rFP roles in persecutory social interactions.</p>

	<p>The exposure to relevant social and/or historical events can increase the generation of false memories (FMs). The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a calamity challenging health, political, and journalistic bodies, with media generating confusion that has facilitated the spread of fake news. In this respect, our study aims at investigating the relationships between memories (true memories, TMs vs. FMs) for COVID-19-related news and different individual variables (i.e., use of traditional and social media, COVID-19 perceived and objective knowledge, fear of the disease, depression and anxiety symptoms, reasoning skills, and coping mechanisms). One hundred and seventy-one university students (131 females) were surveyed. Overall, our results suggested that depression and anxiety symptoms, reasoning skills, and coping mechanisms did not affect the formation of FMs. Conversely, the fear of loved ones contracting the infection was found to be negatively associated with FMs. This finding might be due to an empathy/prosociality-based positive bias boosting memory abilities, also explained by the young age of participants. Furthermore, objective knowledge (i) predicted an increase in TMs and decrease in FMs and (ii) significantly mediated the relationships between the use of social media and development of both TMs and FMs. In particular, higher levels of objective knowledge strengthened the formation of TMs and decreased the development of FMs following use of social media. These results may lead to reconsidering the idea of social media as the main source of fake news. This claim is further supported by either the lack of substantial differences between the use of traditional and social media among participants reporting FMs or the positive association between use of social media and levels of objective knowledge. The knowledge about the topic rather than the type of source would make a difference in the process of memory formation.</p>

	<p>Prism adaptation (PA) is one of the most effective treatments for the rehabilitation of unilateral spatial neglect. Optokinetic stimulation (OKS) has also been demonstrated to be effective in ameliorating symptoms of neglect. The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of these two methods in a group of neglect patients using a crossover design. A group of 13 post-acute brain-damaged patients with unilateral spatial neglect, who had never been rehabilitated, were treated using PA and OKS. Each treatment was applied for 10 sessions, twice a day, to all patients with both treatments in crossed order (i.e., PA followed by OKS or vice versa). Neuropsychological assessments were performed: before the first (T1), at the end of the first/beginning of the second (T2) and at the end of the second training sessions (T3), and two weeks after the end of treatment (T4). Both procedures produced a significant improvement in clinical tests at T2, independent of the type of training. The results suggest that either PA or OKS induces a significant amelioration of neglect in right brain-damaged patients, mainly in the first block of treatment. Since no differences between treatments were found, they could be applied in clinical practice, according to the requirements of the individual patient.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Circadian rhythmicity in mammals is sustained by the central brain clock—the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus (SCN), entrained to the ambient light–dark conditions through a dense retinal input. However, recent discoveries of autonomous clock gene expression cast doubt on the supremacy of the SCN and suggest circadian timekeeping mechanisms devolve to local brain clocks. Here, we use a combination of molecular, electrophysiological, and optogenetic tools to evaluate intrinsic clock properties of the main retinorecipient thalamic center—the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in male rats and mice. We identify the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus as a slave oscillator, which exhibits core clock gene expression exclusively <i>in vivo</i>. Additionally, we provide compelling evidence for intrinsic clock gene expression accompanied by circadian variation in neuronal activity in the intergeniculate leaflet and ventrolateral geniculate nucleus (VLG). Finally, our optogenetic experiments propose the VLG as a light-entrainable oscillator, whose phase may be advanced by retinal input at the beginning of the projected night. Altogether, this study for the first time demonstrates autonomous timekeeping mechanisms shaping circadian physiology of the LGN.</p>

                Background: Nowadays, we are facing a disease caused by SARS-CoV- 2, known globally as COVID-19, which is considered a threat to global health due to its high contagiousness and rapid spread. Methods: Analytical cross-sectional study in 302 health professionals. An online questionnaire consisting of questions about knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19 was applied. Socio- demographic, occupational and comorbidities factors were explored. Simple and multiple logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with KAP. Results: Of the total, 25.2%, 31.5% and 37.4% had high levels of knowledge, preventive practices and risk perception attitudes respectively. Being married aOR=6.75 CI(1.46-31.2) p=0.014, having a master's degree aOR=0.4, CI(0.21-0.80) p=0.009, having a working day with less than ten hours ORa=0.49 CI(0.25-0.95) p=0.036 and obesity aOR=0.38 CI (0.15-0.95) p=0.039 were associated with a low level of knowledge of COVID-19. The variables associated with preventive practices were being over the age of 50 aOR=0.52 CI(0.27-0.98) p=0.007, working in the hospitalization area aOR=1.86 CI(1.08-3.18) p= 0.018 and having comorbidities such as arterial hypertension aOR=0.28 CI(0.081-0.99) p=0.02 and obesity aOR=0.35 CI(0.14-0.83) p=0.019. In relation to negative attitudes towards COVID-19, it was found that physical contact with patients with a confirmed diagnosis aOR=1.84 CI (1.14-2.97) p=0.006 and having asthma aOR=2.13 CI(1.081-4.22) p=0.029 were associated with these attitudes. Conclusion: Our study revealed that health professionals have an insufficient level of knowledge of COVID-19. This is why we recommend implementing strategies such as health literacy programs among health care workers. Thus, they can help develop positive

                <p>Glutamatergic synapses are key cellular sites where cocaine experience creates memory traces that subsequently promote cocaine craving and seeking. In addition to making across-the-board synaptic adaptations, cocaine experience also generates a discrete population of new synapses that selectively encode cocaine memories. These new synapses are glutamatergic synapses that lack functionally stable AMPARs, often referred to as AMPAR-silent synapses or, simply, silent synapses. They are generated <I>de novo</I> in the NAc by cocaine experience. After drug withdrawal, some of these synapses mature by recruiting AMPARs, contributing to the consolidation of cocaine-associated memory. After cue-induced retrieval of cocaine memories, matured silent synapses alternate between two dynamic states (AMPAR-absent vs AMPAR-containing) that correspond with the behavioral manifestations of destabilization and reconsolidation of these memories. Here, we review the molecular mechanisms underlying silent synapse dynamics during behavior, discuss their contributions to circuit remodeling, and analyze their role in cocaine-memory-driven behaviors. We also propose several mechanisms through which silent synapses can form neuronal ensembles as well as cross-region circuit engrams for cocaine-specific behaviors. These perspectives lead to our hypothesis that cocaine-generated silent synapses stand as a distinct set of synaptic substrates encoding key aspects of cocaine memory that drive cocaine relapse.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">DNA Repair Inhibition Leads to Active Export of Repetitive Sequences to the Cytoplasm Triggering an Inflammatory Response</a></h4>

              
                <p>Adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases are often accompanied by evidence of a chronic inflammation that includes activation of microglial cells and altered levels of brain cytokines. Aspects of this response are likely secondary reactions to neurodegeneration, but for many illnesses the inflammation may itself be an early and even causative disease event. In such cases, the inflammation is referred to as "sterile" as it occurs in the absence of an actual bacterial or viral pathogen. A potent trigger of sterile inflammation in CNS microglia has been shown to be the presence of DNA in the cytoplasm (cytoDNA) induced either by direct DNA damage or by inhibited DNA repair. We have shown that cytoDNA comes from the cell nucleus as a result of insufficient DNA damage repair. Using wild-type and <I>Atm</I><sup>-/-</sup> mouse microglia, we extend these observations here by showing that its genomic origins are not random, but rather are heavily biased toward transcriptionally inactive, intergenic regions, in particular repetitive elements and AT-rich sequences. Once released from the genome, in both males and females, we show that cytoDNA is actively exported to the cytoplasm by a CRM1-dependent mechanism. In the cytoplasm, it is degraded either by a cytosolic exonuclease, Trex1, or an autophagy pathway that ends with degradation in the lysosome. Blocking the accumulation of cytoDNA prevents the emergence of the sterile inflammation reaction. These findings offer new insights into the emergence of sterile inflammation and offer novel approaches that may be of use in combatting a wide range of neurodegenerative conditions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Sterile inflammation describes a state where the defenses of the immune system are activated in the absence of a true pathogen. A potent trigger of this unorthodox response is the presence of DNA in the cytoplasm, which immune cells interpret as an invading virus or pathogen. We show that when DNA damage increases, fragments of the cell's own genome are actively exported to the cytoplasm where they are normally degraded. If this degradation is incomplete an immune reaction is triggered. Both age and stress increase DNA damage, and as age-related neurodegenerative diseases are frequently accompanied by a chronic low-level inflammation, strategies that reduce the induction of cytoplasmic DNA or speed its clearance become attractive therapeutic targets.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Developmental Shifts in Amygdala Activity during a High Social Drive State</a></h4>

              
                <p>Amygdala abnormalities characterize several psychiatric disorders with prominent social deficits and often emerge during adolescence. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) bidirectionally modulates social behavior and has increased sensitivity during adolescence. We tested how an environmentally-driven social state is regulated by the BLA in adults and adolescent male rats. We found that a high social drive state caused by brief social isolation increases age-specific social behaviors and increased BLA neuronal activity. Chemogenetic inactivation of BLA decreased the effect of high social drive on social engagement. High social drive preferentially enhanced BLA activity during social engagement; however, the effect of social opportunity on BLA activity was greater during adolescence. While this identifies a substrate underlying age differences in social drive, we then determined that high social drive increased BLA NMDA GluN2B expression and sensitivity to antagonism increased with age. Further, the effect of a high social drive state on BLA activity during social engagement was diminished by GluN2B blockade in an age-dependent manner. These results demonstrate the necessity of the BLA for environmentally driven social behavior, its sensitivity to social opportunity, and uncover a maturing role for BLA and its GluN2B receptors in social engagement.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Social engagement during adolescence is a key component of healthy development. Social drive provides the impetus for social engagement and abnormalities underlie social symptoms of depression and anxiety. While adolescence is characterized by transitions in social drive and social environment sensitivity, little is known about the neural basis for these changes. We found that amygdala activity is uniquely sensitive to social environment during adolescence compared with adulthood, and is required for expression of heightened social drive. In addition, the neural substrates shift toward NMDA dependence in adulthood. These results are the first to demonstrate a unique neural signature of higher social drive and begin to uncover the underlying factors that heighten social engagement during adolescence.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Extensive Structural Remodeling of the Axonal Arbors of Parvalbumin Basket Cells during Development in Mouse Neocortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Parvalbumin-containing (PV<sup>+</sup>) basket cells are specialized cortical interneurons that regulate the activity of local neuronal circuits with high temporal precision and reliability. To understand how the PV<sup>+</sup> interneuron connectivity underlying these functional properties is established during development, we used array tomography to map pairs of synaptically connected PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons and postsynaptic neurons from the neocortex of mice of both sexes. We focused on the axon-myelin unit of the PV<sup>+</sup> interneuron and quantified the number of synapses onto the postsynaptic neuron, length of connecting axonal paths, and their myelination at different time points between 2 weeks and 7 months of age. We find that myelination of the proximal axon occurs very rapidly during the third and, to a lesser extent, fourth postnatal weeks. The number of synaptic contacts made by the PV<sup>+</sup> interneuron on its postsynaptic partner meanwhile is significantly reduced to about one-third by the end of the first postnatal month. The number of autapses, the synapses that PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons form on themselves, however, remains constant throughout the examined period. Axon reorganizations continue beyond postnatal month 2, with the postsynaptic targets of PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons gradually shifting to more proximal locations, and the length of axonal paths and their myelin becoming conspicuously uniform per connection. These continued microcircuit refinements likely provide the structural substrate for the robust inhibitory effects and fine temporal precision of adult PV<sup>+</sup> basket cells.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The axon of adult parvalbumin-containing (PV<sup>+</sup>) interneurons is highly specialized for fast and reliable neurotransmission. It is myelinated and forms synapses mostly onto the cell bodies and proximal dendrites of postsynaptic neurons for maximal impact. In this study, we follow the development of the PV<sup>+</sup> interneuron axon, its myelination and synapse formation, revealing a rapid sequence of axonal reorganization, myelination of the PV<sup>+</sup> interneuron proximal axon, and pruning of almost two-thirds of the synapses in an individual connection. This is followed by a prolonged period of axon refinement and additional myelination leading to a remarkable precision of connections in the adult mouse cortex, consistent with the temporal precision and fidelity of PV<sup>+</sup> interneuron action.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Single-Unit Recordings Reveal the Selectivity of a Human Face Area</a></h4>

              
                <p>The exquisite capacity of primates to detect and recognize faces is crucial for social interactions. Although disentangling the neural basis of human face recognition remains a key goal in neuroscience, direct evidence at the single-neuron level is limited. We recorded from face-selective neurons in human visual cortex in a region characterized by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activations for faces compared with objects. The majority of visually responsive neurons in this fMRI activation showed strong selectivity at short latencies for faces compared with objects. Feature-scrambled faces and face-like objects could also drive these neurons, suggesting that this region is not tightly tuned to the visual attributes that typically define whole human faces. These single-cell recordings within the human face processing system provide vital experimental evidence linking previous imaging studies in humans and invasive studies in animal models.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We present the first recordings of face-selective neurons in or near an fMRI-defined patch in human visual cortex. Our unbiased multielectrode array recordings (i.e., no selection of neurons based on a search strategy) confirmed the validity of the BOLD contrast (faces&ndash;objects) in humans, a finding with implications for all human imaging studies. By presenting faces, feature-scrambled faces, and face-pareidolia (perceiving faces in inanimate objects) stimuli, we demonstrate that neurons at this level of the visual hierarchy are broadly tuned to the features of a face, independent of spatial configuration and low-level visual attributes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dynamic Recovery: GABA Agonism Restores Neural Variability in Older, Poorer Performing Adults</a></h4>

              
                <p>Aging is associated with cognitive impairment, but there are large individual differences in these declines. One neural measure that is lower in older adults and predicts these individual differences is moment-to-moment brain signal variability. Testing the assumption that GABA should heighten neural variability, we examined whether reduced brain signal variability in older, poorer performing adults could be boosted by increasing GABA pharmacologically. Brain signal variability was estimated using fMRI in 20 young and 24 older healthy human adults during placebo and GABA agonist sessions. As expected, older adults exhibited lower signal variability at placebo, and, crucially, GABA agonism boosted older adults' variability to the levels of young adults. Furthermore, poorer performing older adults experienced a greater increase in variability on drug, suggesting that those with more to gain benefit the most from GABA system potentiation. GABA may thus serve as a core neurochemical target in future work on aging- and cognition-related human brain dynamics.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Prior research indicates that moment-to-moment brain signal variability is lower in older, poorer performing adults. We found that this reduced brain signal variability could be boosted through GABA agonism in older adults to the levels of young adults and that this boost was largest in the poorer performing older adults. These results provide the first evidence that brain signal variability can be restored by increasing GABAergic activity and suggest the promise of developing interventions targeting inhibitory systems to help slow cognitive declines in healthy aging.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Does Hemispheric Asymmetry Reduction in Older Adults in Motor Cortex Reflect Compensation?</a></h4>

              
                <p>Older adults tend to display greater brain activation in the nondominant hemisphere during even basic sensorimotor responses. It is debated whether this hemispheric asymmetry reduction in older adults (HAROLD) reflects a compensatory mechanism. Across two independent fMRI experiments involving adult life span human samples (<I>N</I> = 586 and <I>N</I> = 81, approximately half female) who performed right-hand finger responses, we distinguished between these hypotheses using behavioral and multivariate Bayes (MVB) decoding approaches. Standard univariate analyses replicated a HAROLD pattern in motor cortex, but in and out of scanner behavioral results both demonstrated evidence against a compensatory relationship in that reaction time measures of task performance in older adults did not relate to ipsilateral motor activity. Likewise, MVB showed that this increased ipsilateral activity in older adults did not carry additional information, and if anything, combining ipsilateral with contralateral activity patterns reduced action decoding in older adults (at least in experiment 1). These results contradict the hypothesis that HAROLD is compensatory and instead suggest that the age-related ipsilateral hyperactivation is nonspecific, consistent with alternative hypotheses about age-related reductions in neural efficiency/differentiation or interhemispheric inhibition.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A key goal in the cognitive neuroscience of aging is to provide a mechanistic explanation of how brain&ndash;behavior relationships change with age. One interpretation of the common finding that task-based hemispheric activity becomes more symmetrical in older adults is that this shift reflects a compensatory mechanism, with the nondominant hemisphere needing to help out with computations normally performed by the dominant hemisphere. Contrary to this view, our behavioral and brain data indicate that the additional activity in ipsilateral motor cortex in older adults is not reflective of better task performance nor better neural representations of finger actions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Broadband Dynamics Rather than Frequency-Specific Rhythms Underlie Prediction Error in the Primate Auditory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Detection of statistical irregularities, measured as a prediction error response, is fundamental to the perceptual monitoring of the environment. We studied whether prediction error response is associated with neural oscillations or asynchronous broadband activity. Electrocorticography was conducted in three male monkeys, who passively listened to the auditory roving oddball stimuli. Local field potentials (LFPs) recorded over the auditory cortex underwent spectral principal component analysis, which decoupled broadband and rhythmic components of the LFP signal. We found that the broadband component captured the prediction error response, whereas none of the rhythmic components were associated with statistical irregularities of sounds. The broadband component displayed more stochastic, asymmetrical multifractal properties than the rhythmic components, which revealed more self-similar dynamics. We thus conclude that the prediction error response is captured by neuronal populations generating asynchronous broadband activity, defined by irregular dynamic states, which, unlike oscillatory rhythms, appear to enable the neural representation of auditory prediction error response.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This study aimed to examine the contribution of oscillatory and asynchronous components of auditory local field potentials in the generation of prediction error responses to sensory irregularities, as this has not been directly addressed in the previous studies. Here, we show that mismatch negativity&mdash;an auditory prediction error response&mdash;is driven by the asynchronous broadband component of potentials recorded in the auditory cortex. This finding highlights the importance of nonoscillatory neural processes in the predictive monitoring of the environment. At a more general level, the study demonstrates that stochastic neural processes, which are often disregarded as neural noise, do have a functional role in the processing of sensory information.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Disrupting Short-Term Memory Maintenance in Premotor Cortex Affects Serial Dependence in Visuomotor Integration</a></h4>

              
                <p>Human behavior is biased by past experience. For example, when intercepting a moving target, the speed of previous targets will bias responses in future trials. Neural mechanisms underlying this so-called serial dependence are still under debate. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the previous trial leaves a neural trace in brain regions associated with encoding task-relevant information in visual and/or motor regions. We reasoned that injecting noise by means of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over premotor and visual areas would degrade such memory traces and hence reduce serial dependence. To test this hypothesis, we applied bursts of TMS pulses to right visual motion processing region hV5/MT+ and to left dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) during intertrial intervals of a coincident timing task performed by twenty healthy human participants (15 female). Without TMS, participants presented a bias toward the speed of the previous trial when intercepting moving targets. TMS over PMd decreased serial dependence in comparison to the control Vertex stimulation, whereas TMS applied over hV5/MT+ did not. In addition, TMS seems to have specifically affected the memory trace that leads to serial dependence, as we found no evidence that participants' behavior worsened after applying TMS. These results provide causal evidence that an implicit short-term memory mechanism in premotor cortex keeps information from one trial to the next, and that this information is blended with current trial information so that it biases behavior in a visuomotor integration task with moving objects.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Human perception and action are biased by the recent past. The origin of such serial bias is still not fully understood, but a few components seem to be fundamental for its emergence: the brain needs to keep previous trial information in short-term memory and blend it with incoming information. Here, we present evidence that a premotor area has a potential role in storing previous trial information in short-term memory in a visuomotor task and that this information is responsible for biasing ongoing behavior. These results corroborate the perspective that areas associated with processing information of a stimulus or task also participate in maintaining that information in short-term memory even when this information is no longer relevant for current behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Mechanosensory Stimulation via Nanchung Expressing Neurons Can Induce Daytime Sleep in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                <p>The neuronal and genetic bases of sleep, a phenomenon considered crucial for well-being of organisms, has been under investigation using the model organism <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I>. Although sleep is a state where sensory threshold for arousal is greater, it is known that certain kinds of repetitive sensory stimuli, such as rocking, can indeed promote sleep in humans. Here we report that orbital motion-aided mechanosensory stimulation promotes sleep of male and female <I>Drosophila</I>, independent of the circadian clock, but controlled by the homeostatic system. Mechanosensory receptor <I>nanchung</I> (<I>Nan</I>)-expressing neurons in the chordotonal organs mediate this sleep induction: flies in which these neurons are either silenced or ablated display significantly reduced sleep induction on mechanosensory stimulation. Transient activation of the <I>Nan</I>-expressing neurons also enhances sleep levels, confirming the role of these neurons in sleep induction. We also reveal that certain regions of the antennal mechanosensory and motor center in the brain are involved in conveying information from the mechanosensory structures to the sleep centers. Thus, we show, for the first time, that a circadian clock-independent pathway originating from peripherally distributed mechanosensors can promote daytime sleep of flies <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I>.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our tendency to fall asleep in moving vehicles or the practice of rocking infants to sleep suggests that slow rhythmic movement can induce sleep, although we do not understand the mechanistic basis of this phenomenon. We find that gentle orbital motion can induce behavioral quiescence even in flies, a highly genetically tractable system for sleep studies. We demonstrate that this is indeed true sleep based on its rapid reversibility by sensory stimulation, enhanced arousal threshold, and homeostatic control. Furthermore, we demonstrate that mechanosensory neurons expressing a TRPV channel <I>nanchung</I>, located in the antennae and chordotonal organs, mediate orbital motion-induced sleep by communicating with antennal mechanosensory motor centers, which in turn may project to sleep centers in the brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Adolescent Dopamine Neurons Represent Reward Differently during Action and State Guided Learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neuronal underpinning of learning cause-and-effect associations in the adolescent brain remains poorly understood. Two fundamental forms of associative learning are Pavlovian (classical) conditioning, where a stimulus is followed by an outcome, and operant (instrumental) conditioning, where outcome is contingent on action execution. Both forms of learning, when associated with a rewarding outcome, rely on midbrain dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SN). We find that, in adolescent male rats, reward-guided associative learning is encoded differently by midbrain dopamine neurons in each conditioning paradigm. Whereas simultaneously recorded VTA and SN adult neurons have a similar phasic response to reward delivery during both forms of conditioning, adolescent neurons display a muted reward response during operant but a profoundly larger reward response during Pavlovian conditioning. These results suggest that adolescent neurons assign a different value to reward when it is not gated by action. The learning rate of adolescents and adults during both forms of conditioning was similar, supporting the notion that differences in reward response in each paradigm may be because of differences in motivation and independent of state versus action value learning. Static characteristics of dopamine neurons, such as dopamine cell number and size, were similar in the VTA and SN of both ages, but there were age-related differences in stimulated dopamine release and correlated spike activity, suggesting that differences in reward responsiveness by adolescent dopamine neurons are not because of differences in intrinsic properties of these neurons but engagement of different dopaminergic networks.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Reckless behavior and impulsive decision-making by adolescents suggest that motivated behavioral states are encoded differently by the adolescent brain. Motivated behavior, which is dependent on the function of the dopamine system, follows learning of cause-and-effect associations in the environment. We find that dopamine neurons in adolescents encode reward differently depending on the cause-and-effect relationship of the means to receive that reward. Compared with adults, reward contingent on action led to a muted response, whereas reward that followed a cue but was not gated by action produced an augmented phasic response. These data demonstrate an age-related difference in dopamine neuron response to reward that is not uniform and is guided by processes that differentiate between state and action values.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Frontotemporal Lobar Dementia Mutant Tau Impairs Axonal Transport through a Protein Phosphatase 1{gamma}-Dependent Mechanism</a></h4>

              
                <p>Pathologic tau modifications are characteristic of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, but mechanisms of tau toxicity continue to be debated. Inherited mutations in tau cause early onset frontotemporal lobar dementias (FTLD-tau) and are commonly used to model mechanisms of tau toxicity in tauopathies. Previous work in the isolated squid axoplasm model demonstrated that several pathogenic forms of tau inhibit axonal transport through a mechanism involving activation of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). Here, we determined that P301L and R5L FTLD mutant tau proteins elicit a toxic effect on axonal transport as monomeric proteins. We evaluated interactions of wild-type or mutant tau with specific PP1 isoforms (&alpha;, &beta;, and ) to examine how the interaction contributes to this toxic effect using primary rat hippocampal neurons from both sexes. Pull-down and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer experiments revealed selective interactions of wild-type tau with PP1&alpha; and PP1 isoforms, but not PP1&beta;, which were significantly increased by the P301L tau mutation. The results from proximity ligation assays confirmed the interaction in primary hippocampal neurons. Moreover, expression of FTLD-linked mutant tau in these neurons enhanced levels of active PP1, also increasing the pausing frequency of fluorescently labeled vesicles in both anterograde and retrograde directions. Knockdown of PP1, but not PP1&alpha;, rescued the cargo-pausing effects of P301L and R5L tau, a result replicated by deleting a phosphatase-activating domain in the amino terminus of P301L tau. These findings support a model of tau toxicity involving aberrant activation of a specific PP1-dependent pathway that disrupts axonal transport in neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Tau pathology is closely associated with neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies, but the toxic mechanisms remain a debated topic. We previously proposed that pathologic tau forms induce dysfunction and degeneration through aberrant activation of a PP1-dependent pathway that disrupts axonal transport. Here, we show that tau directly interacts with specific PP1 isoforms, increasing levels of active PP1. Pathogenic tau mutations enhance this interaction, further increasing active PP1 levels and impairing axonal transport in isolated squid axoplasm and primary hippocampal neurons. Mutant-tau-mediated impairment of axonal transport was mediated by PP1 and a phosphatase-activating domain located at the amino terminus of tau. This work has important implications for understanding and potentially mitigating tau-mediated neurotoxicity in tauopathies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Disrupting Epileptiform Activity by Preventing Parvalbumin Interneuron Depolarization Block</a></h4>

              
                <p>Inhibitory synaptic mechanisms oppose epileptic network activity in the brain. The breakdown in this inhibitory restraint and propagation of seizure activity has been linked to the overwhelming of feedforward inhibition, which is provided in large part by parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneurons in the cortex. The underlying cellular processes therefore represent potential targets for understanding and preventing the propagation of seizure activity. Here we use an optogenetic strategy to test the hypothesis that depolarization block in PV interneurons is a significant factor during the loss of inhibitory restraint. Depolarization block results from the inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels and leads to impaired action potential firing. We used focal NMDA stimulation to elicit reproducible epileptiform discharges in hippocampal organotypic brain slices from male and female mice and combined this with targeted recordings from defined neuronal populations. Simultaneous patch-clamp recordings from PV interneurons and pyramidal neurons revealed epileptiform activity that was associated with an overwhelming of inhibitory synaptic mechanisms and the emergence of a partial, and then complete, depolarization block in PV interneurons. To counteract this depolarization block, we developed protocols for eliciting pulsed membrane hyperpolarization via the inhibitory opsin, archaerhodopsin. This optical approach was effective in counteracting cumulative inactivation of voltage-gated channels, maintaining PV interneuron action potential firing properties during the inhibitory restraint period, and reducing the probability of initiating epileptiform activity. These experiments support the idea that depolarization block is a point of weakness in feedforward inhibitory synaptic mechanisms and represents a target for preventing the initiation and spread of seizure activity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor-mediated synaptic transmission opposes seizure activity by establishing an inhibitory restraint against spreading excitation. Parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneurons contribute significantly to this inhibitory restraint, but it has been suggested that these cells are overwhelmed as they enter a state of "depolarization block." Here we test the importance of this process by devising an optogenetic strategy to selectively relieve depolarization block in PV interneurons. By inducing brief membrane hyperpolarization, we show that it is possible to reduce depolarization block in PV interneurons, maintain their action potential firing in the face of strong excitation, and disrupt epileptiform activity in an <I>in vitro</I> model. This represents a proof of principle that targeting rate-limiting processes can strengthen the inhibitory restraint of epileptiform activity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Schizophrenia-Linked Protein tSNARE1 Regulates Endosomal Trafficking in Cortical Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p><I>TSNARE1</I>, which encodes the protein tSNARE1, is a high-confidence gene candidate for schizophrenia risk, but nothing is known about its cellular or physiological function. We identified the major gene products of <I>TSNARE1</I> and their cytoplasmic localization and function in endosomal trafficking in cortical neurons. We validated three primary isoforms of <I>TSNARE1</I> expressed in human brain, all of which encode a syntaxin-like Qa SNARE domain. RNA-sequencing data from adult and fetal human brain suggested that the majority of tSNARE1 lacks a transmembrane domain that is thought to be necessary for membrane fusion. Biochemical data demonstrate that tSNARE1 can compete with Stx12 for incorporation into an endosomal SNARE complex, supporting its possible role as an inhibitory SNARE. Live-cell imaging in cortical neurons from mice of both sexes demonstrated that brain tSNARE1 isoforms localized to the endosomal network. The most abundant brain isoform, tSNARE1c, localized most frequently to Rab7<sup>+</sup> late endosomes, and endogenous tSNARE1 displayed a similar localization in human neural progenitor cells and neuroblastoma cells. In mature rat neurons from both sexes, tSNARE1 localized to the dendritic shaft and dendritic spines, supporting a role for tSNARE1 at the postsynapse. Expression of either tSNARE1b or tSNARE1c, which differ only in their inclusion or exclusion of an Myb-like domain, delayed the trafficking of the dendritic endosomal cargo Nsg1 into late endosomal and lysosomal compartments. These data suggest that tSNARE1 regulates endosomal trafficking in cortical neurons, likely by negatively regulating early endosomal to late endosomal trafficking.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Schizophrenia is a severe and polygenic neuropsychiatric disorder. Understanding the functions of high-confidence candidate genes is critical toward understanding how their dysfunction contributes to schizophrenia pathogenesis. <I>TSNARE1</I> is one of the high-confidence candidate genes for schizophrenia risk, yet nothing was known about its cellular or physiological function. Here we describe the major isoforms of <I>TSNARE1</I> and their cytoplasmic localization and function in the endosomal network in cortical neurons. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the majority of brain tSNARE1 acts as a negative regulator to endolysosomal trafficking.</p>

                This study has investigated the solvent extraction of cadmium and lead ions from an aqueous solution in nitrate medium using aminooctyldiphosphonic acid (AODPA) as extractant in chloroform. In order to establish spectrophotometrically the concentration of metal ion in the aqueous phase before and after extraction, the Arsenazo III method was used. The effects of several extraction parameters on the extraction of these metals ions  including volume ratio between the aqueous and organic phases (1–5), extraction kinetic time (0–30 min), molar ratio Q (1–5), addition of HNO3 (pH =2–6), addition of KNO3 (0.01 – 1M), temperature (10–40°C) and the synergetic effect by adding TOPO (solvating agent) were evaluated. Thermodynamic parameters including the Gibbs free energy (ΔG0),enthalpy (ΔH0), and entropy (ΔS0) were calculated. Performed experiments showed that Pb (II) can be extracted till 73% when Cd (II) can be recovered completely after two cycles. The extraction of both metallic ions was spontaneous, endothermic and with a slight randomness.  Positive synergetic effect was observed at  a chelating agent/TOPO ratio of 3. It is a very encouraging result which can lead us to recover cadmium and lower the concentration of lead from wastewater.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">ΔFBA—Predicting metabolic flux alterations using genome-scale metabolic models and differential transcriptomic data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sudharshan Ravi, Rudiyanto Gunawan</p>

Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) provide a powerful framework for simulating the entire set of biochemical reactions in a cell using a constraint-based modeling strategy called flux balance analysis (FBA). FBA relies on an assumed metabolic objective for generating metabolic fluxes using GEMs. But, the most appropriate metabolic objective is not always obvious for a given condition and is likely context-specific, which often complicate the estimation of metabolic flux alterations between conditions. Here, we propose a new method, called ΔFBA (deltaFBA), that integrates differential gene expression data to evaluate directly metabolic flux differences between two conditions. Notably, ΔFBA does not require specifying the cellular objective. Rather, ΔFBA seeks to maximize the consistency and minimize inconsistency between the predicted flux differences and differential gene expression. We showcased the performance of ΔFBA through several case studies involving the prediction of metabolic alterations caused by genetic and environmental perturbations in <i>Escherichia coli</i> and caused by Type-2 diabetes in human muscle. Importantly, in comparison to existing methods, ΔFBA gives a more accurate prediction of flux differences.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Cluster size distribution of cells disseminating from a primary tumor</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mrinmoy Mukherjee, Herbert Levine</p>

The first stage of the metastatic cascade often involves motile cells emerging from a primary tumor either as single cells or as clusters. These cells enter the circulation, transit to other parts of the body and finally are responsible for growth of secondary tumors in distant organs. The mode of dissemination is believed to depend on the EMT nature (epithelial, hybrid or mesenchymal) of the cells. Here, we calculate the cluster size distribution of these migrating cells, using a mechanistic computational model, in presence of different degree of EMT-ness of the cells; EMT is treated as given rise to changes in their active motile forces (<i>μ</i>) and cell-medium surface tension (Γ). We find that, for (<i>μ</i> > <i>μ</i><sub>min</sub>, Γ > 1), when the cells are hybrid in nature, the mean cluster size, N ¯ ∼ Γ 2 . 0 / μ 2 . 8, where <i>μ</i><sub>min</sub> increases with increase in Γ. For Γ ≤ 0, N ¯ = 1, the cells behave as completely mesenchymal. In presence of spectrum of hybrid states with different degree of EMT-ness (motility) in primary tumor, the cells which are relatively more mesenchymal (higher <i>μ</i>) in nature, form larger clusters, whereas the smaller clusters are relatively more epithelial (lower <i>μ</i>). Moreover, the heterogeneity in <i>μ</i> is comparatively higher for smaller clusters with respect to that for larger clusters. We also observe that more extended cell shapes promote the formation of smaller clusters. Overall, this study establishes a framework which connects the nature and size of migrating clusters disseminating from a primary tumor with the phenotypic composition of the tumor, and can lead to the better understanding of metastasis.

During the first weeks of postnatal heart development, cardiomyocytes undergo a major adaptive metabolic shift from glycolytic energy production to fatty acid oxidation. This metabolic change is contemporaneous to the up-regulation and activation of the p38γ and p38δ stress-activated protein kinases in the heart. We demonstrate that p38γ/δ contribute to the early postnatal cardiac metabolic switch through inhibitory phosphorylation of glycogen synthase 1 (GYS1) and glycogen metabolism inactivation. Premature induction of p38γ/δ activation in cardiomyocytes of newborn mice results in an early GYS1 phosphorylation and inhibition of cardiac glycogen production, triggering an early metabolic shift that induces a deficit in cardiomyocyte fuel supply, leading to whole-body metabolic deregulation and maladaptive cardiac pathogenesis. Notably, the adverse effects of forced premature cardiac p38γ/δ activation in neonate mice are prevented by maternal diet supplementation of fatty acids during pregnancy and lactation. These results suggest that diet interventions have a potential for treating human cardiac genetic diseases that affect heart metabolism.

Cochlear supporting cells (SCs) are glia-like cells critical for hearing function. In the neonatal cochlea, the greater epithelial ridge (GER) is a mitotically quiescent and transient organ, which has been shown to nonmitotically regenerate SCs. Here, we ablated Lgr5<sup>+</sup> SCs using <i>Lgr5-DTR</i> mice and found mitotic regeneration of SCs by GER cells in vivo. With lineage tracing, we show that the GER houses progenitor cells that robustly divide and migrate into the organ of Corti to replenish ablated SCs. Regenerated SCs display coordinated calcium transients, markers of the SC subtype inner phalangeal cells, and survive in the mature cochlea. Via RiboTag, RNA-sequencing, and gene clustering algorithms, we reveal 11 distinct gene clusters comprising markers of the quiescent and damaged GER, and damage-responsive genes driving cell migration and mitotic regeneration. Together, our study characterizes GER cells as mitotic progenitors with regenerative potential and unveils their quiescent and damaged translatomes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">target: an R package to predict combined function of transcription factors [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Researchers use ChIP binding data to identify potential transcription factor binding sites. Similarly, they use gene expression data from sequencing or microarrays to quantify the effect of the factor overexpression or knockdown on its targets. Therefore, the integration of the binding and expression data can be used to improve the understanding of a transcription factor function. Here, we implemented the binding and expression target analysis (BETA) in an R/Bioconductor package. This algorithm ranks the targets based on the distances of their assigned peaks from the factor ChIP experiment and the signed statistics from gene expression profiling with factor perturbation. We further extend BETA to integrate two sets of data from two factors to predict their targets and their combined functions. In this article, we briefly describe the workings of the algorithm and provide a workflow with a real dataset for using it. The gene targets and the aggregate functions of transcription factors YY1 and YY2 in HeLa cells were identified. Using the same datasets, we identified the shared targets of the two factors, which were found to be, on average, more cooperatively regulated.

                Background: Plastic waste (PW) is becoming increasingly hazardous to the environment as a result of its massive production, causing significant damage to both the ecosystem and its inhabitants. Managing plastic waste is a global concern due to its non-biodegradable nature. However, it is important to handle PWs properly to curtail the environmental emissions associated with their incineration and dumping into landfills. This research investigates the possibility of producing tiles from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste bottles and fly ash. The mechanical properties, as well as the chemical resistance of the manufactured PET polymer tiles, are reported in this study. Methods: PET waste was used in varying proportions (from 30% to 100%) by sand weight. The shredded PET waste was heated at 230 oC before being suitably blended with fly ash. It was then poured into the designated mold, removed after one hour, and cooled for 24 hours before testing. Results: The assessment of the physical and mechanical properties of the materials revealed that the tiles produced with 30% PET content performed better in terms of material density and strength compared to the samples with higher PET content. The highest compressive strength being 6.88 MPa. Based on the results of the tests, the produced PET tiles have a low water absorption efficiency of 80% lower when compare to cement and ceramic tiles (the water absorption values are between 0.98% and 0.09%). Conclusions: The results from this study indicate that PET waste bottles can be used to produce long-lasting, durable, and extremely low water absorption eco-friendly tiles for both residential and commercial applications. This prospect of tile production using polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste and fly ash would not only minimize the cost of building products but will also act as a waste diversion to mitigate environmental emissions caused by plastic waste disposal.

                Background: Exposing enamel to soft drinks and beverages causes changes in the microscopical morphology. Changes in the physical characteristics, like hardness and surface roughness, were studied with various parameters. Factors such as pH, exposed duration, and other content of the soft drinks have different effects on the enamel. Methods: Thirty-six human premolar teeth were randomly divided into three groups (n=12). Group 1 consisted of teeth which were immersed in artificial saliva (control), group 2 consisted of teeth which were immersed in Pepsi, and group 3 consisted of teeth which were immersed in Mirinda. After the preparation of samples and necessary measures, surface roughness was measured using the profilometer. Baseline measurements were taken. Reading two and reading three were taken after exposing the specimens for three days and 15 days, respectively. All of the collected data were compared statistically using SPSS and presented in tables and graphs. Results: At the baseline, the surface roughness value was the same for all three groups. On the 3rd day, the Mirinda group showed more surface roughness compared to that of the test and Pepsi groups, which was statistically significant. On the 15th day, both the Pepsi and Mirinda groups showed increased surface roughness compared to that of the control, which was statistically significant. Conclusions: Within the limitation of this study, it can be concluded that surface roughness increased when teeth were exposed to both soft drinks

                Background Central nervous system (CNS) lymphomas are a rare subset of lymphoma, which are associated with a poor outcome. The gold standard for CNS imaging is with gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); however, there are a number of limitations, including some patients with small persistent abnormalities from scarring due to focal haemorrhage or from a previous biopsy, which can be difficult to discern from residual tumour. [18F]Fluoromethylcholine positron emission tomography–computed tomography (FCH-PET/CT) uses an analogue of choline, which due to the upregulation of choline kinase in tumour cells, allows increased uptake of FCH. As there is minimal background grey matter uptake of FCH, FCH-PET/CT can be used in CNS imaging and provide a useful tool for response assessment. Methods This is a cohort study, where we identified 40 patients with a diagnosis of primary or secondary CNS lymphoma between 1st November 2011 and 10th October 2019. Results 26 of the 40 patients (65%) had concordant results. Of the discordant results, 11 out of 14 had partial response (PR) on MRI but showed a metabolic complete response (mCR) on FCH-PET. The overall response rates (ORR) were similar between the two modalities (90% for MRI versus 95% with FCT-PET/CT). Conclusion We conclude that FCH-PET/CT is a reasonable alternative mode of imaging to gadolinium-enhanced MRI brain imaging, providing a new tool for assessment of CNS lymphoma.

                Background: There has been rising concern amongst the public regarding their home's proximity to high tension power transmission lines. The primary cause of fear is the impact of the electromagnetic interference (EMI) radiation on the nearby occupants' health. Despite the presence of national permissible limits of EMI radiation, there is still lack of information with regards to the EMI radiation of the types of power lines configuration in Malaysia. Methods: The electric and magnetic fields of several selected power transmission lines were simulated using the EMFACDC software program from the recommendation ITU-T K.90. Five types of power transmission lines available in Malaysia are considered. Results: It was found that the simulated electric and magnetic field levels at all the power lines' right of way (ROW) boundary complies with the prescribed exposure limit. However, the electromagnetic fields (EMF) level increases significantly as the separation distance is reduced from 30m. For a more conservative approach, the ROW can be set at 30m across all transmission voltage level and corridor area condition. Conclusion: It can be concluded that Malaysia's power transmission lines are within the prescribed exposure limits. To further minimize the electric and magnetic field level, it is recommended that the residential building should be built at least 30 meters away from the power transmission lines, especially for the 275kV double circuit, 275/132kV quadruple circuit, and 500kV double circuit lines.

                Introduction: As of now, no study has combined research from different sciences to determine the most suitable diet for humans. This issue is urgent due to the predicted population growth, the effect of this on the environment, and the deterioration of human health and associated costs. Methods: A literature review determined whether an optimal diet for humans exists and what such a diet is, followed by six meta-analyses. The standard criteria for conducting meta-analyses of observational studies were followed. A review of literature reporting Hazard Ratios with a 95% confidence interval for red meat intake, dairy intake, plant-based diet, fiber intake, and serum IGF-1 levels were extracted to calculate effect sizes. Results: Results calculated using NCSS software show that high meat consumption increases mortality probability by 18% on average and increases diabetes risk by 50%. Plant-based and high-fiber diets decrease mortality by 15% and 20% respectively (p < .001). Plant-based diets decreased diabetes risk by 27%, and dairy consumption (measured by increased IGF-1 levels) increased cancer probability by 48% (p < 0.01). A vegetarian or Mediterranean diet was not found to decrease the probability of heart disease. A vegetarian diet can be healthy or not, depending on the foods consumed. A Mediterranean diet with high quantities of meat and dairy products will not produce the health effects desired. The main limitations of the study were that observational studies were heterogeneous and limited by potential confounders. Discussion: The literature and meta-analyses point to an optimal diet for humans that has followed our species from the beginnings of humankind. The optimal diet is a whole food, high fiber, low-fat, 90+% plant-based diet. This diet allowed humans to become the most developed species on Earth. To ensure people’s nutritional needs are met healthily and sustainably, governmental dietary interventions are necessary.

                Background: Non-communicable diseases, the major cause of death and disability, are susceptible to modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors. Atrial fibrillation (AF) increases the risk of stroke by 4 to 5 times and can lead to cardiovascular mortality. This study was conducted to assess the effects of different sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors on stroke development in patients with AF. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between January and June 2018 on patients recruited from Lebanese community pharmacies. The CHA2DS2-VASc scoring system is utilized as a stroke risk stratification tool in AF patients. Participants with a previous physician diagnosis of AF, documented on medical records, were included in this study. Data was collected through a survey that was distributed to all eligible patients. Results: A total of 524 patients were enrolled in the study with a mean age (± SD) of 58.75 ± 13.59 years with hypertension (78.4%) being the most predominant disease. The results showed that obesity (Beta=0.61, p-value =0.011), retirement and unemployment compared to employment (Beta=1.44 and 1.44, p-value=0.001 respectively), divorced/widow compared to married (Beta=1.38, p-value =0.001) were significantly associated with higher CHA2DS2-VASc scores whereas high versus low socio-economic status (Beta=-1.03, p=0.009) and high school education versus primary education level (Beta=-0.49, p-value=0.025) were significantly associated with lower CHA2DS2-VASc scores. Conclusions: The study highlights that the CHA2DS2-VASc score is affected by the presence of various sociodemographic and socioeconomic characteristics in patients with AF. Thus, screening for those factors may predict the progression of cardiovascular disease and may provide an optimal intervention.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">'Scary' pericytes: the fibrotic scar in brain and spinal cord lesions</a></h4>

              
                Scar tissue presents a barrier to regeneration in the central nervous system (CNS). Although the glial scar has been extensively studied, recent evidence suggests that non-glial components are also involved. In a recent paper, Dias, Kalkitsas, and colleagues uncovered a subset of pericytes as a contributor to fibrotic scarring that is conserved across diverse CNS lesions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Modeling the ACVR1R206H mutation in human skeletal muscle stem cells</a></h4>

              
                Abnormalities in skeletal muscle repair can lead to poor function and complications such as scarring or heterotopic ossification (HO). Here, we use fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), a disease of progressive HO caused by ACVR1<sup>R206H</sup> (Activin receptor type-1 receptor) mutation, to elucidate how ACVR1 affects skeletal muscle repair. Rare and unique primary FOP human muscle stem cells (Hu-MuSCs) isolated from cadaveric skeletal muscle demonstrated increased ECM marker expression, showed skeletal muscle-specific impaired engraftment and regeneration ability. Human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived muscle stem/progenitor cells (iMPCs) single cell transcriptome analyses from FOP also revealed unusually increased ECM and osteogenic marker expression compared to control iMPCs. These results show that iMPCs can recapitulate many aspects of Hu-MuSCs for detailed <i>in vitro</i> study, that ACVR1 is a key regulator of Hu-MuSC function and skeletal muscle repair; and that ACVR1 activation in iMPCs or Hu-MuSCs may contribute to HO by changing the local tissue environment.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Circuits for integrating learned and innate valences in the insect brain</a></h4>

              
                Animal behavior is shaped both by evolution and by individual experience. Parallel brain pathways encode innate and learned valences of cues, but the way in which they are integrated during action-selection is not well understood. We used electron microscopy to comprehensively map with synaptic resolution all neurons downstream of all Mushroom Body output neurons (encoding learned valences) and characterized their patterns of interaction with Lateral Horn neurons (encoding innate valences) in <i>Drosophila</i> larva. The connectome revealed multiple <i>convergence neuron</i> types that receive convergent Mushroom Body and Lateral Horn inputs. A subset of these receives excitatory input from positive-valence MB and LH pathways and inhibitory input from negative-valence MB pathways. We confirmed functional connectivity from LH and MB pathways and behavioral roles of two of these neurons. These neurons encode integrated odor value and bidirectionally regulate turning. Based on this we speculate that learning could potentially skew the balance of excitation and inhibition onto these neurons and thereby modulate turning. Together, our study provides insights into the circuits that integrate learned and innate to modify behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mycobacterium tuberculosis canonical virulence factors interfere with a late component of the TLR2 response</a></h4>

              
                For many intracellular pathogens, the phagosome is the site of events and interactions that shape infection outcome. Phagosomal membrane damage, in particular, is proposed to benefit invading pathogens. To define the innate immune consequences of this damage, we profiled macrophage transcriptional responses to wild-type <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (Mtb) and mutants that fail to damage the phagosomal membrane. We identified a set of genes with enhanced expression in response to the mutants. These genes represented a late component of the TLR2-dependent transcriptional response to Mtb, distinct from an earlier component that included <i>Tnf</i>. Expression of the later component was inherent to TLR2 activation, dependent upon endosomal uptake, and enhanced by phagosome acidification. Canonical Mtb virulence factors that contribute to phagosomal membrane damage blunted phagosome acidification and undermined the endosome-specific response. Profiling cell survival and bacterial growth in macrophages demonstrated that the attenuation of these mutants is partially dependent upon TLR2. Further, TLR2 contributed to the attenuated phenotype of one of these mutants in a murine model of infection. These results demonstrate two distinct components of the TLR2 response and identify a component dependent upon endosomal uptake as a point where pathogenic bacteria interfere with the generation of effective inflammation. This interference promotes TB pathogenesis in both macrophage and murine infection models.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The right time for senescence</a></h4>

              
                Cellular senescence is a highly complex and programmed cellular state with diverse and, at times, conflicting physiological and pathological roles across the lifespan of an organism. Initially considered a cell culture artifact, senescence evolved from an age-related circumstance to an intricate cellular defense mechanism in response to stress, implicated in a wide spectrum of biological processes like tissue remodelling, injury and cancer. The development of new tools to study senescence in vivo paved the way to uncover its functional roles in various frameworks, which are sometimes hard to reconcile. Here, we review the functional impact of senescent cells on different organismal contexts. We provide updated insights on the role of senescent cells in tissue repair and regeneration, in which they essentially modulate the levels of fibrosis and inflammation, discussing how “time” seems to be the key maestro of their effects. Finally, we overview the current clinical research landscape to target senescent cells and contemplate its repercussions on this fast-evolving field.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Individual variations in ‘brain age’ relate to early-life factors more than to longitudinal brain change</a></h4>

              
                <i>Brain age</i> is a widely used index for quantifying individuals’ brain health as deviation from a normative brain aging trajectory. Higher-than-expected <i>brain age</i> is thought partially to reflect above-average rate of brain aging. Here, we explicitly tested this assumption in two independent large test datasets (UK Biobank [main] and Lifebrain [replication]; longitudinal observations ≈ 2750 and 4200) by assessing the relationship between cross-sectional and longitudinal estimates of <i>brain age. Brain age</i> models were estimated in two different training datasets (n ≈ 38,000 [main] and 1800 individuals [replication]) based on brain structural features. The results showed no association between cross-sectional <i>brain age</i> and the rate of brain change measured longitudinally. Rather, <i>brain age</i> in adulthood was associated with the congenital factors of birth weight and polygenic scores of <i>brain age,</i> assumed to reflect a constant, lifelong influence on brain structure from early life. The results call for nuanced interpretations of cross-sectional indices of the aging brain and question their validity as markers of ongoing within-person changes of the aging brain. Longitudinal imaging data should be preferred whenever the goal is to understand individual change trajectories of brain and cognition in aging.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Wnt signaling mediates acquisition of blood-brain barrier properties in naïve endothelium derived from human pluripotent stem cells</a></h4>

              
                Endothelial cells (ECs) in the central nervous system (CNS) acquire their specialized blood-brain barrier (BBB) properties in response to extrinsic signals, with Wnt/β-catenin signaling coordinating multiple aspects of this process. Our knowledge of CNS EC development has been advanced largely by animal models, and human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) offer the opportunity to examine BBB development in an <i>in vitro</i> human system. Here we show that activation of Wnt signaling in hPSC-derived naïve endothelial progenitors, but not in matured ECs, leads to robust acquisition of canonical BBB phenotypes including expression of GLUT-1, increased claudin-5, decreased PLVAP and decreased permeability. RNA-seq revealed a transcriptome profile resembling ECs with CNS-like characteristics, including Wnt-upregulated expression of <i>LEF1</i>, <i>APCDD1</i>, and <i>ZIC3</i>. Together, our work defines effects of Wnt activation in naïve ECs and establishes an improved hPSC-based model for interrogation of CNS barriergenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A novel histone deacetylase inhibitor-based approach to eliminate microglia and retain astrocyte properties in glial cell culture.</a></h4>

              
                The close association between astrocytes and microglia causes great difficulties to distinguish their individual roles in innate immune responses in central nervous system. Current chemical-based methods to eliminate microglia in glial cell culture introduce various molecular and functional alterations to astrocytes. Here, we describe a novel two-step approach to achieve a complete elimination of microglia without affecting the biological properties of co-cultured astrocytes by temporal treatment of histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA). We verify TSA as a potent inducer for microglial-specific cell death, which also causes comprehensive gene expression changes in astrocytes. However, withdrawal of TSA not only ensures no microglia repopulation, but also restores all the gene expression changes in terms of astrocyte functions, including neurotrophic factors, glutamate and potassium transporters, and reactive astrocyte subtypes. By contrast, withdrawal of PLX5622, the commonly used colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibitor neither prevents microglia repopulation nor restores the gene expression changes mentioned above. Using this method, we are able to discriminate differential roles of microglia and astrocytes in the induced expression of antiviral and pro-inflammatory cytokines upon various pathological stimuli including the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. This simple and efficient method can be customized for the understanding of microglia-astrocyte interaction and the development of epigenetic therapies that target over-activated microglia in neuroinflammation-related diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Individual differences in frontoparietal plasticity in humans</a></h4>

              
                Neuroplasticity, defined as the brain's ability to change in response to its environment, has been extensively studied at the cellular and molecular levels. Work in animal models suggests that stimulation to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) enhances plasticity, and that myelination constrains plasticity. Little is known, however, about whether proxy measures of these properties in the human brain are associated with learning. Here we investigated the plasticity of the frontoparietal system (FPS), which supports complex cognition. We asked whether VTA resting-state functional connectivity and myelin map (T1-w/T2-w ratio) values predicted learning after short-term training on a FPS-dependent task: the adaptive n-back (n = 46, ages 18-25). We found that stronger connectivity between VTA and lateral prefrontal cortex at baseline predicted greater improvements in accuracy. Lower myelin map values predicted improvement in response times, but not accuracy. Our findings suggest that proxy markers of neural plasticity can predict learning in humans.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Bedtime to the brain: How infants sleep habits intertwine with sleep neurophysiology</a></h4>

              
                Adequate sleep is critical for development and facilitates the maturation of the neurophysiological circuitries at the basis of cognitive and behavioral function. Observational research has associated sleep problems in early life with worse later cognitive, psychosocial, and somatic health outcomes. Yet, the extent to which day-to-day sleep habits in early life relate to neurophysiology - acutely and long-term - remains to be explored. Here, we report that sleep habits in 32 healthy 6-month-olds assessed with actimetry are linked to fundamental aspects of their neurophysiology measured with high-density electroencephalography (hdEEG). Our study reveals four key findings: First, daytime sleep habits are linked to EEG slow wave activity (SWA). Second, habits of nighttime movement and awakenings from sleep are connected with spindle density. Third, habitual sleep timing is linked to neurophysiological connectivity quantified as Delta-coherence. And lastly, Delta-coherence at age 6 months predicts nighttime sleep duration at age 12 months. These novel findings widen our understanding that infants' sleep habits are closely intertwined with three particular levels of neurophysiology: sleep pressure (determined by SWA), the maturation of the thalamocortical system (spindles), and the maturation of cortical connectivity (coherence). Our companion paper complements this insight in the perspective of later developmental outcomes: early thalamocortical connectivity (spindle density) at age 6 months predicts later behavioural status at 12 and 24 months. The crucial next step is to extend this concept to clinical groups to objectively characterize infants' sleep habits "at risk" that foster later neurodevelopmental problems.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Parametric control of flexible timing through low-dimensional neural manifolds</a></h4>

              
                Biological brains possess an unparalleled ability to generalize adaptive behavioral responses from only a few examples. How neural processes enable this capacity to extrapolate is a fundamental open question. A prominent but underexplored hypothesis suggests that generalization is facilitated by a low-dimensional organization of collective neural activity. Here we tested this hypothesis in the framework of flexible timing tasks where dynamics play a key role. Examining trained recurrent neural networks we found that confining the dynamics to a low-dimensional subspace allowed tonic inputs to parametrically control the overall input-output transform and enabled smooth extrapolation to inputs well beyond the training range. Reverse-engineering and theoretical analyses demonstrated that this parametric control of extrapolation relies on a mechanism where tonic inputs modulate the dynamics along non-linear manifolds in activity space while preserving their geometry. Comparisons with neural data from behaving monkeys confirmed the geometric and dynamical signatures of this mechanism.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A biologically inspired architecture with switching units can learn to generalize across backgrounds</a></h4>

              
                Humans and other animals navigate different landscapes and environments with ease, a feat that requires the brain's ability to rapidly and accurately adapt to different visual domains, generalizing across contexts/backgrounds. Despite recent progress in deep learning applied to classification and detection in the presence of multiple confounds including contextual ones, there remain important challenges to address regarding how networks can perform context-dependent computations and how contextually-invariant visual concepts are formed. For instance, recent studies have shown artificial networks that repeatedly misclassified familiar objects set on new backgrounds, e.g. incorrectly labeling known animals when they appeared in a different setting. Here, we show how a bio-inspired network motif can explicitly address this issue. We do this using a novel dataset which can be used as a benchmark for future studies probing invariance to backgrounds. The dataset consists of MNIST digits of varying transparency, set on one of two backgrounds with different statistics: a Gaussian noise or a more naturalistic background from the CIFAR-10 dataset. We use this dataset to learn digit classification when contexts are shown sequentially, and find that both shallow and deep networks have sharply decreased performance when returning to the first background after experience learning the second -- the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon in continual learning. To overcome this, we propose an architecture with additional ``switching'' units that are activated in the presence of a new background. We find that the switching network can learn the new context even with very few switching units, while maintaining the performance in the previous context -- but that they must be recurrently connected to network layers. When the task is difficult due to high transparency, the switching network trained on both contexts outperforms networks without switching trained on only one context. The switching mechanism leads to sparser activation patterns, and we provide intuition for why this helps to solve the task. We compare our architecture with other prominent learning methods, and find that elastic weight consolidation is not successful in our setting, while progressive nets are more complex but less effective. Our study therefore shows how a bio-inspired architectural motif can contribute to task generalization across context.

                Assessment of resting cerebrovascular perfusion measures (mean transit time, cerebral blood flow and cerebral blood volume) with magnetic resonance imaging currently requires the intravascular injection of the dynamic susceptibility contrast agent gadolinium. An initial comparison between hypoxia-induced deoxyhemoglobin and gadolinium was made for these measures in six healthy participants. A bolus of deoxyhemoglobin is generated in the lung via transient hypoxia induced by an available computer-controlled gas blender technology employing sequential gas delivery (RespirAct). We hypothesised and confirmed perfusion measures from both susceptibility contrast agents would yield similar spatial patterns of cerebrovascular perfusion measures. We conclude that hypoxia-induced deoxyhemoglobin, an endogenously, non-invasively generated, non-allergenic, non-toxic, recyclable, environmentally innocuous molecule, may be suitable to become the first new magnetic resonance imaging susceptibility contrast agent introduction since gadolinium.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Identifying Causal Subsequent Memory Effects</a></h4>

              
                Over 40 years of accumulated research has detailed associations between neuroimaging signals measured during a memory encoding task and later memory performance, across a variety of brain regions, measurement tools, statistical approaches and behavioral tasks. But the interpretation of these Subsequent Memory Effects (SMEs) remains unclear: if the identified signals reflect cognitive and neural mechanisms of memory encoding then the underlying neural activity must be causally related to future memory. However, almost all previous SME analyses do not control for potential confounders of this causal interpretation, such as serial position and item effects. We collect a large fMRI dataset and use a novel experimental design and analysis approach that allows us to statistically adjust for all exogenous confounding variables. We find that, using standard approaches without adjustment, we replicate several univariate and multivariate subsequent memory effects and are able to predict memory performance across people. However, we are unable to identify any signal that reliably predicts subsequent memory after adjusting for confounding variables, bringing into doubt the causal status of these effects. We apply the same approach to subjects' judgments of learning collected during an encoding period, and show that these behavioral measures of encoding quality do predict memory after adjustments, suggesting that it is possible to measure signals at the time of encoding that reflect causal mechanisms but that existing neuroimaging measures may not have the precision and specificity to do so.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Executive control by fronto-parietal activity explains counterintuitive decision behavior in complex value-based decision-making</a></h4>

              
                In real life, humans make decisions by taking into account multiple independent factors, such as delay and probability. Cognitive psychology suggests that cognitive control mechanisms play a key role when facing such complex task conditions. However, in value-based decision-making, it still remains unclear to what extent cognitive control mechanisms become essential when the task condition is complex. In this study, we investigated decision-making behaviors and underlying neural mechanisms using a multifactor gambling task where participants simultaneously considered probability and delay. Decision-making behavior in the multifactor task was modulated by both probability and delay. The behavioral effect of probability was stronger than delay, consistent with previous studies. Furthermore, in a subset of conditions that recruited fronto-parietal activations, reaction times were paradoxically elongated despite lower probabilistic uncertainty. Notably, such a reaction time elongation did not occur in control tasks involving single factors. Meta-analysis of brain activations suggested an association between the paradoxical increase of reaction time and strategy switching. Together, these results suggest a novel aspect of complex value-based decision-makings that is strongly influenced by fronto-parietal cognitive control.

                Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is being used to develop diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic biomarkers for critically ill patients with severe brain injuries. In studies of healthy volunteers and non-critically ill patients, prospective cardiorespiratory data are routinely collected to remove non-neuronal fluctuations in the rs-fMRI signal during analysis. However, the feasibility and utility of collecting cardiorespiratory data in critically ill patients on a clinical MRI scanner are unknown. We concurrently acquired rs-fMRI (TR=1250ms), cardiac and respiratory data in 23 critically ill patients with acute severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), and 12 healthy control subjects. We compared the functional connectivity results after denoising with cardiorespiratory data (i.e., RETROICOR) with the results obtained after standard bandpass filtering. Rs-fMRI data in 7 patients could not be analyzed due to imaging artifacts. In 6 of the remaining 16 patients (37.5%), cardiorespiratory data were either incomplete or corrupted. In both patients and control subjects, the functional connectivity corrected with RETROICOR did not significantly differ from that corrected with bandpass filtering of 0.008-0.125 Hz. Collectively, these findings suggest that there is a limited feasibility and utility to prospectively acquire high-quality cardiorespiratory data during rs-fMRI in critically ill patients with severe TBI for physiological correction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">CX3CL1 action on microglia protects from diet-induced obesity by restoring POMC neuronal excitability and melanocortin system activity impaired by high-fat diet feeding</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Diet-induced obesity (DIO) is associated with hypothalamic microglial activation and dysfunction of the melanocortin pathway, but the molecular mechanisms linking the two remain unclear. Previous studies have hypothesized that microglial inflammatory signaling is linked with impaired pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neuron function, but this mechanism has never been directly tested in vivo. We addressed this hypothesis using the specific microglial silencing molecule, CX3CL1 (fractalkine), to determine whether reducing hypothalamic microglial activation can restore POMC/melanocortin signaling in the brain to protect against DIO. Methods: We performed metabolic analyses in mice with targeted viral overexpression of CX3CL1 in the hypothalamus exposed to high fat diet (HFD). Electrophysiologic recording in hypothalamic slices from POMC-MAPT-GFP mice was used to determine the effects of HFD feeding and microglial silencing via minocycline or CX3CL1 on GFP-labeled POMC neurons. Finally, mice with hypothalamic overexpression of CX3CL1 received central treatment with the melanocortin receptor antagonist SHU-9119 to determine whether melanocortin signaling is required for the metabolic benefits of CX3CL1. Results: We found that targeted expression of both soluble and membrane-bound forms of CX3CL1 in the mediobasal hypothalamus potently reduced weight gain and increased leptin sensitivity in animals exposed to high fat diet. The protective effect of CX3CL1 rescued diet-induced changes in POMC neuron excitability and required intact melanocortin receptor signaling in vivo. Conclusion: Our results provide the first evidence that HFD-induced POMC neuron dysfunction involves microglial activation. Furthermore, our study suggests that the anti-obesity action of CX3CL1 is mediated through the restoration of POMC neuron excitability and melanocortin signaling.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Boundary extension is constrained by naturalistic image properties</a></h4>

              
                Boundary extension (BE) is a classical memory illusion in which observers remember more of a scene than was presented. According to predictive accounts, BE reflects the integration of visual input and expectations of what is beyond the boundaries of a scene. Alternatively, according to normalization accounts, BE reflects one end of a normalization process towards the typically-experienced viewing distance of a scene, such that BE and boundary contraction (BC) are equally common. Here, we show that BE and BC depend on depth-of-field (DOF), as determined by the aperture settings on a camera. Photographs with naturalistic DOF led to the strongest BE across a large stimulus set, while BC was primarily observed for unnaturalistic DOF. The relationship between DOF and BE was confirmed in three controlled experiments that isolated DOF from co-varying factors. In line with predictive accounts, we propose that BE is strongest for scene images that resemble day-to-day visual experience.

                Computation within cortical microcircuits is determined by functional properties of the neurons and their synaptic interactions. While heterogeneity of inhibitory interneurons is well established, the anatomical, physiological, and molecular differentiation of excitatory pyramidal neurons is not fully resolved. To identify functional subtypes within the pyramidal neuron population, we focused on human layer 2-3 cortex which greatly expanded during evolution. We performed multi-neuron patch-clamp recordings in brain slices from the temporal cortex of 22 epilepsy patients. We characterized the electrophysiological properties of up to 80 pyramidal neurons per patient, enabling us to assess inter- and intra-individual functional variability. Hierarchical clustering of the high-dimensional parameter space yielded functionally distinct clusters of pyramidal neurons which were present across individuals. This may represent a generic organizational principle converging with previously described transcriptomic heterogeneity. We further observed substantial heterogeneity in physiological parameters with intra-individual variability being severalfold larger than inter-individual variability. The phenotypic variability within and across pyramidal neuron subtypes has important implications for the computational capacity of the cortical microcircuit.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">State-dependent modulation of activity in distinct layer 6 corticothalamic neurons in barrel cortex of awake mice</a></h4>

              
                Layer 6 corticothalamic (L6 CT) neurons are in a strategic position to control sensory input to the neocortex, yet we understand very little about their functions. Apart from studying their anatomical, physiological and synaptic properties, most recent efforts have focused on the activity-dependent influences CT cells can exert on thalamic and cortical neurons through causal optogenetic manipulations. However, few studies have attempted to study them during behavior. In an attempt to address this gap, we performed juxtacellular recordings from optogenetically identified CT neurons in whisker-related primary somatosensory cortex (wS1) of awake, head-fixed mice (of either sex) free to rest quietly or self-initiate bouts of whisking and locomotion. We found a rich diversity of response profiles exhibited by CT cells. Broadly, their spiking patterns were either modulated by whisker-related behavior (~28%) or not (~72%). Whisker-related neurons exhibited both increases as well as decreases in firing rates. We also encountered cells with preceding modulations in firing rate before whisking onset. Overall, whisking better explained these changes in rates than overall changes in arousal. The CT cells that showed no whisker-related activity had low spontaneous firing rates (<0.5 Hz), with many all but silent. Remarkably, this relatively silent population preferentially spiked at the state transition point when pupil diameter constricted and the mouse entered quiet wakefulness. Thus, our results demonstrate that L6 CT neurons in wS1 show diverse spiking patterns, perhaps subserving distinct functional roles related to precisely timed responses during complex behaviors and transitions between discrete waking states.

                Modern optical neuroimaging approaches are expanding our ability to elucidate complex brain function. Diverse imaging contrasts enable direct observation of neural activity with functional sensors along with the induced hemodynamic responses. To date, decoupling the complex interplay of neurovascular coupling and dynamical physiological states has remained challenging when employing single-modality functional neuroimaging tools. We devised a hybrid fluorescence optoacoustic tomography (FLOT) platform combined with a custom data processing pipeline based on statistical parametric mapping, accomplishing the first simultaneous noninvasive observation of both direct and indirect brain-wide activation patterns with optical contrast. Correlated changes in the oxy- and deoxygenated hemoglobin, total hemoglobin, oxygen saturation and rapid GCaMP6f fluorescence signals were observed in response to peripheral sensory stimulation. While the concurrent epifluorescence served to corroborate and complement the functional optoacoustic observations, the latter further aided in decoupling the rapid calcium responses from the slowly varying background in the fluorescence recordings mediated by hemodynamic changes. The hybrid imaging platform expands the capabilities of conventional neuroimaging methods to provide more comprehensive functional readings for studying neurovascular and neurometabolic coupling mechanisms and related diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sources of variation in the spectral slope of the sleep EEG</a></h4>

              
                Building on previous work linking changes in the electroencephalogram (EEG) spectral slope to arousal level, Lendner et al. (2021) reported that wake, non rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep exhibit progressively steeper 30-45 Hz slopes, interpreted in terms of increasing cortical inhibition. Here we sought to replicate Lendner et al.'s scalp EEG findings (based on 20 individuals) in a larger sample of 11,630 individuals from multiple cohorts in the National Sleep Research Resource (NSRR). In a final analytic sample of N = 10,255 distinct recordings, there was unambiguous statistical support for the hypothesis that, within individuals, the mean spectral slope grows steeper going from wake to NREM to REM sleep. We found that the choice of mastoid referencing scheme modulated the extent to which electromyogenic or electrocardiographic artifacts were likely to bias 30-45 Hz slope estimates, as well as other sources of technical, device-specific bias. Nonetheless, within individuals, slope estimates were relatively stable over time. Both cross-sectionally and longitudinal, slopes tended to become shallower with increasing age, particularly for REM sleep; males tended to show flatter slopes than females across all states. Although conceptually distinct, spectral slope did not predict sleep state substantially better than other summaries of the high frequency EEG power spectrum (>20 Hz, in this context) including beta band power, however. Finally, to more fully describe sources of variation in the spectral slope and its relationship to other sleep parameters, we quantified state-dependent differences in the variances (both within and between individuals) of spectral slope, power and interhemispheric coherence, as well as their covariances. In contrast to the common conception of the REM EEG as relatively wake-like (i.e. 'paradoxical' sleep), REM and wake were the most divergent states for multiple metrics, with NREM exhibiting intermediate profiles. Under a simplified modelling framework, changes in spectral slope could not, by themselves, fully account for the observed differences between states, if assuming a strict power law model. Although the spectral slope is an appealing, theoretically inspired parameterization of the sleep EEG, here we underscore some practical considerations that should be borne in mind when applying it in diverse datasets. Future work will be needed to fully characterize state-dependent changes in the aperiodic portions of the EEG power spectra, which appear to be consistent with, albeit not fully explained by, changes in the spectral slope.

                The study of the brain's dynamical activity is opening a valuable source of assistance for the clinical diagnosis of patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC). For example, dysfunctional spread of naturalistic and synthetic stimuli has proven useful to characterize hampered consciousness. However, understanding of the mechanisms behind loss of consciousness following brain injury is still missing. Here, we study the propagation of endogenous and in-silico exogenous perturbations in patients with DOC, based upon directed and causal interactions estimated from resting-state fMRI. We found that patients with DOC suffer decreased capacity for neural propagation and responsiveness to events. Particularly, that loss of consciousness is related to the malfunctioning of two neural circuits: the posterior cortical regions failing to convey information, in conjunction with reduced broadcasting of information from subcortical, temporal, parietal and frontal regions. These results seed light on the mechanisms behind DOC, thus opening new possibilities for clinical applications.

                Enthusiasm and assertiveness are two subordinate personality traits of extraversion. These traits reflect different aspects of extroversion and have distinct implications on mental health. Whereas enthusiasm predicts satisfaction in life and positive relationships, assertiveness predicts psychological distress and reduced social support. The neural basis of these subordinate traits is not well understood. To investigate brain regions where enthusiasm and assertiveness have diverging relationship with morphology, enthusiasm and assertiveness were regressed to gray matter volume (GMV) across the whole brain in a sample of 301 healthy individuals. A significant interaction was found between enthusiasm and assertiveness in the left angular gyrus (t(296) = 4.18, family wise error corrected, FWE p = .001 (cluster-level); Cluster size = 880 voxels). Larger GMV in this area was associated with more enthusiasm and less assertiveness. Our study emphasizes the value of separating extraversion into its subordinate traits when investigating associations to neuroanatomy.

                Theories of neural replay propose that it supports a range of different functions, most prominently planning and memory maintenance. Here, we test the hypothesis that distinct replay signatures relate to planning and memory maintenance. Our reward learning task required human participants to utilize structure knowledge for 'model-based' evaluation, while maintaining knowledge for two independent and randomly alternating task environments. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and multivariate analysis, we found neural evidence for compressed forward replay during planning and backward replay following reward feedback. Prospective replay strength was enhanced for the current environment when the benefits of a model-based planning strategy were higher. Following reward receipt, backward replay for the alternative, distal environment was enhanced as a function of decreasing recency of experience for that environment. Consistent with a memory maintenance role, stronger maintenance-related replay was associated with a modulation of subsequent choices. These findings identify distinct replay signatures consistent with key theoretical proposals on planning and memory maintenance functions, with their relative strength modulated by on-going computational and task demands.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Delineation of dynorphin and kappa opioid receptor circuit elements in alcohol consumption</a></h4>

              
                Alcohol use disorder is complex and multi-faceted, involving the coordination of multiple signaling systems across numerous brain region. Previous work has indicated that both the insular cortex and dynorphin (DYN)/Kappa opioid receptor (KOR) systems contribute to excessive alcohol use. More recently, we identified a microcircuit in the medial aspect of the insular cortex that signals through DYN/KOR. Here, we explored the role of insula DYN/KOR circuit elements on alcohol intake in a long-term intermittent access (IA) procedure. Using a combination of conditional knockout strategies and site-directed pharmacology, we discovered distinct and sex-specific roles for insula DYN and KOR systems in alcohol drinking and related behavior. Our findings show that insula DYN deletion blocked escalated consumption and decreased overall intake of and preference for alcohol in male and female mice. This effect was selective for alcohol in male mice, as DYN deletion did not impact their sucrose intake. In male mice, insula KOR antagonism reduced alcohol intake and preference during the early phase of IA only. Alcohol consumption as not affected by insula KOR knockout. In addition, we found that long-term IA decreased the intrinsic excitability of DYN and deep layer pyramidal neurons (DLPN) in the insula of male mice. Excitatory synaptic transmission was also impacted by IA, as it drove an increase in excitatory synaptic drive in both DYN neurons and DLPN. Combined, our findings suggest that there is a dynamic interplay between excessive alcohol consumption and insula DYN/KOR circuit elements.

	<p>The role of select pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators in driving microglial cell polarization into classically (M1), or alternatively, (M2) activated states, as well as the subsequent differential responses of these induced phenotypes, was examined. Expression of PD-L1, MHC-II, MHC-I, arginase 1 (Arg-1), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) was assessed using multi-color flow cytometry. We observed that both pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators induced PD-L1 expression on non-polarized microglia. Moreover, IFN-γ stimulated significant MHC class I and II expression on these cells. Interestingly, we observed that only IL-4 treatment induced Arg-1 expression, indicating M2 polarization. These M2 cells were refractory to subsequent depolarization and maintained their alternatively activated state. Furthermore, PD-L1 expression was significantly induced on these M2-polarized microglia after treatment with pro-inflammatory mediators, but not anti-inflammatory cytokines. In addition, we observed that only LPS induced iNOS expression in microglial cells, indicating M1 polarization. Furthermore, IFN-γ significantly increased the percentage of M1-polarized microglia expressing iNOS. Surprisingly, when these M1-polarized microglia were treated with either IL-6 or other anti-inflammatory cytokines, they returned to their non-polarized state, as demonstrated by significantly reduced expression of iNOS. Taken together, these results demonstrate differential responses of microglial cells to mediators present in dissimilar microenvironments.</p>

	<p>Descriptions of the nuclear parcellation of the locus coeruleus complex have been provided in approximately 80 mammal species spanning the phylogenetic breadth of this class. Within the mammalian rostral hindbrain, noradrenergic neurons (revealed with tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine-ß-hydroxylase immunohistochemistry) have been observed within the periventricular grey matter (A4 and A6 nuclei) and parvicellular reticular nucleus (A5 and A7 nuclei), with the one exception to date being the tree pangolin, where no A4/A6 neurons are observed. The alphanumeric nomenclature system, developed in laboratory rodent brains, has been adapted to cover the variation observed across species. Cross-species homology is observed regarding the nuclear organization of noradrenergic neurons located in the parvicellular reticular nucleus (A5 and A7). In contrast, significant variations are observed in the organization of the A6 neurons of the locus coeruleus proper. In most mammals, the A6 is comprised of a moderate density of neurons, but in Murid rodents, primates, and megachiropteran bats, the A6 exhibits a very high density of neurons. In primates and megachiropterans, there is an additional moderate density of A6 neurons located rostromedial to the high-density portion. These variations are of importance in understanding the translation of findings in laboratory rodents to humans.</p>
