              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Alternate patterns of temperature variation bring about very different disease outcomes at different mean temperatures</a></h4>

              
                The dynamics of host-parasite interactions are highly temperature-dependent and may be modified by increasing frequency and intensity of climate-driven heat events. Here, we show that altered patterns of temperature variance lead to an almost order-of-magnitude shift in thermal performance of host and pathogen life-history traits over and above the effects of mean temperature and, moreover, that different temperature regimes affect these traits differently. We found that diurnal fluctuations of ±3°C lowered infection rates and reduced spore burden compared to constant temperatures in our focal host <i>Daphnia magna</i> exposed to the microsporidium parasite <i>Ordospora colligata</i>. In contrast, a 3-day heatwave (+6°C) did not affect infection rates, but increased spore burden (relative to constant temperatures with the same mean) at 16°C, while reducing burden at higher temperatures. We conclude that changing patterns of climate variation, superimposed on shifts in mean temperatures due to global warming, may have profound and unanticipated effects on disease dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Patient-specific Boolean models of signalling networks guide personalised treatments</a></h4>

              
                Prostate cancer is the second most occurring cancer in men worldwide. To better understand the mechanisms of tumorigenesis and possible treatment responses, we developed a mathematical model of prostate cancer which considers the major signalling pathways known to be deregulated. We personalised this Boolean model to molecular data to reflect the heterogeneity and specific response to perturbations of cancer patients. 488 prostate samples were used to build patient-specific models and compared to available clinical data. Additionally, eight prostate cell-line-specific models were built to validate our approach with dose-response data of several drugs. The effects of single and combined drugs were tested in these models under different growth conditions. We identified 15 actionable points of interventions in one cell-line-specific model whose inactivation hinders tumorigenesis. To validate these results, we tested nine small molecule inhibitors of five of those putative targets and found a dose-dependent effect on four of them, notably those targeting HSP90 and PI3K. These results highlight the predictive power of our personalised Boolean models and illustrate how they can be used for precision oncology.

                Sustainable land-system transformations are necessary to avert biodiversity and climate collapse. However, it remains unclear where entry points for transformations exist in complex land systems. Here, we conceptualize land systems along land-use trajectories, which allows us to identify and evaluate leverage points, i.e., entry points on the trajectory where targeted...

                Mycobacterium tuberculosis has a lipid-rich cell envelope that is remodeled throughout infection to enable adaptation within the host. Few transcriptional regulators have been characterized that coordinate synthesis of mycolic acids, the major cell wall lipids of mycobacteria. Here, we show that the mycolic acid desaturase regulator (MadR), a transcriptional repressor...

                Background - Data analytics can support the external auditors’ judgements. However, little is known about the external auditors’ data analytics competency. Likewise, role of religiosity in enhancing the external auditors’ performance is also inadequately investigated. This study examined: 1) the effects of data analytics competency on the external auditors’ performance, and 2) the moderating effects of religiosity on data analytics competency and external auditors’ performance relationship. Methods – Survey was conducted on 201 external auditors. Data analytics competency dimensions, namely, personal capabilities, professional expertise, technical skills, technologies and tools expertise were examined. Religiosity was measured by level and dimension (faith, virtue and optional). Results – Data analytics competency (personal capabilities) has a significant positive effect on the Muslim external auditors’ performance, whereas data analytics competency (technologies and tools expertise) has a significant positive affect on the non-Muslim external auditors’ performance. Level of religiosity has significant moderating effect on the relationship between data analytics competency (technologies and tools expertise) and Muslim external auditors’ performance. Nonetheless, level of religiosity does not moderate the relationship between data analytics competency and the performance of non-Muslim external auditors. Religiosity (virtue) has significant moderating effect on the relationship between data analytics competency (personal capabilities) and Muslim external auditors’ performance. Meanwhile, religiosity (faith) has a significant moderating effect on the relationship between data analytics competency (technologies and tools expertise) and non-Muslim external auditors’ performance. Conclusion – This study demonstrates that data analytics competency and religiosity can influence the external auditors’ performance.

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Amacrine cells (ACs) are the most diverse neuronal cell type in the vertebrate retina. Yet little is known about the contribution of ACs to visual processing and retinal disease. A major challenge in evaluating AC function is genetic accessibility. A classic tool of mouse genetics, Cre-mediated recombination, can provide such access. We have screened existing genetically-modified mouse strains and identified multiple candidates that express Cre-recombinase in subsets of retinal ACs. The Cre-expressing mice were crossed to fluorescent-reporter mice to assay Cre expression. In addition, a Cre-dependent fluorescent reporter plasmid was electroporated into the subretinal space of Cre strains. Herein, we report three mouse lines (<I>Tac1::IRES-cre</I>, <I>Camk2a-cre</I>, and <I>Scx-cre</I>) that express Cre recombinase in sub-populations of ACs. In two of these lines, recombination occurred in multiple AC types and a small number of other retinal cell types, while recombination in the <I>Camk2a-cre</I> line appears specific to a morphologically distinct AC. We anticipate that these characterized mouse lines will be valuable tools to the community of researchers who study retinal biology and disease.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Auditory Nerve Fiber Discrimination and Representation of Naturally-Spoken Vowels in Noise</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>To understand how vowels are encoded by auditory nerve (AN) fibers, a number of representation schemes have been suggested that extract the vowel&rsquo;s formant frequencies from AN-fiber spiking patterns. The current study aims to apply and compare these schemes for AN-fiber responses to naturally-spoken vowels in a speech-shaped background noise. Responses to three vowels were evaluated; based on behavioral experiments in the same species, two of these were perceptually difficult to discriminate from each other (/e/ vs /i/), and one was perceptually easy to discriminate from the other two (/a:/). Single-unit AN fibers were recorded from ketamine/xylazine-anesthetized Mongolian gerbils of either sex (<I>n</I> = 8). First, single-unit discrimination between the three vowels was studied. Compared with the perceptually easy discriminations, the average spike timing-based discrimination values were significantly lower for the perceptually difficult vowel discrimination. This was not true for an average rate-based discrimination metric, the rate d-prime (d&rsquo;). Consistently, spike timing-based representation schemes, plotting the temporal responses of all recorded units as a function of their best frequency (BF), i.e., dominant component schemes, average localized interval rate, and fluctuation profiles, revealed representation of the vowel&rsquo;s formant frequencies, whereas no such representation was apparent in the rate-based excitation pattern. Making use of perceptual discrimination data, this study reveals that discrimination difficulties of naturally-spoken vowels in speech-shaped noise originate peripherally and can be studied in the spike timing patterns of single AN fibers.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Modelling sociodemographic factors that affect malaria prevalence in Sussundenga, Mozambique: a cross-sectional study. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Malaria is still one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in Mozambique with little progress in malaria control over the past 20 years. Sussundenga is one of most affected areas. Malaria transmission has a strong association with environmental and sociodemographic factors. The knowledge of sociodemographic factors that affects malaria, may be used to improve the strategic planning for its control. Currently such studies have not been performed in Sussundenga. Thus, the objective of this study is to model the relationship between malaria and sociodemographic factors in Sussundenga, Mozambique. Methods: Houses in the study area were digitalized and enumerated using Google Earth Pro version 7.3. In this study 100 houses were randomly selected to conduct a community survey of Plasmodium falciparum parasite prevalence using rapid diagnostic test (RDT). During the survey, a questionnaire was conducted to assess the sociodemographic factors of the participants. Descriptive statistics were analyzed and backward stepwise logistic regression was performed establishing a relationship between positive cases and the factors. The analysis was carried out using SPSS version 20 package. Results: The overall P. falciparum prevalence was 31.6%. Half of the malaria positive cases occurred in age group 5 to 14 years. Previous malaria treatment, population density and age group were significant predictors for the model. The model explained 13.5% of the variance in malaria positive cases and sensitivity of the final model was 73.3%. Conclusion: In this area the highest burden of P. falciparum infection was among those aged 5–14 years old. Malaria infection was related to sociodemographic factors. Targeting malaria control at community level can combat the disease more effectively than waiting for cases at health centers. These finding can be used to guide more effective interventions in this region.

                During the sequencing process, problems can occur with any device, including the MGISEQ-2000 (DNBSEQ-G400) platform. We encountered a power outage that resulted in a temporary shutdown of a sequencer in the middle of the run. Since barcode reading in MGISEQ-2000 takes place at the end of the run, it was impossible to use non-demultiplexed raw data. We decided to completely use up the same cartridge with reagents and flow cell loaded with DNB and started a new run in a shortened custom mode. We figured out how the MGISEQ-2000 converts preliminary data in .cal format into .fastq files and wrote a script named “Runcer-Necromacer” for merging .fastq files based on the analysis of their headers (available online: https://github.com/genomecenter/runcer-necromancer). Read merging proved to be possible because the MGISEQ-2000 flow cell has a patterned structure and each DNB has invariable coordinates on it, regardless of its position on the flow cell stage. We demonstrated the correctness of data merging by comparing sample analysis results with previously obtained .fastq files for them. Thus, we confirmed that it is possible to restart the device and save both parts of the interrupted run.

                Background: One of the benefits of online education is the potential reduction in carbon emissions through the decrease in travel to attend a university in person. We estimated the savings in CO2 emissions of an international cohort of master’s students who studied fully online from their home countries, rather than travelling to the UK and living there while attending university. Methods: The city and country of residence of a cohort of students who first enrolled in the fully online Peoples-uni/Manchester Metropolitan University Master of Public Health programme between the second semester of 2011 and the first semester 2013 were recorded. Total difference in emissions was calculated by adding the estimated aviation emissions between Manchester, UK and the cities where students resided, to the difference in per capita emissions between the country of origin and the UK for the time that the student would have spent in Manchester, based on the semester in which they first enrolled. Results: 128 students enrolled from 70 cities in 30 countries. 93 students were from a range of African countries and 18 from the Indian sub-continent. Flights to and from Manchester were estimated to have accounted for 114,553kg of CO2 and living in Manchester for the duration of their course compared with staying in the home country would have been equivalent to 854,904kg of CO2. The combined net savings was 969,457kg of CO2. Conclusions: A small cohort of overseas students, largely from Africa and India, studied online rather than attending university in the UK. The likely saving by this small cohort of nearly a million kg of CO 2 emissions offers an indication of the potential environmental benefits of offering university education online to overseas students.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effect of whitening toothpaste on surface roughness and microhardness of human teeth: a systematic review and meta-analysis [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Whitening toothpastes exert a whitening effect on teeth through higher surface cleaning effectiveness resulting from the abrasive properties of the paste or specific chemical components. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conceptualized to examine the relationship between whitening toothpastes and surface roughness as well as microhardness of human teeth and to clarify the evidence base available around this relationship by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies in this topic area, looking at in vitro randomized control trials. Methods: Criteria for including studies in the review were done based on population, intervention, comparison, outcomes and study and studies were identified from electronic databases. Covidence® was used for data screening and data extraction. The CONSORT tool was used for checking relevant content and methodology used in each of the papers reviewed. Systematic review was done followed by meta-analysis, using Review Manager. Results: A total of 125 articles were obtained on key word search. After duplicate removal and title screening, 17 articles were eligible for full text review. Finally, 7 studies were included for systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted on 4 studies. The forest plot for surface roughness showed that that the meta-analytic effect was statistically significant with surface roughness value being higher in the intervention group. The forest plot for microhardness showed that the meta-analytic effect was statistically significant with the microhardness value being lesser in the intervention group. Conclusions: Although whitening toothpastes typically can lighten tooth color by about one or two shades, there is some evidence to show that these toothpastes also affect the mineral content of teeth by increasing surface roughness and reducing microhardness. More evidence and further research are needed to identify the type of whitening agent which will whiten the tooth effectively while maintaining the integrity of the tooth structure.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The benefit of tissue sealant on urethroplasty in hypospadias patients – A systematic review and meta-analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Hypospadias was ranked second after undescended testis as the most prevalent congenital abnormality in newborn males. Hypospadias can be successfully repaired through multiple surgeries in the majority of children. Postoperative complications were not rarely seen after surgeries, such as urethrocutaneous fistula (UCF), meatal stenosis, and glans breakdown. Tissue sealant application in hypospadias repair serves as additional suture line coverage and reduces the post surgery complications5.However, the effects of sealants usage during urethroplasty are still uncertain. This review aimed to know the effects of tissue sealant usage on patients with hypospadias who undergo urethroplasty.  Methods: The study was reported based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Literature was searched on PubMed, Embase, and Scopus following PRISMA guidelines. The search was conducted on October 12th, 2021, using the search term ("glue" OR "sealants" OR "tissue glue" OR "tissue sealant" OR "tissue adhesive") AND ("hypospadias" OR "urethrocutaneous fistula" OR "urethral repair" OR "urethroplasty" OR "hypospadiology").  Result: Systematic searching from all databases resulted in 160 potential articles. After a full-text review, eight articles were included in this study. UCF complication was reported in all studies. The occurrence of complication reported by all studies was urethrocutaneous fistula. Several studies also reported tissue edema and flap-related complications. Tissue sealant had no significant effect in reducing meatal stenosis.   Conclusions: This systematic review revealed additional benefits from several types of tissue sealant in hypospadias repair surgery. Fibrin sealant application over the urethroplasty suture line in hypospadias repair offers a water-proof coverage and may enhance the outcome from the surgery.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Performance and preference of problem-based learning (PBL) and lecture-based classes among medical students of Nepal [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: PBL (problem based learning) is new active learning educational strategy that has been extensively tested and used in recent years. This study aims to compare students' understanding and knowledge retention when taught through PBL and lecture-based classes and compare PAHS students' perceptions of PBL and lectures in medical education. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study of medical students of a PBL based medical school in Nepal, a non-Western low-income country. Ethical approval was given by the institutional research committee of the Patan Academy of Health Sciences. Understanding and knowledge retention was assessed with 50 vignette-based multiple-choice questions, half of which were taught through PBL sessions, and the remaining half were taught in didactic lectures during basic science years of medical school. A separate pre-validated perception questionnaire was used to assess students' preferences regarding PBL and lectures. Results: Out of 107 students, 99 participated in the understanding and knowledge retention questionnaires and 107 completed perception questionnaires. Understanding and knowledge retention of students was found to be the same for topics taught by PBL and lectures, with median scores of 17 and s16, respectively. PBL were mostly preferred for the physiology (59.81%), pathology (51.40%) and pharmacology (53.27%) concepts, and lectures were mostly preferred for the anatomy (78.50%), biochemistry (45.79%), and microbiology (42.99%) topics. Students wanted the same concepts to be taught through both PBL and lectures, especially for anatomy. Conclusions: Understanding and knowledge retention is the same for topics taught by either PBL or lectures during the basic science years of undergraduate medical education. Students prefer PBL for physiology, pathology, and pharmacology-related concepts, conventional didactic lecture for physiology and microbiology, and a combination of lecture and PBL sessions for anatomy.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Colorectal cancer on a dish: exploring the 3D-sphere culture of primary colorectal cancer cells from an Indonesian perspective [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background : Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is one of the deadliest types of cancer and has emerged as one of Indonesia's most devastating diseases. The growing number of colorectal cancer cases is frequently undiagnosed until the disease has progressed to a metastatic stage. This issue has lasted for years, limiting therapy options and resulting in a bad prognosis for the majority of patients. Thus, the purpose of this work is to develop a CRC detection method for Indonesia and other low-middle income nations that integrates in vitro 3D culture, molecular analysis, and in silico analysis. Methods : Colorectal cancer biopsies were transported to the lab and underwent mechanical disaggregation and centrifuged at 300 x g for five minutes. Approximately 10,000 cells were seeded in each Nunc-Sphera 96-well plate (u-bottom) for the following 7 days in standard culture medium. The 3D-sphere was harvested and RNA was extracted afterwards. Molecular analysis was performed using qPCR and the Human Cancer Pathway Profiler. Protein interaction and pathway analysis were conducted using STRING and Reactome online tools. Results :  Following initial seeding, primary CRC 3D-spheres were grown for 14–16 days. Gene profiling and in silico analyses suggest that CDC20, AURKA, and ACLY are expressed at lower levels than the positive control in the 3D-sphere. These markers have been implicated in metastasis, CRC proliferation, and as a drug target ligand. Conclusion : A combination of 3D culture, gene profiling, and in silico analysis is feasible to detect CRC for Indonesia and other low- and middle-income countries. A future possibility is to use minicolorectal cancer in a dish for ex vivo cancer modeling and pharmacological testing.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Vessel masking and Hough transform for optic disc localisation from retinal images [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Retinal images can be considered as one of the reliable indicators for symptoms of many ocular diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration and glaucoma. By analysing and tracking changes of important structures on a retinal image, symptoms of ocular diseases can be detected in a timely manner which helps physicians plan early treatment for better disease control. One of the important landmarks on a retinal image is the optic disc (OD), which must be localised to estimate retinal vessel parameters such as vessel width and tortuosity. This paper proposes a method for automatic OD localisation from a retinal image. Methods: A retinal image is first pre-processed and thresholded to produce a binary image that highlights most retinal vessels on the image. Next, a discrete cosine transform-based smoothing method is employed to replace the detected vessel pixel values on the pre-processed image with values closer to the surrounding neighbour pixel values, effectively masking most vessels on the image. Hough transform is then applied to the vessel-masked image to detect the circle representing the OD on the image, producing the estimated location of the OD center and its estimated diameter. Results: Applying the proposed method to three different public databases, namely Digital Retinal Images for Vessel Extraction (DRIVE), High-Resolution Fundus (HRF) and Methods to Evaluate Segmentation and Indexing Techniques in the field of Retinal Ophthalmology (MESSIDOR) resulted in an overall detection rate of 99.53%. Conclusions: The achieved performance by the proposed method is superior to many published methods of OD localization, with a processing time of less than one second for each image. While this has only been validated on one type of retinal images, future investigations may include validation on other types such as angiograms or scanning laser ophthalmoscopy.

                Background: As Malaysia struggles with the battle to retain talented workers, the retention of persons with disabilities (PWDs) remains a major challenge in innovation management. Malaysia currently has the lowest retention of PWDs in innovation management in The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The purpose of this study is to develop a unique framework to enhance the inclusion of PWDs in Malaysia.  Methods: A questionnaire was distributed to 200 PWDs in the central region of Malaysia.   Results: Based on the results of this research, four crucial variables (salary, compensation, career advancement and reward management) contributed to the lack of involvement in innovation management among PWDs in Malaysia.  Conclusions: This study only focuses on 200 PWDs in Malaysia. Despite the fact that PWDs’ involvement in innovation management is the lowest, there is a lack of research initiative and practitioner commitment to address this issue. Serving as preliminary research in Malaysia, this study develops a unique framework to fill the gap.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Shape analysis of gamma rhythm supports a superlinear inhibitory regime in an inhibition-stabilized network</a></h4>

              
                <p>by R Krishnakumaran, Mohammed Raees, Supratim Ray</p>

Visual inspection of stimulus-induced gamma oscillations (30–70 Hz) often reveals a non-sinusoidal shape. Such distortions are a hallmark of non-linear systems and are also observed in mean-field models of gamma oscillations. A thorough characterization of the shape of the gamma cycle can therefore provide additional constraints on the operating regime of such models. However, the gamma waveform has not been quantitatively characterized, partially because the first harmonic of gamma, which arises because of the non-sinusoidal nature of the signal, is typically weak and gets masked due to a broadband increase in power related to spiking. To address this, we recorded local field potential (LFP) from the primary visual cortex (V1) of two awake female macaques while presenting full-field gratings or iso-luminant chromatic hues that produced huge gamma oscillations with prominent peaks at harmonic frequencies in the power spectra. We found that gamma and its first harmonic always maintained a specific phase relationship, resulting in a distinctive shape with a sharp trough and a shallow peak. Interestingly, a Wilson-Cowan (WC) model operating in an inhibition stabilized mode could replicate this shape, but only when the inhibitory population operated in the super-linear regime, as predicted recently. However, another recently developed model of gamma that operates in a linear regime driven by stochastic noise failed to produce salient harmonics or the observed shape. Our results impose additional constraints on models that generate gamma oscillations and their operating regimes.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Patient contrastive learning: A performant, expressive, and practical approach to electrocardiogram modeling</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nathaniel Diamant, Erik Reinertsen, Steven Song, Aaron D. Aguirre, Collin M. Stultz, Puneet Batra</p>

Supervised machine learning applications in health care are often limited due to a scarcity of labeled training data. To mitigate the effect of small sample size, we introduce a pre-training approach, Patient Contrastive Learning of Representations (PCLR), which creates latent representations of electrocardiograms (ECGs) from a large number of unlabeled examples using contrastive learning. The resulting representations are expressive, performant, and practical across a wide spectrum of clinical tasks. We develop PCLR using a large health care system with over 3.2 million 12-lead ECGs and demonstrate that training linear models on PCLR representations achieves a 51% performance increase, on average, over six training set sizes and four tasks (sex classification, age regression, and the detection of left ventricular hypertrophy and atrial fibrillation), relative to training neural network models from scratch. We also compared PCLR to three other ECG pre-training approaches (supervised pre-training, unsupervised pre-training with an autoencoder, and pre-training using a contrastive multi ECG-segment approach), and show significant performance benefits in three out of four tasks. We found an average performance benefit of 47% over the other models and an average of a 9% performance benefit compared to best model for each task. We release PCLR to enable others to extract ECG representations at https://github.com/broadinstitute/ml4h/tree/master/model_zoo/PCLR.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">gmxapi: A GROMACS-native Python interface for molecular dynamics with ensemble and plugin support</a></h4>

              
                <p>by M. Eric Irrgang, Caroline Davis, Peter M. Kasson</p>

Gmxapi provides an integrated, native Python API for both standard and advanced molecular dynamics simulations in GROMACS. The Python interface permits multiple levels of integration with the core GROMACS libraries, and legacy support is provided via an interface that mimics the command-line syntax, so that all GROMACS commands are fully available. Gmxapi has been officially supported since the GROMACS 2019 release and is enabled by default in current versions of the software. Here we describe gmxapi 0.3 and later. Beyond simply wrapping GROMACS library operations, the API permits several advanced operations that are not feasible using the prior command-line interface. First, the API allows custom user plugin code within the molecular dynamics force calculations, so users can execute custom algorithms without modifying the GROMACS source. Second, the Python interface allows tasks to be dynamically defined, so high-level algorithms for molecular dynamics simulation and analysis can be coordinated with loop and conditional operations. Gmxapi makes GROMACS more accessible to custom Python scripting while also providing support for high-level data-flow simulation algorithms that were previously feasible only in external packages.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Evidence for the emergence of β-trefoils by ‘Peptide Budding’ from an IgG-like β-sandwich</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Liam M. Longo, Rachel Kolodny, Shawn E. McGlynn</p>

As sequence and structure comparison algorithms gain sensitivity, the intrinsic interconnectedness of the protein universe has become increasingly apparent. Despite this general trend, β-trefoils have emerged as an uncommon counterexample: They are an isolated protein lineage for which few, if any, sequence or structure associations to other lineages have been identified. If β-trefoils are, in fact, remote islands in sequence-structure space, it implies that the oligomerizing peptide that founded the β-trefoil lineage itself arose <i>de novo</i>. To better understand β-trefoil evolution, and to probe the limits of fragment sharing across the protein universe, we identified both ‘β-trefoil bridging themes’ (evolutionarily-related sequence segments) and ‘β-trefoil-like motifs’ (structure motifs with a hallmark feature of the β-trefoil architecture) in multiple, ostensibly unrelated, protein lineages. The success of the present approach stems, in part, from considering β-trefoil sequence segments or structure motifs rather than the β-trefoil architecture as a whole, as has been done previously. The newly uncovered inter-lineage connections presented here suggest a novel hypothesis about the origins of the β-trefoil fold itself–namely, that it is a derived fold formed by ‘budding’ from an Immunoglobulin-like β-sandwich protein. These results demonstrate how the evolution of a folded domain from a peptide need not be a signature of antiquity and underpin an emerging truth: few protein lineages escape nature’s sewing table.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Elucidating multi-input processing 3-node gene regulatory network topologies capable of generating striped gene expression patterns</a></h4>

A central problem in developmental and synthetic biology is understanding the mechanisms by which cells in a tissue or a Petri dish process external cues and transform such information into a coherent response, e.g., a terminal differentiation state. It was long believed that this type of positional information could be entirely attributed to a gradient of concentration of a specific signaling molecule (i.e., a morphogen). However, advances in experimental methodologies and computer modeling have demonstrated the crucial role of the dynamics of a cell’s gene regulatory network (GRN) in decoding the information carried by the morphogen, which is eventually translated into a spatial pattern. This morphogen interpretation mechanism has gained much attention in systems biology as a tractable system to investigate the emergent properties of complex genotype-phenotype maps. In this study, we apply a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-like algorithm to probe the design space of three-node GRNs with the ability to generate a band-like expression pattern (target phenotype) in the middle of an arrangement of 30 cells, which resemble a simple (1-D) morphogenetic field in a developing embryo. Unlike most modeling studies published so far, here we explore the space of GRN topologies with nodes having the potential to perceive the same input signal differently. This allows for a lot more flexibility during the search space process, and thus enables us to identify a larger set of potentially interesting and realizable morphogen interpretation mechanisms. Out of 2061 GRNs selected using the search space algorithm, we found 714 classes of network topologies that could correctly interpret the morphogen. Notably, the main network motif that generated the target phenotype in response to the input signal was the type 3 Incoherent Feed-Forward Loop (I3-FFL), which agrees with previous theoretical expectations and experimental observations. Particularly, compared to a previously reported pattern forming GRN topologies, we have uncovered a great variety of novel network designs, some of which might be worth inquiring through synthetic biology methodologies to test for the ability of network design with minimal regulatory complexity to interpret a developmental cue robustly.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Computational modelling of cell motility modes emerging from cell-matrix adhesion dynamics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Leonie van Steijn, Inge M. N. Wortel, Clément Sire, Loïc Dupré, Guy Theraulaz, Roeland M. H. Merks</p>

Lymphocytes have been described to perform different motility patterns such as Brownian random walks, persistent random walks, and Lévy walks. Depending on the conditions, such as confinement or the distribution of target cells, either Brownian or Lévy walks lead to more efficient interaction with the targets. The diversity of these motility patterns may be explained by an adaptive response to the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). Indeed, depending on the ECM composition, lymphocytes either display a floating motility without attaching to the ECM, or sliding and stepping motility with respectively continuous or discontinuous attachment to the ECM, or pivoting behaviour with sustained attachment to the ECM. Moreover, on the long term, lymphocytes either perform a persistent random walk or a Brownian-like movement depending on the ECM composition. How the ECM affects cell motility is still incompletely understood. Here, we integrate essential mechanistic details of the lymphocyte-matrix adhesions and lymphocyte intrinsic cytoskeletal induced cell propulsion into a Cellular Potts model (CPM). We show that the combination of <i>de novo</i> cell-matrix adhesion formation, adhesion growth and shrinkage, adhesion rupture, and feedback of adhesions onto cell propulsion recapitulates multiple lymphocyte behaviours, for different lymphocyte subsets and various substrates. With an increasing attachment area and increased adhesion strength, the cells’ speed and persistence decreases. Additionally, the model predicts random walks with short-term persistent but long-term subdiffusive properties resulting in a pivoting type of motility. For small adhesion areas, the spatial distribution of adhesions emerges as a key factor influencing cell motility. Small adhesions at the front allow for more persistent motility than larger clusters at the back, despite a similar total adhesion area. In conclusion, we present an integrated framework to simulate the effects of ECM proteins on cell-matrix adhesion dynamics. The model reveals a sufficient set of principles explaining the plasticity of lymphocyte motility.

Is there any research that should not be done? Could you think of an experiment and then decide not to do it? These questions get to the heart of the power of modern genetics to mix up and alter genes.

Is there any research you think should not be done? Can you imagine deciding not to do an experiment? This Perspective article explores controversial experiments in the past and today, and what should be done.

                Background : The bauxite mining area on Bintan Island continues to expand into the mangrove forest area. Mangrove forests have ecological, economic, and social importance, which must be managed accordingly to maintain their sustainability. This research was conducted to examine the sustainability of mangrove forest management in the former bauxite mining area on Bintan Island.                                                         Methods: The approach used is Multi Dimensional Scaling- Rapid Appraisal for Sustainability through the modified Rapfish ordinance software technique for the Mangrove Ecosystem. The type of data used is quantitative, covering five dimensions of sustainability, namely ecological, economic, social, legal and institutional as well as technology.                                                                                                        Results: The results showed that the sustainability index status of the ecological, social, legal and institutional dimensions was quite sustainable, while the sustainability index of the economic dimension was unsustainable, and the technological dimension was less sustainable. Attributes of levers that are sensitive to the sustainability of mangrove forest management are: 1) Mangrove density, 2) Substrate fraction, 3) sedimentation, 4) Mangrove importance index, 5) Bio-concentration factor, 6) Benefit value direct, 7) Indirect benefit value, 8) Dependence on mangrove forest as a source of livelihood, 9) Corporate Social Responsibility funding support, 10) Community income, 11) Community health level, 12) Community perception, 13) Legality of mangrove area and mining, 14) Pollution monitoring technology in ex-mining areas and 15) Mangrove rehabilitation technology.                                                                                          Conclusions:The status of the mangrove forest sustainability index on Bintan Island is quite good. the economic and technological dimensions can be upgraded to sustainable status by carrying out management that is more focused on the lever attributes of the ecological, social, legal and institutional dimensions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Association of women’s literacy and children’s mortality rate among countries in southeast Asia 2015-2019: a cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Women’s literacy is often associated with the health status of family members, especially children. Unfortunately, in some regions of Southeast Asia, the rates of women’s literacy are still very low, and in these areas, children’s mortality rates are also very high. This study aims to identify the association of women's literacy and children’s mortality rates among countries in the Southeast Asian region from 2015 to 2019. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, children’s mortality rates were defined as mortality rates in newborns and under-fives. Besides women’s literacy (WL), we also assessed the Human Development Index (HDI), Freedom Status (FS), Government Effectiveness (GE), and the proportion of births assisted by skilled health staff (BASHS) as the independent variables in this study. First, we describe the profiles of WL as well as newborn and under-five mortality rates among 11 countries in Southeast Asia from 2015 to 2019, and then we assess the correlations. Results: Between 2015 to 2019, Myanmar, Lao, and Timor-Leste had the highest child mortality rates. In addition, these four countries were the countries with the lowest WL rates compared to other countries. Children’s mortality rates were significantly associated with WL, GE, HDI, and BASHS. Meanwhile, this study found that the FS of a country was not significantly associated with the children’s mortality rate of countries in the Southeast Asia region. Conclusion: This study found that there’s an indication that the better the WL rate, as well as the governance, the HDI, and maternity services in a country, the lower its children’s mortality rates. Therefore, improvement in multiple sectors such as governance, economy, health system, education, and gender equality is required to help countries in this region achieve the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals target by 2030.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Framing and understanding the whole aspect of oral sex from social and health perspective: a narrative review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Since thousands of years ago, oral sex has become part of sexual behavior among humans. Oral sex is considered taboo. Its taboo does not lie in the behavior, but its expression is deemed inappropriate. As technology becomes more sophisticated, human rights also stand out, leading to the disclosure of the practice in the 21st century. The oral sex that is discussed on a large scale in media encourages people to express it as feedback whether within right or not. It all depends on the value of each people. We found that this sexual behavior is found everywhere regardless of religion, culture, and race. Pop culture influences this behavior so much, it can be seen from music, movies, and television programs that provoke oral sex. Many motivations underlying this behavior include getting sexual pleasure for the sake of living well-being. But it is undeniable that this behavior is still controversial. It could be at risk of causing disease and, on the other hand, is reported to provide many benefits.  According to our theory, oral sex is not a new behavior crossing boundaries. It is just an old behavior that surfaces because of the factors that support it. This behavior, which is still considered taboo, has its disadvantages such as sexually transmitted disease but has also benefits such as preventing preeclampsia.

                Ovaries can be an elective metastatic site for many cancers mostly in gastrointestinal tract, breast and endometrial cancers. Gallbladder and bile ducts cancers are rare, accounting for few ovarian metastatic tumors. We report a case of bilateral metastatic ovarian of gallbladder carcinoma in a 44 years old woman. Patient had pelvic pain, anorexia, weight loss and decreased visual acuity. Imagery showed bilateral ovarian tumor and polyp in the gallbladder.  Furthermore, there were metastasis to the liver, lungs and choroid plexus. Liver biopsy confirmed the metastatic origin from gallbladder cancer. Patient underwent surgery. She had total hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy, omentectomy and cholecystectomy.  She passed away six months later, after refusing additional adjuvant therapy.

                Background:  Malnutrition is well-known to yield high morbidities and it has pre-eruptive and post-eruptive consequences. The objective of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of Hypomineralized Second Primary Molars (HSPM), Molar Incisor Hypomineralization (MIH) and dental caries in malnourished children, as well as addressing the relation between types of malnutrition and the dental morbidities. Methods: This is a cross sectional analytical study. A consecutive sample of 54 malnourished cases aged 5-10 years and presented to the Outpatient Clinic of Pediatric Dentistry Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University across 6 months period were examined for HSPM, MIH – using the  European Academy of Pediatric Dentistry criteria - and dental Caries using def/ DMF indices. Outcomes were the presence or absence of MIH and HSPM and their levels measured as percentage as well as Caries Indices. Exposures were types of malnutrition and the socioeconomic status.  Results:  The mean age of study participants was 7.10 ± 1.34 years. HSPM and MIH were found in 47.2% and 45.2% of the study participants respectively, while dental caries was observed in 83% and 64.3% for primary and permanent teeth respectively. There was co-occurrence between HSPM and MIH in 39% of the cases. HSPM level was significantly different in various types of malnutrition. It showed significant difference between the stunted group (median HSPM of 14.2%) and the overweight or obese group (median HSPM of 0.0%) (P value 0.01). MIH level showed significant differences between the stunted group (median MIH of 19.4%) and overweight or obese group (median MIH of 0.0%) (p value 0.001), as well as between the stunted group (median MIH of 19.4%) and wasted group (median MIH of 0.0%) (p value 0.025). Conclusions: Malnourished children have high prevalence of dental abnormalities. HSPM could expect the presence of MIH.

                Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about many changes in all sectors of life, especially in the field of education. These changes aim to make the learning process more effective in the pandemic environment. However, it can be challenging, as some students do not give positive responses to these changes, especially those in remote areas. This article aims to identify and report students' perceptions about the effectiveness of online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic in the remote North Tapanuli region of Indonesia. Methods: In this study, data were obtained using an online survey involving 30 students from three levels of education, namely junior high school, senior high school, and college. They are students who the teacher appoints as class administrators; through them, the teacher communicates about everything—learning activities. So compared to his other friends, they know more about the implementation of online learning during the covid 19 pandemic. In addition, schools in remote areas have fewer students than schools in big cities. So we conclude that this research is considered representative with thirty students as the sample. The data gathered from the survey were analyzed using quantitative descriptive methods. Results: Results show that online learning is considered less effective by students in remote areas; this happens because communication networks and infrastructure do not adequately support them to follow online learning. Conclusion: Teachers need to evaluate how to teach as well as re-design models and approaches to be applied in learning. This can be achieved by adjusting to the student’s current situation to generate interest and willingness to learn online.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Polygenic Risk Score in African populations: progress and challenges [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) analysis is a method that predicts the genetic risk of an individual towards targeted traits. Even when there are no significant markers, it gives evidence of a genetic effect beyond the results of Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS). Moreover, it selects  single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that  contribute to the disease with low effect size  making it more precise at individual level risk prediction. PRS  analysis addresses the shortfall of GWAS by taking into account the SNPs/alleles with  low effect size but play an indispensable role to the observed phenotypic/trait variance.  PRS analysis has  applications that investigate the genetic basis of several traits, which includes rare diseases. However, the accuracy of PRS analysis depends on the genomic data of the underlying population. For instance, several studies  show   that obtaining higher prediction power of PRS analysis is challenging for non-Europeans. In this manuscript, we review the conventional PRS methods and their application to sub-Saharan African communities. We conclude that  lack of sufficient GWAS data and tools is  the limiting factor of applying PRS analysis to sub-Saharan populations.   We recommend developing Africa-specific PRS methods and tools for estimating and analyzing  African population data   for clinical  evaluation of PRSs of interest and predicting  rare diseases.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Decision making resides at the interface between sensory perception and movement production. Female songbirds in the context of mate choice are an excellent system to define neural circuits through which sensory perception influences production of courtship behaviors. Previous experiments by our group and others have implicated secondary auditory brain sites, including the caudal nidopallium (NC), in mediating behavioral indicators of mate choice. Here, we used anterograde tracer molecules to define projections that emerge from NC in female songbirds, identifying pathways through which NC influences downstream sites implicated in signal processing and decision making. Our results reveal that NC sends projections into the arcopallium, including the ventral intermediate arcopallium (AIV). Previous work revealed that AIV also receives input from another auditory area implicated in song preference and mate choice (caudal mesopallium, CM), suggesting that convergent input from multiple auditory areas may play important roles in initiating mate choice behaviors. In the present results, NC projects to an area implicated in postural and locomotory control (dorsal arcopallium, Ad), suggesting that NC may play a role in directing those forms of copulatory behavior. NC projections also systematically avoid a vocal motor region of the arcopallium that is innervated by CM (robust nucleus of the arcopallium). These results suggest a model in which both NC and CM project to arcopallial pathways implicated in behavioral motivation. These brain regions may exert different influences on pathways through which auditory information can direct different facets of behavioral responses to information detected in those auditory signals.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Three-dimensional multi-site random access photostimulation (3D-MAP)</a></h4>

              
                Optical control of neural ensemble activity is crucial for understanding brain function and disease, yet no technology can achieve optogenetic control of very large numbers of neurons at an extremely fast rate over a large volume. State-of-the-art multiphoton holographic optogenetics requires high-power illumination that only addresses relatively small populations of neurons in parallel. Conversely, one-photon holographic techniques can stimulate more neurons with two to three orders lower power, but with limited resolution or addressable volume. Perhaps most problematically, two-photon holographic optogenetic systems are extremely expensive and sophisticated which has precluded their broader adoption in the neuroscience community. To address this technical gap, we introduce a new one-photon light sculpting technique, three-dimensional multi-site random access photostimulation (3D-MAP), that overcomes these limitations by modulating light dynamically, both in the spatial and in the angular domain at multi-kHz rates. We use 3D-MAP to interrogate neural circuits in 3D and demonstrate simultaneous photostimulation and imaging of dozens of user-selected neurons in the intact mouse brain in vivo with high spatio-temporal resolution. 3D-MAP can be broadly adopted for high-throughput all-optical interrogation of brain circuits owing to its powerful combination of scale, speed, simplicity, and cost.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Conformational decoupling in acid-sensing ion channels uncovers mechanism and stoichiometry of PcTx1-mediated inhibition</a></h4>

              
                Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are trimeric proton-gated cation channels involved in fast synaptic transmission. Pharmacological inhibition of ASIC1a reduces neurotoxicity and stroke infarct volumes, with the cysteine knot toxin Psalmotoxin-1 (PcTx1) being one of the most potent and selective inhibitors. PcTx1 binds at the subunit interface in the extracellular domain (ECD), but the mechanism and conformational consequences of the interaction, as well as the number of toxin molecules required for inhibition remain unknown. Here we use voltage-clamp fluorometry and subunit concatenation to decipher the mechanism and stoichiometry of PcTx1 inhibition of ASIC1a. Besides the known inhibitory binding mode, we propose PcTx1 to have at least two additional binding modes that are decoupled from the pore. One of these modes induces a long-lived ECD conformation that reduces the activity of an endogenous neuropeptide. This long-lived conformational state is proton-dependent and can be destabilized by a mutation that decreases PcTx1 sensitivity. Lastly, the use of concatemeric channel constructs reveal that disruption of a single PcTx1 binding site is sufficient to destabilize the toxin-induced conformation, while functional inhibition is not impaired until two or more binding sites are mutated. Together, our work provides insight into the mechanism of PcTx1 inhibition of ASICs and uncovers a prolonged conformational change with possible pharmacological implications.

                Guanosine pentaphosphate and tetraphosphate (together referred to as ppGpp) are hyperphosphorylated nucleotides found in bacteria and the chloroplasts of plants and algae. In plants and algae artificial ppGpp accumulation can inhibit chloroplast gene expression, and influence photosynthesis, nutrient remobilisation, growth, and immunity. However, it is so far unknown whether ppGpp is required for abiotic stress acclimation in plants. Here, we demonstrate that ppGpp biosynthesis is necessary for acclimation to nitrogen starvation in Arabidopsis. We show that ppGpp is required for remodeling the photosynthetic electron transport chain to downregulate photosynthetic activity and for protection against oxidative stress. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ppGpp is required for coupling chloroplastic and nuclear gene expression during nitrogen starvation. Altogether, our work indicates that ppGpp is a pivotal regulator of chloroplast activity for stress acclimation in plants.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Multiomic characterization of pancreatic cancer-associated macrophage polarization reveals deregulated metabolic programs driven by the GM-CSF–PI3K pathway</a></h4>

              
                The pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma microenvironment is composed of a variety of cell types and marked by extensive fibrosis and inflammation. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are abundant, and they are important mediators of disease progression and invasion. TAMs are polarized in situ to a tumor promoting and immunosuppressive phenotype via cytokine signaling and metabolic crosstalk from malignant epithelial cells and other components of the tumor microenvironment. However, the specific distinguishing features and functions of TAMs remain poorly defined. Here, we generated tumor-educated macrophages (TEMs) in vitro and performed detailed, multiomic characterization (i.e., transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics). Our results reveal unique genetic and metabolic signatures of TEMs, the veracity of which were queried against our in-house single-cell RNA sequencing dataset of human pancreatic tumors. This analysis identified expression of novel, metabolic TEM markers in human pancreatic TAMs, including ARG1, ACLY, and TXNIP. We then utilized our TEM model system to study the role of mutant Kras signaling in cancer cells on TEM polarization. This revealed an important role for granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and lactate on TEM polarization, molecules released from cancer cells in a mutant Kras-dependent manner. Lastly, we demonstrate that GM-CSF dysregulates TEM gene expression and metabolism through PI3K–AKT pathway signaling. Collectively, our results define new markers and programs to classify pancreatic TAMs, how these are engaged by cancer cells, and the precise signaling pathways mediating polarization.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">VTA-projecting cerebellar neurons mediate stress-dependent depression-like behaviors</a></h4>

              
                Although cerebellar alterations have been implicated in stress symptoms, the exact contribution of the cerebellum to stress symptoms remains to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrated the crucial role of cerebellar neurons projecting to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in the development of chronic stress-induced behavioral alterations in mice. Chronic chemogenetic activation of inhibitory Purkinje cells in crus I suppressed c-Fos expression in the DN and an increase in immobility in the tail suspension test or forced swimming test, which were triggered by chronic stress application. The combination of adeno-associated virus-based circuit mapping and electrophysiological recording identified network connections from crus I to the VTA via the dentate nucleus (DN) of the deep cerebellar nuclei. Furthermore, chronic inhibition of specific neurons in the DN that project to the VTA prevented stressed mice from showing such depression-like behavior, whereas chronic activation of these neurons alone triggered behavioral changes that were comparable with the depression-like behaviors triggered by chronic stress application. Our results indicate that the VTA-projecting cerebellar neurons proactively regulate the development of depression-like behavior, raising the possibility that cerebellum may be an effective target for the prevention of depressive disorders in human.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Gene age shapes the transcriptional landscape of sexual morphogenesis in mushroom forming fungi (Agaricomycetes)</a></h4>

              
                Multicellularity has been one of the most important innovations in the history of life. The role of gene regulatory changes in driving transitions to multicellularity is being increasingly recognized; however, factors influencing gene expression patterns are poorly known in many clades. Here we compared the developmental transcriptomes of complex multicellular fruiting bodies of eight Agaricomycetes and <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i>, a closely related human pathogen with a simple morphology. In-depth analysis in <i>Pleurotus ostreatus</i> revealed that allele-specific expression, natural antisense transcripts and developmental gene expression, but not RNA editing or a 'developmental hourglass' act in concert to shape its transcriptome during fruiting body development. We found that transcriptional patterns of genes strongly depend on their evolutionary ages. Young genes showed more developmental and allele-specific expression variation, possibly because of weaker evolutionary constraint, suggestive of non-adaptive expression variance in fruiting bodies. These results prompted us to define a set of conserved genes specifically regulated only during complex morphogenesis by excluding young genes and accounting for deeply conserved ones shared with species showing simple sexual development. Analysis of the resulting gene set revealed evolutionary and functional associations with complex multicellularity, which allowed us to speculate they are involved in complex multicellular morphogenesis of mushroom fruiting bodies.

                Neuropeptides act mostly on a class of G-protein coupled receptors, and play a fundamental role in the functions of neural circuits underlying behaviors. However, the functions of neuropeptide receptors are poorly understood. Here, we used the mollusc model system Aplysia and microinjected the exogenous neuropeptide receptor apATRPR ( Aplysia Allatotropin-related peptide receptor) with an expression vector (pNEX3) into Aplysia neurons that did not express the receptor. Physiological experiments demonstrated that apATRPR could mediate the excitability increase activated by its ligand, apATRP ( Aplysia Allatotropin-related peptide), in the Aplysia neurons that now express the receptor. This study provides the first definitive evidence for a physiological function of a neuropeptide receptor in molluscan animals.

                Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder where recent evidence suggests pathogenesis may be mediated by inflammatory processes. The molecular architecture of the disease remains to be fully elucidated. We performed single-nucleus transcriptomics and unbiased proteomics using postmortem tissue obtained from the prefrontal cortex of 12 individuals with late-stage PD and age-matched controls. We analyzed ~80,000 nuclei and identified eight major cell types, including brain-resident T cells, each with distinct transcriptional changes in line with the known genetics of PD. By analyzing Lewy body pathology in the same postmortem tissue, we found that a-synuclein pathology is inversely correlated with chaperone expression in excitatory neurons. Examining cell-cell interactions, we found a selective abatement of neuron-astrocyte interactions and enhanced neuroinflammation. Proteomic analyses of the same brains identified synaptic proteins in prefrontal cortex that were preferentially downregulated in PD. Strikingly, comparing this dataset to a regionally similar published analysis for Alzheimer's disease (AD), we found no common differentially expressed genes in neurons, but identified many shared differentially expressed genes in glial cells, suggesting that disease etiology in PD and AD are likely distinct. These data are presented as a resource for interrogating the molecular and cellular basis of PD and other neurodegenerative diseases.

                In the developing central nervous system, oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) differentiate into oligodendrocytes, which form myelin around axons. Oligodendrocytes and myelin are essential for the function of the central nervous system, as evidenced by the severe neurological symptoms that arise in demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis and leukodystrophy. Although many cell-intrinsic mechanisms that regulate oligodendrocyte development and myelination have been reported, it remains unclear whether interactions among oligodendrocyte-lineage cells (OPCs and oligodendrocytes) affect oligodendrocyte development and myelination. Here, we show that blocking vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP) 1/2/3-dependent exocytosis from oligodendrocyte-lineage cells impairs oligodendrocyte development, myelination, and motor behavior in mice. Adding oligodendrocyte-lineage cell-secreted molecules to secretion-deficient OPC cultures partially restores the morphological maturation of oligodendrocytes. Moreover, we identified L-type prostaglandin D synthase as an oligodendrocyte-lineage cell-secreted protein that promotes oligodendrocyte development and myelination in vivo. These findings reveal a novel autocrine/paracrine loop model for the regulation of oligodendrocyte and myelin development.

                The membrane protein TMEM150c has been proposed to form a mechanosensitive ion channel that is required for normal proprioceptor function. Here we examined whether expression of TMEM150c in neuroblastoma cells lacking Piezo1 is associated with the appearance of mechanosensitive currents. Using three different modes of mechanical stimuli, indentation, membrane stretch and substrate deflection we could not evoke mechanosensitive currents in cells expressing TMEM150c. We next asked if TMEM150c is necessary for the normal mechanosensitivity of cutaneous sensory neurons. We used an available mouse model in which the Tmem150c locus was disrupted through the insertion of a LacZ cassette with a splice acceptor that should lead to transcript truncation. Analysis of these mice indicated that ablation of the Tmem150c gene was not complete in sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Using a Crispr/cas9 strategy we made a second mouse model in which a large part of the Tmem150c gene was deleted and established that these Tmem150c-/- mice completely lack TMEM150c protein in the DRGs. We used an ex vivo skin nerve preparation to characterize the mechanosenstivity of mechanoreceptors and nociceptors in the glabrous skin of the Tmem150c-/- mice. We found no quantitative alterations in the physiological properties of any type of cutaneous sensory fiber in Tmem150c-/- mice. Since it has been claimed that TMEM150c is required for normal proprioceptor function we made a quantitative analysis of locomotion in Tmem150c-/- mice. Here again we found no indication that there was altered gait in Tmem150c-/- mice compared to wild type controls. In summary, we conclude that existing mouse models that have been used to investigate TMEM150c function in vivo are problematic. Furthermore, we could find no evidence that TMEM150c forms a mechanosensitive channel or that it is necessary for the normal mechanosensitivity of cutaneous sensory neurons.

                In recent years, neuroscience has seen a shift from localist approaches to network-wide investigations of brain function. Neurophysiological signals across different spatial and temporal scales provide an informative insight into neural communication. However, additional methodological considerations arise when investigating network-wide brain dynamics rather than local effects. Specifically, larger amounts of data, investigated across a higher dimensional space, are necessary. Here, we present FiNN (Find Neurophysiological Networks), a novel toolbox for the analysis of neurophysiological data with a focus on functional and effective connectivity. FiNN provides a wide range of data processing methods, introduces new methodological developments to acquire efficient and reliable connectivity estimates that build on already existing concepts, and statistical and visualization tools to facilitate inspection of connectivity estimates and the resulting metrics of brain dynamics. The toolbox is freely available in Python (https://github.com/neurophysiological-analysis/FiNN), and complemented by online documentation (https://neurophysiological-analysis.github.io/FiNN/). To highlight the properties of our toolbox, we evaluated FiNN against a number of established frameworks on both a conceptual and an implementation level. We found FiNN to require much less processing time and memory than other toolboxes. In addition, FiNN adheres to a design philosophy of easy access and modifiability, while providing efficient data processing implementations. Since the investigation of network-level neural dynamics is experiencing increasing interest, we place FiNN at the disposal of the neuroscientific community as open-source software.

                Emerging evidence is implicating mitochondrial function and metabolism in the nucleus accumbens in motivated performance. However, the brain is vulnerable to excessive oxidative insults resulting from neurometabolic processes and whether antioxidant levels in the nucleus accumbens contribute to motivated performance is not known. Here, we identify a critical role for glutathione (GSH), the most important endogenous antioxidant in the brain, in motivation. Using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) at ultra-high field in both clinical and preclinical populations, we establish that higher accumbal GSH levels are highly predictive of better, and particularly steady performance over time in effort-related tasks. Causality was established in preclinical in vivo experiments that, first, showed that down-regulating GSH levels through micro-injections of the GSH synthesis inhibitor buthionine sulfoximine in the nucleus accumbens impaired effort-based reward-incentivized performance. In addition, systemic treatment with the GSH precursor N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) increased accumbal GSH levels and led to improved performance, potentially mediated by a cell-type specific shift in glutamatergic inputs to accumbal medium spiny neurons. Our data indicate a close association between accumbal GSH levels and individua's capacity to exert reward-incentivized effort over time. They also suggest that improvement of accumbal antioxidant function may be a feasible approach to boost motivation.

                Filial imprinting has been used as a powerful ethological paradigm to investigate the neurobiology of early learning that affects lifelong behaviours. When a visually naive chick is exposed to one of a wide range of conspicuous objects, it may learn its characteristics and subsequently recognises and selectively approaches this stimulus (usually the mother hen and siblings). While the initial phases of memory acquisition have been unravelled, the long-term storage and retrieval components of imprinting memories are still unknown. Here, we used functional MRI in awake newly hatched chicks to identify the long-term storage of imprinting memories in a wide network comprising the hippocampal formation, the medial striatum, the arcopallium, and the prefrontal-like nidopallium caudolaterale. These results provide the first example of non-invasive imaging of the brain in a newborn vertebrate.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Learning vs. minding: How subjective costs can mask motor learning</a></h4>

              
                When learning new movements older adults tend to make larger kinematic errors than younger adults, interpreted as an age-related decline in motor-learning ability. However, this conclusion assumes that both older and younger adults use the same error-canceling strategy. Alternatively, it could be that older adults' higher errors can be explained by a difference in strategy, rather than a reduction in learning ability. Consider that error-cancelling strategies can incur higher effort costs. Older adults may be choosing to sacrifice error reduction in favor of a lower effort movement. We test this hypothesis using trajectories where subjects reached to targets in a force field. Utilizing the framework of optimal control theory, we infer subjective costs (i.e., strategies) and internal model accuracy (i.e., proportion of the novel dynamics learned) by fitting a model to each population's trajectory data. Our results demonstrate that the trajectories are not uniquely specified by a precise amount of learning, but rather through a combination of the amount learned and strategic differences represented by relative cost weights. Based on the model fits, younger adults learn between 60-85% of the novel dynamics, and older adults learn between 55-80%. Each model fit produces trajectories which match the experimentally observed data, where a lower proportion learned in the model is compensated for by increasing costs on kinematic errors relative to effort. This finding supports our hypothesis that older and younger adults could be learning to the same extent, but older adults have a higher relative cost on effort compared to younger adults. These results call into question the proposition that older adults learn less than younger adults and suggest that the metrics commonly used to probe motor learning paint an incomplete picture. Importantly, to accurately quantify the learning process the subjective costs of movements should be considered.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ghrelin receptor signaling contributes to fasting-induced suppression of conditioned avoidance behavior and neural circuit activation in male rats</a></h4>

              
                Interoceptive feedback to the brain regarding the physiological state of the body plays an important role in guiding motivated behaviors. For example, a state of negative energy balance tends to increase exploratory/food-seeking behaviors while reducing avoidance behaviors. We recently reported that overnight food deprivation reduces conditioned passive avoidance behavior in male (but not female) rats. Since fasting increases circulating levels of ghrelin, we hypothesized that ghrelin signaling contributes to the observed behavioral effect of fasting. To test this, ad libitum-fed male rats were trained in a passive avoidance procedure using mild footshock. Later, following overnight food deprivation, the same rats were pretreated with ghrelin receptor antagonist (GRA) or saline vehicle 30 min before avoidance testing. GRA restored passive avoidance in fasted rats as measured both by latency to enter and time spent in the shock-paired context. In addition, compared to vehicle-injected fasted rats, fasted rats that received GRA before re-exposure to the shock-paired context displayed more activation of prolactin-releasing peptide (PrRP)-positive noradrenergic neurons in the caudal nucleus of the solitary tract, accompanied by more activation of downstream neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. These results support the view that ghrelin signaling contributes to the inhibitory effect of fasting on learned passive avoidance behavior, perhaps by suppressing recruitment of PrRP-positive noradrenergic neurons and their downstream hypothalamic and limbic forebrain targets.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">In-vivo estimation of axonal morphology from MRI and EEG data</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: We present a novel approach that allows the estimation of morphological features of axonal fibers from data acquired in-vivo in humans. This approach allows the assessment of white matter microscopic properties non-invasively with improved specificity. Theory: The proposed approach is based on a biophysical model of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data and of axonal conduction velocity estimates obtained with Electroencephalography (EEG). In a white matter tract of interest, these data depend on 1) the distribution of axonal radius - P(r) - and 2) the g-ratio of the individual axons that compose this tract - g(r). P(r) is assumed to follow a Gamma distribution with mode and scale parameters, M and {theta}, and g(r) is described by a power-law with parameters  and {beta}. Methods: MRI and EEG data were recorded from 14 healthy volunteers. MRI data were collected with a 3T scanner. MRI g-ratio maps were computed and sampled along the visual transcallosal tract. EEG data were recorded using a 128-lead system with a visual Poffenberg paradigm. The interhemispheric transfer time and axonal conduction velocity were computed from the EEG current density at the group level. Using the MRI and EEG measures and the proposed model, we estimated morphological properties of axons in the visual transcallosal tract. Results: The estimated interhemispheric transfer time was 11.72{+/-}2.87 ms, leading to an average conduction velocity across subjects of 13.22{+/-}1.18 m/s. Out of the 4 free parameters of the proposed model, we estimated {theta} - the width of the right tail of the axonal radius distribution and {beta} - the scaling factor of the axonal g-ratio, a measure of fiber myelination. Across subjects, the parameter {theta} was 0.40{+/-}0.07 m and the parameter {beta} was 0.67{+/-}0.02 m^(-). Conclusions: The estimates of axonal radius and myelination are consistent with histological findings, illustrating the feasibility of this approach. The proposed method allows the measurement of the distribution of axonal radius and myelination within a white matter tract, opening new avenues for the combined study of brain structure and function, and for in-vivo histological studies of the human brain.

                Parkinson's Disease (PD) is characterized by distinct motor phenomena that are expressed asynchronously. Understanding the neurophysiological correlates of these different motor states could facilitate monitoring of disease progression and allow improved assessments of therapeutic efficacy, as well as enable optimal closed-loop neuromodulation. We examined neural activity in the basal ganglia and cortex of subjects with PD during a quantitative motor task to decode tremor and bradykinesia - two cardinal motor signs of this disease - and relatively asymptomatic periods of behavior. Analysis of subcortical and cortical signals revealed that tremor and bradykinesia had distinct, nearly opposite neural signatures, while effective motor control displayed unique, differentiating features. The neurophysiological signatures of these motor states depended on the type of signal recorded as well as the location; cortical decoding accuracy generally outperformed subcortical decoding, while tremor and bradykinesia were better decoded from different portions of the subthalamic nucleus (STN). These results provide a roadmap to leverage real-time neurophysiology to understand and treat PD.

                Both prelimbic corticostriatal neurons and striatal fast-spiking interneurons contribute to decisions that require a trade-off between cost and benefit. We investigated whether ventral motor thalamic input to prelimbic cortex or striatum contributes to cost-benefit decision-making. Optogenetic inhibition of ventral motor thalamic axon terminals in prelimbic cortex biased rats towards a high cost-high benefit option and, in anesthetized rats, decreased neuronal activity in deep layers of prelimbic cortex. Stimulation of ventral motor thalamic nuclei induced a neuronal response in deep layers of prelimbic cortex and simultaneous optogenetic inhibition of layer 1 inhibitory interneurons similarly decreased neuronal activity. Chemogenetic inhibition of striatal-projecting ventral motor thalamic neurons did not affect cost-benefit decision-making. Our results indicate that ventral motor thalamic input to prelimbic cortex, but not striatum, mediates cost-benefit decision-making, probably by regulating prelimbic corticostriatal neuron activity directly as well as indirectly through a network of cortical inhibitory interneurons.

                Mechanosensory neurons in the mouth provide essential information to guide feeding and speech. How classes of oral mechanoreceptors contribute to oral behaviors is not well understood; in particular, the functional properties of lingual mechanoreceptors remain elusive. Previous work identified putative mechanosensory endings in the tongue with novel morphologies; how these fit into current knowledge of mechanosensory neuron classification is not known. To identify functional classes of lingual mechanosensory neurons, we used in vivo calcium imaging of trigeminal ganglia. We first investigated calcium responses of tongue-innervating trigeminal neurons to thermal and mechanical stimulation (e.g., pressure, fluid flow, temperature changes). We found that around 17% of neurons responded to pressure, and that these pressure responders were significantly larger than neurons that only responded to temperature changes. To further investigate the cadre of functionally distinct mechanosensory neurons, we tested responses to brushing and sustained pressures and found that brush-sensitive neurons comprise the majority of tongue-innervating mechanosensory trigeminal neurons. Qualitatively, mechanosensory neurons responded to pressure with distinct kinetics, suggesting the presence of multiple classes of mechanoreceptors. To determine the number of classes, we developed an unbiased multi-layer hierarchical clustering approach to classify calcium response characteristics to pressure stimulation. This approach revealed that mechanosensory neurons displayed five distinct stimulus-response profiles to pressure. Classes include neuronal populations with sustained, transient, high-threshold, and negative responses to force as well as neurons that responded only to brushing. Analysis of cluster representation in transgenic animals with only subsets of labeled neurons reveals molecular markers of clusters and end organ structures. These studies are amongst the first to determine the functional properties of low-threshold mechanosensory neurons innervating the mouse tongue.

                Background: Atypical auditory cortical processing is consistently found in scalp electrophysiological and magnetoencephalographic studies of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and may provide a marker of neuropathological brain development. However, the relationship between atypical cortical processing of auditory information and adaptive behavior in ASD is not yet well understood. Methods: We sought to test the hypothesis that early auditory processing in ASD is related to everyday adaptive behavior through the examination of auditory event-related potentials (AEPs) in response to simple tones and Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales in a large cohort of children with ASD (N=89), aged 6-17, and in age- and IQ- matched neurotypically (NT) developing controls (N=120). Results: Statistical analyses revealed significant group differences in early AEPs over temporal scalp regions. Whereas the expected rightward lateralization of the AEP to tonal stimuli occurred in both groups, lateralization of the AEP was only significantly associated with adaptive functioning, in the domains of communication and daily living, in the ASD group. Conclusions: These results lend support to the hypothesis that atypical processing of sensory information is related to everyday adaptive behavior in autism.

                The aim of this work is to provide a comment on a recent paper by Muzzu and Saleem (2021). In brief, our concern is that the authors claim that visuomotor mismatch responses in mouse visual cortex can be explained by a locomotion-induced gain of visual halt responses, without directly comparing these responses to mismatch responses. Without a direct comparison, the claim that one response can explain the other appears difficult to uphold, more so because previous work finds that a uniform locomotion-induced gain cannot explain mismatch responses. To support these arguments, we analyzed a series of layer 2/3 calcium imaging datasets and show that coupling between visual flow and locomotion greatly enhances mismatch responses in an experience dependent manner compared to halts in non-coupled visual flow. This is consistent with mismatch responses representing visuomotor prediction errors. Thus, we conclude that feature selectivity cannot explain mismatch responses in mouse visual cortex.

                A common problem in motor control concerns how to generate patterns of muscle activity when there are redundant solutions to attain a behavioural goal. Optimal feedback control is a theory that has guided many behavioural studies exploring how the motor system incorporates task redundancy. This theory predicts that kinematic errors that deviate the limb should not be corrected if one can still attain the behavioural goal. Several studies in humans demonstrate that the motor system can flexibly integrate visual and proprioceptive feedback of the limb with goal redundancy within 90ms and 70ms, respectively. Here we show monkeys (Macaca mulatta) demonstrate similar abilities to exploit goal redundancy. We trained four male monkeys to reach for a goal that was either a narrow square or a wide, spatially redundant rectangle. Monkeys exhibited greater trial-by-trial variability when reaching to the wide goal consistent with exploiting goal redundancy. On random trials we jumped the visual feedback of the hand and found monkeys corrected for the jump when reaching to the narrow goal and largely ignored the jump when reaching for the wide goal. In a separate set of experiments, we applied mechanical loads to the arm and found similar corrective responses based on goal shape. Muscle activity reflecting these different corrective responses were detected for the visual and mechanical perturbations starting at ~90 and ~70ms, respectively. Thus, rapid motor responses in macaques can exploit goal redundancy similar to humans, creating a paradigm to study the neural basis of goal-directed motor action and motor redundancy.

                The paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) projects axons to multiple areas and mediates a wide range of behaviors. Heterogeneity of functions and axonal projections in PVT have been reported, but what cell types exist in PVT and how different they are have not been addressed. We applied single-cell RNA sequencing to depict transcriptomic characteristics of mouse PVT neurons. The transcriptome of PVT neurons had a continuous distribution with the largest variance corresponding to the anterior-posterior axis. Although the single-cell transcriptome classified PVT neurons into four types, transcriptomic and histological analyses showed their continuity. Similarly, anterior and posterior subpopulations had nearly non-overlapping axon projection patterns, while another population showed intermediate patterns. In addition, they responded differently to appetite-related neuropeptides, and their chemogenetic activation showed opposing effects in food consumption. Our studies showed contrasts and continuity of PVT neurons underlying their function as a behavior-modulating hub.

	<p>Mitochondrial dysfunction and exacerbated neuroinflammation are critical factors in the pathogenesis of both familial and non-familial forms of Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD). This study aims to understand the possible ameliorative effects of zonisamide on microglial mitochondrial dysfunction in PD. We prepared 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) co-treated mouse models of PD to investigate the effects of zonisamide on mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation in microglial cells. Consequently, we utilised a mouse BV2 cell line that is commonly used for microglial studies to determine whether zonisamide could ameliorate LPS-treated mitochondrial dysfunction in microglia. Flow cytometry assay indicated that zonisamide abolished microglial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in PD models. Extracellular flux assays showed that LPS exposure to BV2 cells at 1 &amp;amp;mu;g/mL drastically reduced the mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). Zonisamide overcame the inhibitory effects of LPS on mitochondrial OCR. Our present data provide novel evidence on the ameliorative effect of zonisamide against microglial mitochondrial dysfunction and support its clinical use as an antiparkinsonian drug.</p>

	<p>The superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) is a white matter bundle that connects the frontal areas with the parietal areas. As part of the visuospatial attentional network, it may be involved in the development of schizophrenia. Deficit syndrome (DS) is characterized by primary and enduring negative symptoms. The present study assessed SLF integrity in DS and nondeficit schizophrenia (NDS) patients and examined possible relationships between it and psychopathology. Twenty-six DS patients, 42 NDS patients, and 36 healthy controls (HC) underwent psychiatric evaluation and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). After post-processing, fractional anisotropy (FA) values within the SLF were analyzed. Psychopathology was assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Brief Negative Symptom Scale, and Self-evaluation of Negative Symptoms. The PANSS proxy for the deficit syndrome was used to diagnose DS. NDS patients had lower FA values than HC. DS patients had greater negative symptoms than NDS patients. After differentiating clinical groups and HC, we found no significant correlations between DTI measures and psychopathological dimensions. These results suggest that changes in SLF integrity are related to schizophrenia, and frontoparietal dysconnection plays a role in its etiopathogenesis. We confirmed that DS patients have greater negative psychopathology than NDS patients. These results are preliminary; further studies are needed.</p>

	<p>This study aims to investigate PD-1/PD-L1 expression patterns in paired primary and recurrent gliomas. Methods: From January 2008 to December 2014, 42 patients who underwent surgical resections of primary and recurrent gliomas were retrospectively included. PD-1/PD-L1 protein expression in tumors was evaluated through immunohistochemistry. Results: In primary gliomas, PD-1 and PD-L1 expression was evident in 9 (22.0%) and 14 (33.3%) patients. In the paired recurrent glioma, PD-1 and PD-L1 expression was evident in 25 (61.0%) and 31 (74.0%) lesions. Both PD-1 and PD-L1 showed significantly enhanced expression after recurrence (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.005; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.005). For PD-L1 expression in recurrent gliomas, the adjuvant therapy group showed significantly increased expression compared to primary gliomas (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.005). For PD-1- primary gliomas, if the matched recurrent gliomas showed PD-1+, the PFS became worse than the remaining recurrent gliomas PD-1- (12.7 vs 25.9 months, p = 0.032). Interestingly, for PD-L1- primary gliomas, if the matched recurrent gliomas showed PD-L1+, the OS became better than the remaining recurrent gliomas PD-L1- (33.8 vs 17.5 months, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001).Conclusions: In the study, we found the expression of PD-1/PD-L1 increased significantly in recurrent gliomas and the elevated level of PD-L1 was tightly associated with adjuvant treatment, suggesting the potential therapeutic and predictive value of PD-1 and PD-L1 in the treatment of recurrent gliomas.</p>

	<p>Background: We aimed to evaluate personality traits in patients with post-COVID syndrome, as well as the association with neuropsychiatric symptoms present in this disorder. Methods: The Big Five Structure Inventory was administered to 93 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of post-COVID syndrome as defined by the WHO and to demographically matched controls. We also performed a comprehensive evaluation of depression, anxiety, fatigue, sleep quality, cognitive function, and olfactory function. Results: Patients with post-COVID syndrome scored lower for emotional stability, equanimity, positive mood, and self-control. Extraversion, emotional stability, and openness correlated negatively with anxiety and depression levels. Conscientiousness correlated negatively with anxiety. No statistically significant correlations were observed between personality traits and cognitive function, sleep quality, olfactory function, or fatigue. Personality scores explained 36.3% and 41% of the variance in scores on the anxiety and depression scales, respectively. Two personality profiles with lower levels of emotional stability were associated with depression and anxiety. Conclusions: Our study shows higher levels of neuroticism in patients with post-COVID syndrome. Personality traits were predictive of the presence of depression and anxiety, but not cognitive function, sleep quality, or fatigue, in the context of post-COVID syndrome. These findings may have implications for the detection of patients at risk of depression and anxiety in post-COVID syndrome, and for the development of preventive and therapeutic interventions.</p>

	<p>Overall, the present pilot study provides detailed information on clinical management for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) referral and diagnosis processes that are mandatory for child and adolescent mental health management. The analysis of ASD management, even if carried out on a selected sample of Child and Adolescent Mental Health (CAMH) units, represents a good approximation of how, in Italian outpatient settings, children and adolescents with ASD are recognised and eventually diagnosed. One of the aims of the study was to verify the adherence of Italian CAMH units to international recommendations for ASD referral and diagnosis and whether these processes can be traced using individual chart reports. Overall, the analysis evidenced that Italian CAMH units adopt an acceptable standard for ASD diagnosis, although the reporting of the ASD managing process in the individual chart is not always accurate. Furthermore, data collected suggest some improvements that CAMH units should implement to fill the gap with international recommendations, namely, establishing a multidisciplinary team for diagnosis, improving the assessment of physical and mental conditions by the use of standardised tools, implementing a specific assessment for challenging behaviours that could allow timely and specific planning of intervention.</p>

	<p>Background: Despite the high burden of childhood disability in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), the opportunity for early intervention and rehabilitation is very limited. Studies have found that community-based rehabilitation service is effective for children with cerebral palsy (CP); however, such services are not readily available in LMICs, and services run by non-profit organisations on external funding are often not sustainable. In this study, we report the lesson learnt in establishing a social business model of early intervention and rehabilitation services for children with CP and adults with disabilities in a rural subdistrict of Bangladesh. Methods: Case study of a rural early intervention and rehabilitation centre (i.e., the model centre) implemented between May 2018 and September 2019. An economic evaluation incorporating gross margin analysis along with descriptive statistics was performed to assess the social business potentials of the model centre. Results: The establishment of this model centre cost ~5955 USD with an average monthly running cost of ~994 USD. During the 17 months study period, 7038 therapy sessions (average eight sessions per patient) were offered to 862 patients with musculoskeletal and neurological disorders. The most common clinical presentations were low back pain (35.6%; n = 307). Six percent (n = 52) of the attendees were children with CP (mean (SD) age 6.3 (4.0) years; 35.7% (n = 19) were female), who received 1392 sessions, on average 27 sessions per child. The centre reached the break-even point at the 13th month and remained profitable for the next 4 months of the study period. An average session fee of 2.2 USD resulted in a gross margin of -1458 USD and 1940 USD in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Revenue to cost ratios for the 2 years were 0.27:1 and 0.51:1 while average rates of return were &amp;amp;minus;41.4% and 10.1%, respectively. Sensitivity analysis revealed that session numbers including 5000, 6000, 7000, 8000, 9000, and 10,000 were required to break even at the session fees of 3.0, 2.50, 2.0, 2.0, 1.5, and 1.5 USD, respectively. Conclusion: Our social business model of an early intervention and rehabilitation service provides evidence of enhancing access to services for children with CP as well as adults with disabilities while ensuring the sustainability of the services in rural Bangladesh.</p>

	<p>Computational models of the basal ganglia (BG) provide a mechanistic account of different phenomena observed during reinforcement learning tasks performed by healthy individuals, as well as by patients with various nervous or mental disorders. The aim of the present work was to develop a BG model that could represent a good compromise between simplicity and completeness. Based on more complex (fine-grained neural network, FGNN) models, we developed a new (coarse-grained neural network, CGNN) model by replacing layers of neurons with single nodes that represent the collective behavior of a given layer while preserving the fundamental anatomical structures of BG. We then compared the functionality of both the FGNN and CGNN models with respect to several reinforcement learning tasks that are based on BG circuitry, such as the Probabilistic Selection Task, Probabilistic Reversal Learning Task and Instructed Probabilistic Selection Task. We showed that CGNN still has a functionality that mirrors the behavior of the most often used reinforcement learning tasks in human studies. The simplification of the CGNN model reduces its flexibility but improves the readability of the signal flow in comparison to more detailed FGNN models and, thus, can help to a greater extent in the translation between clinical neuroscience and computational modeling.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">GIPC1 CGG repeat expansion is associated with movement disorders</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>CGG/GGC repeat expansion in <i>FMR1</i> and <i>NOTCH2NLC</i> is reportedly associated with movement disorders; therefore, we hypothesized that the CGG repeat expansion in <i>LRP12</i>, <i>NUTM2B-AS1</i>, and <i>GIPC1</i>, which was previously identified in myopathy, might also be associated with movement-disorder phenotypes. Here, we investigated whether CGG repeat expansion in <i>LRP12</i>, <i>NUTM2B-AS1</i>, and <i>GIPC1</i> presents in a cohort of patients with movement disorders.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We screened for the CGG repeat expansion in <i>LRP12, NUTM2B-AS1</i>, and <i>GIPC1</i> in 1346 movement-disorder patients and 1,451 matched healthy controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>No patients or controls harbored expanded CGG repeats in <i>LRP12</i> or <i>NUTM2B-AS1</i>, whereas 16 patients harbored &gt;40 CGG repeats in <i>GIPC1</i>, with 11 of these patients harboring &gt;60 CGG repeats. One control individual harbored an expanded <i>GIPC1</i> allele (83 CGG units), suggesting that ~1% of patients affected by movement disorders in our population might harbor <i>GIPC1</i> CGG repeat expansion, with this likely extremely rare in healthy controls (&lt; 0.001). The clinical phenotypes of the <i>GIPC1</i> CGG repeat-positive patients strongly resembled those in patients displaying <i>NOTCH2NLC</i> GGC repeat<i>-</i>positive movement disorders. Additionally, the <i>GIPC1</i> CGG repeat-positive patients presented white-matter hyperintensities but without typical <i>NOTCH2NLC</i>-related high-intensity signals in the corticomedullary junction. Furthermore, 44% of the <i>GIPC1</i> CGG repeat-positive patients showed a cognitive deficit, and skin biopsies in two patients revealed deposition of intranuclear inclusions.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The CGG repeat expansion in <i>GIPC1</i> might be associated with movement-disorder phenotypes and lead to diseases related to intranuclear inclusions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Diffusion tensor imaging correlates of depressive symptoms in Parkinson disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Introduction: Depression is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome prevalent in patients with Parkinson disease (PD) that remains incompletely understood. Further, the differences in biomarkers of depression in PD and in non-PD patients are unclear. The subcallosal cingulate cortex (SCC) and its connections has been implicated in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides a tool to quantify MDD-related structural abnormalities underlying depressive symptoms in PD. Methods: Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data were collected from thirty-one patients with PD. Depression symptom severity was measured using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), and assessed using three subscales: dysphoric mood, loss of interest/pleasure, and somatic symptoms. Probabilistic tractography methods were used to quantify the SCC connectivity to target regions in cortico-limbic-striatal network (ventral striatum (VS), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and uncinate fasciculus (UCF)) while fractional anisotropy (FA) was calculated in predefined white matter regions of interest. DTI data was correlated with severity of depression across three domains. Results: SCC-mPFC connectivity in the left hemisphere was positively correlated with severity of dysphoric mood (Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted <i>p</i> = 0.02). ROI-based analyses demonstrated a significant and distinct topographic association between FA and dysphoric mood, loss of interest/pleasure, and somatic symptom severity, although these findings did not maintain significance after applying the false discovery rate correction. Conclusion: Abnormal SCC connectivity underlies depressive symptoms in both PD and MDD, suggesting that interventions used for MDD should be explored in treating depressive symptoms in PD, particularly depression dominated by dysphoric mood.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Digital reconstruction and quantitative morphometric analysis of bipolar cells in live rat retinal slices</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Bipolar cells convey signals from photoreceptors in the outer retina to amacrine and ganglion cells in the inner retina. In mammals, there are typically 10–15 types of cone bipolar cells and one type of rod bipolar cell. Different types of cone bipolar cells are thought to code and transmit different features of a complex visual stimulus, thereby generating parallel channels that uniquely filter and transform the photoreceptor outputs. Differential synaptic connectivity and expression of ligand- and voltage-gated ion channels are thought to be important mechanisms for processing and filtering visual signals. Whereas the biophysical basis for such mechanisms has been investigated more extensively in rat retina, there is a lack of quantitative morphological data necessary for advancing the structure-function correlation in this species, as recent connectomics investigations have focused on mouse retina. Here, we performed whole-cell recordings from cone and rod bipolar cells in rat retinal slices, filled the cells with fluorescent dyes and acquired image stacks by multi-photon excitation microscopy. Following deconvolution, we performed digital reconstruction and morphometric analysis of 25 cone and 14 rod bipolar cells. Compared to previous descriptions, the extent and complexity of branching of the axon terminal was surprisingly high. By precisely quantifying the level of stratification of the axon terminals in the inner plexiform layer, we have generated a reference system for reliable classification of individual cells in future studies focused on correlating physiological and morphological properties. The implemented workflow can be extended to the development of morphologically realistic compartmental models for these neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neurodevelopmental Patterns of Early Postnatal White Matter Maturation Represent Distinct Underlying Microstructure and Histology</a></h4>

              
                During the early postnatal period, cerebral white matter undergoes rapid maturation through a complex series of interrelated cellular and histogenetic processes. Accurately quantifying these processes is important for improving understanding of early brain development, developmental abnormalities related to prematurity, and neurodevelopmental diseases. Past efforts have used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to track these developmental processes in vivo. However, most previous studies have relied on single imaging modality data and have often been limited by small samples and analytics that do not evaluate complex multivariate imaging patterns. Here, we applied an advanced unsupervised multivariate pattern analysis technique, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), to T2w/T1w signal ratio maps from a large cohort of newborns (Developing Human Connectome Project [dHCP], n=342), revealing patterns of synchronous white matter maturation. These patterns showed divergent age-related maturational trajectories and differential susceptibility to premature birth, which were replicated in an independent large sample of newborns (Early Life Adversity, Biological Embedding, and Risk for Developmental Precursors of Mental Disorders [eLABE], n=239). Furthermore, we showed that T2w/T1w signal variations in white matter maturational patterns are explained by differential contributions of white matter microstructure indices (i.e., free water content and neurite density index) derived from neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) modeling of diffusion-weighted MRI. Finally, we demonstrated how white matter maturation patterns relate to distinct histological features by comparing our findings with postmortem late fetal/early postnatal brain tissue staining. Together, these results delineate a novel MRI representation of white matter microstructural and histological reorganization during the early postnatal development.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mentalizing in economic games is associated with enhanced activation and connectivity in left temporoparietal junction</a></h4>

              
                Studies in Social Neuroeconomics have consistently reported activation in regions associated with social cognition regions, such as the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and temporoparietal junction (TPJ) during decisions in interactive economic games, like the trust game. Activations in these regions have commonly been interpreted as reflecting mentalizing during economic choice that involves (strategic) uncertainty about what interaction partners, who can influence payouts, are going to do. Thus far, this theoretically plausible hypothesis is mainly supported by similar activation patterns in social cognition regions across different tasks that involve mentalizing, as identified by multiple meta-analyses. It remains important to test the involvement of neural activity associated with mentalizing in economic games within same sample of participants performing the same task. We designed a novel version of the classic false-belief task that is commonly used to induce mentalizing. This new task explicitly requires participants to infer beliefs of interaction partners while playing two economic games, the ultimatum game and the trust game. We compare activation patterns during the novel economic-games false-belief task to those during the classic story-based false-belief task using conjunction analyses. We find significant overlap in left TPJ, and dmPFC, as well as temporal pole during two task phases: when participants are reading about a sequence of events (belief formation) and when they answer an incentivized question about the interaction partners' beliefs (belief inference). These results indicate that across the different task types and phases, mentalizing is associated with activation in social cognition regions. Moreover, effective connectivity analyses show that social cognition regions are interconnected during belief-formation and belief-inferences. Specifically, during belief formation, generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI) analyses indicate that right TPJ is a target of both left TPJ and right temporal pole (TP) seed regions, while during belief inferences all seed regions show interconnectivity with each other in ROI-to-ROI analyses. Our results support the notion that belief formation and inferences are supported by social cognitive processes in a wider network of social cognition regions that include bilateral TPJ, TP and dmPFC as central nodes. Importantly, this is the case in the context of economic games and standard false-belief tasks.

                Herpes simplex virus type I (HSV-1) infection is a potential risk factor involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease (AD) and contributes to the AD viral hypothesis. However, further understanding of the neuropathological effects of the HSV-1 infection is hampered by the limitations of existing infection models due to the distinct differences between human brains and other mammalians brains. Here we generated cerebral organoid models derived from pluripotent stem cells to investigate the HSV-induced pathogenesis associated with AD and the role of antiviral drugs in the phenotypic rescue. Our results identified that the HSV-1-infected cerebral organoids recapitulated multiscale neuropathology pertaining to the onset and progression of AD across the genetic, cellular, and tissue levels, including the multicellular A{beta} deposition, dysregulated endogenous AD mediators, reactive gliosis, neuroinflammation, and neural loss. Furthermore, we identified that two antiviral drugs, namely Ribavirin (RBV) and Valacyclovir (VCV), inhibited HSV-1 replication and rescued the neuropathological phenotypes associated with AD in the HSV-1-infected cerebral organoids, implying their therapeutic potential to slow down the progression of AD. Our study provides a high-fidelity human-relevant in-vitro HSV-1 infection model to reconstitute the multiscale neuropathological features associated with AD and discover therapeutic drug candidates relevant to the AD viral hypothesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Enhanced Sodium Channel Inactivation by Temperature and FHF2 Deficiency Blocks Heat Nociception</a></h4>

              
                Transient voltage-gated sodium currents are essential for the initiation and conduction of action potentials in neurons and cardiomyocytes. The amplitude and duration of sodium currents are tuned by intracellular fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FHFs/iFGFs) that associate with the cytoplasmic tails of voltage-gated sodium channels (Navs), and genetic ablation of Fhf genes disturbs neurological and cardiac functions. Amongst reported phenotypes, Fhf2null mice undergo lethal hyperthermia-induced cardiac conduction block attributable to the combined effects of FHF2 deficiency and elevated temperature on the cardiac sodium channel (Nav1.5) inactivation rate. Fhf2null mice also display a lack of heat nociception, while retaining other somatosensory capabilities. Here we employ electrophysiological and computational methods to show that the heat nociception deficit can be explained by the combined effects of elevated temperature and FHF2 deficiency on the inactivation gating of sodium channels Nav1.7 and Nav1.8 expressed in dorsal root ganglion C-fibers. Hence, neurological and cardiac heat-associated deficits in Fhf2null mice derive from shared impacts of FHF deficiency and temperature towards Nav inactivation gating kinetics in distinct tissues.

                Microglia play many critical roles in neural development. Recent single-cell RNA-sequencing studies have found diversity of microglia both across different stages and within the same stage in the developing brain. However, how such diversity is controlled during development is poorly understood. In this study, we first found the expression of the macrophage mannose receptor CD206 in early-stage embryonic microglia on mouse brain sections. This expression showed a sharp decline between E12.5 and E13.5 across the central nervous system. We next tested the roles of the microglia-expressed zinc finger transcription factor SALL1 in this early transition of gene expression. By deleting Sall1 specifically in microglia, we found that many microglia continued to express CD206 when it is normally downregulated. In addition, the mutant microglia continued to show less ramified morphology in comparison with controls even into postnatal stages. Thus, SALL1 is required for early microglia to transition into a more mature status during development.

                Mitochondrial and autophagy dysfunction are mechanisms proposed to be involved in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases. Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder associated with mutant Huntingtin-induced abnormalities in neuronal mitochondrial dynamics and quality control. Former studies suggest that the removal of defective mitochondria may be compromised in HD. The mitochondrial quality control is a complex, well-orchestrated pathway that can be compromised through mitophagy dysregulation or impairment in the mitochondrial-lysosomal axis. Another mitochondrial stress response is the generation of mitochondrial-derived vesicles that fuse with the endolysosomal system and form multivesicular bodies that are extruded from cells as extracellular vesicles (EVs). In this study, we comprehensively characterized the mitochondrial and autophagy alterations in premanifest and manifest HD patients and performed a proteomic and genomic EVs profile. We observed that manifest HD patients exhibit mitochondrial and autophagy impairment associated with enhanced EVs release. Further, we detected mitochondrial components in EVs released by HD cells and in neuron-derived EVs. The EV-associated mtDNA copies were elevated in manifest HD patients suggesting to be an alternative pathway for secretion of reactive mitochondrial components. This study provides a novel framework connecting EVs enhanced release of mitochondrial components to mitochondrial and lysosomal dysfunction in HD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Shisa7-dependent regulation of GABAA receptor single-channel gating kinetics</a></h4>

              
                GABAA receptors (GABAARs) mediate the majority of fast inhibitory transmission throughout the brain. Although it is widely known that pore-forming subunits critically determine receptor function, it is unclear whether their single-channel properties are modulated by GABAAR-associated transmembrane proteins. We previously identified Shisa7 as a GABAAR auxiliary subunit that modulates the trafficking, pharmacology, and kinetic properties of these receptors. In particular, Shisa7 accelerates receptor deactivation; however, the underlying mechanisms by which Shisa7 controls GABAAR kinetics have yet to be determined. Here we have performed single-channel recordings and find that while Shisa7 does not change channel slope conductance, it reduces the frequency of openings. Importantly, Shisa7 modulates GABAAR gating by decreasing the duration and open probability (Po) within bursts. Kinetic analysis of dwell times, activation modeling, and macroscopic simulations indicate that Shisa7 accelerates GABAAR deactivation by governing the time spent between close and open states during gating. Together, our data provide a mechanistic basis for how Shisa7 controls GABAAR gating kinetics and reveal for the first time that GABAAR single-channel properties can be modulated by an auxiliary subunit. These findings shed light on processes that shape the temporal dynamics of GABAergic transmission.

	<p>When listening to music, people are excited by the musical cues immediately before rewarding passages. More generally, listeners attend to the antecedent cues of a salient musical event irrespective of its emotional valence. The present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the behavioral and cognitive mechanisms underlying the cued anticipation of the main theme&amp;amp;rsquo;s recurrence in sonata form. Half of the main themes in the musical stimuli were of a joyful character, half a tragic character. Activity in the premotor cortex suggests that around the main theme&amp;amp;rsquo;s recurrence, the participants tended to covertly hum along with music. The anterior thalamus, pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA), posterior cerebellum, inferior frontal junction (IFJ), and auditory cortex showed increased activity for the antecedent cues of the themes, relative to the middle-last part of the themes. Increased activity in the anterior thalamus may reflect its role in guiding attention towards stimuli that reliably predict important outcomes. The preSMA and posterior cerebellum may support sequence processing, fine-grained auditory imagery, and fine adjustments to humming according to auditory inputs. The IFJ might orchestrate the attention allocation to motor simulation and goal-driven attention. These findings highlight the attention control and audiomotor components of musical anticipation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Probabilistic mapping reveals optimal stimulation site in essential tremor</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To obtain individual clinical and neuroimaging data of patients undergoing Deep Brain Stimulation for essential tremor from five different European centers to identify predictors of outcome and to identify an optimal stimulation site.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analysed retrospectively baseline covariates, pre- and postoperative clinical tremor scores (12-month) as well as individual imaging data from 119 patients to obtain individual electrode positions and stimulation volumes. Individual imaging and clinical data was used to calculate a probabilistic stimulation map in normalized space using voxel-wise statistical analysis. Finally, we used this map to train a classifier to predict tremor improvement.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Probabilistic mapping of stimulation effects yielded a statistically significant cluster that was associated with a tremor improvement greater than 50%. This cluster of optimal stimulation extended from the posterior subthalamic area to the ventralis intermedius nucleus and coincided with a normative structural-connectivity-based cerebello-thalamic tract (CTT). The combined features “distance between the stimulation volume and the significant cluster” and “CTT activation” were used as a predictor of tremor improvement. This correctly classified a greater than 50% tremor improvement with a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 57%.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our multicentre ET probabilistic stimulation map identified an area of optimal stimulation along the course of the CTT. The results of this study are mainly descriptive until confirmed in independent datasets, ideally through prospective testing. This target will be made openly available and may be used to guide surgical planning and for computer-assisted programming of deep brain stimulation in the future.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">The association of retromer deficiency and tau pathology in Down syndrome</a></h4>

              
                <p>Retromer deficiency is reported in Down syndrome and correlates with amyloidosis, however, its association with tau neuropathology remains unclear. Down syndrome and control brain tissues were evaluated for phosphorylated tau, tau modulators, and cathepsin-D activity. Several kinases and phosphatase PP2A were unchanged, but tau phosphorylation was elevated, and cathepsin-D activity decreased in aged Down syndrome subjects. Retromer proteins positively associated with soluble tau, whereas pathogenic tau negatively correlated with retromer proteins and cathepsin-D activity. Retromer deficiency and consequent reduction of cathepsin-D activity may contribute to pathogenic tau accumulation, thus, retromer represents a viable therapeutic target against tau pathology in Down syndrome.</p>

                <p>The antigen specificity of Anti-Neuronal Nuclear Antibody-type 3 (ANNA3)-IgG is unknown. We identified Dachshund-homolog 1 (DACH1) as the ANNA3 autoantigen and confirmed it by antigen-specific assays, immunohistochemical colocalization and immune absorption experiments. Patients' median age was 63.5 years (range, 49–88); 67% were female. Neurological manifestations (information available for 30 patients) included one or more of neuropathy, 12; cognitive difficulties, 11; ataxia, 8; dysautonomia, 7. Evidence of a neoplasm was present in 27/30 (90%), most of neuroendocrine lineage. DACH1-IgG is rare and represents a novel proposed biomarker of neurological autoimmunity and cancer.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Comparing natural history of early and late onset pediatric multiple sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>To describe and compare disease course and prognosis of early (i.e., disease onset before age 11 years) and late (i.e., disease onset after age 11 years) onset pediatric multiple sclerosis.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Prospectively-collected clinical information from Italian Multiple Sclerosis Register of 1993 pediatric multiple sclerosis patients, of whom 172 with early onset, was analyzed. Cox models adjusted for sex, baseline Expanded Disability Status Scale score and disease-modifying treatments and stratified for diagnostic criteria adopted (Poser <i>vs</i> McDonald) were used to assess the risk of reaching irreversible Expanded Disability Status Scale scores of 3, 4, and 6, and conversion to secondary progressive phenotype in early <i>vs</i> late onset pediatric patients. Prognostic factors were also evaluated.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A greater proportion of males, isolated brainstem involvement, and longer time interval between first and second clinical episode was observed in early <i>vs</i> late onset pediatric patients. Compared to late onset, early onset pediatric patients took longer time from disease onset to convert to secondary progressive phenotype and to reach all disability milestones. Recovery from first demyelinating event, time to first relapse, annualized relapse rate during the first 3 years of disease and disease-modifying treatments exposure were independent predictors for long-term disability in early onset pediatric patients. In late onset pediatric patients, isolated optic neuritis, multifocal symptoms or progressive course at disease onset were additional predictors for long-term disability.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings point towards the existence of a different natural history in early <i>vs</i> late onset pediatric multiple sclerosis patients.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Axonal excitability does not differ between painful and painless diabetic or chemotherapy‐induced distal symmetrical polyneuropathy in a multi‐centre observational study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Axonal excitability reflects ion channel function and it is proposed that this may be a biomarker in painful (versus painless) polyneuropathy. Our objective was to investigate the relationship between axonal excitability parameters and chronic neuropathic pain in deeply phenotyped cohorts with diabetic or chemotherapy induced distal symmetrical polyneuropathy.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>239 participants with diabetic polyneuropathy were recruited from sites in the UK and Denmark, and 39 participants that developed chemotherapy-induced polyneuropathy were recruited from Denmark. Participants were separated into those with probable or definite neuropathic pain and those without neuropathic pain. Axonal excitability of large myelinated fibres was measured with the threshold tracking technique. The stimulus site was the median nerve and the recording sites were the index finger (sensory studies) and abductor pollicis brevis muscle (motor studies).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Participants with painless and painful polyneuropathy were well matched across clinical variables. Sensory and motor axonal excitability measures, including recovery cycle, threshold electrotonus, strength duration time constant, and current-threshold relationship, did not show differences between participants with painful and painless diabetic polyneuropathy, while there were only minor changes for chemotherapy-induced polyneuropathy.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Axonal excitability did not significantly differ between painful and painless diabetic or chemotherapy induced polyneuropathy in a multi-centre observational study. Threshold tracking assesses the excitability of myelinated axons; the majority of nociceptors are unmyelinated and although there is some overlap of the ‘channelome’ between these axonal populations, our results suggest that alternative measures such as microneurography are required to understand the relationship between sensory neuron excitability and neuropathic pain.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To assess the feasibility, acceptability, and benefits of a teleneurology clinic serving adults usually attending a neurology outpatient clinic in Lusaka, Zambia during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Televisits were offered to patients scheduled for neurology appointments between March and July 2020 using phone, WhatsApp video, or Zoom calls based on patient accessibility. Visit outcomes were documented, and patient and neurologist satisfaction surveys completed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 323 patients, 195 (60%) were reachable by telephone, 179 of these were alive, and 74% (133/179) of those alive agreed to a televisit. Stroke (30%), seizures (20%), and headache (16%) were the commonest diagnoses seen via televisit. Most televisits (80%) were by telephone call, 14% by WhatsApp video call, and 6% by Zoom. Nearly one-third (30%) of patients were stable and discharged from clinic, 32% only required medication refills, and 19% required an in-person visit. Sixty patients (out of 85 reachable, 71% response rate) and seven of nine neurologists (78% response rate) completed satisfaction surveys. Neurologists reported greater assessment confidence with Zoom, but confidence was high for all modalities. Patients preferring televisits (75%, 45/60) noted reduced expense and time requirements, while those preferring in-person visits (22%, 13/60) cited desire for physical examinations. Overall, 98% of patients and 100% of neurologists were satisfied with televisits.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Teleneurology visits were acceptable and feasible for adults attending an outpatient neurology clinic in Zambia and their neurologists. They offer a promising supplement to in-person visits in resource-limited settings, even when video-conference capabilities and electronic medical records are absent.</p>

                Obesity is recognized as a significant risk factor for Alzheimers disease (AD). Studies have supported the notion that obesity accelerates AD-related pathophysiology in mouse models of AD. The majority of studies to date have focused on the use of early-onset AD models. Here we evaluate the impact of genetic risk factors on late-onset AD (LOAD) in mice fed a high fat/high sugar diet. We focused on three mouse models created through the IU/JAX/Pitt MODEL-AD Center, LOAD1, LOAD1.Plcg2M28L and LOAD1.Mthfr677C>T. At 2 months of age, animals were placed on a high fat/high sugar diet (HFD) that induces obesity, or a control diet (CD) that does not, until 12 months of age. Throughout the study, blood was collected to assess cholesterol and glucose. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) was completed prior to sacrifice to image for glucose utilization and brain perfusion. At the completion of the study, blood and brains were collected for analysis. As expected, animals fed the HFD, regardless of genotype or sex, showed a significant increase in body weight compared to those fed the CD. Glucose and cholesterol increased as a function of HFD as well. Interestingly, LOAD1.Plcg2M28L demonstrated an increase in microglia density as well as alterations in regional brain glucose and perfusion when on a HFD. These changes were not observed in LOAD1 or LOAD1.Mthfr677C>T animals when fed a HFD. Furthermore, LOAD1.Plcg2M28L but not LOAD1.Mthfr677C>T or LOAD1 animals showed transcriptomics correlations to human AD modules. Our results show HFD affects brain health in a genotype-specific manner. Further insight into this process may have significant implications in the development of lifestyle interventions for treatment of AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Prediction error processing speeds up in presence of multisensory contexts</a></h4>

              
                Prediction errors in the brain are indexed by two event related potentials - MMN and P300 which are elicited whenever there is a violation of regularity in occurrence of a repetitive stimulus. While, MMN reflects the brain's ability to perform automatic comparisons between consecutive stimuli and provides an electrophysiological index of sensory error detection, P300 is associated with cognitive processes such as attention and memory. Till date, there has been extensive research on the roles of MMN and P300 individually, because of their potential to be used as clinical markers of consciousness and attention, respectively. However, the relationship between these two ERPs, in context of prediction error propagation is an open question. Secondly, whether these events represent modality specific or modality independent information processing needs to be tested in unisensory and multisensory environments. Our EEG study on 22 healthy human volunteers shows that multisensory prediction errors are temporally facilitated by the constituent unisensory modality that has shorter processing latencies at any stage of prediction error processing. Employing source localization using individual participant's MRI scan, our study reveals that the corresponding ERP generators underlying the temporal hierarchy of prediction mismatch signals in the brain transition from being modality sensitive to modality independent across both unisensory and multisensory contexts. Such knowledge can be of immense value in clinical research for determining the stages of various treatments in aging, schizophrenia and depression, and their efficacy on cognitive function.

Here, we explored whether increased sympathetic nervous activity (SNA) was associated with reduced alpha power and with increased freezing-like behaviour (i.e., body sway) while watching threatening stimuli, reflecting enhanced attention. Salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) was used as a proxy for sympathetic nervous activity, which is elevated in stressful situations. A passive viewing task with affective pictures (unpleasant, neutral, pleasant) was carried out, and pre- and post- task sAA samples were taken. Oscillatory brain activity in the EEG and body sway were assessed simultaneously during the task. The results point to an increase in sAA being associated with reduced alpha power decrease to the unpleasant compared to the neutral pictures as well as increased freezing-like behaviour (i.e., reduction in body sway for unpleasant versus neutral pictures). It appears that an increase in SNA is linked to less attentional valence differentiation. Furthermore, our study corroborates findings from the animal literature in that the SNA increase is linked to a freezing-like response.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Drosophila chemokine-like Orion bridges phosphatidylserine and Draper in phagocytosis of neurons</a></h4>

              
                Phagocytic clearance of degenerating neurons is mediated by "eat-me" signals exposed on the neuronal surface. The conserved neuronal eat-me signal phosphatidylserine (PS) is detected by resident phagocytes through specialized recognition systems. The engulfment receptor Draper (Drpr) is known to mediate PS recognition in Drosophila. However, how Drpr recognizes PS in vivo is unclear. Using larval dendritic arborization (da) neurons and phagocytic epidermal cells as a model, we show that the recently discovered Drosophila chemokine-like Orion is the responsible PS sensor; it functions as a cell-non-autonomous bridging molecule between PS and Drpr to license phagocytosis. Moreover, the Orion dosage is a key determinant of the sensitivity of phagocytes to PS exposed on neurons. Lastly, mutagenesis analysis reveals evolutionarily conserved sequence motifs that are important for Orion secretion and binding to PS. Thus, our results uncover a missing link in PS-mediated phagocytosis in Drosophila and imply conserved mechanisms of phagocytosis of neurons.

	<p>Accurately extracting brain tissue is a critical and primary step in brain neuroimaging research. Due to the differences in brain size and structure between humans and nonhuman primates, the performance of the existing tools for brain tissue extraction, working on macaque brain MRI, is constrained. A new transfer learning training strategy was utilized to address the limitations, such as insufficient training data and unsatisfactory model generalization ability, when deep neural networks processing the limited samples of macaque magnetic resonance imaging(MRI). First, the project combines two human brain MRI data modes to pre-train the neural network, in order to achieve faster training and more accurate brain extraction. Then, a residual network structure in the U-Net model was added, in order to propose a ResTLU-Net model that aims to improve the generalization ability of multiple research sites data. The results demonstrated that the ResTLU-Net, combined with the proposed transfer learning strategy, achieved comparable accuracy for the macaque brain MRI extraction tasks on different macaque brain MRI volumes that were produced by various medical centers. The mean Dice of the ResTLU-Net was 95.81% (no need for denoise and recorrect), and the method required only approximately 30&amp;amp;ndash;60 s for one extraction task on an NVIDIA 1660S GPU.</p>

	<p>Atypical antipsychotics (AAP) are used in the treatment of severe mental illness. They are associated with several metabolic side effects including insulin resistance. The skeletal muscle is the primary tissue responsible for insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Dysfunction of protein regulation within the skeletal muscle following treatment with AAPs may play a role in the associated metabolic side effects. The objective of this study was to measure protein abundance in the skeletal muscle of patients on long-term AAP or mood stabilizer treatment. Cross-sectional muscle biopsies were obtained from patients with bipolar disorder and global protein abundance was measured using stable isotope labeling by amino acid (SILAC) combined with high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS). Sixteen patients completed muscle biopsies and were included in the proteomic analyses. A total of 40 proteins were significantly different between the AAP group and the mood stabilizer group. In-silico pathway analysis identified significant enrichment in several pathways including glucose metabolism, cell cycle, apoptosis, and folate metabolism. Proteome abundance changes also differed based on protein biological processes and function. In summary, significant differences in proteomic profiles were identified in the skeletal muscle between patients on AAPs and mood stabilizers. Future work is needed to validate these findings in prospectively sampled populations.</p>

	<p>Background: Gait deficit is a hallmark of multiple sclerosis and the walking capacity can be improved with neurorehabilitation. Technological advances in biomechanics offer opportunities to assess the effects of rehabilitation objectively. Objective: Combining wireless surface electromyography and wearable inertial sensors to assess and monitor the gait pattern before and after an intensive multidisciplinary neurorehabilitation program (44 h/4weeks) to evaluate rehabilitation efficiency. Methods: Forty people with progressive multiple sclerosis were enrolled. Wireless wearable devices were used to evaluate the gait. Instrumental gait analysis, clinical assessment, and patient report outcome measures were acquired before and after the neurorehabilitation. Spatiotemporal gait parameters, the co-activation index of lower limb muscles, and clinical assessments were compared pre- and post-treatment. Results: Significant improvements after intensive neurorehabilitation were found in most of the clinical assessments, cadence, and velocity of the instrumental gait analysis, paralleled by amelioration of thigh co-activation on the less-affected side. Subjects with better balance performance and higher independence at baseline benefit more from the neurorehabilitation course. Conclusions: Significant improvements in gait performance were found in our cohort after an intensive neurorehabilitation course, for both quantitative and qualitative measures. Integrating kinematic and muscle activity measurements offers opportunities to objectively evaluate and interpret treatment effects.</p>

	<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous condition characterized by deficits in social communication and a repetitive pattern of behavior, with recent Italian prevalence estimates of 1 in 77. Although the core behavioral features of ASD appear to emerge within the first two years of life, clinical diagnosis is often not received before the third birthday. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has recommended that primary care physicians routinely screen for ASD at the 18- and 24-month visits. In Italy, the Guidelines of the Italian National Institute for Health (ISS) recommend the Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (CHAT) as a screening tool for ASD, which compares parent responses with a semistructured observation by a healthcare provider. In the Italian National Health System, pediatricians have regular visits with all children; however, there is wide variability in following screening guidelines, and some barriers have been detected. For these reasons, other studies have highlighted the advantages of using telemedicine with the potential for enhancing ASD screening practices. The current study is an examination of the implementation of the first Italian online web-based screening tool (Web Italian Network for Autism Spectrum DisorderWIN4ASD), an innovative web app for pediatricians. We present the data obtained from the screening activity through the platform by a small group of pediatricians. The results of this study show that the implemented web-based platform appears to be an effective, efficient, and sustainable way to integrate screening services into primary care.</p>

	<p>Autoimmune-mediated ataxia has been associated with paraneoplastic disease, gluten enteropathy, Hashimoto thyroiditis as well as autoimmune disorders without a known associated disease. There have been relatively few reports describing the neuropathology of these conditions. This review is an attempt to consolidate those reports and determine the ways in which autoimmune ataxias can be neuropathologically differentiated from hereditary or other sporadic ataxias. In most instances, particularly in paraneoplastic forms, the presence of inflammatory infiltrates is a strong indicator of autoimmune disease, but it was not a consistent finding in all reported cases. Therefore, clinical and laboratory findings are important for assessing an autoimmune mechanism. Such factors as rapid rate of clinical progression, presence of known autoantibodies or the presence of a malignant neoplasm or other autoimmune disease processes need to be considered, particularly in cases where inflammatory changes are minimal or absent and the pathology is largely confined to the cerebellum and its connections, where the disease can mimic hereditary or other sporadic ataxias.</p>

	<p>Metabolic syndrome (MetS) or otherwise insulin resistance (IR) is described as a cluster of several commonly occurring disorders, including abdominal obesity; lipids disorders, such as hypertriglyceridemia; and low levels of high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), hypertension (&amp;amp;ge;130/85 mmHg), and carbohydrates disorders, such as impaired fasting glucose or diabetes mellitus type 2. Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) constitutes insulin resistance, which is a strong risk factor for strokes. Patients with MetS are often prone to cognitive decline. Metabolic risk factors, hypertension, and diabetes, amongst them, have been hypothesized to play a great role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) and the development of vascular dementia. For neuropsychological diagnostic and theoretical purposes verbal fluency is defined as a cognitive function that facilitates information retrieval from memory. It engages executive control and other cognitive processes, such as selective attention, selective inhibition, mental set shifting, internal response generation, and self-monitoring, as well as imagination and psychomotor skills. A total of 90 subjects, divided into 2 groups, patients with MetS (45) and healthy controls (45), were assessed. A significant difference in performance was found between the patients and controls, both in the phonetic (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) and semantic fluency trials (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). The MetS patients produced less words in the letter K and animal categories. The analysis of descriptive statistics shows that the group of patients with metabolic syndrome generated fewer words in both the phonetic and semantic categories. Our study shows that there is an association between metabolic factors and the verbal fluency performance of MetS patients. This is true, especially for phonetic verbal fluency, which is traditionally connected with the frontal cortex. Lower switching signifies possible executive dysfunctions amongst people with MetS. Subjects with this condition generated more diverse words and created less standard associations. This further implies the existence of dysexecutive syndrome and the need for diagnosing patients in this direction and involving this group of people in therapy. The proper correction of MetS components may improve cognitive function.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Electrophysiological Responses to Rapidly-Presented Affective Stimuli Predict Individual Differences in Subsequent Attention</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>We are constantly surrounded by a dynamically changing perceptual landscape that can influence our behavior even without our full conscious awareness. Emotional processing can have effects on subsequent attention, but there are mixed findings on whether it induces attentional enhancement or interference. The present study used a new multimodal approach to explain and predict such attentional effects based on individual differences in response to emotional stimuli. We briefly presented affective pictures (neutral, positive, erotic, mutilation, and horror categories) for 80 ms, immediately followed by a cued flanker task that was unrelated to the pictures. Event-related potentials (ERPs), skin conductance response (SCR), and reaction time (RT) were measured for each participant. We found that, in general, affective pictures induced higher electrophysiological responses compared with neutral pictures [P300 and late positive potential (LPP) in the erotic condition; P300, LPP, and SCR in the horror condition]. In particular, individuals who showed a strong ERP response to the pictures were impeded in the erotic condition (only P300) and facilitated in the horror condition (both P300 and LPP). Those who did not show a significant ERP or SCR response to the pictures were facilitated in the erotic condition and impeded in the horror condition. Furthermore, it was possible to classify the direction of the attentional effect from the participants&rsquo; P300, LPP, and SCR responses. These results demonstrate that underlying individual differences in emotional processing must be considered in understanding and predicting the effects of emotions on attention and cognition.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A randomised trial of the effects on recruitment and retention of including a wet-ink signature and photograph in the patient invitation letter for a clinical trial: results from a Study Within a Trial (SWAT 3 and SWAT 53) [version 1; peer review: awaitin</a></h4>

              
                Background: There is uncertainty about the effects of modifications to trial patient invitation letters on recruitment and retention. However, such documents are important. Methods: A 2x2 factorial design embedded a pair of randomised Studies Within a Trial (SWAT) within a large host trial (CLEAR), to evaluate the effects of including wet-ink signatures and photographs in the patient invitation letter. Patients were randomised to receive one of four invitation letters: with a wet-ink or generic signature, and with or without a photograph. The primary outcome was the proportion of invited patients who joined the CLEAR trial. The secondary outcome was the proportion of patients retained in the trial. Results: 368 letters were given to potential participants in the CLEAR trial and 121 (33%) joined. Proportions for each randomised group were generic signature and no photograph: 38% (33/88); generic signature and photograph: 32% (28/88); wet-ink personal signature and no photograph: 29% (26/91); wet-ink personal signature and photograph: 34% (34/101). There was no evidence of a significant difference in recruitment between those receiving the patient invitation letter containing a wet-ink versus generic signature (odds ratio (OR): 0.86, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.55 to 1.32, p=0.49) or photograph versus no photograph (OR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.64 to 1.53, p=0.97). Retention was similar for the wet-ink and generic signature groups (OR: 1.20, 95% CI: 0.35 to 4.16, p=0.77) but significantly better when a photograph was used (OR: 5.40, 95% CI: 1.12 to 26.15, p=0.04, based on 2 withdrawals in the photograph group versus 9 in the no photograph group). Conclusions: These SWAT add to the evidence base for the effects of modifications to clinical trial documentation on recruitment and retention. We found including a photograph may improve retention. Although these analyses are underpowered, they will contribute to meta-analysis of similar comparisons. ISRCTN registration: 89040295 (06/07/2018)

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">PressPurt: network sensitivity to press perturbations under interaction uncertainty [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                While the use of networks to understand how complex systems respond to perturbations is pervasive across scientific disciplines, the uncertainty associated with estimates of pairwise interaction strengths (edge weights) remains rarely considered. Mischaracterizations of interaction strength can lead to qualitatively incorrect predictions regarding system responses as perturbations propagate through often counteracting direct and indirect effects. Here, we introduce PressPurt, a computational package for identifying the interactions whose strengths must be estimated most accurately in order to produce robust predictions of a network's response to press perturbations. The package provides methods for calculating and visualizing these edge-specific sensitivities (tolerances) when uncertainty is associated to one or more edges according to a variety of different error distributions. The software requires the network to be represented as a numerical (quantitative or qualitative) Jacobian matrix evaluated at stable equilibrium. PressPurt is open source under the MIT license and is available as both a Python package and an R package hosted at https://github.com/dkoslicki/PressPurt and on the CRAN repository https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=PressPurt.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Japanese sound-symbolic words in global contexts: from translation to hybridization [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                This paper explores the global reception and development of the artistic expression of onomatopoeia and mimetic words in modern and contemporary Japanese literary texts adopting the method of comparative literature. By analyzing sound-symbolic words and their translations in modern Japanese poetry and contemporary comics, the intercultural dialogues of these texts are examined and the emergence of hybrid onomatopoeia in global comic works is illuminated. The Japanese language is often noted for its richness of sound-symbolic words. In the literary world, modern poetry adopted and elaborated the use of these words from the late 19th century in its quest for a new style of poetry. In the early 20th century, poets developed the artistic expression of sound-symbolic words and succeeded in giving musicality to the “new-style poem”. However, the translation of Japanese sound-symbolic words has always been problematic. Experimental uses of these words in modern poems were often untranslatable, making the translations incomprehensible or dull. Nevertheless, graphic narratives and their worldwide distribution changed that situation. Japanese comics (manga) has particularly developed the artistic expression of sound-symbolic words. Usually placed outside speech balloons, these words are elaborately depicted and are important elements of the panel/page layout. Notably, the global popularity of the genre developed a new phase of intercultural dialogue. As not every word has an equivalent or is translatable in the target language, translators have left sound-symbolic words untouched in the translated versions, putting translation aside. Thus, the combination of Japanese and the target language seems to influence the visual comprehension of sound effects among the readers. Through the examinations of some cases, this paper brings to light the emergence of some hybrid onomatopoeia and reveals that the “Third Space” formed by the translation and hybridization of manga is a dynamic field that creates a new culture.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study aimed to elucidate the molecular features of inclusion body myositis (IBM).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed RNA sequencing analysis of muscle biopsy samples from 67 participants, consisting of 58 myositis patients with the pathological finding of CD8-positive T cells invading non-necrotic muscle fibers expressing major histocompatibility complex class I (43 IBM, 6 polymyositis, and 9 unclassifiable myositis), and 9 controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Cluster analysis, principal component analysis, and pathway analysis showed that differentially expressed genes and pathways identified in IBM and polymyositis were mostly comparable. However, pathways related to cell adhesion molecules were upregulated in IBM as compared with polymyositis and controls (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Notably, <i>CDH1</i>, which encodes the epidermal cell junction protein cadherin 1, was overexpressed in the muscles of IBM, which was validated by another RNA sequencing dataset from previous publications. Western blotting confirmed the presence of mature cadherin 1 protein in the muscles of IBM. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed the positivity for anti-cadherin 1 antibody in the muscles of IBM, whereas there was no muscle fiber positive for anti-cadherin 1 antibody in immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy, antisynthetase syndrome, and controls. The fibers stained with anti-cadherin 1 antibody did not have rimmed vacuoles or abnormal protein accumulation. Experimental skeletal muscle regeneration and differentiation systems showed that <i>CDH1</i> is expressed during skeletal muscle regeneration and differentiation.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p><i>CDH1</i> was detected as a differentially expressed gene, and immunohistochemistry showed that cadherin 1 exists in the muscles of IBM, whereas it was rarely seen in those of other idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. Cadherin 1 upregulation in muscle could provide a valuable clue to the pathological mechanisms of IBM. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                <p>COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 infection) can lead to intensive care unit (ICU) admission and critical illness myopathy (CIM). We examined three ICU patients with COVID-19, who required mechanical ventilation for pneumonia and developed CIM. Pathological examination of skeletal muscle biopsies revealed myopathic changes consistent with CIM, variable inflammation with autophagic vacuoles, SARS-CoV immunostaining+ fibers/granules, and electron microscopy findings of mitochondrial abnormalities and coronavirus-like particles. While mitochondrial dysfunction with compromised energy production is a critical pathogenic mechanism of non-COVID-19-associated CIM, in our series of COVID-19-associated CIM, myopathic changes including prominent mitochondrial damage suggest a similar mechanism and association with direct SARS-CoV-2 muscle infection.</p>

                Background: Microfluidic cell manipulation techniques have been continually developed and integrated into miniature chips as a so-called lab-on-a-chip (LOC) platform for high-throughput bioassays. Among the various mechanisms of bioparticles manipulation by electrically induced forces, dielectrophoresis (DEP) has been regarded as the most promising technique utilized in microfluidic systems. Into the micro- to nano-scale level of DEP configuration, the common challenges of undesirable side effects such as electrohydrodynamic effects, joule heating, and electrolysis that may occur in the microfluidic system has always been a hurdle which would severely limit the DEP performance. Methods: A numerical simulation study was performed on a versatile capability of a rectangular type of dielectrophoresis microelectrode with different parametric design configuration variables (channel height: 20-50 µm; electrode width 20-100 µm; electrode spacing 5-50 µm). Results: Numerical study results have shown that the ideal dimension range of design configuration for optimum DEP performance have been identified to be 40µm in channel height, 20-40 µm in electrode width and 5-15µm in electrode spacing, further increasing of the dimensions have shown a decrease in DEP performance consequently abridged the bioparticle manipulation. Conclusion: This investigation of the parametric design of the rectangular geometry microelectrode has provided necessary insight to the microelectrode design information and parametric considerations for optimum DEP device fabrication and enhancement.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Deep brain stimulation for arm tremor: A randomized trial comparing two targets</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the thalamic ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM) effectively suppresses arm tremor. Uncontrolled studies suggest the posterior subthalamic area (PSA) may be superior. We compared the intra-individual efficacy of VIM- versus PSA-DBS on tremor suppression and arm function.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial at Oslo University Hospital in patients (18–80 years) with isolated or combined action tremor affecting at least one arm. Four-contact DBS leads were implanted (bi- or unilaterally) with a trajectory to cover the VIM (upper two contacts) and PSA (lower two contacts). Patients were randomized (1:1 ratio) post-surgery to: Group 1, VIM-stimulation months 0–3 (period 1), then PSA-stimulation months 4–6 (period 2); Group 2, PSA-stimulation first, then VIM-stimulation. Primary endpoint was the difference in improvement from baseline to the end of the VIM- versus PSA-period in the sum of the dominant arm tremor scores of the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating Scale (FTMTRS), items 5/6 + 10–14.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Forty-five patients were randomized to Group 1 (n = 23) or 2 (n = 22). In the primary endpoint per-protocol analysis (mixed model, n = 40), mean difference in the sum FTMTRS score improvement for the dominant arm was −2.65 points (95% CI -4.33 to −0.97; p = 0.002). The difference in favour of PSA stimulation was highly significant in period 2, but not period 1.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our randomized trial demonstrated that PSA stimulation provided superior tremor suppression compared with VIM stimulation. A period effect reducing tremor for up to three months in both groups was most likely attributed to a post-surgery stun effect.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A mechanistic modeling framework reveals the key principles underlying tumor metabolism</a></h4>

While aerobic glycolysis, or the Warburg effect, has for a long time been considered a hallmark of tumor metabolism, recent studies have revealed a far more complex picture. Tumor cells exhibit widespread metabolic heterogeneity, not only in their presentation of the Warburg effect but also in the nutrients and the metabolic pathways they are dependent on. Moreover, tumor cells can switch between different metabolic phenotypes in response to environmental cues and therapeutic interventions. A framework to analyze the observed metabolic heterogeneity and plasticity is, however, lacking. Using a mechanistic model that includes the key metabolic pathways active in tumor cells, we show that the inhibition of phosphofructokinase by excess ATP in the cytoplasm can drive a preference for aerobic glycolysis in fast-proliferating tumor cells. The differing rates of ATP utilization by tumor cells can therefore drive heterogeneity with respect to the presentation of the Warburg effect. Building upon this idea, we couple the metabolic phenotype of tumor cells to their migratory phenotype, and show that our model predictions are in agreement with previous experiments. Next, we report that the reliance of proliferating cells on different anaplerotic pathways depends on the relative availability of glucose and glutamine, and can further drive metabolic heterogeneity. Finally, using treatment of melanoma cells with a BRAF inhibitor as an example, we show that our model can be used to predict the metabolic and gene expression changes in cancer cells in response to drug treatment. By making predictions that are far more generalizable and interpretable as compared to previous tumor metabolism modeling approaches, our framework identifies key principles that govern tumor cell metabolism, and the reported heterogeneity and plasticity. These principles could be key to targeting the metabolic vulnerabilities of cancer.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Bias-free estimation of information content in temporally sparse neuronal activity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Liron Sheintuch, Alon Rubin, Yaniv Ziv</p>

Applying information theoretic measures to neuronal activity data enables the quantification of neuronal encoding quality. However, when the sample size is limited, a naïve estimation of the information content typically contains a systematic overestimation (upward bias), which may lead to misinterpretation of coding characteristics. This bias is exacerbated in Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging because of the temporal sparsity of elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. Here, we introduce methods to correct for the bias in the naïve estimation of information content from limited sample sizes and temporally sparse neuronal activity. We demonstrate the higher accuracy of our methods over previous ones, when applied to Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging data recorded from the mouse hippocampus and primary visual cortex, as well as to simulated data with matching tuning properties and firing statistics. Our bias-correction methods allowed an accurate estimation of the information place cells carry about the animal’s position (<i>spatial information</i>) and uncovered the spatial resolution of hippocampal coding. Furthermore, using our methods, we found that cells with higher peak firing rates carry higher spatial information per spike and exposed differences between distinct hippocampal subfields in the long-term evolution of the spatial code. These results could be masked by the bias when applying the commonly used naïve calculation of information content. Thus, a bias-free estimation of information content can uncover otherwise overlooked properties of the neural code.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A computationally tractable birth-death model that combines phylogenetic and epidemiological data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alexander Eugene Zarebski, Louis du Plessis, Kris Varun Parag, Oliver George Pybus</p>

Inferring the dynamics of pathogen transmission during an outbreak is an important problem in infectious disease epidemiology. In mathematical epidemiology, estimates are often informed by time series of confirmed cases, while in phylodynamics genetic sequences of the pathogen, sampled through time, are the primary data source. Each type of data provides different, and potentially complementary, insight. Recent studies have recognised that combining data sources can improve estimates of the transmission rate and the number of infected individuals. However, inference methods are typically highly specialised and field-specific and are either computationally prohibitive or require intensive simulation, limiting their real-time utility. We present a novel birth-death phylogenetic model and derive a tractable analytic approximation of its likelihood, the computational complexity of which is linear in the size of the dataset. This approach combines epidemiological and phylodynamic data to produce estimates of key parameters of transmission dynamics and the unobserved prevalence. Using simulated data, we show (a) that the approximation agrees well with existing methods, (b) validate the claim of linear complexity and (c) explore robustness to model misspecification. This approximation facilitates inference on large datasets, which is increasingly important as large genomic sequence datasets become commonplace.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Maternal Epilepsy and Long‐term Offspring Mortality – a Nationwide Cohort Study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We examined how maternal epilepsy and use of antiseizure medications in pregnancy was associated with offspring mortality.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This population-based cohort study included all live- and stillborn singletons in Denmark between 1981 and 2016. We used nation-wide registers to retrieve information on pregnancy characteristics, epilepsy diagnoses, use of antiseizure medications, and mortality. Adjusted Mortality rate ratios (MRR) were estimated using log-linear Poisson regression.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The cohort consisted of 1,862,474 children. In total, 12,026 live-born children died during follow-up, of whom 170 (1.4%) were offspring of mothers with epilepsy. Overall mortality was increased in offspring of mothers with epilepsy compared to offspring of mothers without epilepsy (MRR=1.46, 95% CI: 1.23-1.71), driven by an excess mortality only in the first year of life. Mortality was increased for natural deaths (MRR=1.50, 95% CI: 1.25-1.78) but not from unnatural deaths (MRR=1.38, 95% CI: 0.84-2.14), and only in offspring of women with epilepsy who used antiseizure medications during pregnancy (MRR=1.51, 95% CI: 1.00-2.17), but not in offspring of women with epilepsy who did not use antiseizure medications while pregnant (MRR=0.97, 95% CI: 0.69-1.31). When analyses were restricted to children born from 2000 and onwards, the excess mortality that was observed in the first year of life among children of mothers with epilepsy, was no longer evident.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>During the 1981-1999 epoch, offspring of women with epilepsy were at increased risk of dying in the first year of life. However, this risk did not extend to children born after 2000. Future retrospective studies of the effects of maternal epilepsy on the health of the offspring should take this difference into account.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Bayes factor benefits for clinical psychology: review of child and adolescent evidence base [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Statistical methods are a cornerstone of research in clinical psychology and are used in clinical trials and reviews to determine the best available evidence. The most widespread statistical framework, frequentist statistics, is often misunderstood and misused. Even when properly applied, this framework can lead to erroneous conclusions and unnecessarily prolonged trials. The implications for clinical psychology are difficulties in interpreting best available evidence and unnecessarily costly and burdensome research. An alternative framework, Bayesian statistics, is proposed as a solution to several issues with current practice. Methods: Statistical tests of primary outcome measures were extracted from 272 studies, which were cited in 11 recent reviews in the Evidence-based updates series in the Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology. The extracted tests were examined regarding relevant features and re-analyzed using Bayes Factors. Results: When statistical tests were significant, the majority (98%) of re-analyzed tests agreed with such claims. When statistical tests were nonsignificant almost half (43%) of re-analyzed tests disagreed with such claims. Equally important for clinical research, an average of 13% fewer participants per study would have been required if the studies had used Bayes Factors. Conclusions: Bayes Factors offer benefits for research in clinical psychology through intuitive interpretations, and less costly trials.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Awareness and intention to register halal certification of micro and small-scale food enterprises [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This paper discusses halal awareness of food micro and small-scale enterprises (food MSEs) in West Java Province, Indonesia. Halal awareness is the first step toward obtaining halal certificates, which confirm that the product is lawful according to Islamic Sharia. Unfortunately, most of the food sold on the market do not have halal certificates due to a lack of halal awareness and intention on the part of the entrepreneurs. Methods: This study aims at measuring the level of halal awareness and the intention of food MSE entrepreneurs to register halal certification. Halal awareness is assumed to be influenced by knowledge of halal and MSEs' entrepreneurial perceptions of the benefits of halal certificates. Furthermore, halal awareness, attitudes, and perceptions of ease of procedures will encourage the intention to register halal certification. An electronic Google Form with a cover letter and a set of questionnaires was distributed to collect data. Structural Equation Modelling – Partial Least Square (SEM-PLS) was chosen to evaluate the adopted theoretical models in the exploratory research. Results: The results show that halal awareness is influenced by knowledge of halal and perceptions of benefits. Moreover, halal awareness influences positively the intention to obtain a halal certificate, but the intention is not significantly affected by attitudes and perceptions of procedures for obtaining halal certification. This shows that halal awareness will increase the intention to register halal certification. However, it does not impact attitudes/actions to register for halal certification due to the misconceptions about the procedures for obtaining halal certificates. Conclusions: Micro and small entrepreneurs in West Java Province, Indonesia have a good level of awareness about halal food. However, their products are not halal-certified due to the perceptions of the procedures for obtaining halal certificates, which are relatively complicated and costly for micro and small-scale businesses.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Anticancer activity of Caesalpinia sappan by downregulating mitochondrial genes in A549 lung cancer cell line [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The standardization and mechanism of action of Caesalpinia sappan as an anticancer agent are still lacking. This study aimed to understand the mechanism of action of  C,sappan extract as an anticancer agent. Methods: This study was conducted using the A549 lung cancer cell line to understand the mechanism of action of C. sappan extract as an anticancer agent. The cytotoxicity activity, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, protein-related apoptosis (i.e., BCL-2and BAX protein) assays, and RNA sequencing were performed level were measured. Moreover, the antioxidant activity, total flavonoids, and phenolics of C.sappan were also assessed. Results: C.sappan has strong antioxidant activity (22.14 ± 0.93 ppm) total flavonoid content of (529.3 ± 4.56 mgQE/g), and phenolics content of (923.37 ± 5 mgGAE/g). The C.sappan ethanol extract inhibited cancer cell growth and arrested at G0/G1 phase of cell cycle, inducing apoptosis by increasing BAX/BCL-2 protein ratio in A549 lung cancer cell line. Furthermore, results from RNA sequencing analysis showed that C.sappan ethanol extract caused downregulation of genes acting on mitochondrial function including adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and respiration. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that C.sappan has the ability to inhibit cancer cell growth by inducing apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction in A549 cells.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effect of Aloe vera extract in post-burn skin repair in rats [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Burn injury is a global health problem that is most often caused by heat. Burn injury can cause high morbidity and mortality and requires high cost. Therefore, the use of plants as herbal medicine has the potential to be developed in Indonesia. Aloe vera contains various active ingredients that help the wound healing process, such as glucomannan and acemannan which have the effects on the proliferation of macrophages, and fibroblasts, and re-epithelialization. This study aimed to determine the effect of Aloe vera extract in repairing post-burn skin in rats that was analyzed from the number of macrophages and fibroblasts, and epidermal thickness. Methods: This is an experimental study with a posttest-only control group design using 54 Rattus norvegicus Wistar strain rats. The sampling method was simple random sampling consisting of 3 groups, i.e., I. standard group, which were normal rats; II. negative control group, which were given second-degree burns and treated with gel base (without Aloe vera extract); III. treatment groups, which were given second-degree burns and treated with Aloe vera extract gel. Each group was subdivided into three smaller groups (n = 6) according to the time the lesions were evaluated. Skin tissue samplings were carried out on day 3, 14, and 21 after injury to observe the number of macrophages and fibroblasts, and epidermal thickness. Results: There were significant differences in the mean number of macrophages, number of fibroblasts, and epidermal thickness in all groups (p<0.05). Conclusion: Aloe vera extract gel could accelerate the healing process of burns in rats.

                Energy conservation in microorganisms is classically categorized into respiration and fermentation; however, recent work shows some species can use mixed or alternative bioenergetic strategies. We explored the use of extracellular electron transfer for energy conservation in diverse lactic acid bacteria (LAB), microorganisms that mainly rely on fermentative metabolism and are important in food fermentations. The LAB <i>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</i> uses extracellular electron transfer to increase its NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio, generate more ATP through substrate-level phosphorylation, and accumulate biomass more rapidly. This novel, hybrid metabolism is dependent on a type-II NADH dehydrogenase (Ndh2) and conditionally requires a flavin-binding extracellular lipoprotein (PplA) under laboratory conditions. It confers increased fermentation product yield, metabolic flux, and environmental acidification in laboratory media and during kale juice fermentation. The discovery of a single pathway that simultaneously blends features of fermentation and respiration in a primarily fermentative microorganism expands our knowledge of energy conservation and provides immediate biotechnology applications.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Coding of chromatic spatial contrast by macaque V1 neurons</a></h4>

              
                Color perception relies on comparisons between adjacent lights, but how the brain performs these comparisons is poorly understood. To elucidate the underlying neural mechanisms, we recorded spiking responses of individual V1 neurons in macaque monkeys to pairs of stimuli within the classical receptive field (RF). We estimated the spatial-chromatic RF of each neuron and then presented customized colored edges using a novel closed-loop technique. We found that many double-opponent (DO) cells, which have spatially and chromatically opponent RFs, responded to chromatic contrast as a weighted sum, akin to how other V1 cells responded to luminance contrast. Yet other neurons integrated chromatic signals non-linearly, confirming that linear signal integration is not an obligate property of V1 neurons. The functional similarity of cone-opponent DO cells and cone non-opponent simple cells suggests that these two groups may share a common underlying neural circuitry, promotes the construction of image-computable models for full-color image representation, and sheds new light on V1 complex cells.
