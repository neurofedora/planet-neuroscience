              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12106">The Brain-Mesh Model: A Unified Framework For Neural Synchrony, Plasticity, And Coherence</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.12106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The brain-mesh model introduces a novel three-layered architecture that integrates local and macro-regional connectivity with an underlying, mesh-inspired network layer. This foundational mesh layer, based on metallic mesh structures, spans the entire brain and generates interference patterns, noise, and resonance effects that modulate both local and global neural dynamics. The fused model goes beyond traditional connectivity frameworks by providing a unified explanation for phenomena such as brain-wide phase gradients, stable low-frequency resonance frequencies, and long-range plasticity effects, which are often difficult to explain cohesively within existing models.
  In addition to accounting for classical neurobiological observations, such as phase synchrony, functional connectivity fluctuations, and local Hebbian plasticity, the model offers novel insights into less understood phenomena. Specifically, it predicts connectivity-independent phase gradients across non-synaptic regions, harmonic resonance peaks consistent across individuals, and diffuse plasticity driven by global interference patterns, all of which are challenging to explain under current frameworks.
  These unique predictions align with partial empirical observations, such as traveling wave dynamics, consistent low-frequency oscillations, and task-induced connectivity shifts, underscoring the model's relevance. Additionally, the brain-mesh model generates testable hypotheses that distinguish it from traditional approaches. This provides a promising framework for future experimental validation and opens new avenues for understanding global brain function.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12112">Generative Modeling of Neural Dynamics via Latent Stochastic Differential Equations</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.12112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a probabilistic framework for developing computational models of biological neural systems. In this framework, physiological recordings are viewed as discrete-time partial observations of an underlying continuous-time stochastic dynamical system which implements computations through its state evolution. To model this dynamical system, we employ a system of coupled stochastic differential equations with differentiable drift and diffusion functions and use variational inference to infer its states and parameters. This formulation enables seamless integration of existing mathematical models in the literature, neural networks, or a hybrid of both to learn and compare different models. We demonstrate this in our framework by developing a generative model that combines coupled oscillators with neural networks to capture latent population dynamics from single-cell recordings. Evaluation across three neuroscience datasets spanning different species, brain regions, and behavioral tasks show that these hybrid models achieve competitive performance in predicting stimulus-evoked neural and behavioral responses compared to sophisticated black-box approaches while requiring an order of magnitude fewer parameters, providing uncertainty estimates, and offering a natural language for interpretation.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12179">Towards a (meta-)mathematical theory of consciousness: universal (mapping) properties of experience</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.12179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conscious (subjective) experience permeates our daily lives, yet general consensus on a theory of consciousness remains elusive. Integrated Information Theory (IIT) is a prominent approach that asserts the existence of subjective experience (0th axiom), from an intrinsic system of causally related units, and five essential properties (axioms 1-5): intrinsicality, information, integration, exclusion and composition. However, despite empirical support for some aspects of IIT, the supposed necessity of these axioms is unclear given their informal presentation and operationalized dependence on a specific mathematical instantiation as the so-called postulates. The category theory approach presented here attempts to redress this situation. Category theory is a kind of meta-mathematics invented to make relations between formal structures formally precise and so facilitate doing "ordinary" mathematics. In this way, the five essential properties for consciousness are organized around a smaller number of meta-mathematical principles for comparison with IIT. In particular, category theory characterizes mathematical structures by their "universal mapping properties" -- a unique-existence condition for all instances of the structure. Accordingly, axioms 1-5 pertain to universal mapping properties for experience, whence the slogan, "Consciousness is a universal property."

                arXiv:2412.12198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores visual search asymmetry and the detection process between parallel and serial search strategies, building upon Treisman's Feature Integration Theory [3]. Our experiment examines how easy it is to locate an oblique line among vertical distractors versus a vertical line among oblique distractors, a framework previously validated by Treisman & Gormican (1988) [4] and Gupta et al. (2015) [1]. We hypothesised that an oblique target among vertical lines would produce a perceptual 'pop-out' effect, allowing for faster, parallel search, while the reverse condition would require serial search strategy. Seventy-eight participants from Utrecht University engaged in trials with varied target-distractor orientations and number of items. We measured reaction times and found a significant effect of target type on search speed: oblique targets were identified more quickly, reflecting 'pop-out' behaviour, while vertical targets demanded focused attention ('glue phase'). Our results align with past findings, supporting our hypothesis on search asymmetry and its dependency on distinct visual features. Future research could benefit from eye-tracking and neural network analysis, particularly for identifying the neural processing of visual features in both parallel and serial search conditions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12229">Efficacy of Temporal Interference Electrical Stimulation for Spinal Cord Injury Rehabilitation: A Case Series</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.12229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a debilitating condition that often results in significant motor and sensory deficits, impacting the quality of life. Current rehabilitation methods, including physical therapy and electrical stimulation, offer variable outcomes and often require invasive procedures. Temporal interference (TI) stimulation has emerged as a novel, non-invasive neuromodulation technique capable of targeting deep neural structures with precision, providing a promising alternative for SCI rehabilitation. This study explores the efficacy of TI stimulation as a non-invasive approach for improving motor and sensory function in patients with incomplete SCI. Three male patients with incomplete cervical SCI (AIS D) participated in a two-week intervention consisting of 14 sessions of TI stimulation targeting their injury sites. TI stimulation was delivered using frequencies of 1000 Hz and 1040 Hz, with assessments conducted pre- and post-intervention, including motor and sensory evaluations, functional scales, and imaging studies.All participants demonstrated significant improvements in neurological function, motor strength, sensory perception, and functional independence. Neurological levels of injury shifted upward in all cases, with one patient improving from C5 to C7. Graded Redefined Assessment of Strength, Sensibility and Prehension (GRASSP) results shows additional strength, prehension and sensory outcomes obtained for the arm and hand functions of participants. Motor scores (UEMS and LEMS) increased, sensory scores for light touch and pin prick improved, and functional assessments, such as the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and Barthel Index (BI), showed marked gains. Pain scores also decreased in two participants, highlighting additional therapeutic benefits.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13028">Identification of Epileptic Spasms (ESES) Phases Using EEG Signals: A Vision Transformer Approach</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.13028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a new approach to the Epileptic Spasms (ESES) detection based on the EEG signals using Vision Transformers (ViT). Classic ESES detection approaches have usually been performed with manual processing or conventional algorithms, suffering from poor sample sizes, single-channel-based analyses, and low generalization abilities. In contrast, the proposed ViT model overcomes these limitations by using the attention mechanism to focus on the important features in multi-channel EEG data, which is contributing to both better accuracy and efficiency. The model processes frequency-domain representations of EEG signals, such as spectrograms, as image data to capture long-range dependencies and complex patterns in the signal. The model demonstrates high performance with an accuracy of 97% without requiring intensive data preprocessing, thus rendering it suitable for real-time clinical applications on a large scale. The method represents a significant development in the advancement of neurological disorders such as ESES in detection and analysis.

                arXiv:2412.12134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the complex dynamics and fractal attractors that emerge from 60-dimensional ring lattice systems of electrically coupled non-chaotic Rulkov neurons. Although networks of chaotic Rulkov neurons are well-studied, systems of non-chaotic Rulkov neurons have not been extensively explored due to the piecewise complexity of the non-chaotic Rulkov map. We find rich dynamics emerge from the electrical coupling of regular spiking Rulkov neurons, including chaotic spiking, chaotic bursting, and complete chaos. We also discover general trends in the maximal Lyapunov exponent among different ring lattice systems as the electrical coupling strength between neurons is varied. By means of the Kaplan-Yorke conjecture, we also examine the fractal geometry of the chaotic attractors of the ring systems and find various correlations and differences between the fractal dimensions of the attractors and the chaotic dynamics on them.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12651">Shared Attention-based Autoencoder with Hierarchical Fusion-based Graph Convolution Network for sEEG SOZ Identification</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.12651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diagnosing seizure onset zone (SOZ) is a challenge in neurosurgery, where stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) serves as a critical technique. In sEEG SOZ identification, the existing studies focus solely on the intra-patient representation of epileptic information, overlooking the general features of epilepsy across patients and feature interdependencies between feature elements in each contact site. In order to address the aforementioned challenges, we propose the shared attention-based autoencoder (sATAE). sATAE is trained by sEEG data across all patients, with attention blocks introduced to enhance the representation of interdependencies between feature elements. Considering the spatial diversity of sEEG across patients, we introduce graph-based method for identification SOZ of each patient. However, the current graph-based methods for sEEG SOZ identification rely exclusively on static graphs to model epileptic networks. Inspired by the finding of neuroscience that epileptic network is intricately characterized by the interplay of sophisticated equilibrium between fluctuating and stable states, we design the hierarchical fusion-based graph convolution network (HFGCN) to identify the SOZ. HFGCN integrates the dynamic and static characteristics of epileptic networks through hierarchical weighting across different hierarchies, facilitating a more comprehensive learning of epileptic features and enriching node information for sEEG SOZ identification. Combining sATAE and HFGCN, we perform comprehensive experiments with sATAE-HFGCN on the self-build sEEG dataset, which includes sEEG data from 17 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. The results show that our method, sATAE-HFGCN, achieves superior performance for identifying the SOZ of each patient, effectively addressing the aforementioned challenges, providing an efficient solution for sEEG-based SOZ identification.

                arXiv:2408.14508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A suite of impressive scientific discoveries have been driven by recent advances in artificial intelligence. These almost all result from training flexible algorithms to solve difficult optimization problems specified in advance by teams of domain scientists and engineers with access to large amounts of data. Although extremely useful, this kind of problem solving only corresponds to one part of science - the "easy problem." The other part of scientific research is coming up with the problem itself - the "hard problem." Solving the hard problem is beyond the capacities of current algorithms for scientific discovery because it requires continual conceptual revision based on poorly defined constraints. We can make progress on understanding how humans solve the hard problem by studying the cognitive science of scientists, and then use the results to design new computational agents that automatically infer and update their scientific paradigms.

Abstract: Arbor is a software library designed for efficient simulation of large-scale networks of biological neurons with detailed morphological structures. It combines customizable neuronal and synaptic mechanisms with high-performance computing, supporting multi-core CPU and GPU systems.
  In humans and other animals, synaptic plasticity processes play a vital role in cognitive functions, including learning and memory. Recent studies have shown that intracellular molecular processes in dendrites significantly influence single-neuron dynamics. However, for understanding how the complex interplay between dendrites and synaptic processes influences network dynamics, computational modeling is required.
  To enable the modeling of large-scale networks of morphologically detailed neurons with diverse plasticity processes, we have extended the Arbor library to the Plastic Arbor framework, supporting simulations of a large variety of spike-driven plasticity paradigms. To showcase the features of the new framework, we present examples of computational models, beginning with single-synapse dynamics, progressing to multi-synapse rules, and finally scaling up to large recurrent networks. While cross-validating our implementations by comparison with other simulators, we show that Arbor allows simulating plastic networks of multi-compartment neurons at nearly no additional cost in runtime compared to point-neuron simulations. Using the new framework, we have already been able to investigate the impact of dendritic structures on network dynamics across a timescale of several hours, showing a relation between the length of dendritic trees and the ability of the network to efficiently store information.
  By our extension of Arbor, we aim to provide a valuable tool that will support future studies on the impact of synaptic plasticity, especially, in conjunction with neuronal morphology, in large networks.

                arXiv:2412.12694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A series of modified cognitive-only particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms effectively mitigate premature convergence by constructing distinct vectors for different particles. However, the underutilization of these constructed vectors hampers convergence accuracy. In this paper, an adaptive balance search based complementary heterogeneous PSO architecture is proposed, which consists of a complementary heterogeneous PSO (CHxPSO) framework and an adaptive balance search (ABS) strategy. The CHxPSO framework mainly includes two update channels and two subswarms. Two channels exhibit nearly heterogeneous properties while sharing a common constructed vector. This ensures that one constructed vector is utilized across both heterogeneous update mechanisms. The two subswarms work within their respective channels during the evolutionary process, preventing interference between the two channels. The ABS strategy precisely controls the proportion of particles involved in the evolution in the two channels, and thereby guarantees the flexible utilization of the constructed vectors, based on the evolutionary process and the interactions with the problem's fitness landscape. Together, our architecture ensures the effective utilization of the constructed vectors by emphasizing exploration in the early evolutionary process while exploitation in the later, enhancing the performance of a series of modified cognitive-only PSOs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the generalization performance of our architecture.

Abstract: When regarding the suffering of others, we often experience personal distress and feel compelled to help. Inspired by living systems, we investigate the emergence of prosocial behavior among autonomous agents that are motivated by homeostatic self-regulation. We perform multi-agent reinforcement learning, treating each agent as a vulnerable homeostat charged with maintaining its own well-being. We introduce an empathy-like mechanism to share homeostatic states between agents: an agent can either \emph{observe} their partner's internal state (cognitive empathy) or the agent's internal state can be \emph{directly coupled} to that of their partner's (affective empathy). In three simple multi-agent environments, we show that prosocial behavior arises only under homeostatic coupling - when the distress of a partner can affect one's own well-being. Our findings specify the type and role of empathy in artificial agents capable of prosocial behavior.

                arXiv:2412.12484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML) have garnered significant attention, leading to substantial efforts toward the development of quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms to address a variety of complex challenges. The design of high-performance QML models, however, requires expert-level knowledge, posing a significant barrier to the widespread adoption of QML. Key challenges include the design of data encoding mechanisms and parameterized quantum circuits, both of which critically impact the generalization capabilities of QML models. We propose a novel method that encodes quantum circuit architecture information to enable the evolution of quantum circuit designs. In this approach, the fitness function is based on the effective dimension, allowing for the optimization of quantum circuits towards higher model capacity. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of discovering variational quantum circuit architectures that offer improved learning capabilities, thereby enhancing the overall performance of QML models for complex tasks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12790">Structural Cellular Hash Chemistry</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.12790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hash Chemistry, a minimalistic artificial chemistry model of open-ended evolution, has recently been extended to non-spatial and cellular versions. The non-spatial version successfully demonstrated continuous adaptation and unbounded growth of complexity of self-replicating entities, but it did not simulate multiscale ecological interactions among the entities. On the contrary, the cellular version explicitly represented multiscale spatial ecological interactions among evolving patterns, yet it failed to show meaningful adaptive evolution or complexity growth. It remains an open question whether it is possible to create a similar minimalistic evolutionary system that can exhibit all of those desired properties at once within a computationally efficient framework. Here we propose an improved version called Structural Cellular Hash Chemistry (SCHC). In SCHC, individual identities of evolving patterns are explicitly represented and processed as the connected components of the nearest neighbor graph of active cells. The neighborhood connections are established by connecting active cells with other active cells in their Moore neighborhoods in a 2D cellular grid. Evolutionary dynamics in SCHC are simulated via pairwise competitions of two randomly selected patterns, following the approach used in the non-spatial Hash Chemistry. SCHC's computational cost was significantly less than the original and non-spatial versions. Numerical simulations showed that these model modifications achieved spontaneous movement, self-replication and unbounded growth of complexity of spatial evolving patterns, which were clearly visible in space in a highly intuitive manner. Detailed analysis of simulation results showed that there were spatial ecological interactions among self-replicating patterns and their diversity was also substantially promoted in SCHC, neither of which was present in the non-spatial version.

                arXiv:2412.11112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The trade-offs between different mechanical properties of materials pose fundamental challenges in engineering material design, such as balancing stiffness versus toughness, weight versus energy-absorbing capacity, and among the various elastic coefficients. Although gradient-based topology optimization approaches have been effective in finding specific designs and properties, they are not efficient tools for surveying the vast design space of metamaterials, and thus unable to reveal the attainable bound of interdependent material properties. Other common methods, such as parametric design or data-driven approaches, are limited by either the lack of diversity in geometry or the difficulty to extrapolate from known data, respectively. In this work, we formulate the simultaneous exploration of multiple competing material properties as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem and employ a neuroevolution algorithm to efficiently solve it. The Compositional Pattern-Producing Networks (CPPNs) is used as the generative model for unit cell designs, which provide very compact yet lossless encoding of geometry. A modified Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm is employed to evolve the CPPNs such that they create metamaterial designs on the Pareto front of the MOO problem, revealing empirical bounds of different combinations of elastic properties. Looking ahead, our method serves as a universal framework for the computational discovery of diverse metamaterials across a range of fields, including robotics, biomedicine, thermal engineering, and photonics.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11684">Runtime Analysis for Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms in Unbounded Integer Spaces</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.11684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Randomized search heuristics have been applied successfully to a plethora of problems. This success is complemented by a large body of theoretical results. Unfortunately, the vast majority of these results regard problems with binary or continuous decision variables -- the theoretical analysis of randomized search heuristics for unbounded integer domains is almost nonexistent. To resolve this shortcoming, we start the runtime analysis of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, which are among the most successful randomized search heuristics, for unbounded integer search spaces. We analyze single- and full-dimensional mutation operators with three different mutation strengths, namely changes by plus/minus one (unit strength), random changes following a law with exponential tails, and random changes following a power-law. The performance guarantees we prove on a recently proposed natural benchmark problem suggest that unit mutation strengths can be slow when the initial solutions are far from the Pareto front. When setting the expected change right (depending on the benchmark parameter and the distance of the initial solutions), the mutation strength with exponential tails yields the best runtime guarantees in our results -- however, with a wrong choice of this expectation, the performance guarantees quickly become highly uninteresting. With power-law mutation, which is an essentially parameter-less mutation operator, we obtain good results uniformly over all problem parameters and starting points. We complement our mathematical findings with experimental results that suggest that our bounds are not always tight. Most prominently, our experiments indicate that power-law mutation outperforms the one with exponential tails even when the latter uses a near-optimal parametrization. Hence, we suggest to favor power-law mutation for unknown problems in integer spaces.

                arXiv:2412.11931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm~II (NSGA-II) is the most popular multi-objective optimization heuristic. Recent mathematical runtime analyses have detected two shortcomings in discrete search spaces, namely, that the NSGA-II has difficulties with more than two objectives and that it is very sensitive to the choice of the population size. To overcome these difficulties, we analyze a simple tie-breaking rule in the selection of the next population. Similar rules have been proposed before, but have found only little acceptance. We prove the effectiveness of our tie-breaking rule via mathematical runtime analyses on the classic OneMinMax, LeadingOnesTrailingZeros, and OneJumpZeroJump benchmarks. We prove that this modified NSGA-II can optimize the three benchmarks efficiently also for many objectives, in contrast to the exponential lower runtime bound previously shown for OneMinMax with three or more objectives. For the bi-objective problems, we show runtime guarantees that do not increase when moderately increasing the population size over the minimum admissible size. For example, for the OneJumpZeroJump problem with representation length $n$ and gap parameter $k$, we show a runtime guarantee of $O(\max\{n^{k+1},Nn\})$ function evaluations when the population size is at least four times the size of the Pareto front. For population sizes larger than the minimal choice $N = \Theta(n)$, this result improves considerably over the $\Theta(Nn^k)$ runtime of the classic NSGA-II.

                arXiv:2402.18393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous Driving System (ADS) testing is crucial in ADS development, with the current primary focus being on safety. However, the evaluation of non-safety-critical performance, particularly the ADS's ability to make optimal decisions and produce optimal paths for autonomous vehicles (AVs), is also vital to ensure the intelligence and reduce risks of AVs. Currently, there is little work dedicated to assessing the robustness of ADSs' path-planning decisions (PPDs), i.e., whether an ADS can maintain the optimal PPD after an insignificant change in the environment. The key challenges include the lack of clear oracles for assessing PPD optimality and the difficulty in searching for scenarios that lead to non-optimal PPDs. To fill this gap, in this paper, we focus on evaluating the robustness of ADSs' PPDs and propose the first method, Decictor, for generating non-optimal decision scenarios (NoDSs), where the ADS does not plan optimal paths for AVs. Decictor comprises three main components: Non-invasive Mutation, Consistency Check, and Feedback. To overcome the oracle challenge, Non-invasive Mutation is devised to implement conservative modifications, ensuring the preservation of the original optimal path in the mutated scenarios. Subsequently, the Consistency Check is applied to determine the presence of non-optimal PPDs by comparing the driving paths in the original and mutated scenarios. To deal with the challenge of large environment space, we design Feedback metrics that integrate spatial and temporal dimensions of the AV's movement. These metrics are crucial for effectively steering the generation of NoDSs. We evaluate Decictor on Baidu Apollo, an open-source and production-grade ADS. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of Decictor in detecting non-optimal PPDs of ADSs.

                <p>In an effort to increase access to neuroscience education in underserved communities, we created an educational program that utilizes a simple task to measure place preference of the cockroach (<I>Gromphadorhina portentosa</I>) and the open-source free software, SLEAP Estimates Animal Poses (SLEAP) to quantify behavior. Cockroaches (<I>n</I> = 18) were trained to explore a linear track for 2&nbsp;min while exposed to either air, vapor, or vapor with nicotine from a port on one side of the linear track over 14&nbsp;d. The time the animal took to reach the port was measured, along with distance traveled, time spent in each zone, and velocity. As characterizing behavior is challenging and inaccessible for nonexperts new to behavioral research, we created an educational program using the machine learning algorithm, SLEAP, and cloud-based (i.e., Google Colab) low-cost platforms for data analysis. We found that SLEAP was within a 0.5% margin of error when compared with manually scoring the data. Cockroaches were found to have an increased aversive response to vapor alone compared with those that only received air. Using SLEAP, we demonstrate that the <I>x</I>&ndash;<I>y</I> coordinate data can be further classified into behavior using dimensionality-reducing clustering methods. This suggests that the linear track can be used to examine nicotine preference for the cockroach, and SLEAP can provide a fast, efficient way to analyze animal behavior. Moreover, this educational program is available for free for students to learn a complex machine learning algorithm without expensive hardware to study animal behavior.</p>

                <p>Certain structural brain connections have been confirmed to influence sleep duration in children. However, the causal relationships between all brain regions and children's sleep duration remain unclear. A two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis was conducted using data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to examine the relationships between 206 structural connections and sleep duration in children. Sensitivity analyses were employed to validate the findings and assess the robustness of the causal inferences. Stronger connectivity from the left hemisphere (LH) control network to the accumbens (<I>&beta;</I> = &ndash;0.15; 95% CI = [&ndash;0.30, &ndash;2.88 <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> 10<sup>&ndash;3</sup>]; <I>p</I> = 0.05) and from the LH somatomotor network to the LH default network (<I>&beta;</I> = &ndash;0.18; 95% CI = [&ndash;0.34, &ndash;0.03]; <I>p</I> = 0.02) in white-matter structural connectivity (SC) were associated with shorter sleep durations. Conversely, increased white-matter SC from the LH dorsal attention network to the thalamus (<I>&beta;</I> = 0.14; 95% CI = [8.45 <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> 10<sup>&ndash;4</sup>, 0.27]; <I>p</I> = 0.05), from the right hemisphere (RH) control network to the thalamus (<I>&beta;</I> = 0.10; 95% CI = [0.01, 0.19]; <I>p</I> = 0.03), from the RH default network to the thalamus (<I>&beta;</I> = 0.08; 95% CI = [4.53 <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> 10<sup>&ndash;3</sup>, 0.16]; <I>p</I> = 0.04), from the RH limbic network to the thalamus (<I>&beta;</I> = 0.15; 95% CI = [0.05, 0.26]; <I>p</I> = 3.77 <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> 10<sup>&ndash;3</sup>), and from the RH somatomotor network to the thalamus (<I>&beta;</I> = 0.20; 95% CI = [0.07, 0.32]; <I>p</I> = 1.63 <FONT FACE="arial,helvetica">x</FONT> 10<sup>&ndash;3</sup>) correlated with longer sleep durations in children. Two-sample Mendelian randomization provides novel insights into the relationships between brain regions and sleep duration in children. Our findings demonstrate a causal relationship between specific brain areas and sleep duration.</p>

                Background Quality Education is one of the primary requirements for the best survival. Pursuing higher education in a highly reputed institutions makes much difference in shaping the career of the individual. As many ranking and accreditation boards for higher education institutions like NAAC is prevalent, World ranking distinguishes institution reputation globally. The QS World University Ranking is a vital gauge for learners, educators, and institutions all over the world, allowing them to analyze and compare the quality and reputation of higher education. Predicting these rankings is difficult due to data availability concerns and QS’s frequent methodology revisions. Subjectivity and narrow criteria in rankings hamper the assessment of university greatness even more. Machine learning, data scraping, model adaptability, algorithm reversal, and short-term predictions are some existing ways of dealing with these difficulties. In this research, a prediction model for assessing institution performance in the QS World institution Rankings is designed using hybrid machine learning algorithms and optimization techniques. Two algorithms surpass others in forecasting ranks, according to the analysis. These hybrid models improves prediction accuracy of QS world rankings by integrating data analysis with model optimization using particle swarm optimization and Tabu search method.

                Background Pedagogical best practices play a pivotal role in ensuring the academic success of students within the higher education landscape. This study aims to systematically synthesize innovative pedagogical best practices within the university context. Methods We conducted a thorough systematic review using the rigorous PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) methodology. Our review involved comprehensive searches of scientific databases, including Eric, Scopus, and Proquest, covering both Spanish and English publications. We strategically employed Boolean operators like AND and OR to create a robust search equation. Our primary research question guiding this investigation was: “What innovative pedagogical practices have been developed in university settings to improve teaching and learning effectiveness?” This central question led us to delve deeply into the strategies utilized, pedagogical approaches adopted, and the noticeable impact achieved after their implementation. Additionally, we carefully established stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria in accordance with PRISMA guidelines to ensure methodological rigor. Results A total of 25 scholarly articles that met the pre-established criteria were meticulously identified and included in this systematic review. The results were thoughtfully categorized into three distinct teaching strategies: the first emphasizing student-centered approaches, the second showcasing the integration of educational technology, and the third highlighting evaluation and feedback methodologies. Conclusions This systematic exploration of pedagogical best practices underscores their paramount importance in driving continuous improvement in teacher training and fostering innovation within the educational arena. Such practices not only create an engaging and effective learning environment but also set the stage for ongoing advancements in the teaching and learning processes.

                Introduction The profunda femoris artery (PFA) is the largest branch of the femoral artery supplying the thigh. The study reports a rare occurrence of bilateral double profunda artery in a male cadaver, aiming to inform surgeons of such variations to avoid complications during surgical interventions. Methods This study was conducted during routine dissections using 5-10% formalin-fixed lower limbs of a male cadaver at the Department of Anatomy, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, United Arab Emirates University, UAE Results In the right lower limb, two profunda femoris artery (PFA) branches arise from the common femoral artery (CFA) 5 cm from the inguinal ligament, one laterally and one posteromedially. The medial (MCFA) and lateral circumflex (LCFA) arteries branch from these PFAs respectively. The femoral nerve is anterior to the lateral PFA and LCFA and lateral to the posteromedial PFA. The obturator nerve runs posterior to the posteromedial PFA. In the left lower limb, two PFAs originate from the CFA, 2.5 and 5 cm from the inguinal ligament, lateral and posterior to the CFA, respectively. The LCFA stems from the upper PFA, while the medial MCFA arises from the CFA. The femoral nerve lies anterior to both the PFA and LCFA. The obturator nerve is posterior to the MCFA. The femoral vein crosses over the MCFA and the lower posterior PFA, distal to the MCFA origin. Conclusion This report enriches understanding of PFA anatomy and its variations, emphasizing the importance of tailored surgical approaches to minimize risks and ensure procedure success.

                Background Microbes living at extremes evolve unique survival strategies to adapt to challenging environmental conditions. Among these strategies is their distinctive metabolic potential and ability to produce specialized metabolites enabling them to compete for limited resources and defend against predators. These metabolites have significant potential in pharmaceutical and industrial applications, particularly in the development of drugs and biochemicals. Objectives This study aimed to investigate the culturable fungal communities associated with four desert plants and their surrounding soils in the Arabian Peninsula desert to identify their bioactive properties. Methods A total of 12 distinct fungal species were isolated from the plants and soils. Each plant hosted a unique set of fungi, demonstrating the diversity of desert-adapted fungal communities. Biological activities of the fungal extracts were evaluated through various assays, including antimicrobial, antifungal, anticancer, and antioxidant properties. Results Panicum turgidum harbors the most diverse fungal community, dominated by genera such as Mucor, Aspergillus, Colletotrichum, Alternaria, and Chaetomium. Aspergillus species comprise 33% of the total isolates, followed by Fusarium at 16%. All extracts exhibit diverse activities, with Aspergillus species demonstrating the highest antioxidant activities and total phenolic and flavonoid content. Fungi from P. turgidum, particularly Mucor sp., Aspergillus sp., and Curvularia sp., display potent activity against Staphylococcus aureus, while Mucor sp., Chaetomium sp., and Curvularia sp. exhibit moderate inhibition against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Conclusion This study highlights the importance of exploring extremophilic microorganisms, such as those found in desert ecosystems, as they offer a wealth of compounds that could address current challenges in drug discovery and biotechnology.

                <p>by Abel Bernadou, Raphaël Jeanson</p>

Social insects, such as ants and bees, are known for their highly efficient and structured colonies. Division of labour, in which each member of the colony has a specific role, is considered to be one major driver of their ecological success. However, empirical evidence has accumulated showing that many workers, sometimes more than half, remain idle in insect societies. Several hypotheses have been put forward to explain these patterns, but none provides a consensual explanation. Task specialisation exploits inter-individual variations, which are mainly influenced by genetic factors beyond the control of the colony. As a result, individuals may also differ in the efficiency with which they perform tasks. In this context, we aimed to test the hypothesis that colonies generate a large number of individuals in order to recruit only the most efficient to perform tasks, at the cost of producing and maintaining a fraction of workers that remain inactive. We developed a model to explore the conditions under which variations in the scaling of workers’ production and maintenance costs, along with activity costs, allow colonies to sustain a fraction of inactive workers. We sampled individual performances according to different random distributions in order to simulate the variability associated with worker efficiency. Our results show that the inactivity of part of the workforce can be beneficial for a wide range of parameters if it allows colonies to select the most efficient workers. In decentralised systems such as insect societies, we suggest that inactivity is a by-product of the random processes associated with the generation of individuals whose performance levels cannot be controlled.

                <p>by Masami Iwamoto, Satoko Hirabayashi, Noritoshi Atsumi</p>

Voluntary breathing (VB), short–term exercise (STE), and mental stress (MS) can modulate breathing rate (BR), heart rate (HR), and blood pressure (BP), thereby affecting human physical and mental state. While existing experimental studies have explored the relationship between VB, STE, or MS and BR, HR, and BP changes, their findings remain fragmented due to individual differences and challenges in simultaneous, BR, HR, and BP measurements. We propose a computational approach for in–silico simultaneous measurements of the physiological values by comprehensive prediction of the respiratory and circulatory system responses to VB, STE, or MS. Our integrated model combines a respiratory system with a circulatory model, leveraging actor–critic reinforcement learning to control respiratory muscles. We introduce specific parameters to account for involuntary or VB and hyperventilation induced by STE. We modeled mental stress as an electrical input to the amygdala based on prior studies indicating that stress leads to amygdala hyperactivity. Our predictions for breathing rate (BR), tidal volume, minute ventilation, HR, and BP are validated against literature data obtained during various conditions, including different VB patterns (ranging from 6 to 14 bpm), active or passive knee flexion STE, and MS load. The model demonstrates good agreement with experimental results and highlights its ability to explore the mechanism of individual differences. Our model predicts heart rate variability (HRV) indices of total power spectral density and the ellipse area of Poincaré plot. Notably, slow deep breathing at a BR of 6 bpm increases HRV indices, promoting relaxation and cognitive performance. Conversely, MS elevates BP but reduces HRV indices, indicating an unstable and risky state for mental and physical health. Overall, our proposed computational approach provides simultaneous and reasonable predictions of various physiological values, accounting for individual variations through specific parameters.

                <p>by Katherine Levandosky, Calina Copos</p>

Symmetry breaking, which is ubiquitous in biological cells, functionally enables directed cell movement and organized embryogenesis. Prior to movement, cells break symmetry to form a well-defined cell front and rear in a process called polarization. In developing and regenerating tissues, collective cell movement requires the coordination of the polarity of the migration machineries of neighboring cells. Though several works shed light on the molecular basis of polarity, fewer studies have focused on the regulation across the cell-cell junction required for collective polarization, thus limiting our ability to connect tissue-level dynamics to subcellular interactions. Here, we investigated how polarity signals are communicated from one cell to its neighbor to ensure coordinated front-to-rear symmetry breaking with the same orientation across the group. In a theoretical setting, we systematically searched a variety of intercellular interactions and identified that co-alignment arrangement of the polarity axes in groups of two and four cells can only be achieved with strong asymmetric regulation of Rho GTPases or enhanced assembly of complementary F-actin structures across the junction. Our results held if we further assumed the presence of an external stimulus, intrinsic cell-to-cell variability, or larger groups. The results underline the potential of using quantitative models to probe the molecular interactions required for macroscopic biological phenomena. Lastly, we posit that asymmetric regulation is achieved through junction proteins and predict that in the absence of cytoplasmic tails of such linker proteins, the likeliness of doublet co-polarity is greatly diminished.

Lipid metabolism is an essential component in reproductive physiology. While lipid mobilization has been implicated in the growth of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> malaria parasites in their <i>Anopheles</i> vectors, the role of this process in the reproductive biology of these mosquitoes remains elusive. Here, we show that impairing lipolysis in <i>Anopheles gambiae</i>, the major malaria vectors, leads to embryonic lethality. Embryos derived from females in which we silenced the triglyceride lipase Ag<i>TL2</i> or the lipid storage droplet Ag<i>LSD1</i> develop normally during early embryogenesis but fail to hatch due to severely impaired metabolism. Embryonic lethality is efficiently recapitulated by exposing adult females to broad-spectrum lipase inhibitors prior to blood feeding, unveiling lipolysis as a potential target for inducing mosquito sterility. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the importance of maternal lipid mobilization in embryonic health that may inform studies on human reproduction.

                <p>by Matthew L. Lawton, Melissa M. Inge, Benjamin C. Blum, Erika L. Smith-Mahoney, Dante Bolzan, Weiwei Lin, Christina McConney, Jacob Porter, Jarrod Moore, Ahmed Youssef, Yashasvi Tharani, Xaralabos Varelas, Gerald V. Denis, Wilson W.

Repeated antigen exposure leads to T-cell exhaustion, a transcriptionally and epigenetically distinct cellular state marked by loss of effector functions (e.g., cytotoxicity, cytokine production/release), up-regulation of inhibitory receptors (e.g., PD-1), and reduced proliferative capacity. Molecular pathways underlying T-cell exhaustion have been defined for CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, but which factors drive exhaustion in CD4+ T cells, that are also required for an effective immune response against a tumor or infection, remains unclear. Here, we utilize quantitative proteomic, phosphoproteomic, and metabolomic analyses to characterize the molecular basis of the dysfunctional cell state induced by chronic stimulation of CD4+ memory T cells. We identified a dynamic response encompassing both known and novel up-regulated cell surface receptors, as well as dozens of unexpected transcriptional regulators. Integrated causal network analysis of our combined data predicts the histone acetyltransferase p300 as a driver of aspects of this phenotype following chronic stimulation, which we confirmed via targeted small molecule inhibition. While our integrative analysis also revealed large-scale metabolic reprogramming, our independent investigation confirmed a global remodeling away from glycolysis to a dysfunctional fatty acid oxidation-based metabolism coincident with oxidative stress. Overall, these data provide both insights into the mechanistic basis of CD4+ T-cell exhaustion and serve as a valuable resource for future interventional studies aimed at modulating T-cell dysfunction.

                <p>by Scott W. Emmons</p>

Despite decades of research on the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> nervous system based on an anatomical description of synaptic connectivity, the circuits underlying behavior remain incompletely described and the functions of many neurons are still unknown. Updated and more complete chemical and gap junction connectomes of both adult sexes covering the entire animal including the muscle end organ have become available recently. Here, these are analyzed to gain insight into the overall structure of the connectivity network and to suggest functions of individual neuron classes. Modularity analysis divides the connectome graph into 10 communities that can be correlated with broad categories of behavior. A significant role of the body wall musculature end organ is emphasized as both a site of significant information convergence and as a source of sensory input in a feedback loop. Convergence of pathways for multisensory integration occurs throughout the network—most interneurons have similar indegrees and outdegrees and hence disperse information as much as they aggregate it. New insights include description of a set of high degree interneurons connected by many gap junctions running through the ventral cord that may represent a previously unrecognized locus of information processing. There is an apparent mechanosensory and proprioceptive field covering the entire body formed by connectivity of the many mechanosensory neurons of multiple types to 2 interneurons with output connections across the nervous system. Several additional significant, previously unrecognized circuits and pathways are uncovered, some involving unstudied neurons. The insights are valuable for guiding theoretical investigation of network properties as well as experimental studies of the functions of individual neurons, groups of neurons, and circuits.

                <p>by Gabriela Ribeiro, Ana B. Fernandes, Francisco P. M. Oliveira, João S. Duarte, Manuela Oliveira, Clotilde Limbert, Rui M. Costa, Durval C. Costa, Albino J. Oliveira-Maia</p>

Postingestive nutrient stimulation conditions food preferences through striatal dopamine and may be associated with blunted brain responses in obesity. In a cross-sectional study, we tested flavor-nutrient conditioning (FNC) with maltodextrin-enriched yogurt, with maltodextrin previously optimized for concentration and dextrose equivalents (<i>n</i> = 57), and to mask texture cues (<i>n</i> = 102). After conditioning, healthy volunteers (<i>n</i> = 52) increased preference for maltodextrin-paired (+102 kcal, CS<sup>+</sup>), relative to control (+1.8 kcal, CS<sup>-</sup>) flavors, as assessed according to intake, but not pleasantness. In a clinical study (<i>n</i> = 61), behavioral conditioning without effects on pleasantness was confirmed across pre-bariatric candidates with obesity, weight-stable post-surgery patients, and healthy controls, without significant differences between groups. Striatal dopamine D2-like receptor (DD2lR) availability, assessed with [<sup>123</sup>I]IBZM SPECT, was reduced in the obesity group and strongly correlated with conditioning strength and a measure of restrained eating in patients with gastric bypass. These results show that postingestive nutrient stimulation influences human food choices through behavioral reinforcement, and is conserved in obesity and after bariatric surgery.

Biogerontology research aims to explore the molecular basis of aging and discover new anti-aging therapeutic compounds or formulations to combat the detrimental effects of aging and promote a healthy life span. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been, and continues to be, an indispensable model organism in the field of biomedical research for discovering the molecular basis of aging S. cerevisiae has preserved nutritional signaling pathways (such as the target of rapamycin (TOR)-Sch9 and the Ras-AC-PKA (cAMP-dependent protein kinase) pathways, and shows two distinct aging paradigms chronological life span (CLS) and replicative life span (RLS). This review explores the anti-aging properties of natural products, predominantly derived from plants, and phytoextracts using S. cerevisiae as a model organism.

                Background Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is an important enzyme that metabolizes commonly used drugs, such as tramadol hydrochloride (a widely used opioid analgesic). Genetic polymorphisms of CYP2D6 have been shown to influence the pharmacodynamic properties of administered drugs. This study aimed to screen 63 postoperative patients (wild-type, CYP2D6*5, and CYP2D6 multiplication) of Minangkabau ethnicity in West Sumatera, Indonesia, who received tramadol using a modified long PCR method, and to investigate the clinical impact of tramadol on these patients. This study had a retrospective clinical trial registry number NCT06642480. Methods The Reported Long PCR was modified using different DNA polymerases, optimizing annealing, and the number of step PCR to detect wild-type, CYP2D6*5, and multiplication CYP2D6. To ensure accurate PCR, the size of the PCR product was monitored: wild-type (5kb), CYP2D6*5 (6kb), and CYP2D6 multiplication genotype (10 kb). The wild-type PCR product was used as the internal control. The method was applied to screen 63 postoperative patients of Minangkabau ethnicity who received tramadol. The clinical impact was investigated and analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a chi-square test. Result The Long PCR was successfully modified with a two-step PCR at 68°C °C as the annealing and extension temperatures. The screened genotype patients were dominated by the wild-type, followed by CYP2D6*5, and multiplication CYP2D6 with percentages of 89%, 6,3%, and 4,7% respectively. A total of 6.3% of CYP2D6*5 cases were classified as heterozygous and predicted as intermediate metabolizers. In addition, sex and age did not affect postoperative tramadol analgesia treatment, whereas weight had a significant impact (p=0.008). Conclusion The percentages of CYP2D6*5 and CYP2D6 multiplication genotypes were similar to those observed in another Asian population. Based on statistical analysis, tramadol was effective as an analgesic treatment for postoperative Minangkabau ethnicity patients with wild-type, CYP2D6*5, and multiple CYP2D6 genotypes. Further studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods are required to confirm these findings.

                Background Software Defect Prediction (SDP) enables developers to investigate unscrambled faults in the inaugural parts of the software progression mechanism. However, SDP faces the threat of high dimensionality. Feature selection (FS) selects the finest features while carefully discarding others. Several meta-heuristic algorithms, like Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, Differential Evolution, and Ant Colony Optimization, have been used to develop defect prediction models. However, these models have drawbacks like high cost, local optima trap, lower convergence rate, and higher parameter tuning. This study applies an innovative FS technique (FSCOA) rooted in Chernobyl Disaster Optimizer (CDO) technique. The proposed procedure intends to unwrap the best features for a prediction model while minimizing errors. Methods The proposed FSCOA investigated twelve public NASA software datasets from the PROMISE archive on Decision Tree, K-nearest neighbor, Naive Bayes, and Quantitative Discriminant Analysis classifiers. Furthermore, the accuracy of the recommended FSCOA method was correlated with existing FS techniques, like FSDE, FSPSO, FSACO, and FSGA. The statistical merit of the proposed measure was verified using Friedman and Holm tests. Results The experiment indicated that the proposed FSCOA approach bettered the accuracy in majority of the instances and achieved an average rank of 1.75 among other studied FS approaches while applying the Friedman test. Furthermore, the Holm test showed that the p-value was lower than or equivalent to the value of α/(A-i), except for the FSCOA and FSGA and FSCOA and FSACO models. Conclusion The results illustrated the supremacy of the prospective FSCOA procedure over extant FS techniques with higher accuracy in almost all cases due to its advantages like enhanced accuracy, the ability to deal with convoluted, high-magnitude datasets not grounded in local optima, and a faster convergence rate. These advantages empower the suggested FSCOA method to overcome the challenges of the other studied FS techniques.

                The giant striated muscle protein titin integrates into the developing sarcomere to form a stable myofilament system that is extended as myocytes fuse. The logistics underlying myofilament assembly and disassembly have started to emerge with the possibility to follow labeled sarcomere components. Here, we generated the mCherry knock-in at titin’s Z-disk to study skeletal muscle development and remodeling. We find titin’s integration into the sarcomere tightly regulated and its unexpected mobility facilitating a homogeneous distribution of titin after cell fusion – an integral part of syncytium formation and maturation of skeletal muscle. In adult mCherry-titin mice, treatment of muscle injury by implantation of titin-eGFP myoblasts reveals how myocytes integrate, fuse, and contribute to the continuous myofilament system across cell boundaries. Unlike in immature primary cells, titin proteins are retained at the proximal nucleus and do not diffuse across the whole syncytium with implications for future cell-based therapies of skeletal muscle disease.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89950">Midbrain encodes sound detection behavior without auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Hearing involves analyzing the physical attributes of sounds and integrating the results of this analysis with other sensory, cognitive, and motor variables in order to guide adaptive behavior. The auditory cortex is considered crucial for the integration of acoustic and contextual information and is thought to share the resulting representations with subcortical auditory structures via its vast descending projections. By imaging cellular activity in the corticorecipient shell of the inferior colliculus of mice engaged in a sound detection task, we show that the majority of neurons encode information beyond the physical attributes of the stimulus and that the animals’ behavior can be decoded from the activity of those neurons with a high degree of accuracy. Surprisingly, this was also the case in mice in which auditory cortical input to the midbrain had been removed by bilateral cortical lesions. This illustrates that subcortical auditory structures have access to a wealth of non-acoustic information and can, independently of the auditory cortex, carry much richer neural representations than previously thought.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99516">Restoring vestibular function during natural self-motion: Progress and challenges</a></h4>

              
                The vestibular system is integral to behavior; the loss of peripheral vestibular function leads to disabling consequences, such as blurred vision, dizziness, and unstable posture, severely limiting activities of daily living. Fortunately, the vestibular system’s well-defined peripheral structure and well-understood encoding strategies offer unique opportunities for developing sensory prostheses to restore vestibular function. While these devices show promising results in both animal models and implanted patients, substantial room for improvement remains. Research from an engineering perspective has largely focused on optimizing stimulation protocol to improve outcomes. However, this approach has often been pursued in isolation from research in neuroscience that has enriched our understanding of neural responses at the synaptic, cellular, and circuit levels. Accordingly, this review bridges the domains of neuroscience and engineering to consider recent progress and challenges in vestibular prosthesis development. We advocate for interdisciplinary approaches that leverage studies of neural circuits at the population level, especially in light of recent advancement in large-scale recording technology, to identify impediments still to overcome and to develop more naturalistic stimulation strategies. Fully integrating neuroscience and engineering in the context of prosthesis development will help advance the field forward and ultimately improve patient outcomes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88768">Statistical examination of shared loci in neuropsychiatric diseases using genome-wide association study summary statistics</a></h4>

              
                Continued methodological advances have enabled numerous statistical approaches for the analysis of summary statistics from genome-wide association studies. Genetic correlation analysis within specific regions enables a new strategy for identifying pleiotropy. Genomic regions with significant ‘local’ genetic correlations can be investigated further using state-of-the-art methodologies for statistical fine-mapping and variant colocalisation. We explored the utility of a genome-wide local genetic correlation analysis approach for identifying genetic overlaps between the candidate neuropsychiatric disorders, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson’s disease, and schizophrenia. The correlation analysis identified several associations between traits, the majority of which were loci in the human leukocyte antigen region. Colocalisation analysis suggested that disease-implicated variants in these loci often differ between traits and, in one locus, indicated a shared causal variant between ALS and AD. Our study identified candidate loci that might play a role in multiple neuropsychiatric diseases and suggested the role of distinct mechanisms across diseases despite shared loci. The fine-mapping and colocalisation analysis protocol designed for this study has been implemented in a flexible analysis pipeline that produces HTML reports and is available at: https://github.com/ThomasPSpargo/COLOC-reporter.

                We designed novel pre-drug compounds that transform into an active form that covalently modifies particular His residue in the active site, a difficult task to achieve, and applied to carbonic anhydrase (CAIX), a transmembrane protein, highly overexpressed in hypoxic solid tumors, important for cancer cell survival and proliferation because it acidifies tumor microenvironment helping invasion and metastases processes. The designed compounds have several functionalities: (1) primary sulfonamide group recognizing carbonic anhydrases (CA), (2) high-affinity moieties specifically recognizing CAIX among all CA isozymes, and (3) forming a covalent bond with the His64 residue. Such targeted covalent compounds possess both high initial affinity and selectivity for the disease target protein followed by complete irreversible inactivation of the protein via covalent modification. Our designed prodrug candidates bearing moderately active pre-vinylsulfone esters or weakly active carbamates optimized for mild covalent modification activity to avoid toxic non-specific modifications and selectively target CAIX. The lead inhibitors reached 2 pM affinity, the highest among known CAIX inhibitors. The strategy could be used for any disease drug target protein bearing a His residue in the vicinity of the active site.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100449">Control of 3′ splice site selection by the yeast splicing factor Fyv6</a></h4>

              
                Pre-mRNA splicing is catalyzed in two steps: 5ʹ splice site (SS) cleavage and exon ligation. A number of proteins transiently associate with spliceosomes to specifically impact these steps (first and second step factors). We recently identified Fyv6 (FAM192A in humans) as a second step factor in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>; however, we did not determine how widespread Fyv6’s impact is on the transcriptome. To answer this question, we have used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to analyze changes in splicing. These results show that loss of Fyv6 results in activation of non-consensus, branch point (BP) proximal 3ʹ SS transcriptome-wide. To identify the molecular basis of these observations, we determined a high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of a yeast product complex spliceosome containing Fyv6 at 2.3 Å. The structure reveals that Fyv6 is the only second step factor that contacts the Prp22 ATPase and that Fyv6 binding is mutually exclusive with that of the first step factor Yju2. We then use this structure to dissect Fyv6 functional domains and interpret results of a genetic screen for <i>fyv6Δ</i> suppressor mutations. The combined transcriptomic, structural, and genetic studies allow us to propose a model in which Yju2/Fyv6 exchange facilitates exon ligation and Fyv6 promotes usage of consensus, BP distal 3ʹ SS.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99341">Characterization of cancer-driving nucleotides (CDNs) across genes, cancer types, and patients</a></h4>

              
                A central goal of cancer genomics is to identify, in each patient, all the cancer-driving mutations. Among them, point mutations are referred to as cancer-driving nucleotides (CDNs), which recur in cancers. The companion study shows that the probability of <i>i</i> recurrent hits in <b>n</b> patients would decrease exponentially with <i>i</i>; hence, any mutation with <i>i</i> ≥ 3 hits in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database is a high-probability CDN. This study characterizes the 50–150 CDNs identifiable for each cancer type of TCGA (while anticipating 10 times more undiscovered ones) as follows: (i) CDNs tend to code for amino acids of divergent chemical properties. (ii) At the genic level, far more CDNs (more than fivefold) fall on noncanonical than canonical cancer-driving genes (CDGs). Most undiscovered CDNs are expected to be on unknown CDGs. (iii) CDNs tend to be more widely shared among cancer types than canonical CDGs, mainly because of the higher resolution at the nucleotide than the whole-gene level. (iv) Most important, among the 50–100 coding region mutations carried by a cancer patient, 5–8 CDNs are expected but only 0–2 CDNs have been identified at present. This low level of identification has hampered functional test and gene-targeted therapy. We show that, by expanding the sample size to 10<sup>5</sup>, most CDNs can be identified. Full CDN identification will then facilitate the design of patient-specific targeting against multiple CDN-harboring genes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97543">An improved bacterial single-cell RNA-seq reveals biofilm heterogeneity</a></h4>

              
                In contrast to mammalian cells, bacterial cells lack mRNA polyadenylated tails, presenting a hurdle in isolating mRNA amidst the prevalent rRNA during single-cell RNA-seq. This study introduces a novel method, ribosomal RNA-derived cDNA depletion (RiboD), seamlessly integrated into the PETRI-seq technique, yielding RiboD-PETRI. This innovative approach offers a cost-effective, equipment-free, and high-throughput solution for bacterial single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). By efficiently eliminating rRNA reads and substantially enhancing mRNA detection rates (up to 92%), our method enables precise exploration of bacterial population heterogeneity. Applying RiboD-PETRI to investigate biofilm heterogeneity, distinctive subpopulations marked by unique genes within biofilms were successfully identified. Notably, PdeI, a marker for the cell-surface attachment subpopulation, was observed to elevate cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) levels, promoting persister cell formation. Thus, we address a persistent challenge in bacterial single-cell RNA-seq regarding rRNA abundance, exemplifying the utility of this method in exploring biofilm heterogeneity. Our method effectively tackles a long-standing issue in bacterial scRNA-seq: the overwhelming abundance of rRNA. This advancement significantly enhances our ability to investigate the intricate heterogeneity within biofilms at unprecedented resolution.

                The enhancer-promoter looping model, in which enhancers activate their target genes via physical contact, has long dominated the field of gene regulation. However, the ubiquity of this model has been questioned due to evidence of alternative mechanisms and the lack of its systematic validation, primarily owing to the absence of suitable experimental techniques. In this study, we present a new MNase-based proximity ligation method called MChIP-C, allowing for the measurement of protein-mediated chromatin interactions at single-nucleosome resolution on a genome-wide scale. By applying MChIP-C to study H3K4me3 promoter-centered interactions in K562 cells, we found that it had greatly improved resolution and sensitivity compared to restriction endonuclease-based C-methods. This allowed us to identify EP300 histone acetyltransferase and the SWI/SNF remodeling complex as potential candidates for establishing and/or maintaining enhancer-promoter interactions. Finally, leveraging data from published CRISPRi screens, we found that most functionally verified enhancers do physically interact with their cognate promoters, supporting the enhancer-promoter looping model.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99340">The theory of massively repeated evolution and full identifications of cancer-driving nucleotides (CDNs)</a></h4>

              
                Tumorigenesis, like most complex genetic traits, is driven by the joint actions of many mutations. At the nucleotide level, such mutations are cancer-driving nucleotides (CDNs). The full sets of CDNs are necessary, and perhaps even sufficient, for the understanding and treatment of each cancer patient. Currently, only a small fraction of CDNs is known as most mutations accrued in tumors are not drivers. We now develop the theory of CDNs on the basis that cancer evolution is massively repeated in millions of individuals. Hence, any advantageous mutation should recur frequently and, conversely, any mutation that does not is either a passenger or deleterious mutation. In the TCGA cancer database (sample size <b>n</b>=300–1000), point mutations may recur in <i>i</i> out of <b>n</b> patients. This study explores a wide range of mutation characteristics to determine the limit of recurrences (<i>i<sup>*</sup></i>) driven solely by neutral evolution. Since no neutral mutation can reach <i>i<sup>*</sup></i>=3, all mutations recurring at <i>i</i>≥3 are CDNs. The theory shows the feasibility of identifying almost all CDNs if <b>n</b> increases to 100,000 for each cancer type. At present, only &lt;10% of CDNs have been identified. When the full sets of CDNs are identified, the evolutionary mechanism of tumorigenesis in each case can be known and, importantly, gene targeted therapy will be far more effective in treatment and robust against drug resistance.

">Differential temporal filtering in the fly optic lobe</a></h4>

              
                Visual interneurons come in many different flavors, representing luminance changes at one location as ON or OFF signals with different dynamics, ranging from purely sustained to sharply transient responses. While the functional relevance of this representation for subsequent computations like direction-selective motion detection is well understood, the mechanisms by which these differences in dynamics arise are unclear. Here, I study this question in the fly optic lobe. Taking advantage of the known connectome I simulate a network of five adjacent optical columns each comprising 65 different cell types. Each neuron is modeled as an electrically compact single compartment, conductance-based element that receives input from other neurons within its column and from its neighboring columns according to the intra- and inter-columnar connectivity matrix. The sign of the input is determined according to the known transmitter type of the presynaptic neuron and the receptor on the postsynaptic side. In addition, some of the neurons are given voltage-dependent conductances known from the fly transcriptome. As free parameters, each neuron has an input and an output gain, applied to all its input and output synapses, respectively. The parameters are adjusted such that the spatio-temporal receptive field properties of 13 out of the 65 simulated neurons match the experimentally determined ones as closely as possible. Despite the fact that all neurons have identical leak conductance and membrane capacitance, this procedure leads to a surprisingly good fit to the data, where specific neurons respond transiently while others respond in a sustained way to luminance changes. This fit critically depends on the presence of an H-current in some of the first-order interneurons, i.e., lamina cells L1 and L2: turning off the H-current eliminates the transient response nature of many neurons leaving only sustained responses in all of the examined interneurons. I conclude that the diverse dynamic response behavior of the columnar neurons in the fly optic lobe starts in the lamina and is created by their different intrinsic membrane properties. I predict that eliminating the hyperpolarization-activated current by RNAi should strongly affect the dynamics of many medulla neurons and, consequently, also higher-order functions depending on them like direction-selectivity in T4 and T5 neurons.

">G protein Inactivation as a Mechanism for Addiction Treatment</a></h4>

              
                The endogenous dynorphin/kappa opioid receptor (KOR) system in the brain mediates the dysphoric effects of stress, and KOR antagonists may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of drug addiction, depression, and psychosis. One class of KOR antagonists, the long-acting norBNI-like antagonists, have been suggested to act by causing KOR inactivation through a cJun-kinase mechanism rather than by competitive inhibition. In this study, we screened for other opioid ligands that might produce norBNI-like KOR inactivation and found that nalfurafine (a G-biased KOR agonist) and nalmefene (a KOR partial agonist) also produce long-lasting KOR inactivation. Neither nalfurafine nor nalmefene are completely selective KOR ligands, but KOR inactivation was observed at doses 10-100 fold lower than necessary for mu opioid receptor actions. Daily microdosing with nalfurafine or nalmefene blocked KORs responsible for antinociceptive effects, blocked KORs mediating stress-induced aversion, and mitigated the aversion during acute and protracted withdrawal in fentanyl-dependent mice. Both nalfurafine and nalmefene have long histories of safety and use in humans and could potentially be repurposed for the treatment of dynorphin-mediated stress disorders.

">Dimorphic Neural Network Architecture Prioritizes Sexual-related Behaviors in Male C.elegans</a></h4>

              
                Neural network architecture determines its functional output. However, the detailed mechanisms are not well characterized. In this study, we focused on the neural network architectures of male and hermaphrodite C. elegans and the association with sexually dimorphic behaviors. We applied graph theory and computational neuroscience methods to systematically discern the features of these two neural networks. Our findings revealed that a small percentage of sexual-specific neurons exerted dominance throughout the entire male neural network, suggesting male's prioritized sexual-related behavior outputs. Based on the structural and dynamical characteristics of two complete neural networks,sub-networks containing sex-specific neurons and their immediate neighbors, or sub-networks exclusively comprising sex-shared neurons, we predicted dimorphic behavioral outcomes for males and hermaphrodites. To verify the prediction, we performed behavioral and calcium imaging experiments and dissected a circuit that is specific for the increased spontaneous local search in males for mate-searching. Our research sheds light on the neural circuits that underlie sexually dimorphic behaviors in C. elegans, and provides significant insights into the inter connected relationship between network architecture and functional outcomes at the whole-brain level.

">Mechanisms of Alpha-Synuclein Seeded Aggregation in Neurons Revealed by Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging</a></h4>

              
                The brains of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients are characterized by the presence of Lewy body inclusions enriched with fibrillar forms of the presynaptic protein alpha-synuclein (aSyn). Despite related evidence that Lewy pathology spreads across different brain regions as the disease progresses, the underlying mechanism hence the fundamental cause of PD progression is unknown. The propagation of aSyn pathology is thought to potentially occur through the release of aSyn aggregates from diseased neurons, their uptake by neighboring healthy neurons via endocytosis, and subsequent seeding of native aSyn aggregation in the cytosol. A critical aspect of this process is believed to involve the escape of internalized aggregates from the endolysosomal compartment, though direct evidence of this mechanism in cultured neuron models remains lacking. In this study, we utilize a custom-built, time-gated fluorescence lifetime imaging microscope (FLIM) to investigate the progression of seeded aggregation over time in live cortical neurons. By establishing fluorescence lifetime sensitivity to aSyn aggregation level, we are able to monitor the protein's aggregation state. Through a FLIM analysis of neurons expressing aSyn-mVenus and exposed to aSyn preformed fibrils labeled with the acid-responsive dye pHrodo, we reveal the protein's aggregation state in both the cytosol and the endolysosomal compartment. The results indicate that aSyn seeds undergo partial disassembly prior to escaping the endocytic pathway, and that this escape is closely linked to the aggregation of cytosolic aSyn. In certain neurons, monomeric aSyn is found to translocate from the cytosol into the endolysosomal compartment, where it apparently forms aggregates in proximity to retained seeds. Additional analyses reveals zones of neuritic aSyn aggregates that overlaps with regions of microtubule disruption. Collectively, these findings enhance our understanding of aSyn pathology propagation in PD and other synucleinopathies, motivate additional experiments along these lines, and offer a path to guide the development of disease-modifying therapies.

">Mutation in Wdr45 leads to early motor dysfunction and widespread aberrant axon terminals in a beta-propeller protein associated neurodegeneration (BPAN) patient-inspired mouse model</a></h4>

              
                Beta-propeller Protein Associated Neurodegeneration (BPAN) is a devastating neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disease linked to variants in WDR45. Currently, there is no cure or disease altering treatment for this disease. This is, in part, due to a lack of insight into early phenotypes of BPAN progression and WDR45's role in establishing and maintaining neurological function. Here we generated and characterized a mouse model bearing a c52C>T BPAN patient variant in Wdr45. We show this mutation ablates WDR45 protein expression and alters autophagy in the brain. Behavioral analysis of these mice revealed characteristic signs of BPAN including cognitive impairment, hyperactivity, and motor decline. We show these behaviors coincide with widespread neuroinflammation and development of axonal spheroids in multiple neuron subclasses throughout the brain. Several lines of evidence suggest these spheroids arise from axon terminals. Transcriptomic analysis uncovered multiple disrupted pathways in the cortex including genes associated with synapses, neurites, endosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, and ferroptosis. This is supported by accumulation of the iron regulating transferrin receptor 1 (TFRC) and the endoplasmic reticulum resident calreticulin (CALR) in the cortex as these animals age. CALR forms spheroid structures similar to the axonal spheroids seen in these animals. Taken together, our data demonstrate that WDR45 is necessary for healthy brain function and maintenance of axon terminals. This model opens the door to therapeutics targeting BPAN and further exploration of the role of WDR45 in neuronal function.

">Optogenetic inhibition quenches the integration of sensory input in the cortex</a></h4>

              
                Significance: Many fundamental processes of brain computation, such as sensory perception and motor control, heavily rely on the mesoscopic dynamics of activity across the cerebral cortex. Manipulating mesoscale activity and observing its effects across multiple brain regions is crucial for understanding the causal link between cortical dynamics and behavior. Objective: The goal of this study was to develop a novel all-optical system that allows inhibition of excitatory neurons while simultaneously monitoring cortical responses at arbitrary sites across the entire dorsal cortex of mice. Methods: We combined wide-field imaging and optogenetics to create a mesoscale all-optical approach, enabling simultaneous monitoring and manipulation of cortical activity using light. Intravenous injection of two PHP.eB AAVs enabled the whole-brain co-expression of the red-shifted calcium indicator jRCaMP1b and the inhibitory actuator stGtACR2, with stable expression over several weeks. This system was calibrated, and the effects of inhibition on sensory responses were tested. Results: Increasing laser power progressively reduced spontaneous activity at the site of irradiation. A single 5-second pulse on the barrel field cortex significantly decreased the amplitude of sensory-evoked responses, not only in the stimulated region but across the entire stimulated hemisphere. Conclusions: This novel all-optical system enables targeted inhibition while concurrently monitoring mesoscale cortical activity. It provides insights into the dynamics of cortical circuits and offers a milestone for investigating the causal links between neuronal activity and behavior. Future research can use this tool to address sensory responsiveness impairments in neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.

">Reduced enteric BDNF-TrkB signaling drives glucocorticoid-mediated GI dysmotility</a></h4>

              
                Stress affects gastrointestinal (GI) function causing dysmotility, especially in disorders of gut-brain interactions (DGBI) patients. GI motility is regulated by the enteric nervous system (ENS), suggesting that stress alters ENS biology to cause dysmotility. While stress increases glucocorticoid levels through the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, how glucocorticoids affect GI motility is not known. Glucocorticoid signaling reduces expression of specific transcriptional isoforms of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the central nervous system, altering signaling through its receptor Tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) to cause behavioral defects. However, since the nature of ENS-specific Bdnf isoforms and their response to glucocorticoids remains unknown, we are limited in studying how stress impacts the ENS to cause dysmotility. Here, in male and female mice, we establish that stress-responsive Bdnf isoforms that are transcriptionally regulated at exons 4 and 6 represent >85% of all Bdnf isoforms in the post-natal ENS, and that Bdnf and Ntrk2 (TrkB) are expressed by enteric neurons. We further show using male mice dosed with a synthetic glucocorticoid receptor (GR) agonist dexamethasone (Dexa), that increased glucocorticoid signaling in ENS significantly reduces the expression of Bdnf transcripts and protein and that it significantly reduces GI motility. Finally, by using HIOC, a specific synthetic agonist of TrkB, we observe that HIOC treatment significantly improved GI motility of a cohort of Dexa-treated male mice, when compared to Dexa-treated and HIOC-untreated mice. Our results implicate BDNF- TrkB signaling in the etiology of stress-associated dysmotility and suggest that TrkB is a putative therapeutic target for dysmotility in DGBI patients.

">Periaqueductal gray passes over disappointment and signals continuity of remaining reward expectancy</a></h4>

              
                Disappointment is a vital factor in the learning and adjustment of strategies in reward-seeking behaviors. It helps them conserve energy in environments where rewards are scarce, while also increasing their chances of maximizing rewards by prompting them to escape to environments where richer rewards are anticipated (e.g., migration). However, another key factor in obtaining the reward is the ability to monitor the remaining possibilities of obtaining the outcome and to tolerate the disappointment in order to continue with subsequent actions. The periaqueductal gray (PAG) has been reported as one of the key brain regions in regulating negative emotions and escape behaviors in animals. The present study suggests that the PAG could also play a critical role in inhibiting escape behaviors and facilitating ongoing motivated behaviors to overcome disappointing events. We found that PAG activity is tonically suppressed by reward expectancy as animals engage in a task to acquire a reward outcome. This tonic suppression of PAG activity was sustained during a series of sequential task procedures as long as the expectancy of reward outcomes persisted. Notably, the tonic suppression of PAG activity showed a significant correlation with the persistence of animals' reward-seeking behavior while overcoming intermittent disappointing events. This finding highlights that the balance between distinct tonic signaling in the PAG, which signals remaining reward expectancy, and phasic signaling in the LHb, which signals disappointment, could play a crucial role in determining whether animals continue or discontinue reward-seeking behaviors when they encounter an unexpected negative event. This mechanism would be essential for animals to efficiently navigate complex environments with various reward volatilities and ultimately contributes to maximizing their reward acquisition.

">Psilocybin causes sex, time, and dose dependent alterations in brain signaling pathways</a></h4>

              
                Psilocybin is a psychedelic tryptamine that has emerged as a potential candidate for the treatment of a variety of conditions, including treatment resistant depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Clinical trials which have assessed the efficacy of psilocybin for these conditions report a rapid and sustained improvement in patient- and clinician-rated depression scores. The established mechanism of action for psychedelics such as psilocybin is agonism of the serotonin 2A receptor (5HT2AR), however, the downstream molecular processes mediating their therapeutic effects remain unknown. As high doses of psychedelics are known to induce strong perceptual alterations, an additional outstanding question is whether subperceptual doses induce similar molecular effects as psychoactive dosages. Here, we report the first analysis of dose- and sex-dependent transcriptional changes in forebrains of female and male mice at 3 timepoints (8 hours, 24 hours, and 7 days) following a single administration of psilocybin at low (0.25 mg/kg) or high (1 mg/kg) doses. Grouped analysis of both sexes reveals dose- and time-dependent transcriptomic alterations. We report more rapid transcriptional changes and attenuation of such changes in females following a single low-dose relative to males treated identically. Females also responded more robustly to high-dose administration relative to males at 8 and 24 hours, with signal attenuation in both sexes by 7 days. A notable observation was the persistent transcriptional effect of low-dose psilocybin at 7 days, which outlasted high-dose changes, and which suggests that low doses may have prolonged biological effects. A myriad of pathways were altered depending on sex and timepoint, but common features included functions related to neuronal differentiation, neurogenesis, and changes in receptor signaling. These data reveal dose- and sex-dependent molecular effects of psilocybin and support previous studies demonstrating its effect on dendritogenesis. Given ongoing clinical interest in psilocybin for treating mental health disorders, our results suggest that these sexually divergent changes should be considered when weighing treatment strategies. Additional consideration should be given to temporal effects of low vs high dosages on gene transcription, especially when timing psilocybin with adjuvant cognitive behavioral therapy.

                Intensity-based two-photon microscopy (2PM) is a cornerstone of biomedical research but lacks the ability to measure concentrations, a pivotal task for longitudinal studies and quantitative comparisons. Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (FLIM) based on Time-Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) can overcome those limits but suffers from "pile-up" distortions at high photon count rates, severely limiting acquisition speed. We introduce the "laser period blind time" (LPBT) method to correct pile-up distortions in photon counting electronics, enabling reliable low-cost TCSPC-FLIM at high count rates. The correction was implemented on low-cost hardware based on a field programable gate array (FPGA) and validated using a combination of in silico simulations and in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo measurements. The LBPT approach achieves <3% error in lifetime measurements at count rates more than ten times higher than traditional limits, allowing robust FLIM imaging of sub-second metabolite dynamics with subcellular resolution. Our work enables high-precision, cost-effective FLIM imaging at rates comparable to commercial systems and at a fraction of the cost, facilitating the adoption of FLIM across all areas of research needing affordable, quantitative live imaging solutions.

">Visual and vestibular processing of vertical motion: a psychophysical study</a></h4>

              
                The motion of objects and ourselves along the vertical is affected by gravitational acceleration. However, the visual system is poorly sensitive to accelerations, and the vestibular otoliths do not disassociate gravitational and inertial accelerations of ego-motion. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the brain resolves visual and vestibular ambiguities about vertical motion with internal models of gravity, which predict that downward motions are accelerated and upward motions are decelerated by gravity. In visual sessions, a target moved up or down while participants remained stationary. In vestibular sessions, participants were moved up or down, while they fixated an imaginary target moving along. In visual-vestibular sessions, participants were moved up or down while the visual target remained fixed. We found that downward motions of either the visual target or the participant were systematically perceived as lasting less than upward motions of the same duration, and vice-versa for the opposite direction of motion, consistent with the prior assumption that downward motion is accelerated and upward motion is decelerated by gravity. In visual-vestibular sessions, there was no significant difference in the average estimates of duration of downward and upward motion of the participant. However, there was large inter subject variability of these estimates.

">Integrating multi-system environmental factors to predict brain and behavior in adolescents</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Environmental factors have long been shown to influence brain structure and adolescent psychopathology. However, almost no research has included environmental factors spanning micro-to-macro-systems, brain structure, and psychopathology in an integrated framework. Here, we assessed the ways and degree to which multi-system environmental factors during late childhood predict subcortical volume and psychopathology during early adolescence. Method: We used the baseline and 2-year follow-up data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive DevelopmentSM Study (N = 2,766). A Bayesian latent profile analysis was applied to obtain distinct multi-system environmental profiles during late childhood. The profiles were used in a path analysis to predict their direct and indirect effects on subcortical volume and psychopathology during early adolescence. Results: Bayesian latent profile analysis revealed nine environmental profiles. Two distinct profiles predicted greater externalizing problems in adolescents: (i) adversity across, family, school, and neighborhood systems and (ii) family conflict and low school involvement. In contrast, a profile of family and neighborhood affluence predicted fewer externalizing difficulties. Further, family and neighborhood affluence predicted higher subcortical volume, which in turn, predicted fewer externalizing problems; whereas, family economic and neighborhood adversity predicted lower subcortical volume, which in turn, predicted greater externalizing difficulties. Conclusion: We captured direct and indirect influences of environmental factors across multiple systems on externalizing psychopathology. Specifying the equifinal pathways to externalizing psychopathology serves to provide an evidence base for establishing different types of interventions based on the needs and risk profiles of youth.

">Imaging the dancing brain: Decoding sensory, motor and social processes during dyadic dance</a></h4>

              
                Real-world social cognition requires processing and adapting to multiple dynamic information streams. Interpreting neural activity in such ecological conditions remains a key challenge for neuroscience. This study leverages advancements in de-noising techniques and multivariate modeling to extract interpretable EEG signals from pairs of participants engaged in spontaneous dyadic dance. Using multivariate temporal response functions (mTRFs), we investigated how music acoustics, self-generated kinematics, other-generated kinematics, and social coordination each uniquely contributed to EEG activity. Electromyogram recordings from ocular, face, and neck muscles were also modelled to control for muscle artifacts. The mTRFs effectively disentangled neural signals associated with four key processes: (I) auditory tracking of music, (II) control of self-generated movements, (III) visual monitoring of partner movements, and (IV) visual tracking of social coordination accuracy. We show that the first three neural signals are driven by event-related potentials: the P50-N100-P200 triggered by acoustic events, the central lateralized readiness potential triggered by movement initiation, and the occipital N170 triggered by movement observation. Notably, the (previously unknown) neural marker of social coordination encodes the spatiotemporal alignment between dancers, surpassing the encoding of self- or partner-related kinematics taken alone. This marker emerges when partners make visual contact, relies on visual cortical areas, and is specifically driven by movement observation rather than initiation. Using data-driven kinematic decomposition, we further show that vertical movements best drive observers' EEG activity. These findings highlight the potential of real-world neuroimaging, combined with multivariate modelling, to uncover the mechanisms underlying complex yet natural social behaviors.

">Centralized brain networks underlie body part coordination during grooming</a></h4>

              
                Animals must coordinate multiple body parts to perform important tasks such as grooming, or locomotion. How this movement synchronization is achieved by the nervous system remains largely unknown. Here, we uncover the neural basis of body part coordination during goal-directed antennal grooming in the fly, Drosophila melanogaster. We find that unilateral or bilateral grooming of one or both antenna, respectively, arises from synchronized movements of the head, antennae, and forelegs. Simulated replay of these body part kinematics in a biomechanical model shows that this coordination makes grooming more efficient by permitting unobstructed, forceful collisions between the foreleg tibiae and antennae. Movements of one body part do not require proprioceptive sensory feedback from the others: neither amputation of the forelegs or antennae, nor immobilization of the head prevented movements of the other unperturbed body parts. By constructing a comprehensive antennal grooming network from the fly brain connectome, we find that centralized interneurons and shared premotor neurons interconnect and thus likely synchronize neck, antennal, and foreleg motor networks. A simulated activation screen of neurons in this network reveals cell classes required for the coordination of antennal movements during unilateral grooming. These cells form two coupled circuit motifs that enable robust body part synchronization: a recurrent excitatory subnetwork that promotes contralateral antennal pitch and broadcast inhibition that suppresses ipsilateral antennal pitch. Similarly centralized controllers may enable the flexible co-recruitment of multiple body parts to subserve a variety of behaviors.

">Physiological activity within peripheral nerves influences neural output in response to electrical stimulation: an in vivo study</a></h4>

              
                Neuromodulation therapies are often applied to peripheral nerves. These nerves can have physiological activity that interacts with the activity evoked by electrical stimulation, potentially influencing targeted neural output and clinical outcomes. Our goal was to quantify changes in sensory neural unit activity in response to variations in electrical stimulation frequency and amplitude. In a feline model, we applied cutaneous brushing to evoke pudendal nerve afferent activity with and without electrical stimulation via a pudendal nerve cuff electrode. We recorded neural output with microelectrode arrays implanted in ipsilateral sacral dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Combined inter-spike interval distributions for all DRG units showed ranges of flattening, increases, and shifts in response to electrical stimulation. These distributions and changes within them due to electrical stimulation were largely driven by a select few units. Mixed-effects models revealed that quicker firing units generally decreased in firing rate in response to electrical stimulation and, conversely, slower firing units increased in firing rate. A unit's underlying firing rate also drove the magnitude of change in mean output firing rate in response to stimulation. Further, the models reported a small, negative correlation between the output mean unit firing rate and the applied electrical stimulation frequency. These results demonstrate the potential impact of electrical stimulation on underlying neural firing activity and output. Peripheral neuromodulation may normalize abnormal firing patterns in nerves contributing to pathological disorders or alter unrelated physiological activity in off-target neurons. These factors should be considered when selecting neuromodulation settings in animal subjects and human patients.

">Brain maps of general cognitive function and spatial correlations with neurobiological cortical profiles</a></h4>

              
                In this paper, we attempt to answer two questions: 1) which regions of the human brain, in terms of morphometry, are most strongly related to individual differences in domain-general cognitive functioning (g)? and 2) what are the underlying neurobiological properties of those regions? We meta-analyse vertex-wise g-cortical morphometry (volume, surface area, thickness, curvature and sulcal depth) associations using data from 3 cohorts: the UK Biobank (UKB), Generation Scotland (GenScot), and the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (LBC1936), with the meta-analytic N = 38,379 (age range = 44 to 84 years old). These g-morphometry associations vary in magnitude and direction across the cortex (|{beta}| range = -0.12 to 0.17 across morphometry measures) and show good cross-cohort agreement (mean spatial correlation r = 0.57, SD = 0.18). Then, to address (2), we bring together existing - and derive new - cortical maps of 33 neurobiological characteristics from multiple modalities (including neurotransmitter receptor densities, gene expression, functional connectivity, metabolism, and cytoarchitectural similarity). We discover that these 33 profiles spatially covary along four major dimensions of cortical organisation (accounting for 65.9% of the variance) and denote aspects of neurobiological scaffolding that underpin the spatial patterning of MRI-cognitive associations we observe (significant |r| range = 0.21 to 0.56). Alongside the cortical maps from these analyses, which we make openly accessible, we provide a compendium of cortex-wide and within-region spatial correlations among general and specific facets of brain cortical organisation and higher order cognitive functioning, which we hope will serve as a framework for analysing other aspects of behaviour-brain MRI associations.

">The resource elasticity of control</a></h4>

              
                The ability to determine how much the environment can be controlled through our actions has long been viewed as fundamental to adaptive behavior. While traditional accounts treat controllability as a fixed property of the environment, in the real-world this property often depends on the effort, time, and money that we are willing and able to invest. In such cases, controllability can be said to be elastic to invested resources. Here we propose that inferring this elasticity is essential for efficient resource allocation, and thus, elasticity misestimations result in maladaptive behavior. To test these hypotheses, we developed a novel treasure hunt game where participants encountered environments with varying degrees of controllability and elasticity. Across two pre-registered studies (N=514), we first demonstrate that people infer elasticity and adapt their resource allocation accordingly. We then present a computational model that explains how people make this inference, and identify individual elasticity biases that lead to suboptimal resource allocation. Finally, we show that overestimation of elasticity is associated with elevated psychopathology involving an impaired sense of control. These findings establish the elasticity of control as a distinct cognitive construct guiding adaptive behavior, and a computational marker for control-related maladaptive behavior.

">What makes human cortical pyramidal neurons functionally complex</a></h4>

              
                Humans exhibit unique cognitive abilities within the animal kingdom, but the neural mechanisms driving these advanced capabilities remain poorly understood. Human cortical neurons differ from those of other species, such as rodents, in both their morphological and physiological characteristics. Could the distinct properties of human cortical neurons help explain the superior cognitive capabilities of humans? Understanding this relationship requires a metric to quantify how neuronal properties contribute to the functional complexity of single neurons, yet no such standardized measure currently exists. Here, we propose the Functional Complexity Index (FCI), a generalized, deep learning-based framework to assess the input-output complexity of neurons. By comparing the FCI of cortical pyramidal neurons from different layers in rats and humans, we identified key morpho-electrical factors that underlie functional complexity. Human cortical pyramidal neurons were found to be significantly more functionally complex than their rat counterparts, primarily due to differences in dendritic membrane area and branching pattern, as well as density and nonlinearity of NMDA-mediated synaptic receptors. These findings reveal the structural-biophysical basis for the enhanced functional properties of human neurons.

">Non-Caloric Sweeteners combined with glucose affect hypothalamic glucose sensing-induced insulin secretion, food re-intake through neuronal cellular metabolism: An in vivo and in vitro approaches</a></h4>

              
                Changes in brain activity associated with deleterious metabolic effects of non-caloric sweeteners (NCS) have been demonstrated in humans, particularly when their intake is concomitant with that of glucose. Here, we have focused on hypothalamic glucose sensing in rats, detecting increases in circulating glucose levels and in turn triggering various physiological controls. The identification of sweet-taste receptors in the hypothalamus has suggested that they participate in glucosensing mechanism, but the existence of a dialogue between different pathways has never been studied. Here, we tested the acute effects of hypothalamic glucosensing combined with a NCS (sucralose or acesulfame potassium (aceK)), the latter binding only to sweet-taste receptors, without producing energy. Our working hypothesis was that the concomitance of two contradictory signals (energetic, sweet glucose vs. non-energetic, sweet NCS) could be responsible for deleterious physiological effects. After validation that sweet taste receptors and their signaling expressions were indeed present in the rat hypothalamus, insulin secretion induced by hypothalamic glucosensing (increased glucose level) in the presence of sucralose and aceK was examined. Insulin release was reduced compared to glucose alone, while the two NCS alone have no effect. Regarding the satiety-inducing effect of glucose, concomitant injection of each NCS with glucose produced the opposite effect to that observed with glucose alone, with food intake being increased, an effect also present with NCS injected alone. Using the GT1-7 hypothalamic cell line expressing sweet-taste receptors, we showed that the ATP concentration which normally increases with rising glucose levels was dose-dependently decreased in the presence of NCS, an effect which is inhibited in the presence of gurmarin, a specific inhibitor of sweet-taste receptors. The increase in ROS production in response to rising glucose levels was enhanced in the presence of NCS, an effect that was blocked in the presence of gurmarin. In both cases, NCS have an inhibitory effect on stimulated mitochondrial respiration. Taken together, these results suggest that NCS via sweet-taste receptors interfere with mitochondrial signaling and/or energy production during hypothalamic glucose sensing.

                Studying dynamic brain states has offered new insights into understanding functional connectivity. One of the promising approaches for estimating these brain states is the hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM). However, despite its potential, its adoption in the neuroscience community has been limited due to its complexity. We developed the Markov Inference Dynamic Mapping (MIND-Map) toolbox to overcome this limitation. This interactive user-friendly toolbox leverages HSMM to identify brain states, analyze their dynamics, and perform two-sample statistical comparisons of network dynamics. Furthermore, it introduces a new approach, not yet used in conjunction with these models, for determining the optimal number of states, addressing a key challenge in the field. We assessed the performance of the HSMM and our method for identifying the optimal number of states using two datasets, including a unique dataset explicitly developed for this purpose.

">Evidence for systematic - yet task- and motor-contingent - rhythmicity of auditory perceptual judgements</a></h4>

              
                Numerous studies advocate for a rhythmic mode of perception; however, the evidence in the context of auditory perception remains inconsistent. We propose that the divergent conclusions drawn from previous work stem from conceptual and methodological issues. These include ambiguous assumptions regarding the origin of perceptual rhythmicity, variations in listening tasks and attentional demands, differing analytical approaches, and the reliance on fixed participant samples for statistical testing. To systematically address these points, we conducted a series of experiments in which human participants performed auditory tasks involving monaural target sounds presented against binaural white noise backgrounds, while also recording eye movements. These experiments varied in whether stimuli were presented randomly or required motor initialization by the participant, the necessity of memory across trials and the manipulation of attentional demands across modalities. Our findings challenge the notion of universal rhythmicity in hearing, but support the existence of paradigm- and ear-specific fluctuations in perceptual sensitivity and response bias that emerge at multiple frequencies. Notably, the rhythmicity for sounds in the left and right ears appears to be largely independent among participants, and the strength of rhythmicity in behavioural data is linked to oculomotor activity and attentional requirements of the task. Overall, these results resolve conflicting conclusions drawn in previous work and provide specific avenues for further studies into the rhythmicity of auditory perception.

">Continuous Prediction of Mice Lever-Pressing Kinematic Parameters by Background Removed Single-photon Calcium Images</a></h4>

              
                Calcium imaging has gained extensive application in neural decoding tasks because of its high precision in observing cortical neural activity. Nevertheless, the immense data volume and complexity of automated signal extraction algorithms in calcium imaging result in significant delays in extracting neuronal calcium fluorescence signals, greatly constraining the efficiency of neural decoding research and its applicability in real-time tasks. Although a few studies have successfully used partial neuronal signals from calcium imaging data for real-time neural decoding and brain-computer interface tasks, they fail to leverage the complete neuronal dataset from experiments, which limits their ability to decode continuous and complex movements. In response to this challenge, we introduce a neural decoding method based on background-removed single-photon calcium images. This approach extracts three-dimensional spatiotemporal representations of neuronal activity via background removal and employs a decoder combining 3D-ResNet and RNN networks to enable continuous and rapid decoding of mouse lever-pressing kinematic parameters. Compared with traditional methods for neural decoding using single-photon calcium imaging, this approach offers higher accuracy and faster speed. Combined with real-time motion correction algorithms, the proposed neural decoding approach meets real-time decoding requirements at a 20Hz acquisition frame rate, achieving single decoding in just 21.8ms. This advancement significantly improves the efficiency of single-photon calcium imaging-based neural decoding, offering solutions for its application in real-time tasks, such as optical brain-computer interfaces.

">Dissociating Contributions of Theta and Alpha Oscillations from Aperiodic Neural Activity in Human Visual Working Memory</a></h4>

              
                While visual working memory (WM) is strongly associated with reductions in occipitoparietal 8-12 Hz alpha power, the role of 4-7 Hz frontal midline theta power is less clear, with both increases and decreases widely reported. Here, we test the hypothesis that this theta paradox can be explained by non-oscillatory, aperiodic neural activity dynamics. Because traditional time-frequency analyses of electroencephalopgraphy (EEG) data conflate oscillations and aperiodic activity, event-related changes in aperiodic activity can manifest as task-related changes in apparent oscillations, even when none are present. Reanalyzing EEG data from two visual WM experiments (n = 74), and leveraging spectral parameterization, we found systematic changes in aperiodic activity with WM load, and we replicated classic alpha, but not theta, oscillatory effects after controlling for aperiodic changes. Aperiodic activity decreased during WM retention, and further flattened over the occipitoparietal cortex with an increase in WM load. After controlling for these dynamics, aperiodic-adjusted alpha power decreased with increasing WM load. In contrast, aperiodic-adjusted theta power increased during WM retention, but because aperiodic activity reduces more, it falsely appears as though theta oscillatory power (e.g., bandpower) is reduced. Furthermore, only a minority of participants (31/74) had a detectable degree of theta oscillations. These results offer a potential resolution to the theta paradox where studies show contrasting power changes. We identify novel aperiodic dynamics during human visual WM that mask the potential role that neural oscillations play in cognition and behavior.

">Synchronous 3D patterning of diverse CNS progenitors generates motor neurons of broad axial identity</a></h4>

              
                In vitro human organoid models have become transformative tools for studying organogenesis, enabling the generation of spinal cord organoids (SCOs) that mimic aspects of spinal cord biology. However current models do not produce spinal motor neurons (spMNs) with a wide range of axial identities along spinal cord segments within a single structure, limiting their utility in understanding human neural axial specification and the selective vulnerability of spMN subpopulations in motor neuron diseases. Here we present a novel approach to enhance spMN axial heterogeneity in an advanced SCO model derived from neural stem cells (NSCs) and retinoic acid (RA)-primed neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs). RA priming guided NMP differentiation into caudal neural progenitors, generating SCOs enriched in spMNs with posterior axial identities. To further diversify spMN populations, we optimized differentiation by synchronously patterning NSCs with RA-primed NMPs. Incorporating an endothelial-like network and skeletal muscle cells enhanced the organoid physiological complexity and neural maturation and organoid cell viability. This comprehensive approach, termed CASCO, provides a robust platform to study human spMN specification and model neurodegenerative diseases.

">Estimates of quantal synaptic parameters in light of more complex vesicle pool models</a></h4>

              
                The subdivision of synaptic vesicles (SVs) into discrete pools is a leading concept of synaptic physiology. To better explain specific properties of transmission and plasticity, it has been suggested initially that the readily releasable pool (RRP) of SVs is subdivided into two parallel pools differing in their release probability. More recently, evidence was provided that sequential pools with a single RRP and a series-connected finite-size replacement pool (RP) inserted between the reserve pool (RSP) and RRP equally well or even better account for most aspects of transmission and plasticity. It was further suggest that a fraction of the presynaptic release sites (N) are initially unoccupied by SVs, with vesicle recruitment occurring rapidly during activity, and furthermore that the number of release sites itself changes with rapid dynamics during activity. Here we propose a framework that identifies specific signs of the presence of the series-connected RP, using a combination of two experimental electrophysiological standard methods, cumulative analysis (CumAna) and multiple probability fluctuation analysis (MPFA). In particular we show that if the y-intercept (y(0)) of CumAna is larger than N reported by MPFA (y(0) > NMPFA) this is a strong indication for a series-connected RP. This is due to the fact that y(0) reports the sum of RRP and RP. Our analysis further suggests that this result is not affected by unoccupied release sites, as such empty sites contribute to both estimates, y(0) and NMPFA. We discuss experimental findings and models in the recent literature in the light of our theoretical considerations.

">Neuroimmune mechanisms of a mouse model of chronic back pain</a></h4>

              
                Chronic back pain (CBP) is the leading cause of disability affecting 1 in 10 people worldwide. Symptoms are marked by persistent lower back pain, reduced mobility, and heightened cold sensitivity. Here, we utilize a mouse model of CBP induced by injecting urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), a proinflammatory agent in the fibrinolytic pathway, between the L2/L3 lumbar vertebrae. We identified neuroimmune interactions contributing to uPA-induced CBP (henceforth, uPA-CBP) in mouse dorsal root ganglia (DRG), where nociceptive neurons reside. Flow cytometric data reveal that uPA-CBP increases CD45+CD11b+ cells in the DRG, a population characteristically implicated in other chronic pain models. Blocking colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) signaling using PLX5622 partially reduced pain, suggesting CD45+CD11b+ macrophage involvement. Whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology data indicated DRG neuron hyperexcitability in CBP mice compared to controls. RNA sequencing revealed upregulation of pain- and inflammation-related genes involved in leukocyte migration. Together, these findings underscore the importance of the DRG neuroimmune axis in mediating chronic back pain.

">Natural speech re-synthesis from direct cortical recordings using a pre-trained encoder-decoder framework</a></h4>

              
                Reconstructing perceived speech stimuli from neural recordings is not only advancing the understanding of the neural coding underlying speech processing but also an important building block for brain-computer interfaces and neuroprosthetics. However, previous attempts to directly re-synthesize speech from neural decoding suffer from low re-synthesis quality. With the limited neural data and complex speech representation space, it is hard to build decoding model that directly map neural signal into high-fidelity speech. In this work, we proposed a pre-trained encoder-decoder framework to address these problems. We recorded high-density electrocorticography (ECoG) signals when participants listening to natural speech. We built a pre-trained speech re-synthesizing network that consists of a context-dependent speech encoding network and a generative adversarial network (GAN) for high-fidelity speech synthesis. This model was pre-trained on a large naturalistic speech corpus and can extract critical features for speech re-synthesize. We then built a light-weight neural decoding network that mapped the ECoG signal into the latent space of the pre-trained network, and used the GAN decoder to synthesize natural speech. Using only 20 minutes of intracranial neural data, our neural-driven speech re-synthesis model demonstrated promising performance, with phoneme error rate (PER) at 28.6%, and human listeners were able to recognize 71.6% of the words in the re-synthesized speech. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using pre-trained self-supervised model and feature alignment to build efficient neural-to-speech decoding model.

">A2A-positive neurons in the nucleus accumbens core regulate effort exertion</a></h4>

              
                Previous work has implicated the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in the regulation of effort, defined as the amount of work an animal is willing to perform for a given reward, but little is known about the specific contributions of neuronal populations within the NAc to effort regulation. In this study, we examined the contributions of direct pathway and indirect pathway neurons in the NAc core using an operant effort regulation task, in which the effort requirement is the number of lever presses needed for earning a food reward. Using optogenetics, we manipulated the activity of direct pathway spiny projection neurons (dSPNs, D1+) and indirect pathway SPNs (iSPNs, A2A+). Activating dSPNs reduced lever pressing regardless of the effort requirement, as it elicited gnawing, a competing consummatory behavior. On the other hand, activating iSPNs in the NAc core (but not in the shell) reduced lever pressing in an effort- dependent manner: stimulation inducted reduction in performance was greater at higher ratio requirements. In contrast, optogenetically inhibiting NAc core iSPN output resulted in increased effort exertion. Our results show that the indirect pathway output from the NAc core can bidirectionally regulate effort exertion.

">Time-Resolved Neural Oscillations Across Sleep Stages: Associations with Sleep Quality and Aging</a></h4>

              
                Sleep is a fundamental physiological process critical to cognitive function, memory consolidation, emotional regulation, and overall health. This study investigates the relationship between EEG spectral power dynamics and key sleep metrics, including percentage of N3, biological age, percentage of REM, and total sleep time (TST). Using high-resolution spectral analysis, we examine how power across multiple frequency bands (0.1 - 50 Hz) evolves temporally across sleep stages and influences sleep architecture. Our results reveal an inverse relationship between high-frequency power (sigma, beta, and gamma) during the N1 and N2 stages and the subsequent percentage of N3, suggesting that excessive low-frequency power in N2 may disrupt the smooth progression into deep sleep. Additionally, we identify a negative correlation between low delta power (0.1 - 0.5 Hz) during N2 and both percentages of N3 and TST, challenging traditional views on the role of delta activity in sleep regulation. These findings advance the understanding of how brain activity across frequencies modulates sleep depth and duration, with implications for addressing age-related sleep declines.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Previous studies have examined the role of working memory in cognitive tasks such as syntactic, semantic, and phonological processing, thereby contributing to our understanding of linguistic information management and retrieval. However, the real-time processing of phonological information&amp;amp;mdash;particularly in relation to suprasegmental features like tone, where its contour represents a time-varying signal&amp;amp;mdash;remains a relatively underexplored area within the framework of Information Processing Theory (IPT). This study aimed to address this gap by investigating the real-time processing of similar tonal information by native Cantonese speakers, thereby providing a deeper understanding of how IPT applies to auditory processing. Methods: Specifically, this study combined assessments of cognitive functions, an AX discrimination task, and electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate the discrimination results and real-time processing characteristics of native Macau Cantonese speakers perceiving three pairs of similar tones. Results: The behavioral results confirmed the completed merging of T2&amp;amp;ndash;T5 in Macau Cantonese, and the ongoing merging of T3&amp;amp;ndash;T6 and T4&amp;amp;ndash;T6, with perceptual merging rates of 45.46% and 27.28%, respectively. Mismatch negativity (MMN) results from the passive oddball experiment revealed distinct temporal processing patterns for the three tone pairs. Cognitive functions, particularly attention and working memory, significantly influenced tone discrimination, with more pronounced effects observed in the mean amplitude of MMN during T4&amp;amp;ndash;T6 discrimination. Differences in MMN peak latency between T3&amp;amp;ndash;T6 and T4&amp;amp;ndash;T6 further suggested the use of different perceptual strategies for these contour-related tones. Specifically, the T3&amp;amp;ndash;T6 pair can be perceived through early signal input, whereas the perception of T4&amp;amp;ndash;T6 relies on constant signal input. Conclusions: This distinction in cognitive resource allocation may explain the different merging rates of the two tone pairs. This study, by focusing on the perceptual difficulty of tone pairs and employing EEG techniques, revealed the temporal processing of similar tones by native speakers, providing new insights into tone phoneme processing and speech variation.</p>

	<p>Background: Many daily activities depend on visual inputs to improve motor accuracy and minimize errors. Reaching tasks present an ecological framework for examining these visuomotor interactions, but our comprehension of how different amounts of visual input affect motor outputs is still limited. The present study fills this gap, exploring how hand-related visual bias affects motor performance in a reaching task (to draw a line between two dots). Methods: Our setup allowed us to show and hide the visual feedback related to the hand position (cursor of a computer mouse), which was further disentangled from the visual input related to the task (tip of the line). Results: Data from 53 neurotypical participants indicated that, when the hand-related visual cue was visible and disentangled from the task-related visual cue, accommodating movements in response to spatial distortions were less accurate than when the visual cue was absent. Conclusions: We interpret these findings with reference to the concepts of motor affordance of visual cues, shifts between internally- and externally-oriented cognitive strategies to perform movements, and body-related reference frames.</p>

	<p>Background: Video games are no longer just entertainment; they are increasingly recognized for their potential to enhance cognitive abilities, including spatial cognition. This skill is vital in academic disciplines, where strong spatial reasoning is essential for problem-solving and success. Aims: This study investigates how video game engagement impacts self-reported spatial abilities in university students, focusing on the frequency, types, and duration of gaming. It also explores the contributions of specific video game genres and features to perceived cognitive improvements. Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 566 Saudi university students who completed an online questionnaire on their gaming habits and self-reported spatial abilities. Data were analyzed using independent sample t-tests and chi-square tests to assess the associations between video game behaviors and self-reported spatial cognition. Results: Frequent gamers (65% of participants) demonstrated significantly higher self-reported spatial abilities than infrequent gamers, particularly in adapting to spatial challenges (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Players engaged with action and open-world games reported the greatest perceived improvements in spatial cognition. No significant gender differences were observed, indicating that both males and females benefit equally from gaming. The use of perspective in games was notably linked to spatial skill enhancement (p = 0.05). Conclusions: Regular video game play, especially with spatially demanding genres, is associated with significant self-reported improvements in spatial abilities. These findings highlight the potential of video games as tools for enhancing self-reported spatial cognition in education and professional training, particularly in STEM fields.</p>

	<p>Background: This research project examining the moderating role of the Scout Movement in supporting mental health through the shaping of personal competence is based on Bandura&amp;amp;rsquo;s conception of social development (social cognitive theory) in terms of generating a sense of general self-efficacy. Methods: This research examined the moderating value of Scouting with regard to the connection between self-esteem and a sense of efficacy and styles of coping with stress in a group of 683 volunteers. Results: The results suggest that Scouting is a moderator of the relationship between the intensity of an emotion-focused stress coping style and a sense of self-efficacy&amp;amp;mdash;being a Scout intensifies the blocking effect of self-esteem on emotions in stressful situations, which can positively influence emotion regulation. Conclusions: The features described suggest the need to research Scouting as a non-formal education strategy to support the development of young people&amp;amp;rsquo;s mental health in different theoretical and methodological contexts. This work provides conclusions regarding understanding the role of Scouting as a moderator in coping with stress and, consequently, ensuring good mental health. It detailed the knowledge pertaining to specific mechanisms thanks to which Scouting can influence the development of emotional regulation and adaptive response to stressful situations.</p>

	<p>Background and Aims: Measuring stroke recovery poses a significant challenge, given the complexity of the recovery process. We aimed to identify a standardized and data-driven set of metrics of stroke rehabilitation in the literature that ensures the inclusion of all recovery domains and subdomains in the literature. Methods: A systematic review was conducted by four reviewers using the PRISMA guidelines on PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase for stroke recovery articles between 2004 and 2024. The inclusion criteria comprised experimental/observational studies, including ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. All studies had &amp;amp;ge;20 participants who were &amp;amp;ge;18 years of age, and had a follow-up of &amp;amp;ge;3 months. Outcomes included demographics, geographic origin, stroke mechanism, domains and subdomains, metrics used, and follow-up. A bias assessment was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool. This study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024551753). Results: Our search included 324 studies with a sample of 85,156 participants. The study identified seven domains (perception, physical and motor function (PF), speech and language (S&amp;amp;amp;L), cognition, activities of daily living (ADL), quality of life (QoL), and social interaction) and 96 constituent subdomains that encompass the complete landscape of the stroke recovery literature identified. The domains of PF and ADL constituted the vast share of the literature, albeit reducing in their relative representation over time, while domains such as perception and QoL have been increasingly studied since 2004. Using the domains, the study identified the set and frequency of all commonly used metrics to measure stroke recovery in the literature, of which the NIHSS (n = 72), BI (n = 55), and mRS (n = 51) were the most commonly used. We identified eighteen standard metrics that ensure the inclusion of all seven domains and 96 subdomains. Summary of Review and Conclusions: The identified set of domains and metrics within this study can help inform further clinical research and decision-making by providing a standardized set of metrics to be used for each domain. This approach ensures lesser represented domains and subdomains are also included during testing, providing a more complete view and measure of stroke recovery.</p>

	<p>Advancements in neuroimaging, particularly diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques and molecular imaging with positron emission tomography (PET), have significantly enhanced the early detection of biomarkers in neurodegenerative and neuro-ophthalmic disorders. These include Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease, multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody disease. This review highlights the transformative role of advanced diffusion MRI techniques&amp;amp;mdash;Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging and Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging&amp;amp;mdash;in identifying subtle microstructural changes in the brain and visual pathways that precede clinical symptoms. When integrated with artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, these techniques achieve unprecedented diagnostic precision, facilitating early detection of neurodegeneration and inflammation. Additionally, next-generation PET tracers targeting misfolded proteins, such as tau and alpha-synuclein, along with inflammatory markers, enhance the visualization and quantification of pathological processes in vivo. Deep learning models, including convolutional neural networks and multimodal transformers, further improve diagnostic accuracy by integrating multimodal imaging data and predicting disease progression. Despite challenges such as technical variability, data privacy concerns, and regulatory barriers, the potential of AI-enhanced neuroimaging to revolutionize early diagnosis and personalized treatment in neurodegenerative and neuro-ophthalmic disorders is immense. This review underscores the importance of ongoing efforts to validate, standardize, and implement these technologies to maximize their clinical impact.</p>

	<p>The concept of cognitive reserve (CR) has been a cornerstone in cognitive aging research, offering a framework to explain how life experiences like education, occupation, bilingualism, and physical exercise may buffer individuals from cognitive decline in the face of aging or neurological disease. However, this paper argues that the CR model, while influential, may have outlived its usefulness due to inherent limitations that constrain future research directions and unintentionally encourage &amp;amp;ldquo;magical thinking&amp;amp;rdquo;. Specifically, CR&amp;amp;rsquo;s definition, which relies on cognitive performance being &amp;amp;ldquo;better than expected&amp;amp;rdquo; based on known measures of brain structure and function, makes the concept temporally bound to current scientific understanding, potentially stifling novel insights into cognition. In contrast, we propose a shift to a cognitive capacity (CC) framework, which views cognitive performance as being always determined by the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s structural and functional capacities, without needing to invoke expectations based on incomplete knowledge. The CC framework is broader, encompassing factors that either promote or demote cognitive performance by directly modifying brain structure and function. This reconceptualization opens avenues for investigating cognitive enhancement not only in the context of aging or disease but also in young, healthy individuals. By emphasizing causal pathways between brain changes and cognitive outcomes, this perspective provides a more flexible and testable approach to understanding the mechanisms behind cognitive performance and its modulation across the lifespan.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Cardiac arrest may cause significant hypoxic&amp;amp;ndash;ischemic injury leading to coma, seizures, myoclonic jerks, or status epilepticus. Mortality is high, but accurate prognostication is challenging. A multimodal approach is employed, in which electroencephalography (EEG) forms a key part with several recognised patterns of prognostic significance. Methods: In this retrospective study, clinical and qualitative features of the EEG of patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at Kingston General Hospital following cardiac arrest from 2017 to 2020 were reviewed. The study included 81 adult patients (&amp;amp;ge;18 years). Outcome was assessed using the Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) as 1&amp;amp;ndash;2 (favourable) or 3&amp;amp;ndash;5 (unfavourable). EEG patterns were divided into groups within the highly malignant, malignant and benign patterns described in the literature. Results: There were a wide range of causes and 22% had a favourable outcome. Highly malignant, malignant and benign patterns were associated with survival in 0%, 70% and 100%, respectively, and favourable outcomes in 0%, 48% and 100%. All patients with seizures died, and 94% with myoclonus had unfavourable outcomes. In contrast, EEG reactivity and improvement on follow-up EEG were associated with a favourable outcome. Conclusions: Highly malignant EEG, seizures and myoclonus were associated with unfavourable outcomes, while patients with malignant EEG had better outcomes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-5/v2?src=rss">Conditioning factors for the scientific productivity of undergraduate students of health sciences at a private Peruvian University: A cross-sectional analytical study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background The objective of this study was to determine the conditioning factors for scientific research productivity in university students of health sciences. Scientific productivity, in addition to making visible the generation of new knowledge, contributes to the well-being of the population and provides feedback to the scientific community in terms of methodologies, perspectives and results that help to break down barriers that delimit productivity in scientific research. Methods A cross-sectional analytical observational study was conducted. The study population was 4104 students enrolled during the 2021-I semester in the Faculty of Health Sciences of a private Peruvian university. A sample size of 400 students was determined and a stratified probability sampling was used. The variables were measured through surveys. The dependent variable was scientific research productivity, and the independent variables were institutional culture, knowledge management and technological capital. Summary measures are reported according to the type of variable. The chi-square test with a significance level of p<0.05 was applied to assess the association between the variables of interest. A multiple logistic regression analysis was performed using the Stepwise method. Prevalence ratios (PR) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated. Results From the total of 400 students, 74.5% were male, 57.25% were aged between 18 and 27 years, 17% belonged to the school of human medicine and 72% were in their sixth year of studies. Scientific research productivity was associated with management commitment (PR=1.493; 95%CI: 1.077–2.068, p=0.015), sense of personal growth (PR=1.632; 95%CI: 1.041–2.558; p=0.024), recognition by the university (PR=1.385; 95%CI: 1.012–1.896; p=0.043), strategic alliances (PR=1.422; 95%CI: 1.032–1.959; p=0. 03), having research proposals (PR=1.522; 95%CI: 1.114–2.08; p=0.009), dissemination of results obtained (PR=1.542; 95%CI: 1.12–2.122; p=0.01), availability of human resources (PR=1.591; 95%CI: 1.165–2.173; p=0.004), access to equipment and software (PR=1.482; 95%CI: 1.061–2.069; p=0.018) and to laboratories (PR=1.438; 95%CI: 1.047–1.974; p=0.024). Conclusion It is concluded that the research productivity of undergraduate students of health sciences is low. It is imperative to strengthen the university research culture that empowers students as agents of change and strengthens faculty participation in scientific networks and communities.

                This study aims to evaluate the impact of big data analytics (BDA) on the performance of healthcare supply chain management (HCSCMP) by examining both overall efficiency improvements and identifying critical success factors for effective implementation. Through a systematic literature review, the research investigates how BDA enhances real-time decision-making within healthcare supply chains (HCSCs) and identifies the key enablers required for successful BDA adoption. A comprehensive search strategy was employed to analyze 65 papers, resulting in the inclusion of 39 studies published between 2016 and 2023. The review revealed a preference for literature reviews and questionnaires as the primary research methods. The findings indicate that BDA significantly improves HCSCs’ efficiency, particularly in real-time decision-making and operational management. However, successful BDA implementation depends on addressing critical enablers and overcoming associated challenges.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1523/v1?src=rss">Dengue infection during pregnancy and the occurrence of pathological neonatal outcome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Dengue infection during pregnancy increases the risk of maternal and neonatal complications; therefore, the objective of this research is to determine these outcomes and describe the clinical manifestations of the infection. Methods A systematic review of studies published in PubMed, MEDLINE, LILACS, Web of Science, Scopus and thesis repositories published between 2013 and October 2023 was performed. DeCS and MeSH dengue and maternal-neonatal outcome were used. Thirteen studies were selected and the New Castle-Ottawa scale was used to assess their quality. Mantel-Haenszel hazard ratios were calculated to report the overall effect size using random-effects models. All analyses were performed in Rev Man 5.4.1 Results The 13 studies involved a population of 18,724 pregnant women, with cohorts ranging from 25 to 17,673 pregnant women. The most frequent outcomes in the pregnant women were cesarean section and postpartum hemorrhage, and in the newborns, preterm delivery and low birth weight. According to the New Castle-Ottawa scale, six studies were considered low risk and seven studies moderate risk. Dengue is a risk factor for postpartum hemorrhage (OR: 2.24), premature rupture of membranes (OR: 1.04) and cesarean section (OR: 1.13). It could not be concluded that dengue is a risk factor for the neonatal outcomes studied. The clinical picture of pregnant women with dengue was predominantly fever, abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea, anemia, dyspnea and myalgia. Conclusions Pregnancy-related changes in the immune, cardiovascular and coagulation systems, among others, increase the probability of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes in case of DENV infection, such as postpartum hemorrhage, premature rupture of membranes, cesarean section, low birth weight and preterm delivery. Pregnant women should be considered a population at risk and should be included in dengue control, diagnosis and treatment policies.

                This paper explores the concept of α-ψ-ϕ  contractive mappings, contributing to the advancement of self-map extensions and fixed-point theorems within b-metric spaces. We introduce a new class of contractive mappings and demonstrate how they extend traditional contraction principles, offering a broader framework for analyzing fixed points in non-standard spaces. The main result of this study is a generalization of existing fixed-point theorems, supported by comprehensive corollaries, illustrative examples, and rigorous proofs. These findings provide deeper insights into the structure of b-metric spaces and open avenues for further applications in fields such as optimization and machine learning.

                Introduction Numerous studies have concluded that the functional ingredients benefit human health. Similarly, present times have seen exponential growth in functional food in bakery product segments like breads and biscuits. However, there is a lack of information on functional ingredients and their usefulness in developing functional bakery products. This bibliometric study addresses this gap by identifying the current research trends in functional ingredients. Objective To investigate current research trends on functional ingredients and their usefulness in developing functional biscuits. Method The study followed the “Scientific Procedures and Rationales for Systematic Literature Reviews” standards for retrieving literature. The study went through three major stages, “assembling,” “arranging,” and “assessing,” to retrieve 612 articles from the Scopus database from 2013 to 2023. Through further filtering, 395 articles were selected. Result The analysis was conducted using R Studio and VOS viewer. The performance analysis and science mapping tools were used to evaluate the articles. The results showed a 5.76% annual growth in publication trends. The most researched functional ingredients were antioxidants, bioactive compounds, and dietary fiber. The review summarized the most studied foods to develop functional biscuits and highlighted the most experimented technological advancements. Conclusion The study revealed the need for future research studies on functional ingredients with a focus on studying the technical implications of technical advancements in extracting functional ingredients from foods. The study highlights the significance of future studies based on the acceptance of functional biscuits and their sensory properties, focusing on the mass population. The study derives the possible applicability of functional ingredients in developing new formulations from publications and their usefulness in developing new formulations. This insight on the applicability of functional ingredients provides an opportunity for biscuit/cookie manufacturing to boost consumption among the population to a new ascending graph.

                Background Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurological condition that primarily affects older people. Currently available AD drugs are associated with side effects and there is a need to develop natural drugs from plants. Aquilaria is as an endangered medicinal plant genus (commonly called agarwood plants) and various products of Aquilaria plant spp. including resinous heartwood, leaves, bark, and stem have been widely used in various traditional medicine systems. Research on agarwood plants is sparse and only a few previous studies demonstrated their neuroprotective properties in vitro. Owing to the presence of a plethora of secondary metabolites in agarwood plants, it is imperative not only to protect these plants but also evaluate the bioactivity of agarwood phytochemicals. Methods This study used Molsoft tools to predict the physicochemical properties of agarwood ligands, including the number of H-bond donors and acceptors, polar surface area, lipophilicity, solubility, and the molecular polar surface area and volume of agarwood ligands. Additionally, ADMET (absorption, digestion, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) properties were predicted using ADMETlab 2.0. Computational methods such as AutoDock Vina and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were employed for the docking of 41 selected agarwood compounds with AD-related molecular targets. Results and Conclusion According to docking data, three compounds aquilarisin (ASN), aquilarisinin (ANN), aquilarixanthone (AXN) showed highest binding affinity to selected AD targets compared to their known inhibitors. MD simulation studies revealed that, selected agarwood compounds’ protein-ligand complexes showed remarkable structural stability throughout 100ns simulation. The agarwood chemicals aquilarisin, aquilarisinin, aquilarixanthone, pillion (PLN), and agarotetrol (AGT) are consequently suggested as some of the found hits against AD targets, however, additional experimental validation is required to establish their effectiveness.

                Background Yeast strains that are tolerant to several environmental stresses are extensively employed to produce bioethanol from sugar-rich feedstock. Bioethanol production efficiency in Metehara and Fincha Sugar Factories (the two major sugar factories in Ethiopia) is 50% lower than that of similar factories in other parts of the world. Methods In our previous research findings, five wild indigenous strains of multi-stress tolerance yeast were isolated from traditional fermented alcoholic beverages (Tella, Tej, and Areke) in Ethiopia to the purpose of evaluate their potential use for bioethanol using sugarcane molasses as a substrate. Result The optimal parameters for maximum ethanol production were pH of 4.5, 25°Brix, 30°C, 4.0 g/l ammonium sulfate, supplement with yeast extract, and 72 h of incubation period. Under these optimum conditions, 13.13 ± 0.08% (v/v) ethanol was obtained. The yield of hydrous and anhydrous bioethanol from fermented molasses samples were produced at 94.20–95.60% (v/v) and 99.05–99.56% (v/v), respectively. Conclusion According to this finding, Saccharomyces cerevisiae isolate MUT15, Saccharomyces cerevisiae isolate MUT18F, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae isolate R9MU strains have been good candidates for production of industrial bioethanol.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-710/v2?src=rss">Expert Consensus Methods In The Humanities: An Exploration of their Potential [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Despite the significant role of consensus and dissensus in knowledge production, formal approaches to consensus are notably less common in the humanities compared to their frequent application in natural, social, and life sciences. This article therefore explores the potential of expert consensus methods in humanities-related research. Methods In order to do so, an interdisciplinary team of both sciences researchers experienced in consensus methods and researchers familiar with the domain of the humanities and epistemology, conducted a literary review and exchanged their expertise in multiple brainstorm sessions. Results This resulted in the identification of six key elements of expert consensus methods. It also provided for an overview of different types of expert consensus methods that regularly used in the natural, social, and life sciences: Delphi studies, nominal groups, consensus conferences, and Glaser’s state of the art method and illustrative examples from both sciences and humanities-related studies. An overview of possible purposes for applying these methods is provided to identify the research contexts in which these methods have proven their value, which can be extrapolated to humanities related issues for which these methods seem promising. Conclusions The comparisons and categorisation show that, when focusing on the purposes, there seem to be humanities-related issues that may lend themselves better to structured expert consensus methods than their subject matter and research methods might suggest. When deliberately applied in context chosen by researchers with expertise in a specific humanities domain, expert consensus methods can accelerate epistemic process, enhance transparency, increase replicability, stimulate diversity, and encourage fair processes in humanities research and the application of its findings.

                Background Escherichia coli is a critical priority pathogen due to its significant morbidity, mortality, and growing antimicrobial resistance, underscoring the urgent need for novel control strategies. This bacterium is frequently implicated in outbreaks associated with horticultural products, particularly those cultivated in organic farming systems. The aim of this study was to isolate and evaluate the potential of a bacteriophage as a biocontrol agent against E. coli in compost and agricultural irrigation water. Methods E. coli presence in compost samples (n=17) was determined through microbiological assays, and the bacterial identity was confirmed by PCR amplification of the phoA gene. Antimicrobial resistance profiles of the isolates were assessed using the disk diffusion method. Bacteriophage isolation was conducted from livestock fecal samples using a double-layer agar technique. The stability of the bacteriophage under varying pH levels and temperatures was evaluated, along with its replication dynamics. Additionally, the phage’s efficacy in reducing E. coli populations in compost and irrigation water was assessed. Genomic sequencing and bioinformatic analyses of the bacteriophage were conducted to characterize its genetic profile. Results E. coli strains isolated exhibiting multidrug resistance were isolated from compost samples. The isolated bacteriophage, named Alux-21, exhibited stability at neutral pH and retained viability at both 4°C and 40°C over a six-month period. Importantly, the phage achieved a significant reduction of E. coli counts, exceeding 3.8 logs in compost and 3 logs in irrigation water, demonstrating its superior efficacy compared to previously reported phages in similar substrates. Genomic analysis confirmed the absence of virulence-associated, lysogeny, and antibiotic resistance genes. Conclusion The findings highlight Alux-21 as a sustainable biocontrol agent for E. coli in compost and irrigation water. Field validation will be crucial to establish its scalability and efficacy under real-world agricultural conditions.

                Background Ensuring comprehensive access to family planning improves gender equality, empowers women, and, eventually, reduces poverty. However, in the pastoralist community, women were rooted in strong cultural and religious perspectives that promoted many children, discouraged the use of FP, had high male dominance, and had limited control over their life, including the use of FP. Objective To explore the barriers to LARC utilization among pastoralist women in southern Ethiopia. Methods This study used a qualitative descriptive study design and included thirty-three pastoralist women for focus group discussions and twelve key informants for IDI, who were purposefully selected from three pastoral districts. The participants were interviewed and explored the primary barriers to using LARCs. The principal researcher led the interview via a semi structured interview guide that allowed for flexibility in exploring issues aided by audio tape. The approach included a broad inductive thematic analysis, with significant concepts derived from transcripts. Results In this study, there are many barriers to LARC utilization organized into five themes, including myths and misconception (perceived side effects, FP is not suitable for women who work intensively and carry heavy objects and travel long distances), the desire to have many children (children are wealth and Gods gifts), religious belief, distances of health facilities and husband objection. Conclusion and recommendations Information education communication should be provided to address myths and misconceptions about the LARC during the FP intervention for pastoralist women via HEW, HCP, media, and community education. There is a need to enhance social opportunities by involving religious leaders and partners in decision-making and providing health information and counseling to religious leaders and couples in the community through HEW. As myths and misconceptions about LARC use emanate from a variety of concerns, this study may not cover all of them; therefore, future research is needed to investigate additional myths and misconceptions concerning contraception use.

                <p>by Thiago Ohno Bezerra, Antonio C. Roque</p>

Astrocytes respond to neurotransmitters by increasing their intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals). While glutamate released by neurons trigger Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals through IP<sub>3</sub>- and glutamate transporter-dependent mechanisms, dopamine released in distant sites activates astrocytes via dopaminergic receptors. However, little is known about the modulatory effects of dopamine on glutamate-evoked astrocytic activity. To investigate this question, we developed multi-compartment, conductance-based astrocyte models with three distinct morphologies: unipolar; bipolar; and bifurcated-terminal. Glutamate induced localized responses, while dopamine activated all compartments. In the unipolar model, global dopaminergic stimulation reduced the threshold frequency of glutamatergic stimulation required to activate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. Phase-plane analysis of a simplified version of this model revealed that Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are influenced by compartment radius and neurotransmitter type. Morphology significantly influenced glutamate-dopamine interactions. In the bipolar model, glutamatergic stimulation in one process minimally affected the other. Conversely, in the bifurcated-terminal model, where a single process bifurcates into two secondary processes, high-frequency glutamatergic stimulation in one secondary process evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in the other. Dopamine further facilitated this latter cross-process interaction by lowering the glutamatergic stimulation frequency needed to elicit Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in the adjacent secondary process. These findings suggest that dopamine enhances the initiation and propagation of glutamate-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, with the extent of propagation depending on astrocytic morphology and the spatial distribution of glutamatergic inputs.

                <p>by Moritz Grosse-Wentrup, Akshey Kumar, Anja Meunier, Manuel Zimmer</p>

Explaining how neuronal activity gives rise to cognition arguably remains the most significant challenge in cognitive neuroscience. We introduce neuro-cognitive multilevel causal modeling (NC-MCM), a framework that bridges the explanatory gap between neuronal activity and cognition by construing cognitive states as (behaviorally and dynamically) causally consistent abstractions of neuronal states. Multilevel causal modeling allows us to interchangeably reason about the neuronal- and cognitive causes of behavior while maintaining a physicalist (in contrast to a strong dualist) position. We introduce an algorithm for learning cognitive-level causal models from neuronal activation patterns and demonstrate its ability to learn cognitive states of the nematode <i>C. elegans</i> from calcium imaging data. We show that the cognitive-level model of the NC-MCM framework provides a concise representation of the neuronal manifold of <i>C. elegans</i> and its relation to behavior as a graph, which, in contrast to other neuronal manifold learning algorithms, supports causal reasoning. We conclude the article by arguing that the ability of the NC-MCM framework to learn causally interpretable abstractions of neuronal dynamics and their relation to behavior in a purely data-driven fashion is essential for understanding biological systems whose complexity prohibits the development of hand-crafted computational models.

In the realm of infectious disease control, accurate modeling of the transmission dynamics is pivotal. As human mobility and commuting patterns are key components of communicable disease spread, we introduce a novel travel time aware metapopulation model. Our model aims to enhance estimations of disease transmission. By providing more reliable assessments on the efficacy of interventions, curtailing personal rights or human mobility behavior through interventions can be minimized. The proposed model is an advancement over traditional compartmental models, integrating explicit transmission on travel and commute, a factor available in agent-based models but often neglected with metapopulation models. Our approach employs a multi-edge graph ODE-based (Graph-ODE) model, which represents the intricate interplay between mobility and disease spread. This granular modeling is particularly important when assessing the dynamics in densely connected urban areas or when heterogeneous structures across entire countries have to be assessed. The given approach can be coupled with any kind of ODE-based model. In addition, we propose a novel multi-layer waning immunity model that integrates waning of different paces for protection against mild and severe courses of the disease. As this is of particular interest for late-phase epidemic or endemic scenarios, we consider the late-phase of SARS-CoV-2 in Germany. The results of this work show that accounting for resolved mobility significantly influences the pattern of outbreaks. The improved model provides a refined tool for predicting outbreak trajectories and evaluating intervention strategies in relation to mobility by allowing us to assess the transmission that result on traveling. The insights derived from this model can serve as a basis for decisions on the implementation or suspension of interventions, such as mandatory masks on public transportation. Eventually, our model contributes to maintaining mobility as a social good while reducing exuberant disease dynamics potentially driven by travel activities.

                <p>by Siwen Zhao, Xuguang Jiang, Ning Li, Tao Wang</p>

Phospholipids are critical building blocks of mitochondria, and proper mitochondrial function and architecture rely on phospholipids that are primarily transported from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Here, we show that mitochondrial form and function rely on synthesis of phosphatidylserine (PS) in the ER through phosphatidylserine synthase (PSS), trafficking of PS from ER to mitochondria (and within mitochondria), and the conversion of PS to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) by phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (PISD) in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM). Using a forward genetic screen in <i>Drosophila</i>, we found that Slowmo (SLMO) specifically transfers PS from the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) to the IMM within the inner boundary membrane (IBM) domain. Thus, SLMO is required for shaping mitochondrial morphology, but its putative conserved binding partner, dTRIAP, is not. Importantly, SLMO’s role in maintaining mitochondrial morphology is conserved in humans via the SLMO2 protein and is independent of mitochondrial dynamics. Our results highlight the importance of a conserved PSS-SLMO-PISD pathway in maintaining the structure and function of mitochondria.

                Abstract Background Gastric metastasis from melanoma is rare and often presents as an unexpected finding, rarely revealing an underlying primary skin melanoma. Case presentation We report a case of a 62-year-old male who presented with abdominal pain, dyspepsia, anorexia, and weight loss. On physical examination abdominal masses and hepatomegaly were detected. Radiological imaging showed widespread masses in the abdominal and thoracic regions. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy identified an umbilicated protruded lesion with central dark pigmentation at the antro-fundic junction. Histopathological examination and immunohistochemical staining were consistent with melanoma. A subsequent rigorous skin examination uncovered a primary malignant skin melanoma. Due to worsening general condition, the patient received palliative hospice care. Conclusion This report highlights the critical need for vigilant skin examination when encountering gastric lesions with dark pigmentation, which led to the identification of initially undetected cutaneous melanoma.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) paired with rehabilitation therapy improved motor status compared to rehabilitation alone in the phase III VNS-REHAB stroke trial, but treatment response was variable and not associated with any clinical measures acquired at baseline, such as age or side of paresis. We hypothesized that neuroimaging measures would be associated with treatment-related gains, examining performance of regional injury measures versus global brain health measures in parallel with clinical measures.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans in the VNS-REHAB trial were used to derive regional injury measures (extent of injury to corticospinal tract, the primary regional measure; plus extent of injury to precentral gyrus and postcentral gyrus; lesion volume; and lesion topography) and global brain health measures (degree of white matter hyperintensities, the primary global brain measure; plus volumes of cerebrospinal fluid, cortical gray matter, white matter, each thalamus, and total brain). Eight clinical measures assessed at baseline were also evaluated (treatment group, age, race, gender, paretic side, pre-stroke dominant hand, time since stroke, and baseline Fugl-Meyer upper extremity score). Bivariate analyses compared each measure with the primary trial end point (change in Fugl-Meyer upper extremity score from baseline to end of 6 weeks of treatment) across all subjects, with secondary analyses examining trial groups separately.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>MRIs were available from 80 patients (age = 59.8 ± 9.5 years, 29 women). Across all patients, less white matter hyperintensities (<i>r</i> = −0.25, <i>p</i> = 0.028) at baseline was associated with larger Fugl-Meyer score change. In the VNS group, less white matter hyperintensities (<i>r</i> = −0.37, <i>p</i> = 0.018) and larger ipsilesional thalamus volume (<i>r</i> = 0.33, <i>p</i> = 0.046) were each associated with larger Fugl-Meyer score change. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) analyses tested the interaction that each baseline measure had with treatment group and found that the model examining white matter hyperintensities had a significant interaction term, indicating 2.3 less change in Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity (FM-UE) points in the VNS group relative to the control group for each point increase in modified Fazekas scale.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Neuroimaging measures are associated with extent of gains on the primary endpoint of a phase III stroke recovery trial. Among the neuroimaging measures examined, a measure of global brain health (extent of white matter hyperintensities) was better at explaining the change in arm impairment as compared with measures of regional injury; this was true when examining all study subjects as well as only those in the VNS group and is consistent with the global mechanism of action that VNS has throughout the cerebrum. Future studies can evaluate additional measures that further predict response to VNS therapy. The current findings suggest that individual patient neuroimaging results may be useful for a personalized medicine approach to stroke recovery therapeutics. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

<p>Because imagination activates the same neural circuits used in understanding the present, one can access that imagination even in non-linguistic animals through decoding techniques applied to large neural ensembles. This personal retrospective traces the history of the initial discovery that hippocampal theta sequences sweep forward to goals during moments of deliberation and discusses the history that was necessary to put ourselves in the position to recognize this signal. It also discusses how that discovery fits into the larger picture of hippocampal function and the concept of cognition as computation.</p>

                This study demonstrates that hippocampal activity during remote recall is crucial for the reconsolidation of remote memory, also called systems reconsolidation, with new hippocampal engram cells recruited to enable memory updating. The findings reveal that adult neurogenesis supports this recruitment process and the role of mPFC projections to the hippocampus and amygdala in systems reconsolidation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96566">Homeostatic synaptic normalization optimizes learning in network models of neural population codes</a></h4>

              
                Studying and understanding the code of large neural populations hinge on accurate statistical models of population activity. A novel class of models, based on learning to weigh sparse nonlinear Random Projections (RP) of the population, has demonstrated high accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. Importantly, these RP models have a clear and biologically plausible implementation as shallow neural networks. We present a new class of RP models that are learned by optimizing the randomly selected sparse projections themselves. This ‘reshaping’ of projections is akin to changing synaptic connections in just one layer of the corresponding neural circuit model. We show that Reshaped RP models are more accurate and efficient than the standard RP models in recapitulating the code of tens of cortical neurons from behaving monkeys. Incorporating more biological features and utilizing synaptic normalization in the learning process, results in accurate models that are more efficient. Remarkably, these models exhibit homeostasis in firing rates and total synaptic weights of projection neurons. We further show that these sparse homeostatic reshaped RP models outperform fully connected neural network models. Thus, our new scalable, efficient, and highly accurate population code models are not only biologically plausible but are actually optimized due to their biological features. These findings suggest a dual functional role of synaptic normalization in neural circuits: maintaining spiking and synaptic homeostasis while concurrently optimizing network performance and efficiency in encoding information and learning.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95296">Livestock abortion surveillance in Tanzania reveals disease priorities and importance of timely collection of vaginal swab samples for attribution</a></h4>

              
                Lack of data on the aetiology of livestock diseases constrains effective interventions to improve livelihoods, food security and public health. Livestock abortion is an important disease syndrome affecting productivity and public health. Several pathogens are associated with livestock abortions but across Africa surveillance data rarely include information from abortions, little is known about aetiology and impacts, and data are not available to inform interventions. This paper describes outcomes from a surveillance platform established in Tanzania spanning pastoral, agropastoral and smallholder systems to investigate causes and impacts of livestock abortion. Abortion events were reported by farmers to livestock field officers (LFO) and on to investigation teams. Events were included if the research team or LFO could attend within 72 hr. If so, samples and questionnaire data were collected to investigate (a) determinants of attribution; (b) patterns of events, including species and breed, previous abortion history, and seasonality; (c) determinants of reporting, investigation and attribution; (d) cases involving zoonotic pathogens. Between 2017–2019, 215 events in cattle (n=71), sheep (n=44), and goats (n=100) were investigated. Attribution, achieved for 19.5% of cases, was significantly affected by delays in obtaining samples. Histopathology proved less useful than PCR due to rapid deterioration of samples. Vaginal swabs provided practical and sensitive material for pathogen detection. Livestock abortion surveillance, even at a small scale, can generate valuable information on causes of disease outbreaks, reproductive losses and can identify pathogens not easily captured through other forms of livestock disease surveillance. This study demonstrated the feasibility of establishing a surveillance system, achieved through engagement of community-based field officers, establishment of practical sample collection and application of molecular diagnostic platforms.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99914">Biochemical and neurophysiological effects of deficiency of the mitochondrial import protein TIMM50</a></h4>

              
                TIMM50, an essential TIM23 complex subunit, is suggested to facilitate the import of ~60% of the mitochondrial proteome. In this study, we characterized a <i>TIMM50</i> disease-causing mutation in human fibroblasts and noted significant decreases in TIM23 core protein levels (TIMM50, TIMM17A/B, and TIMM23). Strikingly, TIMM50 deficiency had no impact on the steady-state levels of most of its putative substrates, suggesting that even low levels of a functional TIM23 complex are sufficient to maintain the majority of TIM23 complex-dependent mitochondrial proteome. As TIMM50 mutations have been linked to severe neurological phenotypes, we aimed to characterize TIMM50 defects in manipulated mammalian neurons. TIMM50 knockdown in mouse neurons had a minor effect on the steady state level of most of the mitochondrial proteome, supporting the results observed in patient fibroblasts. Amongst the few affected TIM23 substrates, a decrease in the steady state level of components of the intricate oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial ribosome complexes was evident. This led to declined respiration rates in fibroblasts and neurons, reduced cellular ATP levels, and defective mitochondrial trafficking in neuronal processes, possibly contributing to the developmental defects observed in patients with TIMM50 disease. Finally, increased electrical activity was observed in TIMM50 deficient mice neuronal cells, which correlated with reduced levels of KCNJ10 and KCNA2 plasma membrane potassium channels, likely underlying the patients’ epileptic phenotype.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99711">Distinct release properties of glutamate/GABA co-transmission serve as a frequency-dependent filtering of supramammillary inputs</a></h4>

              
                Glutamate and GABA co-transmitting neurons exist in several brain regions; however, the mechanism by which these two neurotransmitters are co-released from the same synaptic terminals remains unclear. Here, we show that the supramammillary nucleus (SuM) to dentate granule cell synapses, which co-release glutamate and GABA, exhibit differences between glutamate and GABA release properties in paired-pulse ratio, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity, presynaptic receptor modulation, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel-vesicle coupling configuration. Moreover, uniquantal synaptic responses show independent glutamatergic and GABAergic responses. Morphological analysis reveals that most SuM terminals form distinct glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses in proximity, each characterized by GluN1 and GABA<sub>A</sub>α1 labeling, respectively. Notably, glutamate/GABA co-transmission exhibits distinct short-term plasticities, with frequency-dependent depression of glutamate and frequency-independent stable depression of GABA. Our findings suggest that glutamate and GABA are co-released from different synaptic vesicles within the SuM terminals, and reveal that distinct transmission modes of glutamate/GABA co-release serve as frequency-dependent filters of SuM inputs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90046">A spatial threshold for astrocyte calcium surge</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes are active cells involved in brain function through the bidirectional communication with neurons, in which astrocyte calcium plays a crucial role. Synaptically evoked calcium increases can be localized to independent subcellular domains or expand to the entire cell, i.e., calcium surge. Because a single astrocyte may contact ~100,000 synapses, the control of the intracellular calcium signal propagation may have relevant consequences on brain function. Yet, the properties governing the spatial dynamics of astrocyte calcium remains poorly defined. Imaging subcellular responses of cortical astrocytes to sensory stimulation in mice, we show that sensory-evoked astrocyte calcium responses originated and remained localized in domains of the astrocytic arborization, but eventually propagated to the entire cell if a spatial threshold of &gt;23% of the arborization being activated was surpassed. Using <i>Itpr2</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice, we found that type-2 IP<sub>3</sub> receptors were necessary for the generation of astrocyte calcium surge. We finally show using in situ electrophysiological recordings that the spatial threshold of the astrocyte calcium signal consequently determined the gliotransmitter release. Present results reveal a fundamental property of astrocyte physiology, i.e., a spatial threshold for astrocyte calcium propagation, which depends on astrocyte intrinsic properties and governs astrocyte integration of local synaptic activity and subsequent neuromodulation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89892">Unsupervised discovery of family specific vocal usage in the Mongolian gerbil</a></h4>

              
                In nature, animal vocalizations can provide crucial information about identity, including kinship and hierarchy. However, lab-based vocal behavior is typically studied during brief interactions between animals with no prior social relationship, and under environmental conditions with limited ethological relevance. Here, we address this gap by establishing long-term acoustic recordings from Mongolian gerbil families, a core social group that uses an array of sonic and ultrasonic vocalizations. Three separate gerbil families were transferred to an enlarged environment and continuous 20-day audio recordings were obtained. Using a variational autoencoder (VAE) to quantify 583,237 vocalizations, we show that gerbils exhibit a more elaborate vocal repertoire than has been previously reported and that vocal repertoire usage differs significantly by family. By performing gaussian mixture model clustering on the VAE latent space, we show that families preferentially use characteristic sets of vocal clusters and that these usage preferences remain stable over weeks. Furthermore, gerbils displayed family-specific transitions between vocal clusters. Since gerbils live naturally as extended families in complex underground burrows that are adjacent to other families, these results suggest the presence of a vocal dialect which could be exploited by animals to represent kinship. These findings position the Mongolian gerbil as a compelling animal model to study the neural basis of vocal communication and demonstrates the potential for using unsupervised machine learning with uninterrupted acoustic recordings to gain insights into naturalistic animal behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90414">Contributions of associative and non-associative learning to the dynamics of defensive ethograms</a></h4>

              
                Defensive behavior changes based on threat intensity, proximity, and context of exposure, and learning about danger-predicting stimuli is critical for survival. However, most Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigms focus only on freezing behavior, obscuring the contributions of associative and non-associative mechanisms to dynamic defensive responses. To thoroughly investigate defensive ethograms, we subjected male and female adult C57BL/6 J mice to a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm that paired footshock with a serial compound stimulus (SCS) consisting of distinct tone and white noise (WN) stimulus periods. To investigate how associative and non-associative mechanisms affect defensive responses, we compared this paired SCS-footshock group with four control groups that were conditioned with either pseudorandom unpaired presentations of SCS and footshock, shock only, or reversed SCS presentations with inverted tone-WN order, with paired or unpaired presentations. On day 2 of conditioning, the paired group exhibited robust freezing during the tone period with switching to explosive jumping and darting behaviors during the WN period. Comparatively, the unpaired and both reverse SCS groups expressed less tone-induced freezing and rarely showed jumping or darting during WN. Following the second day of conditioning, we observed how defensive behavior changed over two extinction sessions. During extinction, the tone-induced freezing decreased in the paired group, and mice rapidly shifted from escape jumping during WN to a combination of freezing and darting. The unpaired, unpaired reverse, and shock-only groups displayed defensive tail rattling and darting during the SCS, with minimal freezing and jumping. Interestingly, the paired reverse group did not jump to WN, and tone-evoked freezing was resistant to extinction. These findings demonstrate that non-associative factors promote some defensive responsiveness, but associative factors are required for robust cue-induced freezing and high-intensity flight expression.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95547">Microstructural asymmetries of the planum temporale predict functional lateralization of auditory-language processing</a></h4>

              
                Structural hemispheric asymmetry has long been assumed to guide functional lateralization of the human brain, but empirical evidence for this compelling hypothesis remains scarce. Recently, it has been suggested that microstructural asymmetries may be more relevant to functional lateralization than macrostructural asymmetries. To investigate the link between microstructure and function, we analyzed multimodal MRI data in 907 right-handed participants. We quantified structural asymmetry and functional lateralization of the planum temporale (PT), a cortical area crucial for auditory-language processing. We found associations between PT functional lateralization and several structural asymmetries, such as surface area, intracortical myelin content, neurite density, and neurite orientation dispersion. The PT structure also showed hemispheric-specific coupling with its functional activity. All these functional-structural associations are highly specific to within-PT functional activity during auditory-language processing. These results suggest that structural asymmetry underlies functional lateralization of the same brain area and highlights a critical role of microstructural PT asymmetries in auditory-language processing.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93778">Identification of an early subset of cerebellar nuclei neurons in mice</a></h4>

              
                Cerebellar nuclei (CN) neurons serve as the primary output of the cerebellum and originate from the cerebellar primordium at early stages of cerebellar development. These neurons are diverse, integrating information from the cerebellar cortex and relaying it to various brain regions. Employing various methodologies, we have characterized a specific subset of CN neurons that do not originate from the rhombic lip or ventricular zone of the cerebellar primordium. Embryos were collected at early stages of development and processed for immunohistochemistry (IHC), western blotting, in situ hybridization (ISH), embryonic culture, DiI labeling, and flow cytometry analysis (FCM). Our findings indicate that a subset of CN neurons expressing α-synuclein (SNCA), OTX2, MEIS2, and p75NTR (NGFR) are located in the rostroventral region of the NTZ. While CN neurons derived from the rhombic lip are positioned in the caudodorsal area of the NTZ in the cerebellar primordium. Utilizing Otx2-GFP and <i>Atoh1<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice, we have determined that these cells do not originate from the germinal zone of the cerebellar primordium. These results suggest the existence of a novel extrinsic germinal zone for the cerebellar primordium, possibly the mesencephalon, from which early CN neurons originate.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89836">Attention modulates human visual responses to objects by tuning sharpening</a></h4>

              
                Visual stimuli compete with each other for cortical processing and attention biases this competition in favor of the attended stimulus. How does the relationship between the stimuli affect the strength of this attentional bias? Here, we used functional MRI to explore the effect of target-distractor similarity in neural representation on attentional modulation in the human visual cortex using univariate and multivariate pattern analyses. Using stimuli from four object categories (human bodies, cats, cars, and houses), we investigated attentional effects in the primary visual area V1, the object-selective regions LO and pFs, the body-selective region EBA, and the scene-selective region PPA. We demonstrated that the strength of the attentional bias toward the target is not fixed but decreases with increasing target-distractor similarity. Simulations provided evidence that this result pattern is explained by tuning sharpening rather than an increase in gain. Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the behavioral effects of target-distractor similarity on attentional biases and suggest tuning sharpening as the underlying mechanism in object-based attention.

	<p>Background: It is known that being the adult child of a parent with an alcohol use disorder (ACoA) can confer a wide variety of increased health and psychological risks, including higher rates of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. Additionally, ACoAs are at greater risk of developing alcohol/substance use disorders (AUDs/SUDs) than individuals from families without a history of AUDs. Methods: ACoA individuals with risky hazardous alcohol use (n = 14) and those not engaged in hazardous use (n = 14) were compared to a group of healthy controls. We examined structural brain differences and applied machine learning algorithms to predict biological brain and DNA methylation ages to investigate differences and determine any accelerated aging between these groups. Results: Hazardous and non-hazardous ACoA groups had lower predicted brain ages than the healthy control group (n = 100), which may result from neuro-developmental differences between ACoA groups and controls. Within specific brain regions, we observed decreased cortical volume within bilateral pars orbitalis and frontal poles, and the left middle temporal gyrus and entorhinal cortex within the hazardous alcohol ACoA group. When looking at the epigenetic aging data, the hazardous ACoA participants had increased predicted epigenetic age difference scores compared to the control group (n = 34) and the non-hazardous ACoA participant groups. Conclusions: The results demonstrate a decreased brain age in the ACoAs compared to control, concurrent with increased epigenetic age specifically in the hazardous ACoA group, laying the foundation for future research to identify individuals with an increased susceptibility to developing hazardous alcohol use. Together, these results provide a better understanding of the associations between epigenetic factors, brain structure, and alcohol use disorders.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Empathy for pain enhances our ability to perceive pain and recognize potential dangers. Empathic bias occurs when members of the in-group evoke more intense empathic responses compared to out-group members. In the process of interacting with peers, children develop peer status and spontaneously form peer groups. The present study examined how peer status affects pain empathy in mid-childhood individuals. Methods: A behavior and an event-related potential (ERP) study were conducted. Participants were exposed to pictures of different peers in painful or non-painful situations and completed the pain and unpleasantness rating tasks. Four types of peers were included: popular, rejected, neglected and unfamiliar peers. Results: The behavioral results suggested that the influence of peer status on cognitive empathy is more salient, and the empathic response to unfamiliar peers is higher than neglecting and rejecting peers. The ERP results indicated that larger P3 and LPP amplitude were observed in the painful stimulus condition than in the non-painful stimulus condition. The findings also showed that the popular peers elicited larger LPP amplitude than other peers. The LPP response to unfamiliar peers was larger than to neglected peers. Conclusions: All these results demonstrated that mid-childhood individuals showed empathic bias to in-group members, but it was influenced by peer status in the cognitive processes of pain empathy.</p>

	<p>Objective: The etiology of multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) is still debated, which is an obstacle to assessing treatment options. An analysis of the scientific literature combined with the clinical experience can suggest some avenues. Methods: The etiology of MCS and its underlying mechanisms were reviewed from the scientific literature to identify the main factors contributing to its development. The results of the studies involving biomarkers and cerebral imaging techniques on MCS subjects were compared with those performed on subjects having the comorbidities of MCS. From the scientific literature and the experience in a clinical setting in occupational and environmental medicine, distinct types of MCS were looked for, with the application of the underlying mechanisms. The potential effectiveness of available treatments was also reviewed. Results: Among many factors, unresolved emotional traumas causing chronic and acute stress reactions play an important role in the development of MCS and can be the basis for effective treatment. We identified three types of clinical presentations, called the accidental type, following a toxic exposure causing an associated emotional trauma, the associative type, following a repeated innocuous exposure in a threatening context, and the developmental type, following a traumatic childhood/adolescence causing hypervigilance and chronic stress/trauma-related disorders. We presented real cases to illustrate these types and the mechanisms behind their development, as well as effective resolution. Conclusions: MCS and its comorbidities could be treated effectively when the underlying emotional trauma(s) are targeted using trauma-focused psychotherapy and other therapies. Diagnostic criteria, principles of treatment and prevention, and avenues for research were derived from this analysis.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Dementia is a syndrome which involves cognitive and motor problems such as memory and motor control that impacts the individuals&amp;amp;rsquo; quality of life. In mental imagery (MI) technique, motor acts are mentally rehearsed without any overt body movements. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of MI on the quality of life, cognitive, and emotional status of older adults with an early stage of dementia. Methods: The present randomized controlled trial consisted of 160 participants. The sample from an Athens Day Care Center of the Alzheimer Association was randomized to (a) the MI and exercise group (intervention group, n = 55), (b) the only exercise group (1st control group, n = 52), and (c) the neither MI nor exercise group (2nd control group, n = 53). Participants engaged in a total of 24 physiotherapy sessions, each lasting approximately 45 min, scheduled twice weekly over a 12-week period. They performed three assessments: (a) one week prior to the program, (b) one and a half months, and (c) after the program. The intervention group performed a 30 min MI with exercise program content immediately following every physiotherapy exercise session. Walking While Talking Test (WWITT), the Euro-Qol 5-Dimensions 5-Level of severity scale (Euro-Qol 5D-5L scale), the Short-Form of Geriatric Depression Scale (SF-GDS), and the Short Anxiety Screening Test (SAST) were used to assess cognitive status, emotional status, and quality of life. Results: A total of 160 participants (43 men, 117 women, with MMSE M = 23.20 SD = 0.15) took part in this study in which most reported holding a university degree (n = 77), were married (n = 101), and had loss of memory as the 1st symptom of dementia (n= 117). The Friedman test revealed statistically significant differences across the three groups on (a) the WWITTmistakes (X2 = 14.95, df = 2, p = 0.001) and WWITTtime (X2 = 13.35, df = 2, p = 0.01), (b) the total Euro-Qol 5D-5L scale (X2 = 11.87.62, df = 2, p = 0.003) and quality of life on the measuring day (X2 = 25.59, df = 2, p = 0.00), (c) the SF-GDS (X2 = 6.54, df = 2, p = 0.038), and (d) the SAST (X2 = 39.907.62, df = 2, p = 0.00). The Friedman test with post hoc Wilcoxon analysis revealed that the mean scores for the intervention group and the 1st control were significantly better than the 2nd control group in many dependent variables. Conclusions: The results indicate that incorporating MI can positively influence cognitive status, emotional status, and the quality of life in older adults diagnosed with early-stage dementia.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Cognitive failures, including lapses in attention, memory, and executive functioning, can negatively affect daily performance and well-being. Negative and positive affectivity have been implicated in cognitive functioning, yet their relationship with cognitive failures remains underexplored. This study investigates the impact of positive and negative affect on cognitive failures, using daily diary methods to examine both within-person and between-person associations in a sample of younger adults from Singapore and adults across the lifespan from the United States (US). (2) Methods: Participants (Singapore: N = 253, US: N = 1726) completed daily diaries over seven (Singapore) or eight (US) consecutive days. Multilevel modelling was used to analyse both within- and between-person relationships between affect and cognitive failures, controlling for demographic and socioeconomic variables. (3) Results: In both the Singapore and US samples, negative affect was consistently positively associated with cognitive failures at both levels (SG within-person: &amp;amp;beta; = 0.21, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001; SG between-person: &amp;amp;beta; = 0.58, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001; US within-person: &amp;amp;beta; = 0.08, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001; US between-person: &amp;amp;beta; = 0.28, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), supporting the influence of negative affective experiences on cognitive lapses. However, positive affect showed no significant associations with daily cognitive failures in the Singapore sample (within-person: &amp;amp;beta; = 0.01, p = 0.683; between-person: &amp;amp;beta; = &amp;amp;minus;0.04, p = 0.484) and only a between-person negative association in the US sample (within-person: &amp;amp;beta; = 0.02, p = 0.157; between-person: &amp;amp;beta; = &amp;amp;minus;0.11, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). (4) Conclusion: These findings suggest that positive and negative affect differentially influence individual differences and intra-individual changes in daily cognitive failures among both younger and older adults.</p>

	<p>Background: Auditory&amp;amp;ndash;tactile integration is an important research area in multisensory integration. Especially in special environments (e.g., traffic noise and complex work environments), auditory&amp;amp;ndash;tactile integration is crucial for human response and decision making. We investigated the influence of attention on the temporal course and spatial distribution of auditory&amp;amp;ndash;tactile integration. Methods: Participants received auditory stimuli alone, tactile stimuli alone, and simultaneous auditory and tactile stimuli, which were randomly presented on the left or right side. For each block, participants attended to all stimuli on the designated side and detected uncommon target stimuli while ignoring all stimuli on the other side. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded via 64 scalp electrodes. Integration was quantified by comparing the response to the combined stimulus to the sum of the responses to the auditory and tactile stimuli presented separately. Results: The results demonstrated that compared to the unattended condition, integration occurred earlier and involved more brain regions in the attended condition when the stimulus was presented in the left hemispace. The unattended condition involved a more extensive range of brain regions and occurred earlier than the attended condition when the stimulus was presented in the right hemispace. Conclusions: Attention can modulate auditory&amp;amp;ndash;tactile integration and show systematic differences between the left and right hemispaces. These findings contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms of auditory&amp;amp;ndash;tactile information processing in the human brain.</p>

	<p>Objective: This study aimed to explore longitudinal relationships between neurophysiological biomarkers and upper limb motor function recovery in stroke patients, focusing on electroencephalography (EEG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) metrics. Methods: This longitudinal cohort study analyzed neurophysiological, clinical, and demographic data from 102 stroke patients enrolled in the DEFINE cohort. We investigated the associations between baseline and post-intervention changes in the EEG theta/alpha ratio (TAR) and TMS metrics with upper limb motor functionality, assessed using the outcomes of five tests: the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), Handgrip Strength Test (HST), Pinch Strength Test (PST), Finger Tapping Test (FTT), and Nine-Hole Peg Test (9HPT). Results: Our multivariate models identified that a higher baseline TAR in the lesioned hemisphere was consistently associated with poorer motor outcomes across all five assessments. Conversely, a higher improvement in the TAR was positively associated with improvements in FMA and 9HPT. Additionally, an increased TMS motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitude in the non-lesioned hemisphere correlated with greater FMA-diff, while a lower TMS Short Intracortical Inhibition (SICI) in the non-lesioned hemisphere was linked to better PST improvements. These findings suggest the potential of the TAR and TMS metrics as biomarkers for predicting motor recovery in stroke patients. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the significance of the TAR in the lesioned hemisphere as a predictor of motor function recovery post-stroke and also a potential signature for compensatory oscillations. The observed relationships between the TAR and motor improvements, as well as the associations with TMS metrics, underscore the potential of these neurophysiological measures in guiding personalized rehabilitation strategies for stroke patients.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Chronic pain is a highly debilitating condition that differs by type, prevalence, and severity between men and women. To uncover the molecular underpinnings of these differences, it is critical to analyze the transcriptomes of spinal cord pain-processing networks for both sexes. Despite several recently published single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) studies on the function and composition of the mouse spinal cord, a gene expression analysis investigating the differences between males and females has yet to be performed. Here, we combined data from three different large-scale snRNA-seq studies, which used sex-identified adult mice. Using SeqSeek, we classified more than 37,000 unique viable cells within predicted cell types with the use of machine learning. We then utilized DESeq2 to identify significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between males and females in a variety of cell populations, including superficial dorsal horn (SDH) neurons. We found a large number of DEGs between males and females in all cells, in neurons, and in SDH neurons of the mouse spinal cord, with a greater level of differential expression in inhibitory SDH neurons compared to excitatory SDH neurons. The results of these analyses are available on an open-source web-app: <a target="_blank"

Lastly, we used gene set enrichment analysis to identify sex-enriched pathways from our previously identified DEGs. Through this, we have identified specific genetic players within the rodent spinal cord that diverge between males and females, which may underlie reported sex differences in spinal nociceptive mechanisms and pain processing.</p>

	<p>Objectives: Dementia is becoming a major health problem in the world, and chronic brain ischemia is an established important risk factor in predisposing this disease. Astrocytes, as one major part of the blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier (BBB), are activated during chronic cerebral blood flow hypoperfusion. Reactive astrocytes have been classified into phenotype pro-inflammatory type A1 or neuroprotective type A2. However, the specific subtype change of astrocyte and the mechanisms of chronic brain ischemia are still unknown. Methods: In order to depict the phenotype changes and their possible roles during this process, a rat bilateral common carotid artery occlusion model (BCAO) was employed in the present study. Meanwhile, the signaling pathways that possibly regulate these changes were investigated as well. Results: After four-week occlusion, astrocytes in the cortex of BCAO rats were shown to be the A2 phenotype, identified by the significant up-regulation of S100a10 accompanied by the down-regulation of Connexin 43 (CX43) protein. Next, we established in vitro hypoxia models, which were set up by stimulating primary astrocyte cultures from rat cortex with cobalt chloride, low glucose, or/and fibrinogen. Consistent with in vivo data, the cultured astrocytes also transformed into the A2 phenotype with the up-regulation of S100a10 and the down-regulation of CX43. In order to explore the mechanism of CX43 protein changes, C6 astrocyte cells were handled in both hypoxia and low-glucose stimulus, in which decreased pERK and pJNK expression were found. Conclusions: In conclusion, our data suggest that in chronic cerebral ischemia conditions, the gradual ischemic insults could promote the transformation of astrocytes into A2 type instead of A1 type, and the phosphorylation of CX43 was negatively regulated by the phosphorylation of ERK and JNK. Also, our data could provide some new evidence of how to leverage the endogenous astrocytes phenotype changes during CNS injury by promoting them to be &amp;amp;ldquo;protector&amp;amp;rdquo; and not &amp;amp;ldquo;culprit&amp;amp;rdquo;.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Brain&amp;amp;ndash;computer interfaces (BCIs) are a rapidly developing technology that captures and transmits brain signals to external sources, allowing the user control of devices such as prosthetics. BCI technology offers the potential to restore physical capabilities in the body and change how we interact and communicate with computers and each other. While BCI technology has existed for decades, recent developments have caused the technology to generate a host of ethical issues and discussions in both academic and public circles. Given that media representation has the potential to shape public perception and policy, it is necessary to evaluate the space that these issues take in public discourse. Methods: We conducted a rapid review of media articles in English discussing ethical issues of BCI technology from 2013 to 2024 as indexed by LexisNexis. Our searches yielded 675 articles, with a final sample containing 182 articles. We assessed the themes of the articles and coded them based on the ethical issues discussed, ethical frameworks, recommendations, tone, and application of technology. Results: Our results showed a marked rise in interest in media articles over time, signaling an increased focus on this topic. The majority of articles adopted a balanced or neutral tone when discussing BCIs and focused on ethical issues regarding privacy, autonomy, and regulation. Conclusions: Current discussion of ethical issues reflects growing news coverage of companies such as Neuralink, and reveals a mounting distrust of BCI technology. The growing recognition of ethical considerations in BCI highlights the importance of ethical discourse in shaping the future of the field.</p>

	<p>Background: Currently, there is a need for approaches to understand and manage the multidimensional autism spectrum and quantify its heterogeneity. The diagnosis is based on behaviors observed in two key dimensions, social communication and repetitive, restricted behaviors, alongside the identification of required support levels. However, it is now recognized that additional modifiers, such as language abilities, IQ, and comorbidities, are essential for a more comprehensive assessment of the complex clinical presentations and clinical trajectories in autistic individuals. Different approaches have been used to identify autism subgroups based on the genetic and clinical heterogeneity, recognizing the importance of autistic behaviors and the assessment of modifiers. While valuable, these methods are limited in their ability to evaluate a specific individual in relation to a normative reference sample of autistic individuals. A quantitative score based on axes of phenotypic variability could be useful to compare individuals, evaluate the homogeneity of subgroups, and follow trajectories of an individual or a specific group. Here we propose an approach by (i) combining measures of phenotype variability that contribute to clinical presentation and could impact different trajectories in autistic persons and (ii) using it with normative modeling to assess the clinical heterogeneity of a specific individual. Methods: Using phenotypic data available in a comprehensive reference sample, the Simons Simplex Collection (n = 2744 individuals), we performed principal component analysis (PCA) to find components of phenotypic variability. Features that contribute to clinical heterogeneity and could impact trajectories in autistic people were assessed by the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R), Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS) and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Cognitive assessment was estimated by the Total Intelligence Quotient (IQ). Results: Three PCs embedded 72% of the normative sample variance. PCA-projected dimensions supported normative modeling where a multivariate normal distribution was used to calculate percentiles. A Multidimensional General Functionality Score (MGFS) to evaluate new prospective single subjects was developed based on percentiles. Conclusions: Our approach proposes a basis for comparing individuals, or one individual at two or more times and evaluating homogeneity in phenotypic clinical presentation and possibly guides research sample selection for clinical trials.</p>

                <p>Increasing data suggest a crucial relationship between glycolipid metabolic disorder and neuropsychiatric injury. The aim of this study is to investigate the behavioral performance changes and neuropathological injuries in mice challenged with high-fat diet (HFD) and streptozotocin (STZ). The glucose metabolism indicators and behavioral performance were detected. The mRNA expression of IL-1&beta;, IL-6, TNF-&alpha;, ocln, zo-1, and clnds and protein expression of APP, p-Tau, p-IRS1, p-AKT, p-ERK, and TREM1/2 were measured. The fluorescence intensities of MAP-2, NeuN, APP, p-Tau, GFAP, and IBA-1 were observed. The results showed that combination of HFD and STZ/I.P. could induce glucose metabolic turmoil and Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like neuropsychiatric dysfunction in mice, as indicated by the increased concentrations of fasting blood glucose and impaired learning and memory ability. Moreover, the model mice presented increased levels of APP, p-Tau, p-IRS1, TREM2, IL-1&beta;, IL-6, TNF-&alpha;, ocln, zo-1, and clnds; decreased levels of p-AKT, p-ERK, and TREM1; and neuron damage and the hyperactivation of astrocytes and microglia in the hippocampus as compared with control mice. Only male mice were used in this study. Although AD and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are distinct pathologies, our results suggested that combination of HFD and STZ/I.P., a widely used T2DM modeling method, could successfully induce AD-like behavioral impairments and neuropathological injuries in mice; the mechanism might be involved with neuroinflammation and its associated dysfunction of IRS1/AKT/ERK signaling pathway. Our findings further support the potential overlap between T2DM and AD pathophysiology, providing insight into the mechanisms underlying the comorbidity of these diseases.</p>

                <p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by deficits in social interaction and communication, cognitive rigidity, and atypical sensory processing. Recent studies suggest that the basal ganglia, specifically the striatum (NSt), plays an important role in ASD. While striatal interneurons, including cholinergic (ChAT<sup>+</sup>) and parvalbumin-positive (PV<sup>+</sup>) GABAergic neurons, have been described to be altered in animal models of ASD, their specific contribution remains elusive. Here, we combined behavioral, anatomical, and electrophysiological quantifications to explore if interneuron balance could be implicated in atypical sensory processing in cortical and striatal somatosensory regions of rats subjected to a valproic acid (VPA) model of ASD. We found that VPA animals showed a significant decrease in the number of ChAT<sup>+</sup> and PV<sup>+</sup> cells in multiple regions (including the sensorimotor region) of the NSt. We also observed significantly different sensory-evoked responses at the single-neuron and population levels in both striatal and cortical regions, as well as corticostriatal interactions. Therefore, selective elimination of striatal PV<sup>+</sup> neurons only partially recapitulated the effects of VPA, indicating that the mechanisms behind the VPA phenotype are much more complex than the elimination of a particular neural subpopulation. Our results indicate that VPA exposure induced significant histological changes in ChAT<sup>+</sup> and PV<sup>+</sup> cells accompanied by atypical sensory-evoked corticostriatal population dynamics that could partially explain the sensory processing differences associated with ASD.</p>

                <p>by Karim G. Habashy, Benjamin D. Evans, Dan F. M. Goodman, Jeffrey S. Bowers</p>

Brains have evolved diverse neurons with varying morphologies and dynamics that impact temporal information processing. In contrast, most neural network models use homogeneous units that vary only in spatial parameters (weights and biases). To explore the importance of temporal parameters, we trained spiking neural networks on tasks with varying temporal complexity, holding different parameter subsets constant. We found that adapting conduction delays is crucial for solving all test conditions under tight resource constraints. Remarkably, these tasks can be solved using only temporal parameters (delays and time constants) with constant weights. In more complex spatio-temporal tasks, an adaptable bursting parameter was essential. Overall, allowing adaptation of both temporal and spatial parameters enhances network robustness to noise, a vital feature for biological brains and neuromorphic computing systems. Our findings suggest that rich and adaptable dynamics may be the key for solving temporally structured tasks efficiently in evolving organisms, which would help explain the diverse physiological properties of biological neurons.

R-loops are a class of non-canonical nucleic acid structures that typically form during transcription when the nascent RNA hybridizes the DNA template strand, leaving the non-template DNA strand unpaired. These structures are abundant in nature and play important physiological and pathological roles. Recent research shows that DNA sequence and topology affect R-loops, yet it remains unclear how these and other factors contribute to R-loop formation. In this work, we investigate the link between nascent RNA folding and the formation of R-loops. We introduce tree-polynomials, a new class of representations of RNA secondary structures. A tree-polynomial representation consists of a rooted tree associated with an RNA secondary structure together with a polynomial that is uniquely identified with the rooted tree. Tree-polynomials enable accurate, interpretable and efficient data analysis of RNA secondary structures without pseudoknots. We develop a computational pipeline for investigating and predicting R-loop formation from a genomic sequence. The pipeline obtains nascent RNA secondary structures from a co-transcriptional RNA folding software, and computes the tree-polynomial representations of the structures. By applying this pipeline to plasmid sequences that contain R-loop forming genes, we establish a strong correlation between the coefficient sums of tree-polynomials and the experimental probability of R-loop formation. Such strong correlation indicates that the pipeline can be used for accurate R-loop prediction. Furthermore, the interpretability of tree-polynomials allows us to characterize the features of RNA secondary structure associated with R-loop formation. In particular, we identify that branches with short stems separated by bulges and interior loops are associated with R-loops.

Mosquito-related diseases pose a significant threat to global public health, necessitating efficient and accurate mosquito classification for effective surveillance and control. This work presents an innovative approach to mosquito classification by leveraging state-of-the-art vision transformers and open-set learning techniques. A novel framework has been introduced that integrates Transformer-based deep learning models with comprehensive data augmentation and preprocessing methods, enabling robust and precise identification of ten mosquito species. The Swin Transformer model achieves the best performance for traditional closed-set learning with 99.60% accuracy and 0.996 F1 score. The lightweight MobileViT technique attains an almost equivalent accuracy of 98.90% with significantly reduced parameters and model complexities. Next, the applied deep learning models’ adaptability and generalizability in a static environment have been enhanced by using new classes of data samples during the inference stage that have not been included in the training set. The proposed framework’s ability to handle unseen classes like insects similar to mosquitoes, even humans, through open-set learning further enhances its practical applicability employing the OpenMax technique and Weibull distribution. The traditional CNN model, Xception, outperforms the latest transformer with higher accuracy and F1 score for open-set learning. The study’s findings highlight the transformative potential of advanced deep-learning architectures in entomology, providing a strong groundwork for future research and development in mosquito surveillance and vector control. The implications of this work extend beyond mosquito classification, offering valuable insights for broader ecological and environmental monitoring applications.

                <p>by Emine Celiker, Charlie Woodrow, Òscar Guadayol, Leonidas-Romanos Davranoglou, Christian M. Schlepütz, Beth Mortimer, Graham K. Taylor, Stuart Humphries, Fernando Montealegre-Z</p>

Mammalian hearing operates on three basic steps: 1) sound capturing, 2) impedance conversion, and 3) frequency analysis. While these canonical steps are vital for acoustic communication and survival in mammals, they are not unique to them. An equivalent mechanism has been described for katydids (Insecta), and it is unique to this group among invertebrates. The katydid inner ear resembles an uncoiled cochlea, and has a length less than 1 mm. Their inner ears contain a hearing organ, <i>crista acustica</i>, which holds tonotopically arranged sensory cells for frequency mapping via travelling waves. The <i>crista acustica</i> is located on a curved triangular surface formed by the dorsal wall of the ear canal. While empirical recordings show tonotopic vibrations in the katydid inner ear for frequency analysis, the biophysical mechanism leading to tonotopy remains elusive due to the small size and complexity of the hearing organ. In this study, robust numerical simulations are developed for an <i>in silico</i> investigation of this process. Simulations are based on the precise katydid inner ear geometry obtained by synchrotron-based micro-computed tomography, and empirically determined inner ear fluid properties for an accurate representation of the underlying mechanism. We demonstrate that the triangular structure below the hearing organ drives the tonotopy and travelling waves in the inner ear, and thus has an equivalent role to the mammalian basilar membrane. This reveals a stronger analogy between the inner ear basic mechanical networks of two organisms with ancient evolutionary differences and independent phylogenetic histories.

                <p>by Victor Geadah, Stefan Horoi, Giancarlo Kerg, Guy Wolf, Guillaume Lajoie</p>

Neurons in the brain have rich and adaptive input-output properties. Features such as heterogeneous f-I curves and spike frequency adaptation are known to place single neurons in optimal coding regimes when facing changing stimuli. Yet, it is still unclear how brain circuits exploit single-neuron flexibility, and how network-level requirements may have shaped such cellular function. To answer this question, a multi-scaled approach is needed where the computations of single neurons and neural circuits must be considered as a complete system. In this work, we use artificial neural networks to systematically investigate single-neuron input-output adaptive mechanisms, optimized in an end-to-end fashion. Throughout the optimization process, each neuron has the liberty to modify its nonlinear activation function parametrized to mimic f-I curves of biological neurons, either by learning an individual static function or via a learned and shared adaptation mechanism to modify activation functions in real-time during a task. We find that such adaptive networks show much-improved robustness to noise and changes in input statistics. Using tools from dynamical systems theory, we analyze the role of these emergent single-neuron properties and argue that neural diversity and adaptation play an active regularization role, enabling neural circuits to optimally propagate information across time. Finally, we outline similarities between these optimized solutions and known coding strategies found in biological neurons, such as gain scaling and fractional order differentiation/integration.

                <p>by Jorin Overwiening, Federico Tesler, Domenico Guarino, Alain Destexhe</p>

The thalamus is the brain’s central relay station, orchestrating sensory processing and cognitive functions. However, how thalamic function depends on internal and external states, is not well understood. A comprehensive understanding would necessitate the integration of single cell dynamics with their collective behavior at population level. For this we propose a biologically realistic mean-field model of the thalamus, describing thalamocortical relay neurons (TC) and thalamic reticular neurons (RE). We perform a multi-scale study of thalamic responsiveness and its dependence on cell and brain states. Building upon existing single-cell experiments we show that: (1) Awake and sleep-like states can be defined via the absence/presence of the neuromodulator acetylcholine (ACh), which controls bursting in TC and RE. (2) Thalamic response to sensory stimuli is linear in awake state and becomes nonlinear in sleep state, while cortical input generates nonlinear response in both awake and sleep state. (3) Stimulus response is controlled by cortical input, which suppresses responsiveness in awake state while it ‘wakes-up’ the thalamus in sleep state promoting a linear response. (4) Synaptic noise induces a global linear responsiveness, diminishing the difference in response between thalamic states. Finally, the model replicates spindle oscillations within a sleep-like state, exhibiting a qualitative change in activity and responsiveness. The development of this thalamic mean-field model provides a new tool for incorporating detailed thalamic dynamics in large scale brain simulations.

                <p>by Tina Lenče, Johannes Sulzer, Kilian Andress, Anne-Sophie Gribling-Burrer, Vanessa Lamm-Schmidt, Lars Barquist, Redmond P. Smyth, Franziska Faber</p>

Bacterial noncoding RNAs fulfill a variety of cellular functions as catalysts, as scaffolds in protein complexes or as regulators of gene expression. They often exhibit complex tertiary structures that are a key determinant of their biochemical function. Here, we characterize the structured “<i>raiA</i> motif” RNA from <i>Clostridioides difficile</i>, which is conserved in more than 2,500 bacterial species from the phyla Bacillota and Actinomycetota. We show that its transcript abundance and stability in exponentially growing bacteria rivals that of ribosomal RNAs. Deletion of the “<i>raiA</i> motif” RNA is associated with delayed transition into stationary phase, and changes in stationary phase pathways such as spore formation, hence we rename it ModT (modulator of transition phase). Mechanistically, we show that ModT-mediated changes in cellular cyclic di-GMP levels are linked to the pronounced sporulation defect in the <i>modT</i> mutant. Importantly, we show that expression profiles and isoform patterns of ModT are conserved in <i>Clostridium perfringens</i> and <i>Paeniclostridium sordellii</i>, and that these orthologs can functionally complement ModT in <i>C</i>. <i>difficile</i>. Chemical structure probing of ModT in vivo reveals dynamic refolding and provides initial evidence for a potential association of ModT with proteins. In summary, our findings indicate that ModT fulfills a conserved role in regulating growth transitions in bacteria and provide a crucial step towards delineating its molecular mechanism.

                Background Aromatic hydrocarbons such as Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene and Xylene (BTEX), give us an environmental challenge. They can be degraded by strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, through emulsification (rhl genes) and biodegradation processes. The BTEX tolerance genes (mlaABCD) may be present in it. The aim of this research was to evaluate, through comparative genomics, the genes of the rhl and mla systems in six strains isolated from hydrocarbon polluted environments. Methods This study examines six Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated from hydrocarbon-contaminated sites in Peru. Each strain shows capabilities like hydrocarbon degradation and heavy metal tolerance. After DNA extraction, sequencing, and quality-controlled assembly, functional genome annotation was performed using BAKTA. Comparative analysis included high-quality Pseudomonas genomes from RefSeq, with ANI metrics to assess genetic similarity. A phylogenetic tree, built from core gene alignment, reveals evolutionary connections and was visualized with iTOL. Results Results showed that all strains had a double copy of the rhlB gene, arranged in the same organization, with rhlABRI genes always adjacent in a 3′-5′ direction. However, rhlG varied in position and orientation among strains, often near rhlC. The C1BHIC5 strain had only one copy of the rhlB gene, and the 3′ – 5 orientation of the rhlG gene was the exception. Most strains had two copies of mlaA, mlaFEDC, and mlaEFD genes for toluene tolerance, with diverse orientations across strains. High synteny was noted within mla gene blocks. Compared to Pseudomonas putida, where mla genes are positioned between murA and ppcD with an additional toluene tolerance gene (ttg2D), strains of P. aeruginosa strains display a similar yet distinct gene arrangement. Conclusions In conclusion, the presence of the rhlABC genes in all the strains analyzed and the BTEX tolerance genes allowed us to understand the great ability of P. aeruginosa to survive in polluted environments.

                Introduction We examined the predictors of tobacco smoking initiation considering factors such as age, gender, pocket money, exposure to smoke in public outdoor places, anti-tobacco media, smoking parents, smoking teachers, and smoking friends among adolescents in Indonesia. Methods Using data from the 2014–2019 National Youth Tobacco Survey grades 7–12, data from 9,655 teenagers were analyzed. The research used the Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS) questionnaire. The analysis used univariate, chi-square and logistic regression with the STATA application version 15. Results In total, 9655 adolescent respondents participated. Multivariate tests indicated that teenagers aged 13-15 years (AOR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.08-1.66) and teenagers aged> 15 years (AOR: 1.65, 95% CI: 1.25-2.17), teenagers who were male (AOR: 13.99, 95% CI: 11.11-17.63), teenagers who were exposed to cigarette smoke in public places outside the room (AOR: 2.00, 95% CI: 1.74-2.29), teenagers who had never seen anti-tobacco messages in the mass media (AOR: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.02-1.48), Teenagers who had parents who smoke (AOR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.08-1.46), teenagers who saw teachers smoking in the school area (AOR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.18-1.71), and teenagers who accepted offers of cigarettes from friends (AOR: 15.11, 95% CI: 10.33-22.11). Conclusion The initiation of tobacco smoking among teenagers in Indonesia can be predicted by various factors such as age, gender, exposure to smoke in outdoor public places, exposure to anti-tobacco media, and influence of parents, teachers, and friends.

                Background In broiler farming, vaccination against Newcastle disease (ND) is essential. Nonetheless, during the post-vaccination phase, production may be negatively impacted by mycotoxin contamination in feed. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of toxin binders on antibody titer and large intestine histopathology after ND vaccination in broiler with aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and ochratoxin A (OTA) toxication. Methods A total of 20 broilers were randomly assigned into 4 groups with 5 replications i.e. (C-) broiler groups with basal feed, (C+) broiler groups with AFB1 and OTA feed contamination, (T1) and (T2) broiler groups with exposed AFB1, OTA, and toxin binders as feed additives with dose 1.1 g/kg and 1.6 g/kg feed, respectively. ND vaccination was carried out on day 7 and 21. Antibody titers were evaluated from serum samples of broiler on days 14, 28, and 35 for further hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test. Histopathology of the cecum and colon organs was evaluated using HE staining on day 36. HI test and histological scoring were analyzed using the One-Way ANOVA, followed by Duncan’s test with a p < 0.05 in SPSS v.26 software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Results As a result, histopathological improvement of the cecum and colon was reported based on mucosal rupture, hemorrhage and necrosis on day 35. An increase in the mean antibody titer compared to days 14 and 28 was observed on day 35, with significant changes observed in serum samples based on the C+ group, which was significantly different from the C- and T2 groups (p < 0.05). Conclusions This study revealed that toxin binder dose of 1.6 g/kg can increase antibody titer and histopathology of cecum and colon in broiler chickens after ND vaccination fed with mycotoxin-contaminated feed.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23660?af=R">Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potentials Participate in Intracellular and Extracellular Theta Rhythms in the Hippocampus: A Personal Narrative</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The hypothesis that the hippocampal theta rhythm consists of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) was critical for understanding the theta rhythm. The dominant views in the early 1980s were that intracellularly recorded theta consisted of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) with little participation by IPSPs, and that IPSPs generated a closed monopolar field in the hippocampus. I (Leung) conceived of a new model for generation of the hippocampal theta rhythm, with theta-rhythmic IPSPs as an essential component, and thus sought to reinvestigate the relation between theta and IPSPs quantitatively with intracellular and extracellular recordings. The intracellular recordings were performed by Leung and Yim in the laboratory of Kris Krnjević at McGill University. Using protocols of passing steady-state holding currents and injection of chloride ions, the intracellular theta and IPSP in a CA1 neuron typically showed the same reversal potential and correlated change in amplitude. Low-intensity stimulation of the alveus evoked an antidromic action potential in CA1 neurons, identifying them as pyramidal cells with output axons in the alveus, which then activated a feedback IPSP with almost no excitatory component. Theta-rhythmic somatic inhibition, together with phase-shifted theta-rhythmic distal apical dendritic excitation were proposed as the two dipoles that generate a gradual extracellular theta phase shift in the CA1 apical dendritic layer. The distal apical excitation driven by the entorhinal cortex was proposed to be atropine-resistant and dominated during walking in rats. Other than serving a conventional role in limiting excitation, rhythmic proximal inhibition and distal dendritic excitation provide varying phasic modulation along the soma-dendritic axis of pyramidal cells, resulting in theta phase-dependent synaptic plasticity and gamma oscillations, which are likely involved in cognitive processing.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Here I describe how an interest in synaptic plasticity took me from a PhD at McGill, where I worked on activity-dependent plasticity in the responses of single units in the association cortex of anesthetized cats, to a collaboration with Terje Lømo in Per Andersen's laboratory in Oslo in 1968–9. There we followed up on Lømo's discovery of LTP, published as an abstract in 1966, to produce the first detailed description of the phenomenon. Later, in London, Tony Gardner-Medwin and I showed that LTP lasting for days could be obtained in the awake rabbit. The two papers were published together in the <i>Journal of Physiology</i> in 1973. I relate how difficulties in replicating our results in English rabbits, and the failure of the first attempts to obtain LTP in slices of the dentate gyrus, led to my abandoning work on LTP for a few years, returning to the fray in the late 1970s through a collaboration with Graham Goddard at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada.</p>
