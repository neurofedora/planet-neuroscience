<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">The present paper shows how cinnamon extract (CE) consumption mitigates neuronal loss and memory impairment following traumatic brain injury (TBI), one of the world’s most common neurodegenerative diseases. TBI patients suffer short- and long-term behavioral, cognitive, and emotional impairments, including difficulties in concentration, memory loss, and depression. Research shows that CE  application can mitigate cognitive and behavioral impairments in animal models for Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, whose pathophysiology is similar to that of TBI. This study builds on prior research by showing similar results in TBI mice models. After drinking CE for a week, mice were injured using our 70-g weight drop TBI device. For 2 weeks thereafter, the mice continued drinking CE alongside standard lab nutrition. Subsequently, the mice underwent behavioral tests to assess their memory, motor activity, and anxiety. The mice brains were harvested for immunohistochemistry staining to evaluate overall neuronal survival. Our results show that CE consumption almost completely mitigates memory impairment and decreases neuronal loss after TBI. Mice that did not consume CE demonstrated impaired memory. Our results also show that CE consumption attenuated neuronal loss in the temporal cortex and the dentate gyrus. Mice that did not consume CE suffered a significant neuronal loss. There were no significant differences in anxiety levels and motor activity between all groups. These findings show a new therapeutic approach to improve cognitive function and decrease memory loss after TBI.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have regulatory roles in several aspects of cellular physiology. Recent studies have also revealed their role in neuronal differentiation and the pathophysiology of neurologic disorders such as epilepsy. We have recently reported altered expression of a number of lncRNAs in the peripheral blood of epileptic patients in association with their response to antiepileptic drugs. One the most significantly altered lncRNAs in epileptic patients is the antisense non-coding RNA in the INK4 locus (<em class="a-plus-plus">ANRIL</em>), whose expression has been found to be higher in both refractory and non-refractory groups compared with controls. In the current study, we aimed to identify the methylation status of this lncRNA to suggest a potential mechanism for deregulated <em class="a-plus-plus">ANRIL</em> expression. Thus, we assessed the methylation status of the <em class="a-plus-plus">ANRIL</em> promoter in 40 patients with refractory epilepsy, 40 patients with non-refractory epilepsy and 40 normal controls using the high-resolution melting (HRM) method. The HRM results showed hypomethylation of the <em class="a-plus-plus">ANRIL</em> promoter region in both refractory epilepsy and non-refractory epilepsy patients compared with normal controls. This methylation pattern was consistent with the recently reported upregulation of this lncRNA in patients with epilepsy. Thus, we suggest altered methylation of the <em class="a-plus-plus">ANRIL</em> promoter as a potential cause of its aberrant expression in peripheral blood of epileptic patients.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been shown to have a complex inheritance. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been shown to be associated with risk of this neurodevelopmental disorder. In the current study, we genotyped four SNPs in a genomic hotspot for human disorders. The selected SNPs were located in adjacency of the antisense noncoding RNA in the INK4 locus (<em class="a-plus-plus">ANRIL</em>) and have been shown to be associated with a number of human disorders. Genotyping was performed in 420 ASD cases and 420 normally developed children. After correction of <em class="a-plus-plus">P</em> values for multiple comparisons, there was no significant difference in frequencies of rs1333045, rs1333048, rs4977574, and rs10757278 alleles, genotypes, or haplotypes between ASD children and children with normal development. However, one estimated haplotype (T A A A haplotype corresponding to rs1333045, rs1333048, rs4977574, and rs10757278 SNPs, respectively) tended to be more prevalent among cases compared with controls (OR (95% CI) = 1.77 (1.19–2.64), adjusted <em class="a-plus-plus">P</em> value = 0.07). Besides, the T A G G tended to be less common among ASD cases compared with controls (OR (95% CI) = 0.64 (0.47–0.87), adjusted P value = 0.07). Although we could not detect significant difference in alleles, genotypes, or haplotypes frequencies between cases and controls, the trend toward association between two haplotypes and ASD risk implies that there might be a putative causative variant in the mentioned haplotypes whose association with ASD could be determined in larger cohorts of patients.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Evidence suggests that some systemic and local factors, including cytokines and growth factors in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), can play an essential role in accelerating fracture healing. The purpose of this study was to evaluate serum levels of some inflammatory cytokines and growth factors in patients with fracture and TBI as well as healthy subjects. In this study, a total number of 30 patients with a femoral fracture, 30 cases with TBI, 30 patients with TBI and a femoral fracture (fracture + TBI group), and 30 healthy subjects were recruited. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores were also determined upon their admission. Then, the serum levels of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique, 12 h and 4 weeks after injury and hospital admission. The study results demonstrated that the serum levels of BMP-2, FGF-2, IL-1β, and PDGF in the femoral fracture + TBI group increased significantly over 12 h and after 4 weeks compared with other groups, but the serum levels of IGF-I, IL-6, and TGF-β in this group increased in a significant manner at 12 h compared with other studied groups. The findings also showed that the time to union of a femoral fracture was shorter in the fracture + TBI group than in cases with a femoral fracture alone (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.03). Accordingly, it seems that elevated serum levels of BMP-2, PDGF, FGF-2, and IL-1β may be associated with healing acceleration in fracture + TBI patients. However, further studies are needed to confirm this claim.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">The role of the gut microbiota in triggering autism is a rapidly emerging field of research. Gut microbiota have been incriminated because autistic children often have gastrointestinal symptoms. Pathogenic gut bacteria in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have been reported. The present study aimed to assess <em class="a-plus-plus">Clostridium difficile</em> in the stool of children with ASD and its relation to gastrointestinal (GI) comorbidities, autism severity, and sensory impairment. The study included 58 ASD patients, 45 of their neurotypical siblings, and 45 unrelated controls. Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) was used to assess the severity of autism. Sensory problems were evaluated using the Short Sensory Profile (SSP). GI symptoms were assessed with a modified six-item GI Severity Index (6-GSI) questionnaire. Quantitative real-time PCR was done for the detection and quantitation of <em class="a-plus-plus">C. difficile</em> and its toxins A and B. <em class="a-plus-plus">C. difficile</em> was detected in 25.9%, 40%, and 15.6% of ASD cases, siblings, and unrelated control respectively. Regarding toxin A and B production, 73.3%, 77.8%, and 71.4% of <em class="a-plus-plus">C. difficile</em> in positive ASD, siblings, and unrelated control cases respectively were toxigenic. There was no statistically significant difference between the three groups as regards <em class="a-plus-plus">C. difficile</em> qualitative, quantitative, and toxin production results. In conclusion<strong class="a-plus-plus">,</strong> <em class="a-plus-plus">C. difficile</em> is not specifically prevalent in the gut of children with ASD. Although most of the strains are toxigenic, there were no GI symptoms in the control groups and no statistically significant association with GI Severity Index in autistic cases. Gastrointestinal dysfunction and sensory impairment are common comorbidities in ASD.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">In the past two decades, genetic studies of familial forms of Parkinson’s disease (PD) have shown evidence that PD has a significant genetic component. Indeed, 12 genes are strongly involved in PD causality, three of them having dominant inheritance and 9 causing early-onset autosomal recessive forms, including 3 with a typical PD and 6 with an atypical parkinsonism. The aim of this study was to determine the genetic basis of familial PD in Moroccan patients. We selected 18 Moroccan index case with familial forms of PD. Patients were first screened for exon-rearrangements by MLPA kit. They were then analyzed by gene panel next-generation sequencing (NGS). Functional variants with minor allele frequencies &lt; 0.5% in public databases were considered potential candidate variants to PD. In the 18 PD patients with a positive family history that were analyzed, MLPA assays identified <em class="a-plus-plus">PRKN</em> deletions in two patients: a homozygous exon 3–5 deletion and a heterozygous exon 4 deletion. Sixteen rare SNV were identified by NGS, four of them were novel. Seven mutations were categorized as pathogenic, five as likely pathogenic, two to be of uncertain significance, and 3 were predicted to be likely benign but may give a weaker pathogenic effect and could contribute to PD since they were found in late-onset PD patients. Rare or novel mutations that could be related to the disease were identified in 72% of these patients (13/18), including nine with bi-allelic pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in genes causing recessive PD, particularly <em class="a-plus-plus">PRKN</em> and <em class="a-plus-plus">PINK1</em>. Mutations in genes with dominant inheritance were found in 4/18 patients (22%).</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Interleukin (IL)-34 is ligand for the colony-stimulating factor (CSF)-1 receptor. This cytokine has fundamental roles the pathogenesis of a number of autoimmune and neurologic disorders. However, its role in the pathogenesis of acute and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathies (AIDP and CIDP) has not been assessed yet. We measured serum levels of IL-34 33 CIDP cases, 16 AIDP cases, and 33 control subjects using commercial ELISA kits. IL-34 levels were significantly higher in both AIDP (44.87 ± 4.38) and CIDP (44.87 ± 4.38) groups compared with healthy subjects (30.10 ± 1.05) (<em class="a-plus-plus">P</em> = 0.046 and <em class="a-plus-plus">P</em> = 0.01, respectively). Differences between female subgroups were insignificant. However, levels of this cytokine were significantly higher in male subjects with CIDP compared with male controls (<em class="a-plus-plus">P</em> = 0.042). Thus, levels of this cytokine might be regarded as biomarkers for these kinds of autoimmune disorders. Future studies are needed to verify these results and find the molecular mechanism of participation of IL-34 in the pathogenesis of AIDP/CIDP.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Dopamine transporter (DAT) or solute carrier family 6 member 3 (SLC6A3) is a transmembrane protein regulating dopaminergic neurotransmission. It has been implicated in playing important roles in the dopaminergic reward pathways, and thus, <em class="a-plus-plus">DAT1</em> is a strong candidate gene for association studies with heroin dependence. A case-control study involving 279 individuals (147 controls and 132 heroin-dependent cases) was conducted. Ten polymorphisms of the <em class="a-plus-plus">DAT1 (SLC6A3)</em> gene were analysed for its association with heroin dependence. Following the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) test, genetic association analyses were performed for the study groups. The post hoc statistical power of the study was 0.655 (65.5%). Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs246997 was found to be significantly associated with heroin dependence at allelic, genotypic, and haplotypic levels. A significant difference in the distribution of 11R allele and 10R/11R genotype of rs28363170 between heroin-dependent cases and controls was also observed. Nominal significance at degrees of freedom (df) = 5 was also observed for rs28363170. Five bimarker-based haplotype combinations were also found to be associated with heroin dependence. For the first time, 13R allele (7R/13R genotype) and 14R allele (7R/14R genotype) were identified for rs3836790 in the population. The study also reports that the 11R allele and 10R/11R genotype of rs28363170 is associated with protection against heroin dependence. 7R and 6R alleles were also found to be the common alleles of rs3836790 in the study population. The study provides evidence for the association of polymorphisms of <em class="a-plus-plus">DAT1 (SLC6A3)</em> with heroin dependence.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">This study was designed to investigate the effect of naringin in oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) model and its mechanism. The target gene of naringin and the enriched pathways of the gene were searched and identified using bioinformatics analysis. Then OGD/R model was built using PC12 cells, after which the cells were treated with different concentrations of naringin. Subsequently, cell proliferation and apoptosis were evaluated by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and flow cytometry assays, respectively. Meanwhile, the expression of NFKB1 in PC12 cells underwent OGD/R-induced injury was detected by qRT-PCR, while apoptosis-related and pathway-related proteins were checked by Western blot. DCF-DA kit was utilized to measure the level of ROS. Our results revealed that NFKB1, which was upregulated in MACO rats and OGD/R-treated PC12 cells, was a target gene of naringin. Naringin could alleviate OGD/R-induced injury via promoting the proliferation, and repressing the apoptosis of PC12 cells through regulating the expression of NFKB1 and apoptosis-associated proteins and ROS level. Besides, the depletion of NFKB1 was positive to cell proliferation but negative to cell apoptosis. Moreover, the depletion of NFKB1 enhanced the influences of naringin on cell proliferation and apoptosis as well as the expression of apoptosis-related proteins and ROS level. Western blotting indicated that both naringin treatment and depletion of NFKB1 could increase the expression of HIF-1α, p-AKT, and p-mTOR compared with OGD/R group. What’s more, treatment by naringin and si-NFKB1 together could significantly increase these effects. Nevertheless, the expression of AKT and mTOR among each group was almost not changed. In conclusion, naringin could prevent the OGD/R-induced injury in PC12 cells in vitro by targeting NFKB1 and regulating HIF-1α/AKT/mTOR-signaling pathway, which might provide novel ideas for the therapy of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Hyperphosphorylated tau is the main component of neurofibrillary tangles and involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Increasing evidences suggest close associations between <em class="a-plus-plus">Porphyromonas gingivalis</em> (<em class="a-plus-plus">P. gingivalis</em>) and AD, but the relationship between <em class="a-plus-plus">P. gingivalis</em> and tau hyperphosphorylation is still unclear. In this study, we investigated whether peripheral infection with <em class="a-plus-plus">P. gingivalis</em> caused tau hyperphosphorylation by using wild Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and HT-22 cells. The rats were injected with <em class="a-plus-plus">P. gingivalis</em> suspension or phosphate-buffered saline 3 times per week. After 4 weeks or 12 weeks, the rats were sacrificed for analyzing systemic inflammation, neuroinflammation, and tau hyperphosphorylation. The results showed that the severity of phosphorylated tau at the AD-related sites Thr181 and Thr231 and the number of activated astrocytes were notably greater in the hippocampus of rats with <em class="a-plus-plus">P. gingivalis</em> injection. And the levels of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α in serum and hippocampus were also increased in the rats with <em class="a-plus-plus">P. gingivalis</em> injection. In addition, the activity of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) was significantly inhibited in the hippocampus of rats with <em class="a-plus-plus">P. gingivalis</em> injection. In vitro, IL-1β induced tau hyperphosphorylation by inhibiting the activity of PP2A in HT-22 cells and application of the PP2A promoter efficiently attenuated IL-1β-induced tau hyperphosphorylation in HT-22 cells. These results indicated that <em class="a-plus-plus">P. gingivalis</em> could induce tau hyperphosphorylation via, in part, attenuating the activity of PP2A through triggering systemic inflammation and neuroinflammation in wild-type SD rats.</p>

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to participate in the pathogenesis of several complex disorders such as immune-related disorders. Multiple sclerosis (MS) as an inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system has been associated with aberrant expression of several lncRNAs. In the current study, we assessed expression of NF-κB-, autophagy-, and obesity-associated lncRNAs/genes and two inflammatory cytokines in the peripheral blood of MS patients and healthy controls. <em class="a-plus-plus">LNC-MKI67IP</em> was down-regulated in total MS patients compared with total controls (<em class="a-plus-plus">P</em> value &lt; 0.0001).

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Neuritin (Nrn1) is a small highly conserved extracellular membrane protein involved in the process of neural cell survival and differentiation, axonal and dendritic growth, and synapse formation and maturation. Previous studies have demonstrated that intravitreal injection of recombinant Nrn1 as a gene therapy could alleviate retinal ganglion cell (RGC) apoptosis and promote optic nerve axon regeneration after optic nerve crush (ONC). However, the mechanism underlying the repairing effect of Nrn1 against optic never injury remains elusive. In this study, a rAAV2-mediated Nrn1 overexpression vector (AAV2-Nrn1) was applied to treat ONC through intravitreal injection for the purpose of further exploring the effect and mechanism of Nrn1 in repairing the injured optic nerve. The results showed that AAV2-Nrn1 was mainly transfected into RGCs without affecting astrocytes. Nrn1 overexpression effectively reduced RGC apoptosis and promoted optic nerve regeneration and visual function restoration as demonstrated by retinal imaging, histopathological analysis, and physiological function detection in vivo following ONC. Immunoblot assay revealed that functional molecules of Nrn1 activated the Akt1 and Stat3 pathways and inhibited the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. The results of the present study may provide experimental evidence for further application of Nrn1 to the clinical treatment of optic nerve injury.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">A variety of studies have proposed that transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) is involved in the progression of multiple diseases, including neuropathic pain. Although increased expression of TRPV1 in chronic constriction injury was described earlier, the underlying regulatory mechanisms of TRPV1 in neuropathic pain remain largely unknown. In our study, we constructed a chronic constriction injury (CCI) rat model to deeply analyze the mechanisms underlying TRPV1. RT-qPCR-indicated TRPV1 mRNA and protein expression were extremely upregulated in CCI rat dorsal spinal cord tissues. Then, TRPV1 was corroborated to interact with N-terminal EF-hand Ca<sup class="a-plus-plus">2+</sup>-binding protein 2 (NECAB2). The mRNA and protein levels of NECAB2 were increased in CCI tissues. Moreover, TRPV1 and NECAB2 together regulated nociceptive procession-associated protein metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (p-ERK1/2), and Ca<sup class="a-plus-plus">2+</sup> in isolated microglia of CCI rats. Moreover, TRPV1 upregulation apparently increased mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia as well as the expression of inflammation-associated genes (COX-2, TNF-α, and IL-6). In addition, downregulation of NECAB2 significantly decreased mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia as well as the expression of COX-2, TNF-α, and IL-6. Furthermore, TRPV1 was confirmed to be a downstream target of miR-338-3p. TRPV1 overexpression abolished the inhibitory effect by miR-338-3p elevation on neuropathic pain development. In summary, this study proved TRPV1, targeted by miR-338-3p, induced neuropathic pain by interacting with NECAB2, which provides a potential therapeutic target for neuropathic pain treatment.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) have been reported to be closely associated with various diseases, but their roles in TBI has not been fully elucidated. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the underlying mechanism of LncRNA HOTAIR in TBI-induced microglial activation and inflammatory factor release. In vivo mouse TBI model and in vitro microglia activation model were established by Feeney’s free-fall impact method and by LPS stimulation, respectively. The expression of LncRNA HOTAIR in activated microglia was detected by qRT-PCR. After shRNA knocked down, the expressions of LncRNA HOTAIR and microglia activation marker Iba-1 in microglia were detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot and by ELISA that detected the concentration of inflammatory factor in cell culture supernatants. The relationship between LncRNA HOTAIR and MYD88 in mouse microglia BV2 cells was observed by RNA pull-down assay. Furthermore, the effect of LncRNA HOTAIR on MYD88 stability was assessed by cycloheximide (CHX)-chase and by immunoprecipitation and ubiquitination assays that analyzed MYD88 ubiquitination. LncRNA HOTAIR was abnormally highly expressed in activated microglia. By Western blot and ELISA, the knockdown of LncRNA HOTAIR in microglia significantly repressed microglia activation and inflammatory factor release. By RNA pull-down assay, LncRNA HOTAIR could bind to MYD88 protein. Besides, by cycloheximide (CHX)-chase and immunoprecipitation and ubiquitination assays, the overexpression of the LncRNA HOTAIR enhanced the stability of MYD88 protein and inhibited Nrdp1-mediated ubiquitination of MYD88 protein. After the transfection of shRNA-HOTAIR and shRNA-HOTAIR+pcDNA-MYD88 into microglia, shRNA-HOTAIR could significantly inhibit the activation of microglia and the release of inflammatory factors, while these effects were reversed after the transfection of pcDNA-MYD88. Our experimental data indicated that LncRNA HOTAIR was highly expressed in activated microglia, and our further studies had found that the interference with LncRNA HOTAIR could repress microglia activation and inflammatory factor release via promoting Nrdp1-mediated ubiquitination of MYD88 protein.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">This study was designed to test whether the <em class="a-plus-plus">Cronobacter sakazakii</em> infection-impaired contextual learning and memory are mediated by the activation of the complement system; subsequent activation of inflammatory signals leads to alternations in serotonin transporter (SERT). To test this, rat pups (postnatal day, PND 15) were treated with either <em class="a-plus-plus">C. sakazakii</em> (10<sup class="a-plus-plus">7</sup> CFU) or <em class="a-plus-plus">Escherichia coli</em> OP50 (10<sup class="a-plus-plus">7</sup> CFU) or Luria bertani broth (100 μL) through oral gavage and allowed to stay with their mothers until PND 24. Experimental groups’ rats were allowed to explore (PNDs 31–35) and then trained in contextual learning task (PNDs 36–43). Five days after training, individuals were tested for memory retention (PNDs 49–56). Observed behavioural data showed that <em class="a-plus-plus">C. sakazakii</em> infection impaired contextual-associative learning and memory. Furthermore, our analysis showed that <em class="a-plus-plus">C. sakazakii</em> infection activates complement system complement anaphylatoxin (C5a) (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS1)) and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase1 (MEKK1). Subsequently, MEKK1 induces pro-inflammatory signals possibly through apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1 (ASK-1), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK1/3) and protein kinase B gamma (AKT-3). In parallel, activated nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer B cells (NF-κB) induces interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IFNα-1, which may alter the level of serotonin transporter (SERT). Observed results suggest that impaired contextual learning and memory could be correlated with C5a-mediated NF-κβ and ASK1 pathways.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is considered a prevalent neurological disorder with a neurodegenerative nature in elderly people. Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation due to amyloid β (Aβ) peptides are strongly involved in AD pathogenesis. Klotho is an anti-aging protein with multiple protective effects that its deficiency is involved in development of age-related disorders. In this study, we investigated the beneficial effect of Klotho pretreatment at different concentrations of 0.5, 1, and 2 nM against Aβ1–42 toxicity at a concentration of 20 μM in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Our findings showed that Klotho could significantly and partially restore cell viability and decrease reactive oxygen species (known as ROS) and improve superoxide dismutase activity (SOD) in addition to reduction of caspase 3 activity and DNA fragmentation following Aβ1–42 challenge. In addition, exogenous Klotho also reduced inflammatory biomarkers consisting of nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in Aβ-exposed cells. Besides, Klotho caused downregulation of Wnt1 level, upregulation of phosphorylated cyclic AMP response element binding (pCREB), and mRNA levels of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) with no significant alteration of epsilon isoform of protein kinase C (PKCε) after Aβ toxicity. In summary, Klotho could alleviate apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation in human neuroblastoma cells after Aβ challenge and its beneficial effect is partially exerted through appropriate modulation of Wnt1/pCREB/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">RAB7, a member of RAS oncogene family–like 1 (RAB7L1), is a GTPase belonging to the Rab family and acts as an upstream regulator to regulate the kinase activity of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2). Although LRRK2 has been shown to aggravate secondary brain injury (SBI) after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), it is unknown whether RAB7L1 is also involved in this process. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the role of RAB7L1 in ICH-induced SBI in vivo. Autologous blood was injected into adult male Sprague-Dawley rats to induce an ICH model in vivo. The results showed that the protein levels of RAB7L1 increased after ICH. Overexpression of RAB7L1 induced neuronal apoptosis and damage, as demonstrated by TUNEL-positive and FJB-positive cells, and exacerbated ICH-induced learning and cognitive dysfunctions; in contrast, downregulation of RAB7L1 via RNA interference yielded comparatively opposite changes in these parameters. In summary, this study demonstrates that RAB7L1 promotes SBI after ICH and may represent a potential target for ICH therapy.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Genomic studies on schizophrenia (SCZ) have revealed several candidate genes involved in excitatory synapse function and plasticity associated with its etiology. SHANK2 is a postsynaptic scaffolding protein, which anchors a protein complex connecting NMDAR, AMPAR, and mGluR receptors at excitatory neuronal synapses. Mutations in the <em class="a-plus-plus">SHANK2</em> gene have been reported to be associated with human autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and SCZ. To identify variants in the <em class="a-plus-plus">SHANK2</em> gene and determine the association of <em class="a-plus-plus">SHANK2</em> with SCZ in the Chinese Uygur population, we conducted targeted sequencing of whole exon regions and exon-intron boundaries of <em class="a-plus-plus">SHANK2</em> in 1574 SCZ patients and 1481 healthy controls. A total of 149 variants were identified, including six common variants and 143 rare variants. For common variants, rs62622853 and rs3924047 showed allelic significance with SCZ before correction, but the association was eliminated after Bonferroni correction. Seven rare nonsynonymous variants, p.Arg739Trp, p.Pro807Leu, p.Ile854Phe, p.Thr1322Ser, p.Leu1434Arg, p.Val1486Ile, and p.Thr1674Met, occurred only in the patients but not in any of the healthy controls. In silico analysis predicted that p.Arg739Trp, p.Leu1434Arg, and p.Val1486Ile variants are likely to be damaging. The present study suggests that individuals with two novel rare nonsynonymous variants (p.Arg739Trp, p.Leu1434Arg) and p.Val1486Ile variants of <em class="a-plus-plus">SHANK2</em> might increase the susceptibility to developing SCZ disorder.</p>

Genetic perturbations of cerebral cortical development can lead to neurodevelopmental disease, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To identify genomic regions crucial to corticogenesis, we mapped the activity of gene-regulatory elements generating a single-cell atlas of gene expression and chromatin accessibility both independently and jointly. This revealed waves of gene regulation by key transcription factors (TFs) across a nearly continuous differentiation trajectory into glutamatergic neurons, distinguished the expression programs of glial lineages, and identified lineage-determining TFs that exhibited strong correlation between linked gene-regulatory elements and expression levels. These highly connected genes adopted an active chromatin state in early differentiating cells, consistent with lineage commitment. Basepair-resolution neural network models identified strong cell-type specific enrichment of noncoding mutations predicted to be disruptive in a cohort of ASD subjects and identified frequently disrupted TF binding sites. This approach illustrates how cell-type specific mapping can provide insights into the programs governing human development and disease.

Rett syndrome (RTT) is a devastating neurodevelopmental disorder, caused by disruptions to the MECP2 gene, and resulting in severe cognitive and motor impairment. Previous work strongly suggests that healthy MECP2 function is required to have a normal balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurons. However, the details of how neural circuit dynamics and motor function are disrupted remain unclear. How might imbalanced E/I cause problems for motor function in RTT? We addressed this question in the motor cortex of awake, freely behaving rats, comparing normal rats with a transgenic rat model of RTT. We recorded single-unit spiking activity while simultaneously recording body movement of the rats. We found that RTT rats tend to have excessive synchrony among neurons in the motor cortex and less complex body movements. Importantly, greater synchrony was correlated with greater stereotypy of relationships between neurons and body movements. To further test how our observations were related to an E/I imbalance, we pharmacologically altered inhibitory synaptic interactions. We were able to recapitulate many of the phenomena we found in MECP2-deficient rats by enhancing inhibition in normal rats. Our results suggest that RTT-related E/I imbalance in the motor cortex gives rise to excessive synchrony and, consequently, a stereotyped motor code, which may underlie abnormal motor function in RTT.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.29.424235v1?rss=1">Why sensory neurons are tuned to multiple stimulus features</a></h4>

Many sensory neurons encode information about more than one stimulus feature. Multidimensional tuning increases ambiguity in stimulus-response relationships, but we find that it also offers an unexpected computational advantage, allowing the brain to better reconstruct sensory stimuli. From the responses of sensory neurons, populations, and sensory-driven movement behavior, more information can be recovered about a stimulus vector than about its individual components. We term this coding advantage 'stimulus synergy' and show that it is distinct from other coding synergies, arising from inseparability of the response- conditioned stimulus distribution along individual stimulus dimensions. From extracellular recordings in motion sensitive cortex and measurements of pursuit eye movements, we demonstrate that stimulus synergy in cortical populations is preserved downstream in the precision of pursuit, and that a common decoding model predicts the level of synergy in pursuit behavior. This suggests that the brain exploits the information advantage afforded by multidimensional sensory tuning.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>It is unclear if stopping treatment with dabigatran, a new oral anticoagulant (NOAC), induces a paradoxical rebound prothrombotic state. We investigated if short‐term (1–3 days) dabigatran cessation is associated with a higher thrombus volume than expected from a simple reversal of the anticoagulant effect.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Ten‐week‐old C57Bl/6 mice (n = 338) received one of the following oral treatments: phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS), dabigatran for 7 days with or without 1 to 4 day cessation, and aspirin in either a single dose or daily for 7 days. Some of the animals that ceased dabigatran for 1 to 3 days received single‐dose aspirin. Thereafter, we induced FeCl<sub>3</sub>‐mediated carotid thrombosis in 130 mice, after which we performed micro computed tomography thrombus imaging. The other 208 mice underwent coagulation assays or platelet function tests. As an explorative pilot study, we reviewed the medical records of 18 consecutive patients with NOAC cessation‐related cerebral infarction in a large acute stroke cohort.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We observed a ~ 40% higher volume of carotid thrombus after dabigatran cessation at 1 to 3 days than after vehicle treatment and showed that this effect could be prevented by single‐dose aspirin pretreatment. Dabigatran cessation unduly increased platelet aggregability for 2 days after drug cessation, an effect mediated through thrombin or arachidonic acid, which effect was significantly attenuated by single‐dose aspirin pretreatment. In patients, short‐term (≤ 3 days) cessation of NOAC therapy, compared with longer‐term (≥ 5 days) cessation, tended to be associated with relatively high stroke severity.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We provide the first preclinical evidence that a rebound prothrombotic state follows short‐term cessation of dabigatran therapy. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Cardiac troponin is a specific and sensitive biomarker to identify and quantify myocardial injury. Myocardial injury is frequently detected after acute ischemic stroke and strongly associated with unfavorable outcomes. Concomitant acute coronary syndrome is only one of several possible differential diagnoses that may cause elevation of cardiac troponin after stroke. As a result, there are uncertainties regarding the correct interpretation and optimal management of stroke patients with myocardial injury in clinical practice. Elevation of cardiac troponin may occur as part of a ‘Stroke-Heart Syndrome’. The term ‘Stroke-Heart Syndrome’ subsumes a clinical spectrum of cardiac complications after stroke including cardiac injury, dysfunction, and arrhythmia which may relate to disturbances of autonomic function and the brain–heart axis. In this review, we provide an up-to-date overview about prognostic implications, mechanisms, and management of elevated cardiac troponin levels in patients with acute ischemic stroke.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Conditioning transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with subthreshold conditioning stimulus followed by supra-threshold test stimulus at inter-stimulus intervals (ISI) of 1–5 ms results in inhibition (SICI), while ISI at 10–15 ms results in facilitation (ICF). One concerning issue, applying ICF/SICI protocols on patients is the substantial protocol variability. Here, we hypothesized that increasing the number of CS could result in more robust ICF/SICI protocols. Twenty healthy subjects participated in the study. Motor-evoked potentials (MEP) were obtained from conditioning TMS with a varying number of conditioning stimuli in 3, 4, 10, and 15 ms ISI over the primary motor cortex. MEP amplitudes were then compared to examine excitability. TMS with 3, 5, and 7 conditioning stimuli but not with one conditioning stimulus induced ICF. Moreover, 10 ms ISI produced stronger ICF than 15 ms ISI. Significant SICI was only induced with one conditioning stimulus. Besides, 3 ms ISI resulted in stronger SICI than 4 ms ISI. Only a train of conditioning stimuli induced stable ICF and may be more advantageous than the classical paired pulse ICF paradigm.</p>

Changes in available nutrients are inevitable events for most living organisms. Upon nutritional stress, several signaling pathways cooperate to change the transcription program through chromatin regulation to rewire cellular metabolism. In budding yeast, histone H3 threonine 11 phosphorylation (H3pT11) acts as a marker of low glucose stress and regulates the transcription of nutritional stress responsive genes. Understanding how this histone modification 'senses' external glucose changes remains elusive. Here, we show that Tda1, the yeast orthologue of human Nuak1, is a direct kinase for H3pT11 upon low glucose stress. Yeast AMPK directly phosphorylates Tda1 to govern Tda1 activity, while CK2 regulates Tda1 nuclear localization. Collectively, AMPK and CK2 signaling converge on histone kinase Tda1 to link external low glucose stress to chromatin regulation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63550">The brain in motion: How ensemble fluidity drives memory-updating and flexibility</a></h4>

While memories are often thought of as flashbacks to a previous experience, they do not simply conserve veridical representations of the past but must continually integrate new information to ensure survival in dynamic environments. Therefore, ‘drift’ in neural firing patterns, typically construed as disruptive ‘instability’ or an undesirable consequence of noise, may actually be useful for updating memories. In our view, continual modifications in memory representations reconcile classical theories of stable memory traces with neural drift. Here we review how memory representations are updated through dynamic recruitment of neuronal ensembles on the basis of excitability and functional connectivity at the time of learning. Overall, we emphasize the importance of considering memories not as static entities, but instead as flexible network states that reactivate and evolve across time and experience.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63493">Circuit and synaptic organization of forebrain-to-midbrain pathways that promote and suppress vocalization</a></h4>

Animals vocalize only in certain behavioral contexts, but the circuits and synapses through which forebrain neurons trigger or suppress vocalization remain unknown. Here we used transsynaptic tracing to identify two populations of inhibitory neurons that lie upstream of neurons in the periaqueductal gray that gate the production of ultrasonic vocalizations in mice (i.e., PAG-USV neurons). Activating PAG-projecting neurons in the preoptic hypothalamus (POA<sub>PAG </sub>neurons) elicited USV production in the absence of social cues. In contrast, activating PAG-projecting neurons in the central-medial boundary zone of the amygdala (Amg<sub>C/M-PAG </sub>neurons) transiently suppressed USV production without disrupting non-vocal social behavior. Optogenetics-assisted circuit mapping in brain slices revealed that POA<sub>PAG</sub> neurons directly inhibit PAG interneurons, which in turn inhibit PAG-USV neurons, whereas Amg<sub>C/M-PAG</sub> neurons directly inhibit PAG-USV neurons. These experiments identify two major forebrain inputs to the PAG that trigger and suppress vocalization, respectively, while also establishing the synaptic mechanisms through which these neurons exert opposing behavioral effects.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/62963">Dose-dependent action of the RNA binding protein FOX-1 to relay X-Chromosome number and determine <i>C. elegans</i> sex</a></h4>

We demonstrate how RNA binding protein FOX-1 functions as a dose-dependent X-signal element to communicate X-chromosome number and thereby determine nematode sex. FOX-1, an RNA recognition motif protein, triggers hermaphrodite development in XX embryos by causing non-productive alternative pre-mRNA splicing of <i>xol-1</i>, the master sex-determination switch gene that triggers male development in XO embryos. RNA binding experiments together with genome editing demonstrate that FOX-1 binds to multiple GCAUG and GCACG motifs in a <i>xol-1</i> intron, causing intron retention or partial exon deletion, thereby eliminating male-determining XOL-1 protein. Transforming all motifs to GCAUG or GCACG permits accurate alternative splicing, demonstrating efficacy of both motifs. Mutating subsets of both motifs partially alleviates non-productive splicing. Mutating all motifs blocks it, as does transforming them to low-affinity GCUUG motifs. Combining multiple high-affinity binding sites with the two-fold change in FOX-1 concentration between XX and XO embryos achieves dose-sensitivity in splicing regulation to determine sex.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/62238">Adaptive evolution of nontransitive fitness in yeast</a></h4>

A common misconception is that evolution is a linear 'march of progress', where each organism along a line of descent is more fit than all those that came before it. Rejecting this misconception implies that evolution is nontransitive: a series of adaptive events will, on occasion, produce organisms that are less fit compared to a distant ancestor. Here we identify a nontransitive evolutionary sequence in a 1,000-generation yeast evolution experiment. We show that nontransitivity arises due to adaptation in the yeast nuclear genome combined with the stepwise deterioration of an intracellular virus, which provides an advantage over viral competitors within host cells. Extending our analysis, we find that nearly half of our ~140 populations experience multilevel selection, fixing adaptive mutations in both the nuclear and viral genomes. Our results provide a mechanistic case-study for the adaptive evolution of nontransitivity due to multilevel selection in a 1,000-generation host/virus evolution experiment.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/61968">Metage2Metabo, microbiota-scale metabolic complementarity for the identication of key species</a></h4>

To capture the functional diversity of microbiota, one must identify metabolic functions and species of interest within hundreds or thousands of microorganisms. We present Metage2Metabo (M2M) a resource that meets the need for de-novo functional screening of genome-scale metabolic networks (GSMNs) at the scale of a metagenome, and the identification of critical species with respect to metabolic cooperation. M2M comprises a flexible pipeline for the characterisation of individual metabolisms and collective metabolic complementarity. In addition, M2M identifies key species, that are meaningful members of the community for functions of interest. We demonstrate that M2M is applicable to collections of genomes as well as metagenome-assembled genomes, permits an efficient GSMN reconstruction with Pathway Tools, and assesses the cooperation potential between species. M2M identifies key organisms by reducing the complexity of a large-scale microbiota into minimal communities with equivalent properties, suitable for further analyses.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/60376">Metabolic control of cellular immune-competency by odors in <i>Drosophila</i></a></h4>

Studies in different animal model systems have revealed the impact of odors on immune cells, however, any understanding on why and how odors control cellular immunity remained unclear. We find that <i>Drosophila</i> employ an olfactory-immune cross-talk to tune a specific cell type, the lamellocytes, from hematopoietic-progenitor cells. We show that neuronally released GABA derived upon olfactory stimulation, is utilized by blood-progenitor cells as a metabolite and through its catabolism, these cells stabilize Sima/HIFα protein. Sima capacitates blood-progenitor cells with the ability to initiate lamellocyte differentiation. This systemic axis becomes relevant for larvae dwelling in wasp-infested environments where chances of infection are high. By co-opting the olfactory route, the pre-conditioned animals elevate their systemic GABA levels leading to the up-regulation of blood-progenitor cell Sima expression. This elevates their immune-potential and primes them to respond rapidly when infected with parasitic wasps. The present work highlights the importance of the olfaction in immunity and shows how odor detection during animal development is utilized to establish a long-range axis in the control of blood-progenitor competency and immune-priming.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59928">Common cell type nomenclature for the mammalian brain</a></h4>

The advancement of single cell RNA-sequencing technologies has led to an explosion of cell type definitions across multiple organs and organisms. While standards for data and metadata intake are arising, organization of cell types has largely been left to individual investigators, resulting in widely varying nomenclature and limited alignment between taxonomies. To facilitate cross-dataset comparison, the Allen Institute created the Common Cell type Nomenclature (CCN) for matching and tracking cell types across studies that is qualitatively similar to gene transcript management across different genome builds. The CCN can be readily applied to new or established taxonomies and was applied herein to diverse cell type datasets derived from multiple quantifiable modalities. The CCN facilitates assigning accurate yet flexible cell type names in the mammalian cortex as a step towards community-wide efforts to organize multi-source, data-driven information related to cell type taxonomies from any organism.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59659">Def6 regulates endogenous type-I interferon responses in osteoblasts and suppresses osteogenesis</a></h4>

Bone remodeling involves a balance between bone resorption and formation. The mechanisms underlying bone remodeling are not well understood. DEF6 is recently identified as a novel loci associated with bone mineral density. However, it is unclear how Def6 impacts bone remodeling. We identify Def6 as a novel osteoblastic regulator that suppresses osteoblastogenesis and bone formation. Def6 deficiency enhances both bone resorption and osteogenesis. The enhanced bone resorption in Def6<sup>-/-</sup> mice dominates, leading to osteoporosis. Mechanistically, Def6 inhibits the differentiation of both osteoclasts and osteoblasts via a common mechanism through endogenous type-I IFN-mediated feedback inhibition. RNAseq analysis shows expression of a group of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) during osteoblastogenesis. Furthermore, we found that Def6 is a key upstream regulator of IFNβ and ISG expression in osteoblasts. Collectively, our results identify a novel immunoregulatory function of Def6 in bone remodeling, and shed insights into the interaction between immune system and bone.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56029">Recent shifts in the genomic ancestry of Mexican Americans may alter the genetic architecture of biomedical traits</a></h4>

People in the Americas represent a diverse continuum of populations with varying degrees of admixture among African, European, and Amerindigenous ancestries. In the United States, populations with non-European ancestry remain understudied, and thus little is known about the genetic architecture of phenotypic variation in these populations. Using genotype data from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos, we find that Amerindigenous ancestry increased by an average of ~20% spanning 1940s-1990s in Mexican Americans. These patterns result from complex interactions between several population and cultural factors which shaped patterns of genetic variation and influenced the genetic architecture of complex traits in Mexican Americans. We show for height how polygenic risk scores based on summary statistics from a European-based genome-wide association study perform poorly in Mexican Americans. Our findings reveal temporal changes in population structure within Hispanics/Latinos that may influence biomedical traits, demonstrating a need to improve our understanding of admixed populations.

Significance: We propose a robust video-based method for estimating the positions of fNIRS optodes on the scalp. Aim: Calibrating the location of optodes relative to a subject's scalp is an important step in acquisition of reliable neuroimaging data, and is a relatively open problem when dealing with developmental populations. Existing methods pose various motion constraints, require expert annotation and are only applicable in laboratory conditions. A quick and robust framework to deal with these issues is required. Approach: Using a variety of novel computer-vision technologies, we implement a fully-automatic appearance-based method that estimates the registration parameters from a raw video of the subject. We validate our method on 10 adult subjects and prove its usability with infants as well. Results: We compare our method with the golden standard 3D digitizer, and to other photogrammetry based approaches. We show it achieves state-of-the-art results. Our method is implemented as a freely available open-source toolbox at https://github.com/yoterel/STORM. Conclusions: Our method allows to calibrate the fNIRS system in a simple way, with unprecedented speed and accuracy. Fast calibration facilitates more spatially precise neuroimaging with developmental and clinical populations even in unconventional environments.

The adult brain retains endogenous neural stem/precursors cells (eNPCs) in two major neurogenic niches, the subgranular zone (SGZ) in the hippocampus and the subventricular zone (SVZ). While in humans and rodents the SGZ contributes to memory functions by generating new neurons that integrate into hippocampal circuitry, the role of eNPCs of the SVZ is less clear. SVZ-eNPCs contribute to the generation of new neurons fated to the olfactory bulb (OB) in rodents but not in humans where they are thought to contribute to striatal neurogenesis as a result of tissue damage. Here, we show in mice and humans a novel non-neurogenic physiological role of adult SVZ-eNPCs in supporting cognitive functions by regulating striatal neuronal activity. We first provide evidence that GABAergic transmission between parvalbumin-expressing fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) and medium spiny neurons (MSNs) is tuned by SVZ-eNPCs via secretion of Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein Like 1 (IGFBPL-1) that, in turn, regulates the Insulin-Like Growth Factor (IGF-1) signalling cascade. Consistently, selective ablation of SVZ-eNPCs and in vivo disruption of the IGF-signalling determine the impairment of intrastriatal coherence. A finding associated with a higher failure rate of GABAergic transmission mediated by FSIs and with striatum-related behavioural dysfunctions impairing decision making. Human validation studies revealed IGFBPL-1 expression in the SVZ and in foetal and induced-pluripotent stem cell-derived NPCs as well as a strong correlation in neurological patients between SVZ pathological damage, reduction of striatum volume and impairment of information processing speed. All in all, our results highlight a novel non-neurogenic homeostatic role exerted by SVZ-eNPCs on striatal GABAergic neurons that might contribute to cognitive processes involving decisions-making tasks.

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in a global pandemic. In addition to respiratory complications as a result of SARS-CoV-2 illness, accumulating evidence suggests that neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms are associated with the disease caused by the virus. In this study, we investigated the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1 stimulation on neuroinflammation in BV-2 microglia. Analyses of culture supernatants revealed an increase in the production of TNF, IL-6, IL-1{beta} and iNOS/NO. SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1 increased protein expressions of phospho-p65 and phospho-I{kappa}B, as well as enhancing DNA binding and transcriptional activity of NF-{kappa}B. Pro-inflammatory effects of the glycoprotein effects were reduced in the presence of BAY11-7082 (1 M). The presence of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1 in BV-2 microglia increased the protein expression of NLRP3, as well as caspase-1 activity. However, pre-treatment with CRID3 (1 M) or BAY11-7082 (1 M) resulted in the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome/caspase-1. It was also observed that CRID3 attenuated SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1-induced increase in IL-1{beta} production. Increased protein expression of p38 MAPK was observed in BV-2 microglia stimulated with the spike glycoprotein S1, and was reduced in the presence of SKF 86002. These results have provided the first evidence demonstrating SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 glycoprotein-induced neuroinflammation in BV-2 microglia. We propose that promotion of neuroinflammation by this glycoprotein is mediated through activation of NF-{kappa}B, NLRP3 inflammasome and p38 MAPK. These results are significant because of their relevance to our understanding of neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms observed in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.

Computational models of animal biosonar seek to identify critical aspects of echo processing responsible for the superior, real-time performance of echolocating bats and dolphins in target tracking and clutter rejection. The Spectrogram Correlation and Transformation (SCAT) model replicates aspects of biosonar imaging in both species by processing wideband biosonar sounds and echoes with auditory mechanisms identified from experiments with bats. The model acquires broadband biosonar broadcasts and echoes, represents them as time-frequency spectrograms using parallel bandpass filters, translates the filtered signals into ten parallel amplitude threshold levels, and then operates on the resulting time-of-occurrence values at each frequency to estimate overall echo range delay. It uses the structure of the echo spectrum by depicting it as a series of local frequency nulls arranged regularly along the frequency axis of the spectrograms after dechirping them relative to the broadcast. Computations take place entirely on the timing of threshold-crossing events for each echo relative to threshold-events for the broadcast. Threshold-crossing times take into account amplitude-latency trading, a physiological feature absent from conventional digital signal processing. Amplitude-latency trading transposes the profile of amplitudes across frequencies into a profile of time-registrations across frequencies. Target shape is extracted from the spacing of the object's individual acoustic reflecting points, or glints, using the mutual interference pattern of peaks and nulls in the echo spectrum. These are merged with the overall range-delay estimate to produce a delay-based reconstruction of the object's distance as well as its glints. Clutter echoes indiscriminately activate multiple parts in the null-detecting system, which then produces the equivalent glint-delay spacings in images, thus blurring the overall echo-delay estimates by adding spurious glint delays to the image. Blurring acts as an anticorrelation process that rejects clutter intrusion into perceptions.

The hippocampal local field potential (LFP) exhibits a strong correlation with behavior. During rest, the theta rhythm is not prominent, but during active behavior, there are strong rhythms in the theta, theta harmonics, and gamma ranges. With increasing running velocity, theta, theta harmonics and gamma increase in power and in cross-frequency coupling, suggesting that neural entrainment is a direct consequence of the total excitatory input. While it is common to study the parametric range between the LFP and its complementing power spectra between deep rest and epochs of high running velocity, it is also possible to explore how the spectra degrades as the energy is completely quenched from the system. Specifically, it is unknown whether the 1/f slope is preserved as synaptic activity becomes diminished, as low frequencies are generated by large pools of neurons while higher frequencies comprise the activity of more local neuronal populations. To test this hypothesis, we examined rat LFPs recorded from the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex during barbiturate overdose euthanasia. Within the hippocampus, the initial stage entailed a quasi-stationary stage when the LFP spectrum exhibited power-law feature while the frequency components over 20 Hz exhibited a power decay with a similar decay rate. This stage was followed by a rapid collapse of power spectrum towards the absolute electrothermal noise background. As the collapse of activity occurred later in hippocampus compared with medial entorhinal cortex or visual cortex, it suggests that the ability of a neural network to maintain the 1/f slope with decreasing energy is a function of general connectivity. Broadly, these data support the energy cascade theory where there is a cascade of energy from large cortical populations into smaller loops, such as those that supports the higher frequency gamma rhythm. As energy is pulled from the system, neural entrainment at gamma frequency (and higher) decline first. The larger loops, comprising a larger population, are fault-tolerant to a point capable of maintaining their activity before a final collapse.

Decisions requiring the gradual accrual of sensory evidence appear to recruit widespread cortical areas. However, the nature of the contributions of different regions remains unclear. Here we trained mice to accumulate evidence over seconds while navigating in virtual reality, and optogenetically silenced the activity of many cortical areas during different brief trial epochs. We found that the inactivation of different areas primarily affected the evidence-accumulation computation per se, rather than other decision-related processes. Specifically, we observed selective changes in the weighting of evidence over time, such that frontal inactivations led to deficits on longer timescales than posterior cortical ones. Likewise, large-scale cortical Ca2+ activity during task performance displayed different temporal integration windows matching the effects of inactivation. Our findings suggest that distributed cortical areas accumulate evidence following their hierarchy of intrinsic timescales.

Understanding the many facets of the organization of brain dynamics at large scales remains largely unexplored. Here, we construct a brain-wide model based on recent progress in biologically-realistic population models obtained using mean-field techniques. We use The Virtual Brain (TVB) as a simulation platform and incorporate mean-field models of networks of Adaptive Exponential (AdEx) integrate-and-fire neurons. Such models can capture the main intrinsic firing properties of central neurons, such as adaptation, and also include the typical kinetics of postsynaptic conductances. We hypothesize that such features are important to a biologically realistic simulation of brain dynamics. The resulting ``TVB-AdEx'' model is shown here to generate two fundamental dynamical states, asynchronous-irregular (AI) and Up-Down states, which correspond to the asynchronous and synchronized dynamics of wakefulness and slow-wave sleep, respectively. The synchrony of slow waves appear as an emergent property at large scales, and reproduce the very different patterns of functional connectivity found in slow-waves compared to asynchronous states. Next, we simulated experiments with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) during asynchronous and slow-wave states, and show that, like in experimental data, the effect of the stimulation greatly depends on the activity state. During slow waves, the response is strong but remains local, in contrast with asynchronous states, where the response is weaker but propagates across brain areas. To compare more quantitatively with wake and slow-wave sleep states, we compute the perturbational complexity index and show that it matches the value estimated from TMS experiments. We conclude that the TVB-AdEx model replicates some of the properties of synchrony and responsiveness seen in the human brain, and is a promising tool to study spontaneous and evoked large-scale dynamics in the normal, anesthetized or pathological brain.

Metabolism is physiologically fundamental to a biological system. Understanding brain metabolism is critical for our comprehensive knowledge of brain function in health and disease. Combining a microarray collection system with targeted metabolomics analysis, here we performed precision mapping of the metabolome in the mouse brain and created maps for 79 metabolites with a resolution of 0.125mm3 per pixel (i.e., brain subregion). The metabolome atlas provides researchers with a useful resource to interpret the vulnerability of specific brain regions to various disease-relevant metabolic perturbations.

Dynamic causal models (DCMs) of electrophysiological data allow, in principle, for inference on hidden, bulk synaptic function in neural circuits. The directed influences between the neuronal elements of modeled circuits are subject to delays due to the finite transmission speed of axonal connections. Ordinary differential equations are therefore not adequate to capture the ensuing circuit dynamics, and delay differential equations (DDEs) are required instead. Previous work has illustrated that the integration of DDEs in DCMs benefits from sophisticated integration schemes in order to ensure rigorous parameter estimation and correct model identification. However, integration schemes that have been proposed for DCMs either emphasise speed (at the possible expense of accuracy) or robustness (but with computational costs that are problematic in practice). In this technical note, we propose an alternative integration scheme that overcomes these shortcomings and offers high computational efficiency while correctly preserving the nature of delayed effects. This integration scheme is available as open-source code in the Translational Algorithms for Psychiatry-Advancing Science (TAPAS) toolbox and can be easily integrated into existing software (SPM) for the analysis of DCMs for electrophysiological data. While this paper focuses on its application to the convolution-based formalism of DCMs, the new integration scheme can be equally applied to more advanced formulations of DCMs (e.g. conductance based models). Our method provides a new option for electrophysiological DCMs that offers the speed required for scientific projects, but also the accuracy required for rigorous translational applications, e.g. in computational psychiatry.

Background and Purpose: Quality assessment of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) is of vital importance to a wide range of animal studies of stroke such as reperfusion therapy. However, a non-invasive and objective assessment method is still lacking. Herein, we propose an image feature-based protocol to assess the quality of the procedure. Methods: We performed permanent MCAO to a total of 161 Sprague-Dawley rats. Micro positron emission tomography (PET) images were acquired both before and after the MCAO procedure. Triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining was also conducted as a ground truth to ensure the MCAO quality. After preprocessing of the PET images, a combination of 3D scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) and support vector machine (SVM) was applied to extract features and train a classifier that can assess the quality of the MCAO procedure. Results: 106 rats and 212 images were used as training data to construct the classification model. The SVM classifier achieved over 98% accuracy in cross validation. 10 rats with TTC results served as validation data as the staining showed clear infarction in the ipsilateral brain. Their images were tested by the classifier and all of them were categorized into the correct group. Finally, the remaining 45 rats from a separate experiment were treated as independent test data. The prediction accuracy for their 90 images reached the level of 91%. An online interface was constructed for users to upload their scans and obtain the assessment results. Conclusion: This image-based protocol provides a convenient, quantitative and non-invasive tool to assess the quality of the MCAO procedure.

Understanding animal thermal tolerance is crucial to predict how animals will respond to increasingly warmer temperatures, and to mitigate the impact of the climate change on species survival. Yet, the physiological mechanisms underlying animal thermal tolerance are largely unknown. In this study, we developed a method for measuring upper thermal limit (CTmax) in larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) and found that it occurs at similar temperatures as in adult zebrafish. We discovered that CTmax precedes a transient, heat-induced brain-wide depolarization during heat ramping. By monitoring heart rate, we established that cardiac function is sub-optimal during the period where CTmax and brain depolarization occur. In addition, we found that oxygen availability affects both locomotor neural activity and CTmax during a heat stress. The findings of this study suggest that neural impairment due to limited oxygen availability at high temperatures can cause CTmax in zebrafish.

We transduced mouse cortical astrocytes cultured from four litters of embryonic wildtype (WT) and connexin43 (Cx43) null mouse pups with lentiviral vector encoding hTERT and measured expression of astrocyte-specific markers up to passage 10 (p10). The immortalized cell lines thus generated (designated IWCA and IKOCA, respectively) expressed biomarkers consistent with those of neonatal astrocytes, including Cx43 from wildtype but not from Cx43-null mice, lack of Cx30, and presence of Cx26. AQP4, the water channel that is found in high abundance in astrocyte end-feet, was expressed at moderately high levels in early passages, and its mRNA and protein declined to low but still detectable levels by p10. The mRNA levels of the astrocyte biomarkers aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1), glutamine synthetase (GS) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) remained relatively constant during successive passages. GS protein expression was maintained while GFAP declined with cell passaging but was still detectable at p10. Both mRNA and protein levels of glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1) declined with passage number. Immunostaining at corresponding times was consistent with the data from Western blots and provided evidence that these proteins were expressed at appropriate intracellular locations. Consistent with our goal of generating immortalized cell lines in which Cx43 was either functionally expressed or absent, IWCA cells were found to be well coupled with respect to intercellular dye transfer and similar to primary astrocyte cultures in terms of time course of junction formation, electrical coupling strength and voltage sensitivity. Moreover, barrier function was enhanced in co-culture of the IWCA cell line with bEnd.3 microvascular endothelial cells. In addition, immunostaining revealed oblate endogenous Cx43 gap junction plaques in IWCA that were similar in appearance to those plaques obtained following transfection of IKOCA cells with fluorescent protein tagged Cx43. Re-expression of Cx43 in IKOCA cells allows experimental manipulation of connexins and live imaging of interactions between connexins and other proteins. We conclude that properties of these cell lines resemble those of primary cultured astrocytes, and they may provide useful tools in functional studies by facilitating genetic and pharmacological manipulations in the context of an astrocyte-appropriate cellular environment.

The central nervous system plans human reaching movements with stereotypically smooth kinematic trajectories and fairly consistent durations. Smoothness seems to be explained by accuracy as a primary movement objective, whereas duration seems to avoid excess energy expenditure. But energy does not explain smoothness, so that two aspects of the same movement are governed by seemingly incompatible objectives. Here we show that smoothness is actually economical, because humans expend more metabolic energy for jerkier motions. The proposed mechanism is an underappreciated cost proportional to the rate of muscle force production, for calcium transport to activate muscle. We experimentally tested that energy cost in humans (N=10) performing bimanual reaches cyclically. The empirical cost was then demonstrated to predict smooth, discrete reaches, previously attributed to accuracy alone. A mechanistic, physiologically measurable, energy cost may therefore unify smoothness and duration, and help resolve motor redundancy in reaching movements.

There is an urgent need for new pain-relieving therapies. We have previously shown using mouse models of persistent pain that a single intrathecal injection of substance P conjugated to the light chain of botulinum toxin (SP-BOT) silenced neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and alleviated mechanical hypersensitivity. The SP-BOT construct selectively silenced neurokinin 1 receptor positive (NK1R+) neurons in the superficial dorsal horn of the spinal cord. A subset of these NK1R+ neurons are nociceptive projection neurons and convey injury-related information to the brainstem, initiating and maintaining programmes of escape and recovery essential for healing. Previously, we observed a reduction in mechanical hypersensitivity in a spared nerve injury (SNI) model of neuropathic pain state after intrathecal injection of SP-BOT over the lumbar spinal cord and lasting for up to 40 days. In this latest study, we have extended these observations and now show that thermal and affective measures of pain behaviour were also alleviated by a single intrathecal injection of SP-BOT. By introducing SNI 30 days, 60 days, 90 days or 120 days after injection of SP-BOT we have established that NK1R+ spinal neurons in the superficial lamina of the dorsal horn were silenced for up to 120 days following a single intrathecal injection of the botulinum construct. We also show that behavioural alleviation of neuropathic pain symptoms could be reinstated by a second injection of SP-BOT at 120 days. Taken together this research demonstrates that this recently developed botulinum toxin conjugate provides a powerful new way of providing long term pain relief without toxicity following a single injection and also has a therapeutic potential for repeated dosing when pain begins to return.

<p>Nectin‐2α, prominently expressed in the medial habenula (MHb), was localized at cholinergic neuron dendrites in synaptic regions of the MHb (clustered filled dots) in addition to the boundary between the adjacent somata of the clustered cholinergic neurons (edges of clustered open hexagons). This dendritic nectin‐2α formed puncta adherentia junctions cooperatively with afadin, cadherin‐8, p120‐catenin, β‐catenin, and αN‐catenin and regulated synapse formation.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The medial habenula (MHb) receives afferents from the triangular septum and the medial septal complex, projects efferents to the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) in the midbrain to regulate dopamine and serotonin levels, and is implicated in stress, depression, memory, and nicotine withdrawal syndrome. We previously showed that the cell adhesion molecule nectin‐2α is localized at the boundary between adjacent somata of clustered cholinergic neurons and regulates the voltage‐gated A‐type K<sup>+</sup> channel Kv4.2 localization at membrane specializations in the MHb. This adhesion apparatus, named nectin‐2α spots, is not associated with the nectin‐binding protein afadin or any classic cadherins and their binding proteins p120‐catenin and β‐catenin. We showed here that nectin‐2α was additionally localized at cholinergic neuron dendrites in synaptic regions of the MHb. The genetic ablation of <i>nectin‐2</i> reduced the number of synapses in the MHb without affecting their morphology. Nectin‐2α was associated with afadin, cadherin‐8, p120‐catenin, β‐catenin, and αN‐catenin, forming puncta adherentia junctions (PAJs). Nectin‐2α was observed in the IPN, but not in the triangular septum or the medial septal complex. The genetic ablation of <i>nectin‐2</i> did not affect synapse formation in the IPN. These results indicate that nectin‐2α forms two types of adhesion apparatus in the MHb, namely nectin‐2α spots at neighboring somata and PAJs at neighboring dendrites, and that dendritic PAJs regulate synapse formation in the MHb.</p>

<p>Phosphatidylinositol‐4,5‐bisphosphate (PI‐4,5‐P<sub>2</sub>) is critical for synaptic vesicle docking and fusion and is generated by either the type 1 phosphatidylinositol‐4‐phosphate 5‐kinases (PI4P5Ks) or the type 2 phosphatidylinositol‐5‐phosphate 4‐kinases (PI5P4Ks). In this study, we describe the neuro‐anatomical localization of PI5P4Kα and PI5P4Kβ in the normal brain. PI5P4Kα is expressed in both oligodendrocytes and some neurons, while PI5P4Kβ is expressed solely in neurons. By electron microscopy, both kinases are located in a peri‐synaptic distribution in axon terminals and dendritic spines, suggesting a role in neuro‐transmission, possibly through synaptic vesicle docking, recycling, and/or fusion.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Phosphatidylinositol‐4,5‐bisphosphate (PI‐4,5‐P<sub>2</sub>) is critical for synaptic vesicle docking and fusion and generation of the second messengers, diacylglycerol and inositol‐1,4,5‐trisphosphate. PI‐4,5‐P<sub>2</sub> can be generated by two families of kinases: type 1 phosphatidylinositol‐4‐phosphate 5‐kinases, encoded by PIP5K1A, PIP5K1B and PIP5K1C, and type 2 phosphatidylinositol‐5‐phosphate 4‐kinases, encoded by PIP4K2A, PIP4K2B, and PIP4K2C. While the roles of the type 1 enzymes in brain function have been extensively studied, the roles of the type 2 enzymes are poorly understood. Using selective antibodies validated by genetic deletion of pip4k2a or pip4k2b in mouse brain, we characterized the location of the enzymes, PI5P4Kα and PI5P4Kβ, encoded by these genes. In mice, we demonstrate that PI5P4Kα is expressed in adulthood, whereas PI5P4Kβ is expressed early in development. PI5P4Kα localizes to white matter tracts, especially the corpus callosum, and at a low level in neurons, while PI5P4Kβ is expressed in neuronal populations, especially hippocampus and cortex. Dual labeling studies demonstrate that PI5P4Kα co‐localizes with the oligodendrocyte marker, Olig2, whereas PI5P4Kβ co‐localizes with the neuronal marker, NeuN. Ultrastructural analysis demonstrates that both kinases are contained in axon terminals and dendritic spines adjacent to the synaptic membrane, which support a potential role in synaptic transmission. Immunoperoxidase analysis of macaque and human brain tissue demonstrate a conserved pattern for PI5P4Kα and PI5P4Kβ. These results highlight the diverse cell‐autonomous expression of PI5P4Kα and PI5P4Kβ and support further exploration into their role in synaptic function in the brain.</p>

<p>We examined the chronology of infarct and the viability and morphological changes in neuroglia and neurons located in different brain regions on d1, d7, and d28 post β‐amyloid (Aβ) toxicity and endothelin‐1 induced ischemia (ET1) in rats.

</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Combination of ischemia and β‐amyloid (Aβ) toxicity has been shown to simultaneously increase neuro‐inflammation, endogenous Aβ deposition, and neurodegeneration. However, studies on the evolution of infarct and panorama of cellular degeneration as a synergistic or overlapping mechanism between ischemia and Aβ toxicity are lacking. Here, we compared fluorojade B (FJB) and hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stains primarily to examine the chronology of infarct, and the viability and morphological changes in neuroglia and neurons located in different brain regions on d1, d7, and d28 post Aβ toxicity and endothelin‐1 induced ischemia (ET1) in rats. We demonstrated a regional difference in cellular degeneration between cortex, corpus callosum, striatum, globus pallidus, and thalamus after cerebral injury. Glial cells in the cortex and corpus callosum underwent delayed FJB staining from d7 to d28, but neurons in cortex disappeared within the first week of cerebral injury. Striatal lesion core and globus pallidus of Aβ + ET1 rats showed extensive degeneration of neuronal cells compared with ET1 rats alone starting from d1. Differential and exacerbated expressions of cyclooxygenase‐2 might be the cause of excessive neuronal demise in the striatum of Aβ + ET1 rats. Such an investigation may improve our understanding to identify and manipulate a critical therapeutic window post comorbid injury.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We present here a thorough and complete analysis of mouse P0‐P140 prethalamic histogenetic subdivisions and corresponding nuclear derivatives, in the context of local tract landmarks. The study used as fundamental material brains from a transgenic mouse line that expresses <i>LacZ</i> under the control of an intragenic enhancer of <i>Dlx5</i> and <i>Dlx6</i> (<i>Dlx5</i>/<i>6‐LacZ</i>). Subtle shadings of LacZ signal, jointly with pan‐DLX immunoreaction, and several other ancillary protein or RNA markers, including <i>Calb2</i> and <i>Nkx2.2</i> ISH (for the prethalamic eminence, and derivatives of the rostral zona limitans shell domain, respectively) were mapped across the prethalamus. The resulting model of the prethalamic region postulates tetrapartite rostrocaudal and dorsoventral subdivisions, as well as a tripartite radial stratification, each cell population showing a characteristic molecular profile. Some novel nuclei are proposed, and some instances of potential tangential cell migration were noted.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Vascular structures in the developing brain are thought to form via angiogenesis from preformed blood vessels in the cephalic mesenchyme. Immunohistochemical studies of developing mouse brain from E10.5 to E13.5 revealed the presence of avascular blood islands of primitive erythroid cells expressing hemangioblast markers (Flk1, Tal1/Scl1, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1, vascular endothelial‐cadherin, and CD34) and an endothelial marker recognized by <i>Griffonia simplicifolia</i> isolectin B4 (IB4) in the cephalic mesenchyme. These cells formed a perineural vascular plexus from which angiogenic sprouts originated and penetrated the neuroepithelium. In addition, avascular isolated cells expressing primitive erythroid, hemangioblast and endothelial makers were visible in the neuroepithelium where they generated vasculogenic and hemogenic foci. From E10.5 to E13.5, these vasculogenic foci were a source of new blood vessel formation in the developing brain. In vitro, cultured E13.5 brain endothelial cells contained hemogenic endothelial cells capable of generating erythroid cells. Similar cells were present in primary cultures of dissociated cells from E10.5 embryonic head. Our results provide new evidence that the brain vasculature, like that of the yolk sac and the eye choriocapillaris and hyaloid vascular systems, develops at least in part via hemovasculogenesis, a process in which vasculogenesis and hematopoiesis occur simultaneously.</p>

<p>A voxel‐based morphometry analysis of 20 capuchin T1‐magnetic resonance imaging scans identified several sex differences in gray matter morphology. Male capuchins showed enlargement in a region of the posterior hypothalamus, possibly including the mammillary bodies, paraventricular nucleus, and/or lateral hypothalamus. Female capuchins showed enlargement in the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres, likely Crus II, and in the left occipitotemporal cortex, possibly including V2, V3, V4, TEO, and/or MT. These female‐enlarged regions have shown experience‐dependent plasticity in prior primate studies, and tractography indicated that they connect with a distributed network of perceptual and association regions. We postulate that capuchin brains, like human brains and in contrast to rodent brains, may show sex differences related to differential lifetime experience on top of more innate sex differences.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This study reports an analysis of 20 T1‐weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans from tufted capuchin monkeys (5 male, 15 female). We carried out a data‐driven, whole‐brain volumetric analysis on regional gray matter anatomy using voxel‐based morphometry. This revealed that males showed statistically significant expansion of a region of the hypothalamus, while females showed significant expansion in a distributed set of regions, including the cerebellum, early visual cortex, and higher‐order visual regions spanning occipital and temporal cortex. In order to elucidate the network connectivity of these regions, we employed probabilistic tractography on diffusion tensor imaging data. This showed that the female‐enlarged regions connect with distributed association networks across the brain. Notably, this contrasts with rodent studies, where sex differences are focused in deep, ancestral limbic regions involved in the control of reproductive behavior. Additionally, in our data set, for several regions, male and female volumetric measures were completely nonoverlapping. This contrasts with human studies, where sex differences in cortical regions have been reported but are characterized by overlapping rather than divergent male and female values. We suggest that these results can be understood in the context of the different lifetime experiences of males and females, which may produce increased experience‐dependent cortical plasticity in capuchins compared to rodents, and in humans compared to capuchins.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Storage and voiding of urine from the lower urinary tract (LUT) must be timed precisely to occur in appropriate behavioral contexts. A major part of the CNS circuit that coordinates this activity is found in the lumbosacral spinal cord. Immediate early gene (IEG) activity mapping has been widely used to investigate the lumbosacral LUT‐related circuit, but most reports focus on the effects of noxious stimulation in anesthetized female rats. Here we use c‐Fos and EGR‐1 (Zif268) activity mapping of lumbosacral spinal cord to investigate cystometry‐induced micturition in awake female and male rats. In females, after cystometry c‐Fos neurons in spinal cord segments L5–S2 were concentrated in the sacral parasympathetic nucleus (SPN), dorsal horn laminae II–IV, and dorsal commissural nucleus (SDCom). Comparisons of cystometry and control groups in male and female revealed sex differences. Activity mapping suggested dorsal horn laminae II–IV was activated in females but showed net inhibition in males. However, inhibition in male rats was not detected by EGR‐1 activity mapping, which showed low coexpression with c‐Fos. A class of catecholamine neurons in SPN and SDCom neurons were also more strongly activated by micturition in females. In both sexes, most c‐Fos neurons were identified as excitatory by their absence of Pax2 expression. In conclusion, IEG mapping in awake male and female rats has extended our understanding of the functional molecular anatomy of the LUT‐related circuit in spinal cord. Using this approach, we have identified sex differences that were not detected by previous studies in anesthetized rats.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disabling neuropsychiatric disorder whose neurobiological basis remains unclear. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have reported functional and structural alterations of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in OCD. In this study, we explored the functional activity of subregions of the ACC and effective connectivity (EC) between ACC subregions and the whole brain in OCD. We used a Granger causality analysis (GCA) to identify the direction of information flow and whether the impact of that flow was excitatory or inhibitory. We performed resting‐state functional MRI in 31 patients with OCD and 36 healthy controls and analyzed the amplitude of low‐frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and coefficient‐based GCA. The left pregenual ACC (pACC) in patients with OCD showed decreased ALFF relative to controls. There was significantly decreased excitatory output from the left pACC to both right dorsal superior frontal gyrus (dSFG) and left precuneus in patients compared with controls. Patients also had decreased inhibitory input to left pACC from left ventral SFG and left thalamus and caudate relative to controls. Results were similar in drug‐naive patients and those with prior but not current psychopharmacological treatment. In patients, path coefficients of GCA from left pACC to right dSFG showed significant negative correlations with obsession and anxiety ratings. Decreased spontaneous neural activity and altered EC of pACC with widely distributed cortical circuitry, and associations with clinical ratings highlight the importance of pACC functional alteration in OCD.</p>

<p>In this article, we present methods for guided volume reconstruction of serial section animal brain histology with an evaluation of registration accuracy. Using methods derived from diffeomorphometry, we quantify the 3D distortion caused by two steps in the histology tissue processing pipeline: (a) reassembly of tape‐transfer assisted histology sections and (b) tissue perfusion and fixation.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Whole brain neuroanatomy using tera‐voxel light‐microscopic data sets is of much current interest. A fundamental problem in this field is the mapping of individual brain data sets to a reference space. Previous work has not rigorously quantified in‐vivo to ex‐vivo distortions in brain geometry from tissue processing. Further, existing approaches focus on registering unimodal volumetric data; however, given the increasing interest in the marmoset model for neuroscience research and the importance of addressing individual brain architecture variations, new algorithms are necessary to cross‐register multimodal data sets including MRIs and multiple histological series. Here we present a computational approach for same‐subject multimodal MRI‐guided reconstruction of a series of consecutive histological sections, jointly with diffeomorphic mapping to a reference atlas. We quantify the scale change during different stages of brain histological processing using the Jacobian determinant of the diffeomorphic transformations involved. By mapping the final image stacks to the ex‐vivo post‐fixation MRI, we show that (a) tape‐transfer assisted histological sections can be reassembled accurately into 3D volumes with a local scale change of 2.0 ± 0.4% per axis dimension; in contrast, (b) tissue perfusion/fixation as assessed by mapping the in‐vivo MRIs to the ex‐vivo post fixation MRIs shows a larger median absolute scale change of 6.9 ± 2.1% per axis dimension. This is the first systematic quantification of local metric distortions associated with whole‐brain histological processing, and we expect that the results will generalize to other species. These local scale changes will be important for computing local properties to create reference brain maps.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Spiders possess a wide array of sensory‐driven behaviors and therefore provide rich models for studying evolutionary hypotheses about the relationship between brain morphology, sensory systems, and behavior. Despite this, only a handful of studies have examined brain variation across the order of Araneae. In this study, I present descriptions of the gross brain morphology for 19 families of spiders that vary in eye morphology. Spiders showed the most variation in the secondary eye visual pathway. Based on this variation, spiders could be categorized into four groups. Group 1 spiders had small, underdeveloped laminae, no medullae, and no mushroom bodies. Group 2 spiders had large laminae, no medullae and large mushroom bodies. Group 3 spiders had laminae and some evidence of reduced medullae and mushroom bodies. Group 4 spiders had the most complex systems, with large laminae, medullae formed from optical glomeruli, and robust mushroom bodies. Within groups, there was large variation in the shape and size of individual regions, indicating possible variation in neuronal organization. The possible evolutionary implications of the loss of a dedicated olfactory organ in spiders and its effects on the mushroom body are also discussed.</p>

<p>We identified a novel population of inhibitory prodynorphin neurons in the mouse and human brainstem which we named LJA5.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Sensory information is transmitted from peripheral nerves, through the spinal cord, and up to the brain. Sensory information may be modulated by projections from the brain to the spinal cord, but the neural substrates for top‐down sensory control are incompletely understood. We identified a novel population of inhibitory neurons in the mouse brainstem, distinguished by their expression of prodynorphin, which we named LJA5. Here, we identify a similar group of <i>Pdyn+</i> neurons in the human brainstem, and we define the efferent and afferent projection patterns of LJA5 neurons in mouse. Using specific genetic tools, we selectively traced the projections of the <i>Pdyn</i>‐expressing LJA5 neurons through the brain and spinal cord. Terminal fields were densest in the lateral and ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (PAG), lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPB), caudal pressor area, and lamina I of the spinal trigeminal nucleus and all levels of the spinal cord. We then labeled cell types in the PAG, LPB, medulla, and spinal cord to better define the specific targets of LJA5 boutons. LJA5 neurons send the only known inhibitory descending projection specifically to lamina I of the spinal cord, which transmits afferent pain, temperature, and itch information up to the brain. Using retrograde tracing, we found LJA5 neurons receive inputs from sensory and stress areas such as somatosensory/insular cortex, preoptic area, paraventricular nucleus, dorsomedial nucleus and lateral hypothalamus, PAG, and LPB. This pattern of inputs and outputs suggest LJA5 neurons are uniquely positioned to be activated by sensation and stress, and in turn, inhibit pain and itch.</p>

<p>Dark‐adapting the fiddler crab eye at night triggers great changes in rhabdom diameters and crystalline cone shape, increasing optical sensitivity and acceptance angles. However, during daytime the eye remains effectively light‐adapted in the dark. Surprisingly, screening pigments do not appear to migrate to help moderate fluctuations in brightness.

</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A great diversity of adaptations is found among animals with compound eyes and even closely related taxa can show variation in their light‐adaptation strategies. A prime example of a visual system evolved to function in specific light environments is the fiddler crab, used widely as a model to research aspects of crustacean vision and neural pathways. However, questions remain regarding how their eyes respond to the changes in brightness spanning many orders of magnitude, associated with their habitat and ecology. The fiddler crab <i>Afruca tangeri</i> forages at low tide on tropical and semi‐tropical mudflats, under bright sunlight and on moonless nights, suggesting that their eyes undergo effective light adaptation. Using synchrotron X‐ray tomography, light and transmission electron microscopy and in vivo ophthalmoscopy, we describe the ultrastructural changes in the eye between day and night. Dark adaptation at dusk triggered extensive widening of the rhabdoms and crystalline cone tips. This doubled the ommatidial acceptance angles and increased microvillar surface area for light capture in the rhabdom, theoretically boosting optical sensitivity 7.4 times. During daytime, only partial dark‐adaptation was achieved and rhabdoms remained narrow, indicating strong circadian control on the process. Bright light did not evoke changes in screening pigment distributions, suggesting a structural inability to adapt rapidly to the light level fluctuations frequently experienced when entering their burrow to escape predators. This should enable fiddler crabs to shelter for several minutes without undergoing significant dark‐adaptation, their vision remaining effectively adapted for predator detection when surfacing again in bright light.</p>

<p>The authors identified and quantified the <i>age pigment</i> lipofuscin within pial arterial walls and neocortical parenchyma of <i>young</i> drug‐resistant epilepsy patients.

<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Increased oxidative stress has been associated with several neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, but also with neurological diseases sharing pathophysiological pathways like epilepsy. Lipofuscin is a nondegradable end‐product of oxidative stress; its cerebral presence reflects the cumulative amount of oxidative stress the brain has endured. In this study, we have observed prominent autofluorescent particles in the pial arterial wall and in neocortical parenchyma of young, drug‐resistant epilepsy patients (18–28 years old) who underwent resective brain surgery (<i>n</i> = 6), as well as in older control patients (<i>n</i> = 3). With fluorescence spectroscopic imaging, brightfield microscopy, histochemistry and fluorescence lifetime imaging, these autofluorescent particles were identified as the <i>age pigment</i> lipofuscin. An evaluation of these lipofuscin particles using Imaris© software allowed robust quantification, while the 3D properties allowed visualization of the complex configuration. We elaborate on the usefulness of lipofuscin as a marker of cumulative oxidative stress in the brain. Furthermore, we speculate on the observed differences in particle size and density that we found between young patients and older controls, which could imply a role for lipofuscin in the pathophysiology of epilepsy and possibly other neurological diseases.</p>

<p>Long‐term in vitro culture of neural stem cells (NSCs) resulted in aging‐related upregulation of inflammatory‐ and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress‐related genes. The induction of four reprogramming factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c‐Myc) could decrease expression of the inflammatory and ER stress‐related genes during the long‐term culture.

</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Adult stem cells age during long‐term in vitro culture, and neural stem cells (NSCs), which can self‐renew and differentiate into neurons and glial cells, also display reduced differentiation potential after repeated passaging. However, the mechanistic details underlying this process remain unclear. In this study, we found that long‐term in vitro culture of NSCs resulted in aging‐related upregulation of inflammatory‐ and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress‐related genes, including the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)1β and IL6, the senescence‐associated enzyme matrix metallopeptidase 13 (MMP13), and the ER stress‐responsive transcription factor activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). However, the cyclic and transient induction of four reprogramming factors (POU domain, class 5, transcription factor 1, also known as octamer‐binding transcription factor 4; SRY [sex determining region Y]‐box 2; Kruppel‐like factor 4; and myelocytomatosis oncogene; collectively referred to as OSKM) can inhibit NSC aging, as indicated by the decreased expression of the inflammatory and ER stress‐related genes. We used ROSA‐4F NSCs, which express OSKM from only one allele, to minimize the potential for full reprogramming or tumor formation during NSC rejuvenation. We expect that this novel rejuvenation method will enhance the potential of NSCs as a clinical approach to the treatment of neurological diseases.</p>

The rat and mouse brain flatmaps are based on current brain reference atlases, and they represent all depths of the divisional hierarchy of central nervous system gray matter represented therein. Also represented for rat and mouse are white matter tracts, ganglia, and nerves, and for the rat a series of flatmaps illustrating stages of brain development. The rat and mouse brain flatmaps are designed to facilitate comparative analysis between these species, and for adaptability to novel parcellation schemas and computational applications. We give examples of these uses, including a proof‐of‐concept workflow demonstrating how the flatmaps could be adapted to form the basis of a web‐based graphical data viewer and analysis platform to represent a wide variety of brain data.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Here we present a flatmap of the mouse central nervous system (CNS) (brain) and substantially enhanced flatmaps of the rat and human brain. Also included are enhanced representations of nervous system white matter tracts, ganglia, and nerves, and an enhanced series of 10 flatmaps showing different stages of rat brain development. The adult mouse and rat brain flatmaps provide layered diagrammatic representation of CNS divisions, according to their arrangement in corresponding reference atlases: Brain Maps 4.0 (BM4, rat) (Swanson, The Journal of Comparative Neurology, 2018, 526, 935–943), and the first version of the Allen Reference Atlas (mouse) (Dong, The Allen reference atlas, (book + CD‐ROM): A digital color brain atlas of the C57BL/6J male mouse, 2007). To facilitate comparative analysis, both flatmaps are scaled equally, and the divisional hierarchy of gray matter follows a topographic arrangement used in BM4. Also included with the mouse and rat brain flatmaps are cerebral cortex atlas level contours based on the reference atlases, and direct graphical and tabular comparison of regional parcellation. To encourage use of the brain flatmaps, they were designed and organized, with supporting reference tables, for ease‐of‐use and to be amenable to computational applications. We demonstrate how they can be adapted to represent novel parcellations resulting from experimental data, and we provide a proof‐of‐concept for how they could form the basis of a web‐based graphical data viewer and analysis platform. The mouse, rat, and human brain flatmap vector graphics files (Adobe Reader/Acrobat viewable and Adobe Illustrator editable) and supporting tables are provided open access; they constitute a broadly applicable neuroscience toolbox resource for researchers seeking to map and perform comparative analysis of brain data.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Tanycytes are highly specialized ependymal cells that line the bottom and the lateral walls of the third ventricle. In contact with the cerebrospinal fluid through their cell bodies, they send processes into the arcuate nucleus, the ventromedial nucleus, and the dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus. In the present work, we combined transgenic and immunohistochemical approaches to investigate the neuroanatomical associations between tanycytes and neural cells present in the hypothalamic parenchyma, in particular in the arcuate nucleus. The specific expression of tdTomato in tanycytes first allowed the observation of peculiar subcellular protrusions along tanycyte processes and at their endfeet such as spines, swelling, en passant boutons, boutons, or claws. Interestingly, these protrusions contact different neural cells in the brain parenchyma including blood vessels and neurons, and in particular NPY and POMC neurons in the arcuate nucleus. Using both fluorescent and electron microscopy, we finally observed that these tanycyte protrusions contain ribosomes, mitochondria, diverse vesicles, and transporters, suggesting dense tanycyte/neuron and tanycyte/blood vessel communications. Altogether, our results lay the neuroanatomical basis for tanycyte/neural cell interactions, which will be useful to further understand cell‐to‐cell communications involved in the regulation of neuroendocrine functions.</p>

<p>We examined the visual response properties of genetically targeted neurons in retina, optic tectum, and torus longitudinalis of larval zebrafish. Functional characterization of dimming responsive neurons within these visual areas revealed responses with varied photosensitivity profiles, including (a) low‐sensitivity neurons that selectively respond to large light decrements, (b) high‐sensitivity neurons that selectively encode small decrements, and (c) broad sensitivity neurons that respond to a wide range of light decrements. Our data support a model in which parallel OFF channels generated in the retina remain segregated across three stages of visual processing.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Vertebrate retinas contain circuits specialized to encode light level decrements. This information is transmitted to the brain by dimming‐sensitive OFF retinal ganglion cells (OFF‐RGCs) that respond to light decrements with increased firing. It is known that OFF‐RGCs with distinct photosensitivity profiles form parallel visual channels to the vertebrate brain, yet how these channels are processed by first‐ and higher order brain areas has not been well characterized in any species. To address this question in the larval zebrafish visual system, we examined the visual response properties of a genetically identified population of tectal neurons with a defined axonal projection to a second‐order visual area: <i>id2b</i>:<i>gal4‐</i>positive torus longitudinalis projection neurons (TLPNs). TLPNs responded consistently to whole‐field dimming stimuli and exhibited the strongest responses when dimming was preceded by low light levels. Functional characterization of OFF‐RGC terminals in tectum revealed responses that varied in their photosensitivities: (a) low‐sensitivity OFF‐RGCs that selectively respond to large light decrements, (b) high‐sensitivity OFF‐RGCs that selectively encode small decrements, and (c) broad sensitivity OFF‐RGCs that respond to a wide range of light decrements. Diverse photosensitivity profiles were also observed using pan‐neuronal calcium imaging to identify dimming‐responsive neurons in both tectum and torus longitudinalis. Together, these data support a model in which parallel OFF channels generated in the retina remain segregated across three stages of visual processing. Segregated OFF channels with different sensitivities may allow specific aspects of dimming‐evoked behaviors to be modulated by ambient light levels.</p>

<p>Locations of waking/arousal‐related cell groups of the brainstem and caudal diencephalon at which GA exert anesthetic actions. They include the pontomesencephalic reticular formation (PRF), locus coeruleus (LC), parabrachial nucleus (PB), tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) and orexin‐containing cells of the lateral hypothalamus. GAs have been shown to suppress the activity of each of these structures to induce anesthesia whereas their activation (e.g., by electrical stimulation) hastens the recovery from anesthesia.

</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We review evidence challenging the hypothesis that memories are processed or consolidated in sleep. We argue that the brain is in an unconscious state in sleep, akin to general anesthesia (GA), and hence is incapable of meaningful cognitive processing—the sole purview of waking consciousness. At minimum, the encoding of memories in sleep would require that waking events are faithfully transferred to and reproduced in sleep. Remarkably, however, this has never been demonstrated, as waking experiences are never truly replicated in sleep but rather appear in very altered or distorted forms. General anesthetics (GAs) exert their effects through endogenous sleep–wake control systems and accordingly GA and sleep share several common features: sensory blockade, immobility, amnesia and lack of awareness (unconsciousness). The loss of consciousness in non‐REM (NREM) sleep or to GAs is characterized by: (a) delta oscillations throughout the cortex; (b) marked reductions in neural activity (from waking) over widespread regions of the cortex, most pronounced in frontal and parietal cortices; and (c) a significant disruption of the functional connectivity of thalamocortical and corticocortical networks, particularly those involved in “higher order” cognitive functions. Several (experimental) reports in animals and humans have shown that disrupting the activity of the cortex, particularly the orbitofrontal cortex, severely impairs higher order cognitive and executive functions. The profound and widespread deactivation of the cortex in the unconscious states of NREM sleep or GA would be expected to produce an equivalent, or undoubtedly a much greater, disruptive effect on mnemonic and cognitive functions. In conclusion, we contend that the unconscious, severely altered state of the brain in NREM sleep would negate any possibility of cognitive processing in NREM sleep.</p>

<p>Here, we show that the hemiellipsoid body of the true crab <i>Neohelice granulata</i> shares many of the insect mushroom body characters. In this brain center, which has previously been shown to reflect context‐dependent memory, we identified the presence of microglomeruli‐like complexes, input and output regions, aminergic innervation, adult neurogenesis, and elevated expression of proteins necessary for memory processes. in vivo calcium imaging suggests that, as in insect mushroom bodies, stimuli of different nature can trigger divergent neuronal activity patterns in the output region. The study provides a series of data that is parsimonious with a shared organization of memory centers across crustaceans and insects.

<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hypothesis of a common origin for high‐order memory centers in bilateral animals presents the question of how different brain structures, such as the vertebrate hippocampus and the arthropod mushroom bodies, are both structurally and functionally comparable. Obtaining evidence to support the hypothesis that crustaceans possess structures equivalent to the mushroom bodies that play a role in associative memories has proved challenging. Structural evidence supports that the hemiellipsoid bodies of hermit crabs, crayfish and lobsters, spiny lobsters, and shrimps are homologous to insect mushroom bodies. Although a preliminary description and functional evidence supporting such homology in true crabs (Brachyura) has recently been shown, other authors consider the identification of a possible mushroom body homolog in Brachyura as problematic. Here we present morphological and immunohistochemical data in <i>Neohelice granulata</i> supporting that crabs possess well‐developed hemiellipsoid bodies that are resolved as mushroom bodies‐like structures. <i>Neohelice</i> exhibits a peduncle‐like tract, from which processes project into proximal and distal domains with different neuronal specializations. The proximal domains exhibit spines and <i>en passant</i>‐like processes and are proposed here as regions mainly receiving inputs. The distal domains exhibit a “trauben”‐like compartmentalized structure with bulky terminal specializations and are proposed here as output regions. In addition, we found microglomeruli‐like complexes, adult neurogenesis, aminergic innervation, and elevated expression of proteins necessary for memory processes. Finally, in vivo calcium imaging suggests that, as in insect mushroom bodies, the output regions exhibit stimulus‐specific activity. Our results support the shared organization of memory centers across crustaceans and insects.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Afferent activity dynamically regulates neuronal properties and connectivity in the central nervous system. The Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is an RNA‐binding protein that regulates cellular and synaptic properties in an activity‐dependent manner. Whether and how FMRP level and localization are regulated by afferent input remains sparsely examined and how such regulation is associated with neuronal response to changes in sensory input is unknown. We characterized changes in FMRP level and localization in the chicken nucleus magnocellularis (NM), a primary cochlear nucleus, following afferent deprivation by unilateral cochlea removal. We observed rapid (within 2 hr) aggregation of FMRP immunoreactivity into large granular structures in a subset of deafferented NM neurons. Neurons that exhibited persistent FMRP aggregation at 12–24 hr eventually lost cytoplasmic Nissl substance, indicating cell death. A week later, FMRP expression in surviving neurons regained its homeostasis, with a slightly reduced immunostaining intensity and enhanced heterogeneity. Correlation analyses under the homeostatic status (7–14 days) revealed that neurons expressing relatively more FMRP had a higher capability of maintaining cell body size and ribosomal activity, as well as a better ability to detach inactive presynaptic terminals. Additionally, the intensity of an inhibitory postsynaptic protein, gephyrin, was reduced following deafferentation and was positively correlated with FMRP intensity, implicating an involvement of FMRP in synaptic dynamics in response to reduced afferent inputs. Collectively, this study demonstrates that afferent input regulates FMRP expression and localization in ways associated with multiple types of neuronal responses and synaptic rearrangements.</p>

<p>by Timothy C. Matisziw, Ashkan Gholamialam, Kathleen M. Trauth</p>

Reasoning about the factors underlying habitat connectivity and the inter-habitat movement of species is essential to many areas of biological inquiry. In order to better describe and understand the ways in which the landscape may support species movement, an increasing amount of research has focused on identification of paths or corridors that may be important in providing connectivity among habitat. The least-cost path problem has proven to be an instrumental analytical tool in this sense. A complicating aspect of such path identification methods is how to best reconcile and integrate the array of criteria or objectives that species may consider in traversal of a landscape. In cases where habitat connectivity is thought to be influenced or guided by multiple objectives, numerous solutions to least-cost path problems can exist, representing tradeoffs between the objectives. In practice though, identification of these solutions can be very challenging and as such, only a small proportion of them are typically examined leading to a weak characterization of habitat connectivity. To address this computational challenge, a multiobjective optimization framework is proposed. A generalizable multiobjective least-cost path model is first detailed. A non-inferior set estimation (MONISE) algorithm for identifying supported efficient solutions to the multiobjective least-cost path model is then described. However, it is well known that unsupported efficient solutions (which are equally important) can also exist, but are typically ignored given that they are more difficult to identify. Thus, to enable the identification of the full set of efficient solutions (supported and unsupported) to the multiobjective model, a multi-criteria labeling algorithm is then proposed. The developed framework is applied to assess different conceptualizations of habitat connectivity supporting amphibian movement in a wetland system. The results highlight the range of tradeoffs in characterizations of connectivity that can exist when multiple objectives are thought to contribute to movement decisions and that the number of unsupported efficient solutions (which are typically ignored) can vastly outweigh that of the supported efficient solutions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ei-KBrK73DI" width="1" />

<p>by Otto I. Pulkkinen, Prson Gautam, Ville Mustonen, Tero Aittokallio</p>

Combinatorial therapies are required to treat patients with advanced cancers that have become resistant to monotherapies through rewiring of redundant pathways. Due to a massive number of potential drug combinations, there is a need for systematic approaches to identify safe and effective combinations for each patient, using cost-effective methods. Here, we developed an exact multiobjective optimization method for identifying pairwise or higher-order combinations that show maximal cancer-selectivity. The prioritization of patient-specific combinations is based on Pareto-optimization in the search space spanned by the therapeutic and nonselective effects of combinations. We demonstrate the performance of the method in the context of BRAF-V600E melanoma treatment, where the optimal solutions predicted a number of co-inhibition partners for vemurafenib, a selective BRAF-V600E inhibitor, approved for advanced melanoma. We experimentally validated many of the predictions in BRAF-V600E melanoma cell line, and the results suggest that one can improve selective inhibition of BRAF-V600E melanoma cells by combinatorial targeting of MAPK/ERK and other compensatory pathways using pairwise and third-order drug combinations. Our mechanism-agnostic optimization method is widely applicable to various cancer types, and it takes as input only measurements of a subset of pairwise drug combinations, without requiring target information or genomic profiles. Such data-driven approaches may become useful for functional precision oncology applications that go beyond the cancer genetic dependency paradigm to optimize cancer-selective combinatorial treatments.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tQFi8d3CAl4" width="1" />

<p>by Alessandro Ingrosso</p>

Characterizing the relation between weight structure and input/output statistics is fundamental for understanding the computational capabilities of neural circuits. In this work, I study the problem of storing associations between analog signals in the presence of correlations, using methods from statistical mechanics. I characterize the typical learning performance in terms of the power spectrum of random input and output processes. I show that optimal synaptic weight configurations reach a capacity of 0.5 for any fraction of excitatory to inhibitory weights and have a peculiar synaptic distribution with a finite fraction of silent synapses. I further provide a link between typical learning performance and principal components analysis in single cases. These results may shed light on the synaptic profile of brain circuits, such as cerebellar structures, that are thought to engage in processing time-dependent signals and performing on-line prediction.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/k5UZKwtwElo" width="1" />

<p>by Edoardo Pinzuti, Patricia Wollstadt, Aaron Gutknecht, Oliver Tüscher, Michael Wibral</p>

Information transfer, measured by transfer entropy, is a key component of distributed computation. It is therefore important to understand the pattern of information transfer in order to unravel the distributed computational algorithms of a system. Since in many natural systems distributed computation is thought to rely on rhythmic processes a frequency resolved measure of information transfer is highly desirable. Here, we present a novel algorithm, and its efficient implementation, to identify separately frequencies sending and receiving information in a network. Our approach relies on the invertible maximum overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT) for the creation of surrogate data in the computation of transfer entropy and entirely avoids filtering of the original signals. The approach thereby avoids well-known problems due to phase shifts or the ineffectiveness of filtering in the information theoretic setting. We also show that measuring frequency-resolved information transfer is a partial information decomposition problem that cannot be fully resolved to date and discuss the implications of this issue. Last, we evaluate the performance of our algorithm on simulated data and apply it to human magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings and to local field potential recordings in the ferret. In human MEG we demonstrate top-down information flow in temporal cortex from very high frequencies (above 100Hz) to both similarly high frequencies and to frequencies around 20Hz, i.e. a complex spectral configuration of cortical information transmission that has not been described before. In the ferret we show that the prefrontal cortex sends information at low frequencies (4-8 Hz) to early visual cortex (V1), while V1 receives the information at high frequencies (&gt; 125 Hz).<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yvPcW6Al6VQ" width="1" />

<i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (<i>Mtb</i>) infection causes tuberculosis (TB), a disease characterized by development of granulomas. Granulomas consist of activated immune cells that cluster together to limit bacterial growth and restrict dissemination. Control of the TB epidemic has been limited by lengthy drug regimens, antibiotic resistance, and lack of a robustly efficacious vaccine. Fibrosis commonly occurs during treatment and is associated with both positive and negative disease outcomes in TB but little is known about the processes that initiate fibrosis in granulomas. Human and nonhuman primate granulomas undergoing fibrosis can have spindle-shaped macrophages with fibroblast-like morphologies suggesting a relationship between macrophages, fibroblasts, and granuloma fibrosis. This relationship has been difficult to investigate because of the limited availability of human pathology samples, the time scale involved in human TB, and overlap between fibroblast and myeloid cell markers in tissues. To better understand the origins of fibrosis in TB, we used a computational model of TB granuloma biology to identify factors that drive fibrosis over the course of local disease progression. We validated the model with granulomas from nonhuman primates to delineate myeloid cells and lung-resident fibroblasts. Our results suggest that peripheral granuloma fibrosis, which is commonly observed, can arise through macrophage-to-myofibroblast transformation (MMT). Further, we hypothesize that MMT is induced in M1 macrophages through a sequential combination of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory signaling in granuloma macrophages. We predict that MMT may be a mechanism underlying granuloma-associated fibrosis and warrants further investigation into myeloid cells as drivers of fibrotic disease.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/i4DJnTeQ8vU" width="1" />

<p>by Christopher L. Dembia, Nicholas A. Bianco, Antoine Falisse, Jennifer L. Hicks, Scott L. Delp</p>

Musculoskeletal simulations are used in many different applications, ranging from the design of wearable robots that interact with humans to the analysis of patients with impaired movement. Here, we introduce OpenSim Moco, a software toolkit for optimizing the motion and control of musculoskeletal models built in the OpenSim modeling and simulation package. OpenSim Moco uses the direct collocation method, which is often faster and can handle more diverse problems than other methods for musculoskeletal simulation. Moco frees researchers from implementing direct collocation themselves—which typically requires extensive technical expertise—and allows them to focus on their scientific questions. The software can handle a wide range of problems that interest biomechanists, including motion tracking, motion prediction, parameter optimization, model fitting, electromyography-driven simulation, and device design. Moco is the first musculoskeletal direct collocation tool to handle kinematic constraints, which enable modeling of kinematic loops (e.g., cycling models) and complex anatomy (e.g., patellar motion). To show the abilities of Moco, we first solved for muscle activity that produced an observed walking motion while minimizing squared muscle excitations and knee joint loading. Next, we predicted how muscle weakness may cause deviations from a normal walking motion. Lastly, we predicted a squat-to-stand motion and optimized the stiffness of an assistive device placed at the knee. We designed Moco to be easy to use, customizable, and extensible, thereby accelerating the use of simulations to understand the movement of humans and other animals.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MfhXqWduoys" width="1" />

<p>by Abhishek Mallela, Maulik K. Nariya, Eric J. Deeds</p>

Protein turnover is vital to cellular homeostasis. Many proteins are degraded efficiently only after they have been post-translationally “tagged” with a polyubiquitin chain. Ubiquitylation is a form of Post-Translational Modification (PTM): addition of a ubiquitin to the chain is catalyzed by E3 ligases, and removal of ubiquitin is catalyzed by a De-UBiquitylating enzyme (DUB). Nearly four decades ago, Goldbeter and Koshland discovered that reversible PTM cycles function like on-off switches when the substrates are at saturating concentrations. Although this finding has had profound implications for the understanding of switch-like behavior in biochemical networks, the general behavior of PTM cycles subject to synthesis and degradation has not been studied. Using a mathematical modeling approach, we found that simply introducing protein turnover to a standard modification cycle has profound effects, including significantly reducing the switch-like nature of the response. Our findings suggest that many classic results on PTM cycles may not hold <i>in vivo</i> where protein turnover is ubiquitous. We also found that proteins sharing an E3 ligase can have closely related changes in their expression levels. These results imply that it may be difficult to interpret experimental results obtained from either overexpressing or knocking down protein levels, since changes in protein expression can be coupled via E3 ligase crosstalk. Understanding crosstalk and competition for E3 ligases will be key in ultimately developing a global picture of protein homeostasis.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RCq5WNuC9-M" width="1" />

NF-Y is a trimeric Transcription Factor -TF- which binds with high selectivity to the conserved CCAAT element. Individual ChIP-seq analysis as well as ENCODE have progressively identified locations shared by other TFs. Here, we have analyzed data introduced by ENCODE over the last five years in K562, HeLa-S3 and GM12878, including several chromatin features, as well RNA-seq profiling of HeLa-S3 cells after NF-Y inactivation. We double the number of sequence-specific TFs and co-factors reported. We catalogue them in 4 classes based on co-association criteria, infer target genes categorizations, identify positional bias of binding sites and gene expression changes. Larger and novel co-associations emerge, specifically concerning subunits of repressive complexes as well as RNA-binding proteins. On the one hand, these data better define NF-Y association with single members of major classes of TFs, on the other, they suggest that it might have a wider role in the control of mRNA production.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/N0A940Gb8G4" width="1" />

In January 2020, a COVID-19 outbreak was detected in Sichuan Province of China. Six weeks later, the outbreak was successfully contained. The aim of this work is to characterize the epidemiology of the Sichuan outbreak and estimate the impact of interventions in limiting SARS-CoV-2 transmission. We analyzed patient records for all laboratory-confirmed cases reported in the province for the period of January 21 to March 16, 2020. To estimate the basic and daily reproduction numbers, we used a Bayesian framework. In addition, we estimate the number of cases averted by the implemented control strategies. The outbreak resulted in 539 confirmed cases, lasted less than two months, and no further local transmission was detected after February 27. The median age of local cases was 8 years older than that of imported cases. We estimated R<sub>0</sub> at 2.4 (95% CI: 1.6–3.7). The epidemic was self-sustained for about 3 weeks before going below the epidemic threshold 3 days after the declaration of a public health emergency by Sichuan authorities. Our findings indicate that, were the control measures be adopted four weeks later, the epidemic could have lasted 49 days longer (95% CI: 31–68 days), causing 9,216 more cases (95% CI: 1,317–25,545).<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gLmm_TU9SSs" width="1" />

<p>by Samuel Christensen, Yitong Huang, Olivia J. Walch, Daniel B. Forger</p>

Which suggestions for behavioral modifications, based on mathematical models, are most likely to be followed in the real world? We address this question in the context of human circadian rhythms. Jet lag is a consequence of the misalignment of the body’s internal circadian (~24-hour) clock during an adjustment to a new schedule. Light is the clock’s primary synchronizer. Previous research has used mathematical models to compute light schedules that shift the circadian clock to a new time zone as quickly as possible. How users adjust their behavior when provided with these optimal schedules remains an open question. Here, we report data collected by wearables from more than 100 travelers as they cross time zones using a smartphone app, <i>Entrain</i>. We find that people rarely follow the optimal schedules generated through mathematical modeling entirely, but travelers who better followed the optimal schedules reported more positive moods after their trips. Using the data collected, we improve the optimal schedule predictions to accommodate real-world constraints. We also develop a scheduling algorithm that allows for the computation of approximately optimal schedules "on-the-fly" in response to disruptions. User burnout may not be critically important as long as the first parts of a schedule are followed. These results represent a crucial improvement in making the theoretical results of past work viable for practical use and show how theoretical predictions based on known human physiology can be efficiently used in real-world settings.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZT_k6uA95ic" width="1" />

<i>In vivo</i> imaging of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) killing activity revealed that infected cells have a higher observed probability of dying after multiple contacts with CTLs. We developed a three-dimensional agent-based model to discriminate different hypotheses about how infected cells get killed based on quantitative 2-photon <i>in vivo</i> observations. We compared a constant CTL killing probability with mechanisms of signal integration in CTL or infected cells. The most likely scenario implied increased susceptibility of infected cells with increasing number of CTL contacts where the total number of contacts was a critical factor. However, when allowing <i>in silico</i> T cells to initiate new interactions with apoptotic target cells (zombie contacts), a contact history independent killing mechanism was also in agreement with experimental datasets. The comparison of observed datasets to simulation results, revealed limitations in interpreting 2-photon data, and provided readouts to distinguish CTL killing models.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9anFAnynf2o" width="1" />

<i>Bacillus anthracis</i>, a spore-forming gram-positive bacterium, causes anthrax. The external surface of the exosporium is coated with glycosylated proteins. The sugar additions are capped with the unique monosaccharide anthrose. The West African Group (WAG) <i>B</i>. <i>anthracis</i> have mutations rendering them anthrose deficient. Through genome sequencing, we identified 2 different large chromosomal deletions within the anthrose biosynthetic operon of <i>B</i>. <i>anthracis</i> strains from Chile and Poland. In silico analysis identified an anthrose-deficient strain in the anthrax outbreak among European heroin users. Anthrose-deficient strains are no longer restricted to West Africa so the role of anthrose in physiology and pathogenesis was investigated in <i>B</i>. <i>anthracis</i> Sterne. Loss of anthrose delayed spore germination and enhanced sporulation. Spores without anthrose were phagocytized at higher rates than spores with anthrose, indicating that anthrose may serve an antiphagocytic function on the spore surface. The anthrose mutant had half the LD<sub>50</sub> and decreased time to death (TTD) of wild type and complement <i>B</i>. <i>anthracis</i> Sterne in the A/J mouse model. Following infection, anthrose mutant bacteria were more abundant in the spleen, indicating enhanced dissemination of Sterne anthrose mutant. At low sample sizes in the A/J mouse model, the mortality of Δ<i>antC</i>-infected mice challenged by intranasal or subcutaneous routes was 20% greater than wild type. Competitive index (CI) studies indicated that spores without anthrose disseminated to organs more extensively than a complemented mutant. Death process modeling using mouse mortality dynamics suggested that larger sample sizes would lead to significantly higher deaths in anthrose-negative infected animals. The model was tested by infecting <i>Galleria mellonella</i> with spores and confirmed the anthrose mutant was significantly more lethal. Vaccination studies in the A/J mouse model showed that the human vaccine protected against high-dose challenges of the nonencapsulated Sterne-based anthrose mutant. This work begins to identify the physiologic and pathogenic consequences of convergent anthrose mutations in <i>B</i>. <i>anthracis</i>.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/xLHjWAFmZzo" width="1" />

<p>by Albert Zhang, Ziqiang Guan, Kyle Ockerman, Pengyuan Dong, Jiansheng Guo, Zhiping Wang, Dong Yan</p>

Coordination of cell growth is essential for the development of the brain, but the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of glial and neuronal size are poorly understood. To investigate the mechanisms involved in glial size regulation, we used <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> amphid sheath (AMsh) glia as a model and show that a conserved <i>cis</i>-Golgi membrane protein <i>eas-1/GOLT1B</i> negatively regulates glial growth. We found that <i>eas-1</i> inhibits a conserved E3 ubiquitin ligase <i>rnf-145</i>/RNF145, which, in turn, promotes nuclear activation of <i>sbp-1/</i> SREBP, a key regulator of sterol and fatty acid synthesis, to restrict cell growth. At early developmental stages, <i>rnf-145</i> in the <i>cis</i>-Golgi network inhibits <i>sbp-1</i> activation to promote the growth of glia, and when animals reach the adult stage, this inhibition is released through an <i>eas-1-</i>dependent shuttling of <i>rnf-145</i> from the <i>cis</i>-Golgi to the <i>trans</i>-Golgi network to stop glial growth. Furthermore, we identified long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs), especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), as downstream products of the <i>eas-1-rnf-145-sbp-1</i> pathway that functions to prevent the overgrowth of glia. Together, our findings reveal a novel and potentially conserved mechanism underlying glial size control.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/lnZqLcygP-Q" width="1" />

Host–pathogen conflicts leave genetic signatures in genes that are critical for host defense functions. Using these “molecular scars” as a guide to discover gene functions, we discovered a vertebrate-specific MItochondrial STress Response (MISTR) circuit. MISTR proteins are associated with electron transport chain (ETC) factors and activated by stress signals such as interferon gamma (IFNγ) and hypoxia. Upon stress, ultraconserved microRNAs (miRNAs) down-regulate MISTR1(NDUFA4) followed by replacement with paralogs MItochondrial STress Response AntiViral (MISTRAV) and/or MItochondrial STress Response Hypoxia (MISTRH). While cells lacking MISTR1(NDUFA4) are more sensitive to chemical and viral apoptotic triggers, cells lacking MISTRAV or expressing the squirrelpox virus-encoded vMISTRAV exhibit resistance to the same insults. Rapid evolution signatures across primate genomes for <i>MISTR1(NDUFA4)</i> and <i>MISTRAV</i> indicate recent and ongoing conflicts with pathogens. MISTR homologs are also found in plants, yeasts, a fish virus, and an algal virus indicating ancient origins and suggesting diverse means of altering mitochondrial function under stress. The discovery of MISTR circuitry highlights the use of evolution-guided studies to reveal fundamental biological processes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Lko71xOFkvE" width="1" />

<p>by Zhimao Wu, Nan Pang, Yingying Zhang, Huicheng Chen, Ying Peng, Jingyan Fu, Qing Wei</p>

Cilia play critical roles during embryonic development and adult homeostasis. Dysfunction of cilia leads to various human genetic diseases, including many caused by defects in transition zones (TZs), the “gates” of cilia. The evolutionarily conserved TZ component centrosomal protein 290 (CEP290) is the most frequently mutated human ciliopathy gene, but its roles in ciliogenesis are not completely understood. Here, we report that CEP290 plays an essential role in the initiation of TZ assembly in <i>Drosophila</i>. Mechanistically, the N-terminus of CEP290 directly recruits DAZ interacting zinc finger protein 1 (DZIP1), which then recruits Chibby (CBY) and Rab8 to promote early ciliary membrane formation. Complete deletion of CEP290 blocks ciliogenesis at the initiation stage of TZ assembly, which can be mimicked by DZIP1 deletion mutants. Remarkably, expression of the N-terminus of CEP290 alone restores the TZ localization of DZIP1 and subsequently ameliorates the defects in TZ assembly initiation in <i>cep290</i> mutants. Our results link CEP290 to DZIP1-CBY/Rab8 module and uncover a previously uncharacterized important function of CEP290 in the coordination of early ciliary membrane formation and TZ assembly.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/aG3YmgUwtug" width="1" />

When the J-domain of the heat shock protein DnaJB1 is fused to the catalytic (C) subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), replacing exon 1, this fusion protein, J-C subunit (J-C), becomes the driver of fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL-HCC). Here, we use cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to characterize J-C bound to RIIβ, the major PKA regulatory (R) subunit in liver, thus reporting the first cryo-EM structure of any PKA holoenzyme. We report several differences in both structure and dynamics that could not be captured by the conventional crystallography approaches used to obtain prior structures. Most striking is the asymmetry caused by the absence of the second cyclic nucleotide binding (CNB) domain and the J-domain in one of the RIIβ:J-C protomers. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we discovered that this asymmetry is already present in the wild-type (WT) RIIβ<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub> but had been masked in the previous crystal structure. This asymmetry may link to the intrinsic allosteric regulation of all PKA holoenzymes and could also explain why most disease mutations in PKA regulatory subunits are dominant negative. The cryo-EM structure, combined with small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), also allowed us to predict the general position of the Dimerization/Docking (D/D) domain, which is essential for localization and interacting with membrane-anchored A-Kinase-Anchoring Proteins (AKAPs). This position provides a multivalent mechanism for interaction of the RIIβ holoenzyme with membranes and would be perturbed in the oncogenic fusion protein. The J-domain also alters several biochemical properties of the RIIβ holoenzyme: It is easier to activate with cAMP, and the cooperativity is reduced. These results provide new insights into how the finely tuned allosteric PKA signaling network is disrupted by the oncogenic J-C subunit, ultimately leading to the development of FL-HCC.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/SxEStF5xD4g" width="1" />

<p>by Eva Bons, Christine Leemann, Karin J. Metzner, Roland R. Regoes</p>

An often-returning question for not only HIV-1, but also other organisms, is how predictable evolutionary paths are. The environment, mutational history, and random processes can all impact the exact evolutionary paths, but to which extent these factors contribute to the evolutionary dynamics of a particular system is an open question. Especially in a virus like HIV-1, with a large mutation rate and large population sizes, evolution is expected to be highly predictable if the impact of environment and history is low, and evolution is not neutral. We investigated the effect of environment and mutational history by analyzing sequences from a long-term evolution experiment, in which HIV-1 was passaged on 2 different cell types in 8 independent evolutionary lines and 8 derived lines, 4 of which involved a switch of the environment. The experiments lasted for 240–300 passages, corresponding to approximately 400–600 generations or almost 3 years. The sequences show signs of extensive parallel evolution—the majority of mutations that are shared between independent lines appear in both cell types, but we also find that both environment and mutational history significantly impact the evolutionary paths. We conclude that HIV-1 evolution is robust to small changes in the environment, similar to a transmission event in the absence of an immune response or drug pressure. We also find that the fitness landscape of HIV-1 is largely smooth, although we find some evidence for both positive and negative epistatic interactions between mutations.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/4erFhbSb4yI" width="1" />

Cardiac levels of the signal transducer and activator of transcription factor-3 (STAT3) decline with age, and male but not female mice with a cardiomyocyte-specific STAT3 deficiency conditional knockout (CKO) display premature age-related heart failure associated with reduced cardiac capillary density. In the present study, isolated male and female CKO-cardiomyocytes exhibit increased prostaglandin (PG)-generating cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression. The PG-degrading hydroxyprostaglandin-dehydrogenase-15 (HPGD) expression is only reduced in male cardiomyocytes, which is associated with increased prostaglandin D<sub>2</sub> (PGD<sub>2</sub>) secretion from isolated male but not female CKO-cardiomyocytes. Reduced HPGD expression in male cardiomyocytes derive from impaired androgen receptor (AR)–signaling due to loss of its cofactor STAT3. Elevated PGD<sub>2</sub> secretion in males is associated with increased white adipocyte accumulation in aged male but not female hearts. Adipocyte differentiation is enhanced in isolated stem cell antigen-1 (SCA-1)<sup>+</sup> cardiac progenitor cells (CPC) from young male CKO-mice compared with the adipocyte differentiation of male wild-type (WT)-CPC and CPC isolated from female mice. Epigenetic analysis in freshly isolated male CKO-CPC display hypermethylation in pro-angiogenic genes (<i>Fgfr2</i>, <i>Epas1</i>) and hypomethylation in the white adipocyte differentiation gene <i>Zfp423</i> associated with up-regulated ZFP423 expression and a shift from endothelial to white adipocyte differentiation compared with WT-CPC. The expression of the histone-methyltransferase EZH2 is reduced in male CKO-CPC compared with male WT-CPC, whereas no differences in the EZH2 expression in female CPC were observed. Clonally expanded CPC can differentiate into endothelial cells or into adipocytes depending on the differentiation conditions. ZFP423 overexpression is sufficient to induce white adipocyte differentiation of clonal CPC. In isolated WT-CPC, PGD<sub>2</sub> stimulation reduces the expression of EZH2, thereby up-regulating ZFP423 expression and promoting white adipocyte differentiation. The treatment of young male CKO mice with the COX inhibitor Ibuprofen or the PGD<sub>2</sub> receptor (DP)2 receptor antagonist BAY-u 3405 in vivo increased EZH2 expression and reduced ZFP423 expression and adipocyte differentiation in CKO-CPC. Thus, cardiomyocyte STAT3 deficiency leads to age-related and sex-specific cardiac remodeling and failure in part due to sex-specific alterations in PGD<sub>2</sub> secretion and subsequent epigenetic impairment of the differentiation potential of CPC. Causally involved is the impaired AR signaling in absence of STAT3, which reduces the expression of the PG-degrading enzyme HPGD.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/bZIPnUYRK2w" width="1" />

Understanding species’ roles in food webs requires an accurate assessment of their trophic niche. However, it is challenging to delineate potential trophic interactions across an ecosystem, and a paucity of empirical information often leads to inconsistent definitions of trophic guilds based on expert opinion, especially when applied to hyperdiverse ecosystems. Using coral reef fishes as a model group, we show that experts disagree on the assignment of broad trophic guilds for more than 20% of species, which hampers comparability across studies. Here, we propose a quantitative, unbiased, and reproducible approach to define trophic guilds and apply recent advances in machine learning to predict probabilities of pairwise trophic interactions with high accuracy. We synthesize data from community-wide gut content analyses of tropical coral reef fishes worldwide, resulting in diet information from 13,961 individuals belonging to 615 reef fish. We then use network analysis to identify 8 trophic guilds and Bayesian phylogenetic modeling to show that trophic guilds can be predicted based on phylogeny and maximum body size. Finally, we use machine learning to test whether pairwise trophic interactions can be predicted with accuracy. Our models achieved a misclassification error of less than 5%, indicating that our approach results in a quantitative and reproducible trophic categorization scheme, as well as high-resolution probabilities of trophic interactions. By applying our framework to the most diverse vertebrate consumer group, we show that it can be applied to other organismal groups to advance reproducibility in trait-based ecology. Our work thus provides a viable approach to account for the complexity of predator–prey interactions in highly diverse ecosystems.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/gkLuvPEX4Ak" width="1" />

<p>We diagnosed 11 Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) cases among 71,904 COVID patients attended at 61 Spanish emergency departments (EDs) during the 2‐month pandemic peak. The relative frequency of GBS among ED patients was higher in COVID (0.15‰) than non‐COVID (0.02‰) patients (odds ratio [OR] = 6.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.18–12.5), as was the standardized incidence (9.44 and 0.69 cases/100,000 inhabitant‐years, respectively, OR = 13.5, 95% CI = 9.87–18.4). Regarding clinical characteristics, olfactory–gustatory disorders were more frequent in COVID‐GBS than non‐COVID–GBS (OR = 27.59, 95% CI = 1.296–587) and COVID–non‐GBS (OR = 7.875, 95% CI = 1.587–39.09) patients. Although COVID‐GBS patients were more frequently admitted to intensive care, mortality was not increased versus control groups.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has recently gained attention as an alternative treatment of malignant gliomas. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent within tumors of the central nervous system (CNS). Conventional treatments for this CNS tumor include surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Surgery is still being considered as the treatment of choice. Even so, the poor prognosis and/or recurrence of the disease after applying any of these treatments highlight the urgency of exploring new therapies and/or improving existing ones to achieve the definitive eradication of tumor masses and remaining cells. PDT is a therapeutic modality that involves the destruction of tumor cells by reactive oxygen species induced by light, which were previously treated with a photosensitizing agent. However, in recent years, its experimental application has expanded to other effects that could improve overall performance against GBM. In the current review, we revisit the main advances of PDT for GBM management and also, the recent mechanistic insights about cellular and molecular aspects related to tumoral resistance to PDT of GBM.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57243">Cancer-associated fibroblasts and their influence on tumor immunity and immunotherapy</a></h4>

Fibroblasts play an essential role in organogenesis and the integrity of tissue architecture and function. Growth in most solid tumors is dependent upon remodeling ‘stroma’, composed of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and extracellular matrix (ECM), which plays a critical role in tumor initiation, progression, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. Recent studies have clearly established that the potent immunosuppressive activity of stroma is a major mechanism by which stroma can promote tumor progression and confer resistance to immune-based therapies. Herein, we review recent advances in identifying the stroma-dependent mechanisms that regulate cancer-associated inflammation and antitumor immunity, in particular, the interactions between fibroblasts and immune cells. We also review the potential mechanisms by which stroma can confer resistance to immune-based therapies for solid tumors and current advancements in stroma-targeted therapies.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55177">Diverse and complex muscle spindle afferent firing properties emerge from multiscale muscle mechanics</a></h4>

Despite decades of research, we lack a mechanistic framework capable of predicting how movement-related signals are transformed into the diversity of muscle spindle afferent firing patterns observed experimentally, particularly in naturalistic behaviors. Here, a biophysical model demonstrates that well-known firing characteristics of mammalian muscle spindle Ia afferents – including movement history dependence, and nonlinear scaling with muscle stretch velocity – emerge from first principles of muscle contractile mechanics. Further, mechanical interactions of the muscle spindle with muscle-tendon dynamics reveal how motor commands to the muscle (alpha drive) versus muscle spindle (gamma drive) can cause highly variable and complex activity during active muscle contraction and muscle stretch that defy simple explanation. Depending on the neuromechanical conditions, the muscle spindle model output appears to ‘encode’ aspects of muscle force, yank, length, stiffness, velocity, and/or acceleration, providing an extendable, multiscale, biophysical framework for understanding and predicting proprioceptive sensory signals in health and disease.

Cortical areas have the capacity of large-scale reorganization following sensory deprivation. However, it remains unclear whether this is a unique process that homogenously affects the entire deprived region or it is suitable to changes depending on local circuitries across layers. By using in vivo electrophysiology to record neuronal activity simultaneously across cortical depth, we showed that sensory deprivation due to spinal cord injury induces layer-specific changes in both spontaneous and evoked-activity. While supragranular layers specifically increased gamma oscillations and the ability to initiate up-states during spontaneous activity, infragranular layers displayed increased, faster and delayed evoked-responses to sensory stimulation. Therefore, sensory deprivation immediately modifies local circuitries allowing supragranular layers to better integrate spontaneous corticocortical information to maintain column excitability, and infragranular layers to better integrate evoked-sensory inputs to preserve subcortical outputs. These layer-specific changes may guide long-term alterations in excitability and plasticity associated to network rearrangements and the appearance of sensory pathologies associated with spinal cord injury.

Lysophosphatidyl-choline (LPC), a member of the phospholipid family, has recently emerged as an interesting new player in pain. It has been proposed to mediate pain through Acid-Sensing Ion Channel 3 (ASIC3), a pain-related channel mainly expressed in peripheral sensory neurons. LPC potentiates ASIC3 current evoked by mild acidifications, but can also activate the channel at physiological pH, and its local injection in rodents evokes ASIC3-dependent pain. We combine here in vivo recordings of spinal cord neuron activity with subcutaneous LPC injection to analyze the mechanism of action associated with the LPC-induced, ASIC3-dependent pain in peripheral and spinal cord neurons. We show that a single cutaneous injection of LPC exclusively affects the nociceptive pathway. It evokes an ASIC3-dependent short-term sensitization of nociceptive fibers that drives hyperexcitability of projecting neurons within the dorsal spinal cord without apparent central sensitization.

The position of the axon initial segment (AIS) is thought to play a critical role in neuronal excitability. In particular, empirical studies have found correlations between a distal shift in AIS position and a reduction of excitability. Yet, theoretical work has suggested that the neuron should become more excitable as the distance between soma and AIS is increased, because of increased electrical isolation. Specifically, resistive coupling theory predicts that the action potential (AP) threshold decreases with the logarithm of the axial resistance (Ra) between the middle of the AIS and the soma. However, no direct experimental evidence has been provided so far to support this theoretical prediction. We therefore examined how changes in Ra at the axon hillock impact the voltage threshold (Vth) of the somatic AP in L5 pyramidal neurons. Increasing Ra by mechanically pinching the axon between the soma and the AIS was found to lower the spike threshold by ~6 mV. Conversely, decreasing Ra by replacing a weakly mobile ion (gluconate) by a highly mobile ion (chloride) elevated the spike threshold. All Ra-dependent changes in spike threshold could be reproduced in a Hodgkin-Huxley compartmental model. We conclude that in L5 pyramidal neurons, excitability increases with axial resistance, and therefore with a distal shift of the AIS.

Autophagy is a cellular degradation pathway essential for neuronal health and function. Autophagosome biogenesis occurs at synapses, is locally regulated and increases in response to neuronal activity. The mechanisms that couple autophagosome biogenesis to synaptic activity remain unknown. In this study we determine that trafficking of ATG-9, the only transmembrane protein in the core autophagy pathway, links the synaptic vesicle cycle with autophagy. ATG-9 positive vesicles in C. elegans are generated from the trans-Golgi network via AP3-dependent budding, and delivered to presynaptic sites. At presynaptic sites, ATG-9 undergoes exo-endocytosis in an activity-dependent manner. Mutations that disrupt endocytosis, including one associated with Parkinson's disease, result in abnormal ATG-9 accumulation at clathrin-rich synaptic foci and defects in activity-dependent presynaptic autophagy. Our findings uncover regulated key steps of ATG-9 trafficking at presynaptic sites, and provide evidence that ATG-9 exo-endocytosis couples autophagosome biogenesis at presynaptic sites with the activity-dependent synaptic vesicle cycle.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.27.424515v1?rss=1">Conflict-mediated tasks for studying the act of facing threats in pursuit of rewards</a></h4>

Survival depends on the ability of animals to avoid threats and approach rewards. Traditionally, these two opposing motivational systems have been studied separately. In nature, however, they regularly occur simultaneously. When threat- and reward-eliciting stimuli (learned or unlearned) co-occur, a motivational conflict emerges that challenges individuals to weigh available options and execute a single behavioral response (avoid or approach). Previous animal models using approach-avoidance conflicts have often focused on the ability to avoid threats by forgoing the opportunity to obtain rewards. In contrast, behavioral tasks designed to capitalize on the ability to actively choose to execute approach behaviors despite threats are lacking. Thus, we developed three conflict-mediated tasks to directly study rats confronting threats to obtain rewards guided by innate and conditioned cues. One conflict task involves crossing a potentially electrified grid to obtain food on the opposite end of a straight alley, the second task is based on the step-down threat avoidance paradigm, and the third one is a modified version of the open field test. We used diazepam to pharmacologically validate conflict-mediated behaviors in our tasks. We found that, regardless of whether competing stimuli were conditioned or innate, a low diazepam dose facilitated taking action to obtain rewards in the face of threats during conflict, without affecting choice behavior when there was no conflict involved. Using this validated set of innate/learned conflict-mediated tasks could help understand the underlying brain mechanisms that allow animals to confront threats, by actively suppressing defensive responses, to achieve goals.

Visual image reconstruction from brain activity produces images whose features are consistent with the neural representations in the visual cortex given arbitrary visual instances [1-3], presumably reflecting the persons visual experience. Previous reconstruction studies have been concerned either with how stimulus images are faithfully reconstructed or with whether mentally imagined contents can be reconstructed in the absence of external stimuli. However, many lines of vision research have demonstrated that even stimulus perception is shaped both by stimulus-induced processes and top-down processes. In particular, attention (or the lack of it) is known to profoundly affect visual experience [4-8] and brain activity [9-21]. Here, to investigate how top-down attention impacts the neural representation of visual images and the reconstructions, we use a state-of-the-art method (deep image reconstruction [3]) to reconstruct visual images from fMRI activity measured while subjects attend to one of two images superimposed with equally weighted contrasts. Deep image reconstruction exploits the hierarchical correspondence between the brain and a deep neural network (DNN) to translate (decode) brain activity into DNN features of multiple layers, and then create images that are consistent with the decoded DNN features [3, 22, 23]. Using the deep image reconstruction model trained on fMRI responses to single natural images, we decode brain activity during the attention trials. Behavioral evaluations show that the reconstructions resemble the attended rather than the unattended images. The reconstructions can be modeled by superimposed images with contrasts biased to the attended one, which are comparable to the appearance of the stimuli under attention measured in a separate session. Attentional modulations are found in a broad range of hierarchical visual representations and mirror the brain-DNN correspondence. Our results demonstrate that top-down attention counters stimulus-induced responses and modulate neural representations to render reconstructions in accordance with subjective appearance. The reconstructions appear to reflect the content of visual experience and volitional control, opening a new possibility of brain-based communication and creation.

Astrocytes are widely implicated in CNS diseases, but their contributions to disease related phenotypes remain incompletely explored. Anhedonia accompanies several neurological and psychiatric diseases, including major depressive disorder (MDD) and Alzheimers disease (AD), both of which are associated with neuroinflammation. In order to explore how neuroinflammation affects astrocytes, we assessed medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) and visual cortex (VCX) astrocytic gene expression using a neuroinflammation mouse model that displayed anhedonia as a phenotype. In this model, anhedonia was reversed by the fast acting antidepressant ketamine. Astrocyte specific gene expression alterations included those related to immune cell signaling, intracellular Ca2+ signaling, cholesterol biosynthesis, and metabolic pathways. Such changes peaked when anhedonia was greatest, and reversed to normal when anhedonia subsided. However, region-specific molecular identities between PFC and VCX astrocytes were maintained throughout, implying that astrocyte identities do not converge during neuroinflammation. We also mapped anhedonia-related astrocyte and bulk tissue gene expression changes onto published PFC single cell RNA sequencing data, and compared them to MDD and AD post-mortem human tissue samples to identify shared mechanisms. Finally, we assessed how neuroinflammation affected mPFC neuronal properties and detected no alterations at a time point when there was strong astrocyte reactivity. Our data show that neuroinflammation can cause significant and reversible changes in astrocyte gene expression and mouse behaviour without obvious neurotoxicity or loss of essential homeostatic functions. Furthermore, gene expression signatures accompanying neuroinflammation reveal pathways shared with MDD and AD, which display neuroinflammation as a comorbidity in humans.

Significance statementAstrocytes are widely implicated in brain diseases, but their contributions to disease-related phenotypes remain incompletely explored. To make inroads into this problem, we assessed medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) and visual cortex (VCX) astrocyte gene expression using a peripherally induced neuroinflammation mouse model that produced anhedonia - a phenotype associated with several brain disorders. Neuroinflammation caused reversible changes in mouse behaviour and astrocyte-specific gene expression changes, some of which were related to human post mortem data for major depressive disorder (MDD) and Alzheimers disease (AD), but without any clear evidence of neurotoxicity in PFC of mice. The astrocyte molecular alterations accompanying neuroinflammation-induced anhedonia will be informative to explore diverse brain disorders and the effects of neuroinflammation on the CNS more broadly.

Goal-directed behaviors involve distributed brain networks. The small size of the mouse brain makes it amenable to manipulations of neural activity dispersed across brain areas, but existing optogenetic methods serially test a few brain regions at a time, which slows comprehensive mapping of distributed networks. Laborious operant conditioning training required for most experimental paradigms exacerbates this bottleneck. We present an autonomous workflow to survey the involvement of brain regions at scale during operant behaviors in mice. Naive mice living in a home-cage system learned voluntary head-fixation (&gt;1 hour/day) and performed difficult decision-making tasks, including contingency reversals, for 2 months without human supervision. We incorporated an optogenetic approach to manipulate activity in deep brain regions through intact skull during home-cage behavior. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we tested dozens of mice in parallel unsupervised optogenetic experiments, revealing multiple regions in cortex, striatum, and superior colliculus involved in tactile decision-making.

Deposition of amyloid beta (A{beta}) and phosphorylated Tau along with microglia- and astrocyte-mediated neuroinflammation are prominent pathogeneic features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In recent years, impairment of autophagy has also been shown to contribute to AD progression. Here, we provide evidence that oral treatment of amyloid-prone AD-like APPPS1 mice with the autophagy activator Spermidine, a small body-endogenous polyamine often used as dietary supplement, decreased neuroinflammation and reduced neurotoxic soluble A{beta} at both early and late stages of AD. Mechanistically, Spermidine induced autophagy in microglia as well as in astrocytes, which subsequently impacted TLR3- and TLR4-mediated inflammatory processes by decreasing cytotoxicity, inflammasome activity and NF-{kappa}B signalling. Our data highlight that autophagy targets the inflammatory response of glial cells and emphasize the potential of orally administered autophagy-activating drugs such as Spermidine to interfere with AD progression.

Many neuron types consist of populations with continuously varying molecular properties. Here we show a continuum of postsynaptic molecular properties in three types of neurons and assess the functional consequences in cerebellar unipolar brush cells (UBCs). While UBCs are thought to form discrete functional subtypes, with mossy fiber (MF) activation increasing firing in ON-UBC and suppressing firing in OFF-UBC. We find instead a continuum of response profiles that reflect the graded and inversely correlated expression of excitatory mGluR1 and inhibitory mGluR2/3 pathways. MFs coactivate mGluR2/3 and mGluR1 in many UBCs, leading to sequential inhibition-excitation because mGluR2/3-currents are faster. Additionally, we show that DAG kinase controls mGluR1 response duration, and that graded DAG kinase levels account for systematic variation of response duration over two orders of magnitude. These results demonstrate that continuous variations in metabotropic signaling can generate a stable cell-autonomous basis for temporal integration and learning over multiple time scales.

The complex connectivity of the mammalian brain underlies its function, but understanding how interconnected brain regions interact in neural processing remains a formidable challenge. Here we address this problem by introducing a genetic probe that permits selective functional imaging of neural circuit elements defined by their synaptic interrelationships throughout the brain. The probe is an engineered enzyme that transduces cytosolic calcium dynamics of probe-expressing cells into localized hemodynamic responses that can be selectively visualized by functional magnetic resonance imaging. Using a viral vector that undergoes retrograde transport, we apply the probe to characterize a brain-wide network of monosynaptic inputs to the striatum activated in a deep brain stimulation paradigm in rats. The results reveal engagement of surprisingly diverse projection sources and inform an integrated model of striatal function relevant to reward behavior and therapeutic neurostimulation approaches. Our work thus establishes a potent strategy for mechanistic analysis of distributed neural systems.

Open-top light sheet microscopy (OT-LSM) is a specialized microscopy for the high throughput cellular imaging of large tissues including optically cleared tissues by having all the optical setup below the sample stage. Current OT-LSM systems had relatively low axial resolutions by using weakly focused light sheets to cover the imaging field of view (FOV). In this report, open-top axially swept LSM (OTAS-LSM) was developed for high-throughput cellular imaging with the improved axial resolution. OTAS-LSM swept the tightly focused excitation light sheet across the imaging FOV by using an electro tunable lens (ETL) and collected emission light at the focus of light sheet with a camera in the rolling shutter mode. OTAS-LSM was developed by using air objective lenses and a water prism for simplicity and it had on-axis optical aberration associated with the mismatch of refractive indices between air and immersion medium. The effects of optical aberration were analyzed by both simulation and experiment. The image resolutions were 1.5-1.6m, and approximately 140% of the aberration-free theoretical values. The newly developed OTAS-LSM was applied to the imaging of optically cleared mouse brain and small intestine and it could visualize neuronal networks in the single cell level. OTAS-LSM might be useful for the high-throughput cellular examination of optically cleared large tissues.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Limbic encephalitis (LE) comprises a spectrum of inflammatory changes in affected brain structures including the presence of autoantibodies and lymphoid cells. Still, the potential of distinct lymphocyte subsets alone to elicit key clinico‐pathological sequelae of LE potentially inducing temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) with chronic spontaneous seizures and hippocampal sclerosis (HS) is unresolved.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Here, we scrutinized pathogenic consequences emerging from CD8<sup>+</sup> T‐cells targeting hippocampal neurons by recombinant adeno‐associated virus‐mediated expression of the model‐autoantigen Ovalbumin (OVA) in CA1 neurons of OT‐I/RAG1<sup>‐/‐</sup> mice (termed ‘OVA‐CD8<sup>+</sup> LE model’).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Viral‐mediated antigen transfer caused dense CD8<sup>+</sup> T‐cell infiltrates confined to the hippocampal formation starting on day five after virus transduction. Flow cytometry indicated priming of CD8<sup>+</sup> T‐cells in brain‐draining lymph nodes to precede hippocampal invasion. At the acute model stage, the inflammatory process was accompanied by frequent seizure activity and impairment of hippocampal memory skills. MRI‐scans at day seven of the OVA‐CD8<sup>+</sup> LE model revealed hippocampal edema and blood‐brain‐barrier disruption that converted into atrophy until day 40. CD8<sup>+</sup> T‐cells specifically targeted OVA‐expressing, SIINFEKL‐H‐2K<sup>b</sup> positive CA1 neurons and caused segmental apoptotic neurodegeneration, astrogliosis and microglial activation. At the chronic model stage, mice exhibited spontaneous recurrent seizures and persisting memory deficits, whilst the sclerotic hippocampus was populated with CD8<sup>+</sup> T‐cells escorted by NK‐cells.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These data indicate that a CD8<sup>+</sup> T‐cell initiated attack of distinct hippocampal neurons is sufficient to induce LE converting into TLE‐HS. Intriguingly, the role of CD8<sup>+</sup> T‐cells exceeds neurotoxic effects and points to their major pathogenic role in TLE following LE.</p>

<p>We accomplished visualization and reconstruction of noradrenergic neurons projecting to the olfactory bulb (OB) by infection of adeno‐associated viruses into the locus coeruleus of dopamine beta hydroxylase‐Cre mice. An individual noradrenergic axon traveled while forming several branches and was distributed in multiple glomeruli that were located in different areas of the glomerular layer in the OB.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Olfactory input is processed in the glomerulus of the main olfactory bulb (OB) and relayed to higher centers in the brain by projection neurons. Conversely, centrifugal inputs from other brain regions project to the OB. We have previously analyzed centrifugal inputs into the OB from several brain regions using single‐neuron labeling. In this study, we analyzed the centrifugal noradrenergic (NA) fibers derived from the locus coeruleus (LC), because their projection pathways and synaptic connections in the OB have not been clarified in detail. We analyzed the NA centrifugal projections by single‐neuron labeling and immunoelectron microscopy. Individual NA neurons labeled by viral infection were three‐dimensionally traced using Neurolucida software to visualize the projection pathway from the LC to the OB. Also, centrifugal NA fibers were visualized using an antibody for noradrenaline transporter (NET). NET immunoreactive (‐ir) fibers contained many varicosities and synaptic vesicles. Furthermore, electron tomography demonstrated that NET‐ir fibers formed asymmetrical synapses of varied morphology. Although these synapses were present at varicosities, the density of synapses was relatively low throughout the OB. The maximal density of synapses was found in the external plexiform layer; about 17% of all observed varicosities contained synapses. These results strongly suggest that NA‐containing fibers in the OB release NA from both varicosities and synapses to influence the activities of OB neurons. The present study provides a morphological basis for olfactory modulation by centrifugal NA fibers derived from the LC.</p>

The human lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) is composed mainly of the magnocellular and parvocellular subdivisions. The non-invasive identification of these subdivisions is, however, difficult due to the small size of the LGN. Here we propose a method to identify these subdivisions by combining two structural MR measures: high-resolution proton-density weighted images and macromolecular tissue volume maps. We collected MRI data from 15 healthy subjects and found that the spatial organization of these subdivisions identified by our method was consistent with post-mortem histological data. Furthermore, the stimulus selectivity in these regions measured by functional MRI was consistent with physiological studies. These results suggest that macromolecular tissue volume mapping is a promising approach to evaluating the tissue properties of LGN subdivisions in living humans. This method potentially will enable neuroscientific and clinical hypotheses about the human LGN to be tested.

<p>By observing the behavior of mice in their home cage environment, using the powerful PhenoTyper tracking system, we demonstrate that mice display dramatic reductions in movement and exploration when isolated from their cage mates, an instantaneous effect that escalates over the next 5 days, which is reversible upon re‐pairing.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The effects of social isolation on an individual's behavior is an important field of research, especially as public health officials encourage social distancing to prevent the spread of pandemic disease. In this study we evaluate the effects of social isolation on physical activity in mice. Utilizing a pixel‐based tracking system, we continuously monitored the movement of isolated mice compared with paired cage mates in the home cage environment. We demonstrate that mice that are socially isolated dramatically decrease their movement when separated from their cage mate, and especially in the dark cycle, when mice are normally most active. When isolated mice are re‐paired with their original cage mate, this effect is reversed, and mice return to their prior levels of activity. These findings suggest a close link between social isolation and physical activity, and are of particular interest in the wake of coronavirus disease 2019, when many are forced into isolation. Social isolation may affect an individual's overall activity levels in humans too, which may have unintended effects on health that deserve further consideration.</p>

<h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                  <p class="a-plus-plus">Concussed patients with chronic symptoms commonly report dizziness during exposure to environments with complex visual stimuli (e.g. supermarket aisles, busy crossroads). Such visual induced dizziness is well-known in patients with vestibular deficits, in whom it indicates an overreliance on visual cues in sensory integration. Considering that optokinetic after-nystagmus (OKAN) reflects the response of the central network integrating visual and vestibular self-motion signals (velocity storage network), we investigated OKAN in 71 patients [17 (23.9%) females, 30.36 ± 9.05 years old] who suffered from persistent symptoms after a concussion and presented clinical signs suggesting visual dependence. Data were retrospectively compared with 21 healthy individuals [13 (61.9%) females, 26.29 ± 10.00 years old]. The median values of the slow cumulative eye position and of the time constant of OKAN were significantly higher in patients than in healthy individuals (slow cumulative eye position: 124.15 ± 55.61° in patients and 77.87 ± 45.63° in healthy individuals—<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.012; time constant: 25.17 ± 10.27 s in patients and 13.95 ± 4.92 s in healthy individuals—<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.003). The receiving operating curve (ROC) estimated on the time constant had an overall area under the curve of 0.73. Analysis of the ROC suggests that a test measuring the OKAN time constant could obtain a sensitivity of 0.73 and specificity of 0.72 in determining the origin of the visual-related disturbances in those patients (threshold 16.6 s). In a subset of 43 patients who also performed the Sensory Organization Test (SOT), the proposed OKAN test was twice as sensitive as the SOT. This study suggests that concussed patients with persisting visual symptoms may have an underlying impairment of the velocity storage mechanism and that measuring the OKAN time constant can objectify such impairment.</p>

<p>Axonal mitochondrial size correlates with <i>g</i>‐ratio during homeostasis in multiple species and during advanced remyelination. But not during early remyelination. Oligodendrocyte mitochondria function influence myelin thickness which influence axonal mitochondria size.</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Demyelinating pathology is common in many neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis, stroke, and Alzheimer's disease and results in axonal energy deficiency, dysfunctional axonal propagation, and neurodegeneration. During myelin repair and also during myelin homeostasis, mutual regulative processes between axons and myelin sheaths are known to be essential. However, proficient tools are lacking to characterize axon‐myelin interdependence during (re)myelination. Thus, we herein investigated adaptions in myelin sheath <i>g</i>‐ratio as a proxy for myelin thickness and axon metabolic status during homeostasis and myelin repair, by using axonal mitochondrial size as a proxy for axonal metabolic status. We found that axons with thinner myelin sheaths had larger axonal mitochondria; this was true for across different central nervous system tracts as well as across species, including humans. The link between myelin sheath thickness and mitochondrial size was temporarily absent during demyelination but reestablished during advanced remyelination, as shown in two commonly used animal models of toxic demyelination. By further exploring this association in mice with either genetically induced mitochondrial or myelin dysfunction, we show that axonal mitochondrial size adjusts in response to the thickness of the myelin sheath but not <i>vice versa</i>. This pinpoints the relevance of mitochondrial adaptation upon myelin repair and might open a new therapeutic window for remyelinating therapies.</p>

<p>We generated a novel vitamin D receptor (VDR) VDR<sup>Cre</sup> knockin mouse for the interrogation of VDR anatomy in the brain. In this paper, we demonstrate through immunohistochemistry that VDR<sup>Cre</sup>‐driven reporter expression colocalizes with VDR mRNA throughout the brain. Additionally, we demonstrate that tdTomato (+) neurons respond rapidly to vitamin D, which does not occur in tdTomato (‐) neurons.

</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Vitamin D action has been linked to several diseases regulated by the brain including obesity, diabetes, autism, and Parkinson’s. However, the location of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in the brain is not clear due to conflicting reports. We found that two antibodies previously published as specific in peripheral tissues are not specific in the brain. We thus created a new knockin mouse with cre recombinase expression under the control of the endogenous VDR promoter (VDR<sup>Cre</sup>). We demonstrated that the cre activity in the VDR<sup>Cre</sup> mouse brain (as reported by a cre‐dependent tdTomato expression) is highly overlapping with endogenous VDR mRNAs. These VDR‐expressing cells were enriched in multiple brain regions including the cortex, amygdala, caudate putamen, and hypothalamus among others. In the hypothalamus, VDR partially colocalized with vasopressin, oxytocin, estrogen receptor α, and β‐endorphin to various degrees. We further functionally validated our model by demonstrating that the endogenous VDR agonist 1,25‐dihydroxyvitamin D activated all tested tdTomato+ neurons in the paraventricular hypothalamus but had no effect on neurons without tdTomato fluorescence. Thus, we have generated a new mouse tool that allows us to visualize VDR‐expressing cells and to characterize their functions.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Freshwater snails of the genus <i>Biomphalaria</i> serve as obligatory hosts for the digenetic trematode <i>Schistosoma mansoni</i>, the causative agent for the most widespread form of intestinal schistosomiasis. Within <i>Biomphalaria</i>, <i>S. mansoni</i> larvae multiply and transform into the cercariae form that can infect humans. Trematode development and proliferation is thought to be facilitated by modifications of host behavior and physiological processes, including a reduction of reproduction known as ‘parasitic castration’. As neuropeptides participate in the control of reproduction across phylogeny, a neural transcriptomics approach was undertaken to identify peptides that could regulate <i>Biomphalaria</i> reproductive physiology. The present study identified a transcript in <i>Biomphalaria alexandrina</i> that encodes a peptide belonging to the gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) superfamily. The precursor and the predicted mature peptide, pQIHFTPDWGNN‐NH<sub>2</sub> (designated <i>Biom</i>‐GnRH), share features with peptides identified in other molluscan species, including panpulmonates, opisthobranchs, and cephalopods. An antibody generated against <i>Biom</i>‐GnRH labeled neurons in the cerebral, pedal, and visceral ganglia of <i>B. glabrata</i>. GnRH‐like immunoreactive (GnRHli) fiber systems projected to all central ganglia. In the periphery, immunoreactive material was detected in the ovotestis, oviduct, albumen gland, and nidamental gland. As these structures serve crucial roles in the production, transport, nourishment, and encapsulation of eggs, disruption of the GnRH system of <i>Biomphalaria</i> could contribute to reduced reproductive activity in infected snails.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed to characterize the phenotypic spectrum and functional consequences associated with variants in the gene <i>GABRB2</i>, coding for the γ‐aminobutyric acid type A (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptor subunit β2.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We recruited and systematically evaluated 25 individuals with variants in <i>GABRB2</i>, 17 of whom are newly described and 8 previously reported with additional clinical data. Functional analysis was performed using a <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocyte model system.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Our cohort of 25 individuals from 22 families with variants in <i>GABRB2</i> demonstrated a range of epilepsy phenotypes from genetic generalized epilepsy to developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. Fifty‐eight percent of individuals had pharmacoresistant epilepsy; response to medications targeting the GABAergic pathway was inconsistent. Developmental disability (present in 84%) ranged from mild intellectual disability to severe global disability; movement disorders (present in 44%) included choreoathetosis, dystonia, and ataxia. Disease‐associated variants cluster in the extracellular N‐terminus and transmembrane domains 1–3, with more severe phenotypes seen in association with variants in transmembrane domains 1 and 2 and the allosteric binding site between transmembrane domains 2 and 3. Functional analysis of 4 variants in transmembrane domains 1 or 2 (p.Ile246Thr, p.Pro252Leu, p.Ile288Ser, p.Val282Ala) revealed strongly reduced amplitudes of GABA‐evoked anionic currents.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p><i>GABRB2</i>‐related epilepsy ranges broadly in severity from genetic generalized epilepsy to developmental and epileptic encephalopathies. Developmental disability and movement disorder are key features. The phenotypic spectrum is comparable to other GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor‐encoding genes. Phenotypic severity varies by protein domain. Experimental evidence supports loss of GABAergic inhibition as the mechanism underlying <i>GABRB2</i>‐associated neurodevelopmental disorders. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<p>In the past decade, society has experienced notable growth in a variety of
technological areas. However, the Fourth Industrial Revolution has not been
embraced yet. Industry 4.0 imposes several challenges which include the
necessity of new architectural models to tackle the uncertainty that open
environments represent to cyber-physical systems (CPS). Waste Electrical and
Electronic Equipment (WEEE) recycling plants stand for one of such open
environments. Here, CPSs must work harmoniously in a changing environment,
interacting with similar and not so similar CPSs, and adaptively collaborating
with human workers. In this paper, we support the Distributed Adaptive Control
(DAC) theory as a suitable Cognitive Architecture for managing a recycling
plant. Specifically, a recursive implementation of DAC (between both
single-agent and large-scale levels) is proposed to meet the expected demands
of the European Project HR-Recycler. Additionally, with the aim of having a
realistic benchmark for future implementations of the recursive DAC, a
micro-recycling plant prototype is presented.

<p>For more than a century, scientists have been collecting behavioral data--an
increasing fraction of which is now being publicly shared so other researchers
can reuse them to replicate, integrate or extend past results. Although
behavioral data is fundamental to many scientific fields, there is currently no
widely adopted standard for formatting, naming, organizing, describing or
sharing such data. This lack of standardization is a major bottleneck for
scientific progress. Not only does it prevent the effective reuse of data, it
also affects how behavioral data in general are processed, as non-standard data
calls for custom-made data analysis code and prevents the development of
efficient tools. To address this problem, we develop the Behaverse Data Model
(BDM), a standard for structuring behavioral data. Here we focus on major
concepts in behavioral data, leaving further details and developments to the
project's website (https://behaverse.github.io/data-model/).

<p>Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is emerging as a new research direction
which has the potential to replace the hand-crafted neural architectures
designed for specific tasks. Previous evolution based architecture search
requires high computational resources resulting in high search time. In this
work, we propose a novel way of applying a simple genetic algorithm to the NAS
problem called EvNAS (Evolving Neural Architecture using One Shot Model) which
reduces the search time significantly while still achieving better result than
previous evolution based methods. The architectures are represented by using
the architecture parameter of the one shot model which results in the weight
sharing among the architectures for a given population of architectures and
also weight inheritance from one generation to the next generation of
architectures. We propose a decoding technique for the architecture parameter
which is used to divert majority of the gradient information towards the given
architecture and is also used for improving the performance prediction of the
given architecture from the one shot model during the search process.
Furthermore, we use the accuracy of the partially trained architecture on the
validation data as a prediction of its fitness in order to reduce the search
time. EvNAS searches for the architecture on the proxy dataset i.e. CIFAR-10
for 4.4 GPU day on a single GPU and achieves top-1 test error of 2.47% with
3.63M parameters which is then transferred to CIFAR-100 and ImageNet achieving
top-1 error of 16.37% and top-5 error of 7.4% respectively. All of these
results show the potential of evolutionary methods in solving the architecture
search problem.

<p>The preB\"otzinger Complex, the mammalian inspiratory rhythm generator,
encodes inspiratory time as motor pattern. Spike synchronization throughout
this sparsely connected network generates inspiratory bursts albeit with
variable latencies after preinspiratory activity onset in each breathing cycle.
Using preB\"otC rhythmogenic microcircuit minimal models, we examined the
variability in probability and latency to burst, mimicking experiments. Among
various physiologically plausible graphs of 1000 point neurons with
experimentally determined neuronal and synaptic parameters, directed
Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs best captured the experimentally observed dynamics.
Mechanistically, preB\"otC (de)synchronization and oscillatory dynamics are
regulated by the efferent connectivity of spiking neurons that gates the
amplification of modest preinspiratory activity through input convergence.
Furthermore, to replicate experiments, a lognormal distribution of synaptic
weights was necessary to augment the efficacy of convergent coincident inputs.
These mechanisms enable exceptionally robust yet flexible preB\"otC attractor
dynamics that, we postulate, represent universal temporal-processing and
decision-making computational motifs throughout the brain.

<p>A central challenge in the computational modeling of neural dynamics is the
trade-off between accuracy and simplicity. At the level of individual neurons,
nonlinear dynamics are both experimentally established and essential for
neuronal functioning. An implicit assumption has thus formed that an accurate
computational model of whole-brain dynamics must also be highly nonlinear,
whereas linear models may provide a first-order approximation. Here, we provide
a rigorous and data-driven investigation of this hypothesis at the level of
whole-brain blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) and macroscopic field potential
dynamics by leveraging the theory of system identification. Using functional
MRI (fMRI) and intracranial EEG (iEEG), we model the resting state activity of
700 subjects in the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and 122 subjects from the
Restoring Active Memory (RAM) project using state-of-the-art linear and
nonlinear model families. We assess relative model fit using predictive power,
computational complexity, and the extent of residual dynamics unexplained by
the model. Contrary to our expectations, linear auto-regressive models achieve
the best measures across all three metrics, eliminating the trade-off between
accuracy and simplicity. To understand and explain this linearity, we highlight
four properties of macroscopic neurodynamics which can counteract or mask
microscopic nonlinear dynamics: averaging over space, averaging over time,
observation noise, and limited data samples. Whereas the latter two are
technological limitations and can improve in the future, the former two are
inherent to aggregated macroscopic brain activity. Our results, together with
the unparalleled interpretability of linear models, can greatly facilitate our
understanding of macroscopic neural dynamics and the principled design of
model-based interventions for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.

<p>We combine two popular optimization approaches to derive learning algorithms
for generative models: variational optimization and evolutionary algorithms.
The combination is realized for generative models with discrete latents by
using truncated posteriors as the family of variational distributions. The
variational parameters of truncated posteriors are sets of latent states. By
interpreting these states as genomes of individuals and by using the
variational lower bound to define a fitness, we can apply evolutionary
algorithms to realize the variational loop. The used variational distributions
are very flexible and we show that evolutionary algorithms can effectively and
efficiently optimize the variational bound. Furthermore, the variational loop
is generally applicable ("black box") with no analytical derivations required.
To show general applicability, we apply the approach to three generative models
(we use noisy-OR Bayes Nets, Binary Sparse Coding, and Spike-and-Slab Sparse
Coding). To demonstrate effectiveness and efficiency of the novel variational
approach, we use the standard competitive benchmarks of image denoising and
inpainting. The benchmarks allow quantitative comparisons to a wide range of
methods including probabilistic approaches, deep deterministic and generative
networks, and non-local image processing methods. In the category of
"zero-shot" learning (when only the corrupted image is used for training), we
observed the evolutionary variational algorithm to significantly improve the
state-of-the-art in many benchmark settings. For one well-known inpainting
benchmark, we also observed state-of-the-art performance across all categories
of algorithms although we only train on the corrupted image. In general, our
investigations highlight the importance of research on optimization methods for
generative models to achieve performance improvements.

<p>We introduce and experimentally demonstrate tag-based genetic regulation, a
new genetic programming (GP) technique that allows evolving programs to
dynamically adjust which code modules to express. Tags are evolvable labels
that provide a flexible mechanism for referring to code modules. Tag-based
genetic regulation extends existing tag-based naming schemes to allow programs
to "promote" and "repress" code modules. This extension allows evolution to
structure a program as a gene regulatory network where program modules are
regulated based on instruction executions. We demonstrate the functionality of
tag-based regulation on a range of program synthesis problems. We find that
tag-based regulation improves problem-solving performance on context-dependent
problems; that is, problems where programs must adjust how they respond to
current inputs based on prior inputs (i.e., current context). We also observe
that our implementation of tag-based genetic regulation can impede adaptive
evolution when expected outputs are not context-dependent (i.e., the correct
response to a particular input remains static over time). Tag-based genetic
regulation broadens our repertoire of techniques for evolving more dynamic
genetic programs and can easily be incorporated into existing tag-enabled GP
systems.

<p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have great potential for energy-efficient
implementation of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on dedicated neuromorphic
hardware. Recent studies demonstrated competitive performance of SNNs compared
with DNNs on image classification tasks, including CIFAR-10 and ImageNet data.
The present work focuses on using SNNs in combination with deep reinforcement
learning in ATARI games, which involves additional complexity as compared to
image classification. We review the theory of converting DNNs to SNNs and
extending the conversion to Deep Q-Networks (DQNs). We propose a robust
representation of the firing rate to reduce the error during the conversion
process. In addition, we introduce a new metric to evaluate the conversion
process by comparing the decisions made by the DQN and SNN, respectively. We
also analyze how the simulation time and parameter normalization influence the
performance of converted SNNs. We achieve competitive scores on 17
top-performing Atari games. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first
to achieve state-of-the-art performance on multiple Atari games with SNNs. Our
work serves as a benchmark for the conversion of DQNs to SNNs and paves the way
for further research on solving reinforcement learning tasks with SNNs.

<p>Artificial neural networks can achieve impressive performances, and even
outperform humans in some specific tasks. Nevertheless, unlike biological
brains, the artificial neural networks suffer from tiny perturbations in
sensory input, under various kinds of adversarial attacks. It is therefore
necessary to study the origin of the adversarial vulnerability. Here, we
establish a fundamental relationship between geometry of hidden representations
(manifold perspective) and the generalization capability of the deep networks.
For this purpose, we choose a deep neural network trained by local errors, and
then analyze emergent properties of trained networks through the manifold
dimensionality, manifold smoothness, and the generalization capability. To
explore effects of adversarial examples, we consider independent Gaussian noise
attacks and fast-gradient-sign-method (FGSM) attacks. Our study reveals that a
high generalization accuracy requires a relatively fast power-law decay of the
eigen-spectrum of hidden representations. Under Gaussian attacks, the
relationship between generalization accuracy and power-law exponent is
monotonic, while a non-monotonic behavior is observed for FGSM attacks. Our
empirical study provides a route towards a final mechanistic interpretation of
adversarial vulnerability under adversarial attacks.

<p>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) have become competitive forecasting methods,
as most notably shown in the winning method of the recent M4 competition.
However, established statistical models such as ETS and ARIMA gain their
popularity not only from their high accuracy, but they are also suitable for
non-expert users as they are robust, efficient, and automatic. In these areas,
RNNs have still a long way to go. We present an extensive empirical study and
an open-source software framework of existing RNN architectures for
forecasting, that allow us to develop guidelines and best practices for their
use. For example, we conclude that RNNs are capable of modelling seasonality
directly if the series in the dataset possess homogeneous seasonal patterns,
otherwise we recommend a deseasonalization step. Comparisons against ETS and
ARIMA demonstrate that the implemented (semi-)automatic RNN models are no
silver bullets, but they are competitive alternatives in many situations.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/64107">Graded titin cleavage progressively reduces tension and uncovers the source of A-band stability in contracting muscle</a></h4>

The giant muscle protein titin is a major contributor to passive force; however, its role in active force generation is unresolved. Here, we use a novel titin-cleavage (TC) mouse model that allows specific and rapid cutting of elastic titin to quantify how titin-based forces define myocyte ultrastructure and mechanics. We show that under mechanical strain, as titin cleavage doubles from heterozygous to homozygous TC muscles, Z-disks become increasingly out of register while passive and active forces are reduced. Interactions of elastic titin with sarcomeric actin filaments are revealed. Strikingly, when titin-cleaved muscles contract, myosin-containing A-bands become split and adjacent myosin filaments move in opposite directions while also shedding myosins. This establishes intact titin filaments as critical force-transmission networks, buffering the forces observed by myosin filaments during contraction. To perform this function, elastic titin must change stiffness or extensible length, unveiling its fundamental role as an activation-dependent spring in contracting muscle.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63035">Canonical goal-selective representations are absent from prefrontal cortex in a spatial working memory task requiring behavioral flexibility</a></h4>

The prefrontal cortex (PFC)'s functions are thought to include working memory, as its activity can reflect information that must be temporarily maintained to realize the current goal. We designed a flexible spatial working memory task that required rats to navigate—after distractions and a delay—to multiple possible goal locations from different starting points and via multiple routes. This made the current goal location the key variable to remember, instead of a particular direction or route to the goal. However, across a broad population of PFC neurons, we found no evidence of current-goal-specific memory in any previously reported form—i.e. differences in the rate, sequence, phase or covariance of firing. This suggests such patterns do not hold working memory in the PFC when information must be employed flexibly. Instead, the PFC grouped locations representing behaviorally equivalent task features together, consistent with a role in encoding long-term knowledge of task structure.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/61189">Functional implications of MIR domains in protein <i>O</i>-mannosylation</a></h4>

Protein <i>O</i>-mannosyltransferases (PMTs) represent a conserved family of multispanning endoplasmic reticulum membrane proteins involved in glycosylation of S/T-rich protein substrates and unfolded proteins. PMTs work as dimers and contain a luminal MIR domain with a β-trefoil fold, which is susceptive for missense mutations causing α-dystroglycanopathies in humans. Here, we analyze PMT-MIR domains by an integrated structural biology approach using X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy and evaluate their role in PMT function in vivo. We determine Pmt2- and Pmt3-MIR domain structures and identify two conserved mannose-binding sites, which are consistent with general β-trefoil carbohydrate-binding sites (α, β), and also a unique PMT2-subfamily exposed FKR motif. We show that conserved residues in site α influence enzyme processivity of the Pmt1-Pmt2 heterodimer in vivo. Integration of the data into the context of a Pmt1-Pmt2 structure and comparison with homologous β-trefoil – carbohydrate complexes allows for a functional description of MIR domains in protein <i>O</i>-mannosylation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/60415">Proofreading through spatial gradients</a></h4>

Key enzymatic processes use the nonequilibrium error correction mechanism called kinetic proofreading to enhance their specificity. The applicability of traditional proofreading schemes, however, is limited since they typically require dedicated structural features in the enzyme, such as a nucleotide hydrolysis site or multiple intermediate conformations. Here, we explore an alternative conceptual mechanism that achieves error correction by having substrate binding and subsequent product formation occur at distinct physical locations. The time taken by the enzyme-substrate complex to diffuse from one location to another is leveraged to discard wrong substrates. This mechanism does not have the typical structural requirements, making it easier to overlook in experiments. We discuss how the length scales of molecular gradients dictate proofreading performance, and quantify the limitations imposed by realistic diffusion and reaction rates. Our work broadens the applicability of kinetic proofreading and sets the stage for studying spatial gradients as a possible route to specificity.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59095">Constitutive activation of cellular immunity underlies the evolution of resistance to infection in Drosophila</a></h4>

Organisms rely on inducible and constitutive immune defences to combat infection. Constitutive immunity enables a rapid response to infection but may carry a cost for uninfected individuals, leading to the prediction that it will be favoured when infection rates are high. When we exposed populations of <i>Drosophila melanogaster </i>to intense parasitism by the parasitoid wasp <i>Leptopilina boulardi, </i>they evolved resistance by developing a more reactive cellular immune response. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we found that immune-inducible genes had become constitutively upregulated. This was the result of resistant larvae differentiating precursors of specialized immune cells called lamellocytes that were previously only produced after infection. Therefore, populations evolved resistance by genetically hard-wiring the first steps of an induced immune response to become constitutive.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58461">Manipulation of the human tRNA pool reveals distinct tRNA sets that act in cellular proliferation or cell cycle arrest</a></h4>

Different subsets of the tRNA pool in human are expressed in different cellular conditions. The 'proliferation-tRNAs' are induced upon normal and cancerous cell division, while the 'differentiation tRNAs' are active in non-dividing, differentiated cells. Here we examine the essentiality of the various tRNAs upon cellular growth and arrest. We established a CRISPR-based editing procedure with sgRNAs that each target a tRNA family. We measured tRNA essentiality for cellular growth and found that most proliferation tRNAs are essential compared to differentiation tRNAs in rapidly growing cell lines. Yet in more slowly dividing lines, the differentiation tRNAs were more essential. In addition, we measured the essentiality of each tRNA family upon response to cell cycle arresting signals. Here we detected a more complex behavior with both proliferation-tRNAs and differentiation-tRNAs showing various levels of essentiality. These results provide the so-far most comprehensive functional characterization of human tRNAs with intricate roles in various cellular states.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The use and abuse of cannabis can be associated with significant pathophysiology, however it remains unclear whether 1) acute administration of Δ‐9‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) during early adulthood alters the cannabinoid type 1 (CB<sub>1</sub>) receptor localization and expression in cells of the brain, and 2) THC produces structural brain changes. Here we use electron microscopy and a highly sensitive pre‐embedding immunogold method to examine CB<sub>1</sub> receptors in the hippocampus cornu ammonis subfield 1 (CA1) 30 min after male mice were exposed to a single THC injection (5 mg/kg). The findings show that acute exposure to THC can significantly decrease the percentage of CB<sub>1</sub> receptor immunopositive terminals making symmetric synapses, mitochondria and astrocytes. The percentage of CB<sub>1</sub> receptor‐labeled terminals forming asymmetric synapses was unaffected. Lastly, CB<sub>1</sub> receptor expression was significantly lower at terminals of symmetric and asymmetric synapses as well as in mitochondria.</p>
<p>Structurally, CA1 dendrites were significantly larger, and contained more spines and mitochondria following acute THC administration. The area of the dendritic spines, synaptic terminals, mitochondria and astrocytes decreased significantly following acute THC exposure. Altogether, these results indicate that even a single THC exposure can have a significant impact on CB<sub>1</sub> receptor expression, and can alter CA1 ultrastructure, within 30 min of drug exposure. These changes may contribute to the behavioral alterations experienced by young individuals shortly after cannabis intoxication.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Patients with traumatic brain injury who fail to obey commands after sedation‐washout pose one of the most significant challenges for neurological prognostication. Reducing prognostic uncertainty will lead to more appropriate care decisions and ensure provision of limited rehabilitation resources to those most likely to benefit. Bedside‐markers of covert residual cognition, including speech comprehension, may reduce this uncertainty.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We recruited 28 patients with acute traumatic brain injury who were 2‐7‐days sedation‐free and failed to obey commands. Patients heard streams of isochronous monosyllabic words that built meaningful phrases and sentences while their brain activity via electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. In healthy individuals, EEG activity only synchronises with the rhythm of phrases and sentences when listeners consciously comprehend the speech. This approach therefore provides a measure of residual speech comprehension in unresponsive patients.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>17‐ and 16‐patients were available for assessment with the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended at three‐ and six‐months, respectively. Outcome significantly correlated with the strength of patients’ acute cortical tracking of phrases and sentences (r&gt;.6, p&lt;.007), quantified by inter‐trial phase coherence. Linear regressions revealed that the strength of this comprehension response (beta=.603, p=.006) significantly improved the accuracy of prognoses relative to clinical characteristics alone (e.g. Glasgow Coma Scale, Computer Tomography (CT) grade).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>A simple, passive, auditory EEG protocol improves prognostic accuracy in a critical period of clinical decision‐making. Unlike other approaches to probing covert cognition for prognostication, this approach is entirely passive and therefore less susceptible to cognitive deficits, increasing the number of patients who may benefit.</p>

<p>by Colin G. Cess, Stacey D. Finley</p>

Within the tumor microenvironment, macrophages exist in an immunosuppressive state, preventing T cells from eliminating the tumor. Due to this, research is focusing on immunotherapies that specifically target macrophages in order to reduce their immunosuppressive capabilities and promote T cell function. In this study, we develop an agent-based model consisting of the interactions between macrophages, T cells, and tumor cells to determine how the immune response changes due to three macrophage-based immunotherapeutic strategies: macrophage depletion, recruitment inhibition, and macrophage reeducation. We find that reeducation, which converts the macrophages into an immune promoting phenotype, is the most effective strategy and that the macrophage recruitment rate and tumor proliferation rate (tumor-specific properties) have large impacts on therapy efficacy. We also employ a novel method of using a neural network to reduce the computational complexity of an intracellular signaling mechanistic model.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/itGbDRPWJ0A" width="1" />

Insulin resistance (IR) precedes the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and increases cardiovascular disease risk. Although genome wide association studies (GWAS) have uncovered new loci associated with T2D, their contribution to explain the mechanisms leading to decreased insulin sensitivity has been very limited. Thus, new approaches are necessary to explore the genetic architecture of insulin resistance. To that end, we generated an iPSC library across the spectrum of insulin sensitivity in humans. RNA-seq based analysis of 310 induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) clones derived from 100 individuals allowed us to identify differentially expressed genes between insulin resistant and sensitive iPSC lines. Analysis of the co-expression architecture uncovered several insulin sensitivity-relevant gene sub-networks, and predictive network modeling identified a set of key driver genes that regulate these co-expression modules. Functional validation in human adipocytes and skeletal muscle cells (SKMCs) confirmed the relevance of the key driver candidate genes for insulin responsiveness.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xm2yv54rgnU" width="1" />

<p>by Bas van Opheusden, Luigi Acerbi, Wei Ji Ma</p>

The fate of scientific hypotheses often relies on the ability of a computational model to explain the data, quantified in modern statistical approaches by the likelihood function. The log-likelihood is the key element for parameter estimation and model evaluation. However, the log-likelihood of complex models in fields such as computational biology and neuroscience is often intractable to compute analytically or numerically. In those cases, researchers can often only estimate the log-likelihood by comparing observed data with synthetic observations generated by model simulations. Standard techniques to approximate the likelihood via simulation either use summary statistics of the data or are at risk of producing substantial biases in the estimate. Here, we explore another method, inverse binomial sampling (IBS), which can estimate the log-likelihood of an entire data set efficiently and without bias. For each observation, IBS draws samples from the simulator model until one matches the observation. The log-likelihood estimate is then a function of the number of samples drawn. The variance of this estimator is uniformly bounded, achieves the minimum variance for an unbiased estimator, and we can compute calibrated estimates of the variance. We provide theoretical arguments in favor of IBS and an empirical assessment of the method for maximum-likelihood estimation with simulation-based models. As case studies, we take three model-fitting problems of increasing complexity from computational and cognitive neuroscience. In all problems, IBS generally produces lower error in the estimated parameters and maximum log-likelihood values than alternative sampling methods with the same average number of samples. Our results demonstrate the potential of IBS as a practical, robust, and easy to implement method for log-likelihood evaluation when exact techniques are not available.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OsIhzQozl6c" width="1" />

<p>by Julienne LaChance, Daniel J. Cohen</p>

Fluorescence reconstruction microscopy (FRM) describes a class of techniques where transmitted light images are passed into a convolutional neural network that then outputs predicted epifluorescence images. This approach enables many benefits including reduced phototoxicity, freeing up of fluorescence channels, simplified sample preparation, and the ability to re-process legacy data for new insights. However, FRM can be complex to implement, and current FRM benchmarks are abstractions that are difficult to relate to how valuable or trustworthy a reconstruction is. Here, we relate the conventional benchmarks and demonstrations to practical and familiar cell biology analyses to demonstrate that FRM should be judged in context. We further demonstrate that it performs remarkably well even with lower-magnification microscopy data, as are often collected in screening and high content imaging. Specifically, we present promising results for nuclei, cell-cell junctions, and fine feature reconstruction; provide data-driven experimental design guidelines; and provide researcher-friendly code, complete sample data, and a researcher manual to enable more widespread adoption of FRM.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wf9Ho97_a2o" width="1" />

By modifying and calibrating an active vertex model to experiments, we have simulated numerically a confluent cellular monolayer spreading on an empty space and the collision of two monolayers of different cells in an antagonistic migration assay. Cells are subject to inertial forces and to active forces that try to align their velocities with those of neighboring ones. In agreement with experiments in the literature, the spreading test exhibits formation of fingers in the moving interfaces, there appear swirls in the velocity field, and the polar order parameter and the correlation and swirl lengths increase with time. Numerical simulations show that cells inside the tissue have smaller area than those at the interface, which has been observed in recent experiments. In the antagonistic migration assay, a population of fluidlike Ras cells invades a population of wild type solidlike cells having shape parameters above and below the geometric critical value, respectively. Cell mixing or segregation depends on the junction tensions between different cells. We reproduce the experimentally observed antagonistic migration assays by assuming that a fraction of cells favor mixing, the others segregation, and that these cells are randomly distributed in space. To characterize and compare the structure of interfaces between cell types or of interfaces of spreading cellular monolayers in an automatic manner, we apply topological data analysis to experimental data and to results of our numerical simulations. We use time series of data generated by numerical simulations to automatically group, track and classify the advancing interfaces of cellular aggregates by means of bottleneck or Wasserstein distances of persistent homologies. These techniques of topological data analysis are scalable and could be used in studies involving large amounts of data. Besides applications to wound healing and metastatic cancer, these studies are relevant for tissue engineering, biological effects of materials, tissue and organ regeneration.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FpOKxraLPNY" width="1" />

<p>by Bojan Krtenic, Adrian Drazic, Thomas Arnesen, Nathalie Reuter</p>

The enzymes of the GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) superfamily count more than 870 000 members through all kingdoms of life and share the same structural fold. GNAT enzymes transfer an acyl moiety from acyl coenzyme A to a wide range of substrates including aminoglycosides, serotonin, glucosamine-6-phosphate, protein N-termini and lysine residues of histones and other proteins. The GNAT subtype of protein N-terminal acetyltransferases (NATs) alone targets a majority of all eukaryotic proteins stressing the omnipresence of the GNAT enzymes. Despite the highly conserved GNAT fold, sequence similarity is quite low between members of this superfamily even when substrates are similar. Furthermore, this superfamily is phylogenetically not well characterized. Thus functional annotation based on sequence similarity is unreliable and strongly hampered for thousands of GNAT members that remain biochemically uncharacterized. Here we used sequence similarity networks to map the sequence space and propose a new classification for eukaryotic GNAT acetyltransferases. Using the new classification, we built a phylogenetic tree, representing the entire GNAT acetyltransferase superfamily. Our results show that protein NATs have evolved more than once on the GNAT acetylation scaffold. We use our classification to predict the function of uncharacterized sequences and verify by <i>in vitro</i> protein assays that two fungal genes encode NAT enzymes targeting specific protein N-terminal sequences, showing that even slight changes on the GNAT fold can lead to change in substrate specificity. In addition to providing a new map of the relationship between eukaryotic acetyltransferases the classification proposed constitutes a tool to improve functional annotation of GNAT acetyltransferases.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PEKlfRJLvyY" width="1" />

Zoonotic avian influenza viruses pose severe health threats to humans. Of several viral subtypes reported, the low pathogenic avian influenza H7N9 virus has since February 2013 caused more than 1,500 cases of human infection with an almost 40% case-fatality rate. Vaccination of poultry appears to reduce human infections. However, the emergence of highly pathogenic strains has increased concerns about H7N9 pandemics. To develop an efficacious H7N9 human vaccine, we designed vaccine viruses by changing the patterns of <i>N</i>-linked glycosylation (NLG) on the viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein based on evolutionary patterns of H7 HA NLG changes. Notably, a virus in which 2 NLG modifications were added to HA showed higher growth rates in cell culture and elicited more cross-reactive antibodies than did other vaccine viruses with no change in the viral antigenicity. Developed into an inactivated vaccine formulation, the vaccine virus with 2 HA NLG additions exhibited much better protective efficacy against lethal viral challenge in mice than did a vaccine candidate with wild-type (WT) HA by reducing viral replication in the lungs. In a ferret model, the 2 NLG-added vaccine viruses also induced hemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies and significantly suppressed viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tracts compared with the WT HA vaccines. In a mode of action study, the HA NLG modification appeared to increase HA protein contents incorporated into viral particles, which would be successfully translated to improve vaccine efficacy. These results suggest the strong potential of HA NLG modifications in designing avian influenza vaccines.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/tD-eDoOH63s" width="1" />

Nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) defects have been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as <i>C9ORF72</i>-associated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (C9-ALS/FTD). Here, we identify a neuroprotective pathway of like-Sm protein 12 (<i>LSM12</i>) and exchange protein directly activated by cyclic AMP 1 (<i>EPAC1</i>) that sustains the nucleocytoplasmic RAN gradient and thereby suppresses NCT dysfunction by the <i>C9ORF72</i>-derived poly(glycine-arginine) protein. LSM12 depletion in human neuroblastoma cells aggravated poly(GR)-induced impairment of NCT and nuclear integrity while promoting the nuclear accumulation of poly(GR) granules. In fact, <i>LSM12</i> posttranscriptionally up-regulated <i>EPAC1</i> expression, whereas EPAC1 overexpression rescued the RAN gradient and NCT defects in <i>LSM12</i>-deleted cells. C9-ALS patient-derived neurons differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (C9-ALS iPSNs) displayed low expression of <i>LSM12</i> and <i>EPAC1</i>. Lentiviral overexpression of LSM12 or EPAC1 indeed restored the RAN gradient, mitigated the pathogenic mislocalization of TDP-43, and suppressed caspase-3 activation for apoptosis in C9-ALS iPSNs. EPAC1 depletion biochemically dissociated RAN-importin β1 from the cytoplasmic nuclear pore complex, thereby dissipating the nucleocytoplasmic RAN gradient essential for NCT. These findings define the <i>LSM12</i>-<i>EPAC1</i> pathway as an important suppressor of the NCT-related pathologies in C9-ALS/FTD.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/PGYGt4CxIDM" width="1" />

Histone variants expand chromatin functions in eukaryote genomes. <i>H2A</i>.<i>B</i> genes are testis-expressed short histone H2A variants that arose in placental mammals. Their biological functions remain largely unknown. To investigate their function, we generated a knockout (KO) model that disrupts all 3 <i>H2A</i>.<i>B</i> genes in mice. We show that <i>H2A</i>.<i>B</i> KO males have globally altered chromatin structure in postmeiotic germ cells. Yet, they do not show impaired spermatogenesis or testis function. Instead, we find that <i>H2A</i>.<i>B</i> plays a crucial role postfertilization. Crosses between <i>H2A</i>.<i>B</i> KO males and females yield embryos with lower viability and reduced size. Using a series of genetic crosses that separate parental and zygotic contributions, we show that the <i>H2A</i>.<i>B</i> status of both the father and mother, but not of the zygote, affects embryonic viability and growth during gestation. We conclude that <i>H2A</i>.<i>B</i> is a novel parental-effect gene, establishing a role for short H2A histone variants in mammalian development. We posit that parental antagonism over embryonic growth drove the origin and ongoing diversification of short histone H2A variants in placental mammals.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/38O2OT1oGoc" width="1" />

<p>The brain activity of the four brain regions during visuo‐guided grip force tracking tasks were detected by functional near‐infrared spectroscopy. Pearson's correlation method, partial correlation method, and a pairwise maximum entropy model were used to get a more comprehensive and accurate functional connectivity for precise grip force control.</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The functional connectivity (FC) between multiple brain regions during tasks is currently gradually being explored with functional near‐infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). However, the FC present during grip force tracking tasks performed under visual feedback remains unclear. In the present study, we used fNIRS to measure brain activity during resting states and grip force tracking tasks at 25%, 50%, and 75% of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) in 11 healthy subjects, and the activity was measured from four target brain regions: the left prefrontal cortex (lPFC), right prefrontal cortex (rPFC), left sensorimotor cortex (lSMC), and right sensorimotor cortex (rSMC). We determined the FC between these regions utilizing three different methods: Pearson's correlation method, partial correlation method, and a pairwise maximum entropy model (MEM). The results showed that the FC of lSMC‐rSMC and lPFC‐rPFC (interhemispheric homologous pairs) were significantly stronger than those of other brain region pairs. Moreover, FC of lPFC‐rPFC was strengthened during the 75% MVC task compared to the other task states and the resting states. The FC of lSMC‐lPFC and rSMC‐rPFC (intrahemispheric region pairs) strengthened with a higher task load. The results provided new insights into the FC between brain regions during visuo‐guided grip force tracking tasks.</p>

<p>N‐cadherin is involved in the formation and maintenance of synapses. It was mainly detected in type II cells and nerve fibers in taste buds. Immunoelectron microscopy detected N‐cadherin symmetrically in the membranes of contact sites between afferent fibers (N) and type II cells (II), including synapses. Arrowheads: atypical mitochondria.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Taste buds, the receptor organs for taste, contain 50–100 taste bud cells. Although these cells undergo continuous turnover, the structural and functional integrity of taste buds is maintained. The molecular mechanisms by which synaptic connectivity between taste buds and afferent fibers is formed and maintained remain ambiguous. In the present study, we examined the localization of N‐cadherin in the taste buds of the mouse circumvallate papillae because N‐cadherin, one of the classical cadherins, is important for the formation and maintenance of synapses. At the light microscopic level, N‐cadherin was predominantly detected in type II cells and nerve fibers in the connective tissues in and around the vallate papillae. At the ultrastructural level, N‐cadherin immunoreactivity appears along the cell membrane and in the intracellular vesicles of type II cells. N‐cadherin immunoreactivity also is evident in the membranes of afferent terminals at the contact sites to N‐cadherin‐positive type II cells. At channel type synapses between type II cells and nerve fibers, N‐cadherin is present surrounding, but not within, the presumed neurotransmitter release zone, identified by large mitochondria apposed to the taste cells. The present results suggest that N‐cadherin is important for the formation or maintenance of type II cell afferent synapses in taste buds.</p>

                    <p class="a-plus-plus">We aimed to determine (1) the test–retest reliability of a newly developed portable fixed dynamometer (PFD) as compared to the hand-held dynamometer (HHD) in patients with motor neuron disease (MND) and (2) the PFD’s ability to reduce possible examiner-induced ceiling effects.</p>

                    <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Methods</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Test–retest reliability of isometric muscle strength of the quadriceps was measured in patients with MND and non-neurological controls using the HHD and PFD. Reliability was estimated by the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and standard error of measurement (SEM) using linear mixed effects models, and the Bland–Altman method of agreement.</p>

                    <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Results</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">In total, 45 patients with MND and 43 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. The ICC of the PFD was excellent and similar in both patients and controls (ICC <sub class="a-plus-plus">Patients</sub> 99.5% <em class="a-plus-plus">vs.</em> ICC <sub class="a-plus-plus">Controls</sub> 98.6%) with a SEM of 6.2%. A strong examiner-induced ceiling effect in HHD was found when the participant’s strength exceeded that of examiner. Employing the PFD increased the range of muscle strength measurements across individuals nearly twofold from 414 to 783 N.</p>

                    <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Conclusions</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Portable fixed dynamometry may significantly reduce examiner-induced ceiling effects, optimize the standardization of muscle strength testing, and maximize reliability. Ultimately, PFD may improve the delivery of care due to its potential for unsupervised, home-based assessments and reduce the burden to the patient of participating in clinical trials for MND or other neuromuscular diseases.</p>

<p>The family of lipid neuromodulators has been rapidly growing, as the use of different -omics techniques led to the discovery of a large number of naturally occurring N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) and N-acyl amino acids belonging to the complex lipid signaling system termed endocannabinoidome. These molecules exert a variety of biological activities in the central nervous system, as they modulate physiological processes in neurons and glial cells and are involved in the pathophysiology of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Their effects on dopamine cells have attracted attention, as dysfunctions of dopamine systems characterize a range of psychiatric disorders, i.e., schizophrenia and substance use disorders (SUD). While canonical endocannabinoids are known to regulate excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs impinging on dopamine cells and modulate several dopamine-mediated behaviors, such as reward and addiction, the effects of other lipid neuromodulators are far less clear. Here, we review the emerging role of endocannabinoid-like neuromodulators in dopamine signaling, with a focus on non-cannabinoid N-acylethanolamines and their receptors. Mounting evidence suggests that these neuromodulators contribute to modulate synaptic transmission in dopamine regions and might represent a target for novel medications in alcohol and nicotine use disorder.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.617422">Target Molecules of STIM Proteins in the Central Nervous System</a></h4>

<p>Stromal interaction molecules (STIMs), including STIM1 and STIM2, are single-pass transmembrane proteins that are located predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). They serve as calcium ion (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) sensors within the ER. In the central nervous system (CNS), they are involved mainly in Orai-mediated store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (SOCE). The key molecular components of the SOCE pathway are well-characterized, but the molecular mechanisms that underlie the regulation of this pathway need further investigation. Numerous intracellular target proteins that are located in the plasma membrane, ER, cytoskeleton, and cytoplasm have been reported to play essential roles in concert with STIMs, such as conformational changes in STIMs, their translocation, the stabilization of their interactions with Orai, and the activation of other channels. The present review focuses on numerous regulators, such as Homer, SOCE-associated regulatory factor (SARAF), septin, synaptopodin, golli proteins, partner of STIM1 (POST), and transcription factors and proteasome inhibitors that regulate STIM-Orai interactions in the CNS. Further we describe novel roles of STIMs in mediating Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via other than Orai pathways, including TRPC channels, VGCCs, AMPA and NMDA receptors, and group I metabotropic glutamate receptors. This review also summarizes recent findings on additional molecular targets of STIM proteins including SERCA, IP<sub>3</sub>Rs, end-binding proteins (EB), presenilin, and CaMKII. Dysregulation of the SOCE-associated toolkit, including STIMs, contributes to the development of neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease), traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, and stroke. Emerging evidence points to the role of STIM proteins and several of their molecular effectors and regulators in neuronal and glial physiology and pathology, suggesting their potential application for future therapeutic strategies.</p>

<p>Mass spectrometry is the driving force behind current brain proteome analysis. In a typical proteomics approach, a protein isolate is digested into tryptic peptides and then analyzed by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. The recent advancements in data independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry provide higher sensitivity and protein coverage than the classic data dependent acquisition. DIA cycles through a pre-defined set of peptide precursor isolation windows stepping through 400–1,200 m/z across the whole liquid chromatography gradient. All peptides within an isolation window are fragmented simultaneously and detected by tandem mass spectrometry. Peptides are identified by matching the ion peaks in a mass spectrum to a spectral library that contains information of the peptide fragment ions' pattern and its chromatography elution time. Currently, there are several reports on DIA in brain research, in particular the quantitative analysis of cellular and synaptic proteomes to reveal the spatial and/or temporal changes of proteins that underlie neuronal plasticity and disease mechanisms. Protocols in DIA are continuously improving in both acquisition and data analysis. The depth of analysis is currently approaching proteome-wide coverage, while maintaining high reproducibility in a stable and standardisable MS environment. DIA can be positioned as the method of choice for routine proteome analysis in basic brain research and clinical applications.</p>

<p>Recent evidence increasingly associates network disruption in brain organization with multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a rare terminal disease. However, the comparability of brain network characteristics across different studies remains a challenge for conventional graph theoretical methods. One suggested method to address this issue is minimum spanning tree (MST) analysis, which provides a less biased comparison. Here, we assessed the novel application of MST network analysis to hemodynamic responses recorded by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) neuroimaging modality, during an activity-based paradigm to investigate hypothetical disruptions in frontal functional brain network topology as a marker of the executive dysfunction, one of the most prevalent cognitive deficit reported across ALS studies. We analyzed data recorded from nine participants with ALS and ten age-matched healthy controls by first estimating functional connectivity, using phase-locking value (PLV) analysis, and then constructing the corresponding individual and group MSTs. Our results showed significant between-group differences in several MST topological properties, including leaf fraction, maximum degree, diameter, eccentricity, and degree divergence. We further observed a global shift toward more centralized frontal network organizations in the ALS group, interpreted as a more random or dysregulated network in this cohort. Moreover, the similarity analysis demonstrated marginally significantly increased overlap in the individual MSTs from the control group, implying a reference network with lower topological variation in the healthy cohort. Our nodal analysis characterized the main local hubs in healthy controls as distributed more evenly over the frontal cortex, with slightly higher occurrence in the left prefrontal cortex (PFC), while in the ALS group, the most frequent hubs were asymmetrical, observed primarily in the right prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the global PLV (gPLV) synchronization metric is associated with disease progression, and a few topological properties, including leaf fraction and tree hierarchy, are linked to disease duration. These results suggest that dysregulation, centralization, and asymmetry of the hemodynamic-based frontal functional network during activity are potential neuro-topological markers of ALS pathogenesis. Our findings can possibly support new bedside assessments of the functional status of ALS’ brain network and could hypothetically extend to applications in other neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

Background<p>Neuroinflammation and cellular apoptosis caused by spinal cord ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury result in neurological dysfunction. MicroRNAs (miRs) have crucial functions in spinal cord I/R injury pathogenesis according to previous evidences. Herein, whether miR-128-3p contributes to spinal cord I/R injury by regulating specificity protein 1 (SP1) was assessed.</p>Methods<p>A rat model of spinal cord I/R injury was established by occluding the aortic arch for 14 min. Then, miR-128-3p’s interaction with SP1 was detected by dual-luciferase reporter assays. Next, miR-128-3p mimic and inhibitor, as well as adenovirus-delivered shRNA specific for SP1 were injected intrathecally for assessing the effects of miR-128-3p and SP1 on rats with spinal cord I/R injury. SP1, Bax and Bcl-2 expression levels in I/R injured spinal cord tissues were evaluated by Western blotting, while IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 were quantitated by ELISA. Tarlov scores were obtained to detect hind-limb motor function. Evans blue (EB) dye extravasation was utilized to examine blood–spinal cord barrier (BSCB) permeability. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining was performed for neuronal apoptosis assessment.</p>Results<p>MiR-128-3p expression was decreased, while SP1 amounts were increased in rat spinal cord tissue specimens following I/R. SP1 was identified as a miR-128-3p target and downregulated by miR-128-3p. MiR-128-3p overexpression or SP1 silencing alleviated I/R-induced neuroinflammation and cell apoptosis, and improved Tarlov scores, whereas pretreatment with miR-128-3p inhibitor aggravated the above injuries.</p>Conclusion<p>Overexpression of miR-128-3p protects neurons from neuroinflammation and apoptosis during spinal cord I/R injury partially by downregulating SP1.</p>

<p>Background: Brainstem-mediated functions are impaired in neurodegenerative diseases and aging. Atrophy can be visualized by MRI. This study investigates extrinsic sources of brainstem volume variability, intrinsic sources of anatomical variability, and the influence of age and sex on the brainstem volumes in healthy subjects. We aimed to develop efficient normalization strategies to reduce the effects of intrinsic anatomic variability on brainstem volumetry.</p><p>Methods: Brainstem segmentation was performed from MPRAGE data using our deep-learning-based brainstem segmentation algorithm MD-GRU. The extrinsic variability of brainstem volume assessments across scanners and protocols was investigated in two groups comprising 11 (median age 33.3 years, 7 women) and 22 healthy subjects (median age 27.6 years, 50% women) scanned twice and compared using Dice scores. Intrinsic anatomical inter-individual variability and age and sex effects on brainstem volumes were assessed in segmentations of 110 healthy subjects (median age 30.9 years, range 18–72 years, 53.6% women) acquired on 1.5T (45%) and 3T (55%) scanners. The association between brainstem volumes and predefined anatomical covariates was studied using Pearson correlations. Anatomical variables with associations of |r| &gt; 0.30 as well as the variables age and sex were used to construct normalization models using backward selection. The effect of the resulting normalization models was assessed by % relative standard deviation reduction and by comparing the inter-individual variability of the normalized brainstem volumes to the non-normalized values using paired t- tests with Bonferroni correction.</p><p>Results: The extrinsic variability of brainstem volumetry across different field strengths and imaging protocols was low (Dice scores &gt; 0.94). Mean inter-individual variability/SD of total brainstem volumes was 9.8%/7.36. A normalization based on either total intracranial volume (TICV), TICV and age, or v-scale significantly reduced the inter-individual variability of total brainstem volumes compared to non-normalized volumes and similarly reduced the relative standard deviation by about 35%.</p><p>Conclusion: The extrinsic variability of the novel brainstem segmentation method MD-GRU across different scanners and imaging protocols is very low. Anatomic inter-individual variability of brainstem volumes is substantial. This study presents efficient normalization models for variability reduction in brainstem volumetry in healthy subjects.</p>

<p>Alzheimer's disease is associated with the cerebral accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. The progressive occurrence of tau aggregates in different brain regions is closely related to neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. However, our current understanding of tau propagation relies almost exclusively on postmortem histopathology, and the precise propagation dynamics of misfolded tau in the living brain remain poorly understood. Here we combine longitudinal positron emission tomography and dynamic network modeling to test the hypothesis that misfolded tau propagates preferably along neuronal connections. We follow 46 subjects for three or four annual positron emission tomography scans and compare their pathological tau profiles against brain network models of intracellular and extracellular spreading. For each subject, we identify a personalized set of model parameters that characterizes the individual progression of pathological tau. Across all subjects, the mean protein production rate was 0.21 ± 0.15 and the intracellular diffusion coefficient was 0.34 ± 0.43. Our network diffusion model can serve as a tool to detect non-clinical symptoms at an earlier stage and make informed predictions about the timeline of neurodegeneration on an individual personalized basis.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.563669">NeuroRA: A Python Toolbox of Representational Analysis From Multi-Modal Neural Data</a></h4>

<p>In studies of cognitive neuroscience, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) is widely used as it offers richer information than traditional univariate analysis. Representational similarity analysis (RSA), as one method of MVPA, has become an effective decoding method based on neural data by calculating the similarity between different representations in the brain under different conditions. Moreover, RSA is suitable for researchers to compare data from different modalities and even bridge data from different species. However, previous toolboxes have been made to fit specific datasets. Here, we develop NeuroRA, a novel and easy-to-use toolbox for representational analysis. Our toolbox aims at conducting cross-modal data analysis from multi-modal neural data (e.g., EEG, MEG, fNIRS, fMRI, and other sources of neruroelectrophysiological data), behavioral data, and computer-simulated data. Compared with previous software packages, our toolbox is more comprehensive and powerful. Using NeuroRA, users can not only calculate the representational dissimilarity matrix (RDM), which reflects the representational similarity among different task conditions and conduct a representational analysis among different RDMs to achieve a cross-modal comparison. Besides, users can calculate neural pattern similarity (NPS), spatiotemporal pattern similarity (STPS), and inter-subject correlation (ISC) with this toolbox. NeuroRA also provides users with functions performing statistical analysis, storage, and visualization of results. We introduce the structure, modules, features, and algorithms of NeuroRA in this paper, as well as examples applying the toolbox in published datasets.</p>

<p>We found that phase cone clustering patterns in EEG ripple bands demonstrate an increased turnover rate in epileptogenic zones compared to adjacent regions. We employed 256 channel EEG data collected in four adult subjects with refractory epilepsy. The analysis was performed in the 80–150 and 150–250 Hz ranges. Ictal onsets were documented with intracranial EEG recordings. Interictal scalp recordings, free of epileptiform patterns, of 240-s duration, were selected for analysis for each subject. The data was filtered, and the instantaneous phase was extracted after the Hilbert transformation. Spatiotemporal contour plots of the unwrapped instantaneous phase with 1.0 ms intervals were constructed using a montage layout of the 256 electrode positions. Stable phase cone patterns were selected based on criteria that the sign of spatial gradient did not change for a minimum of three consecutive time samples and the frame velocity was consistent with known propagation velocities of cortical axons. These plots exhibited increased dynamical formation and dissolution of phase cones in the ictal onset zones, compared to surrounding cortical regions, in all four patients. We believe that these findings represent markers of abnormally increased cortical excitability. They are potential tools that may assist in localizing the epileptogenic zone.</p>

<p>Modulating connectivity measures in EEG-based neurofeedback studies is assumed to be a promising therapeutic and training tool. However, little is known so far about its effects and trainability. In the present study, we investigated the effects of up- and down-regulating SMR (12–15 Hz) coherence by means of neurofeedback training on EEG activity and memory functions. Twenty adults performed 10 neurofeedback training sessions in which half of them tried to increase EEG coherence between Cz and CPz in the SMR frequency range, while the other half tried to down-regulate coherence. Up-regulation of SMR coherence led to between- and within-session changes in EEG coherence. SMR power increased across neurofeedback training sessions but not within training sessions. Cross-over training effects on baseline EEG measures were also observed in this group. Up-regulation of SMR coherence was also associated with improvements in memory functions when comparing pre- and post-test results. Participants were not able to down-regulate SMR coherence. This group did not show any changes in baseline EEG measures or memory functions comparing pre- and post-test. Our results provide insights in the trainability and effects of connectivity-based neurofeedback training and indications for its practical application.</p>

<p>Background: Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) is a neuroimaging technique that may be useful for non-invasive mapping of brain temperature (i.e., thermometry) over a large brain volume. To date, intra-subject reproducibility of MRSI-based brain temperature (MRSI-t) has not been investigated. The objective of this repeated measures MRSI-t study was to establish intra-subject reproducibility and repeatability of brain temperature, as well as typical brain temperature range.</p><p>Methods: Healthy participants aged 23–46 years (N = 18; 7 females) were scanned at two time points ~12-weeks apart. Volumetric MRSI data were processed by reconstructing metabolite and water images using parametric spectral analysis. Brain temperature was derived using the frequency difference between water and creatine (T<sub>CRE</sub>) for 47 regions of interest (ROIs) delineated by the modified Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas. Reproducibility was measured using the coefficient of variation for repeated measures (COVrep), and repeatability was determined using the standard error of measurement (SEM). For each region, the upper and lower bounds of Minimal Detectable Change (MDC) were established to characterize the typical range of T<sub>CRE</sub> values.</p><p>Results: The mean global brain temperature over all subjects was 37.2°C with spatial variations across ROIs. There was a significant main effect for time [F<sub>(1, 1,591)</sub> = 37.0, p &lt; 0.0001] and for brain region [F<sub>(46, 1,591)</sub> = 2.66, p &lt; 0.0001]. The time<sup>*</sup>brain region interaction was not significant [F<sub>(46, 1,591)</sub> = 0.80, p = 0.83]. Participants' T<sub>CRE</sub> was stable for each ROI across both time points, with ROIs' COVrep ranging from 0.81 to 3.08% (mean COVrep = 1.92%); majority of ROIs had a COVrep &lt;2.0%.</p><p>Conclusions: Brain temperature measurements were highly consistent between both time points, indicating high reproducibility and repeatability of MRSI-t. MRSI-t may be a promising diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic tool for non-invasively monitoring brain temperature changes in health and disease. However, further studies of healthy participants with larger sample size(s) and numerous repeated acquisitions are imperative for establishing a reference range of typical brain T<sub>CRE</sub>, as well as the threshold above which T<sub>CRE</sub> is likely pathological.</p>

<p>Aphasia is an acquired impairment of language functions resulting from a brain lesion. It is usually accompanied by deficits in non-linguistic cognitive processes. This study aimed to investigate in patients with aphasia the complex interrelationships between selected cognitive functions: auditory speech comprehension, working memory (WM), and temporal information processing (TIP) in the millisecond time range. Thirty right-handed subjects (20 males) aged from 27 to 82 years suffering from post-stroke aphasia participated in the study. Verbal working memory (VWM) and spatial working memory (SWM) were assessed with: (1) a receptive verbal test and (2) the Corsi Block-Tapping Test, respectively. Both these WM tests used the forward tasks (mainly engaging maintenance processes, i.e., storing, monitoring, and matching information) and backward tasks (engaging both maintenance and manipulation processes, i.e., reordering and updating information). Auditory comprehension was assessed by receptive language tests, and TIP efficiency was assessed by auditory perception of temporal order in the millisecond time range. We observed better performance of forward WM tasks than backward ones, independently of the type of material used. Furthermore, the severity of auditory comprehension impairment correlated with the efficiency on both forward and backward VWM tasks and the backward SWM task. Further analysis revealed that TIP plays a crucial role only in the latter task. These results indicate the divergent pattern of interactions between WM and TIP depending on the type of WM tasks. Level of verbal competency appeared to play an important role in both VWM tasks, whereas TIP (which is associated with manipulation processes) appeared to be important for SWM, but only on the backward task.</p>

<p>Adaptation can optimize information processing by allowing the visual system to always adjust to the environment. However, only a few studies have investigated how the visual system makes adjustments to repeatedly occurring changes in the input, still less about the related neural mechanism. Our previous study found that contrast adaptation attenuated after multiple daily sessions of repeated adaptation, which was explained by the habituation of either the adapter’s effective strength or the adaptation mechanisms. To examine the former hypothesis, in the present study we used the frequency tagging technique to measure the adapter-elicited steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) amplitudes. Participants repeatedly adapted to the same contrast adapter in a top-up manner for six continuous days, which was called training of adaptation. The behavioral adaptation effect and SSVEP response to the trained adapter and an untrained control adapter were measured before and after training. The psychophysical results showed that the effect of adaptation in the trained condition significantly reduced after training, replicating our previous finding. Contradicting the prediction of the hypothesis that repeated adaptation attenuated the effective strength of the adapter, the SSVEP amplitude was unchanged after training, which was further confirmed by an equivalence test. Taken together, the results challenge the account of habituation of adapter in repeated adaptation, while leaving the account of habituation of adaptation mechanism to be tested.</p>

<p>Numerical inductive reasoning has been considered as one of the most important higher cognitive functions of the human brain. Importantly, previous behavioral studies have consistently reported that one critical component of numerical inductive reasoning is checking, which often occurs when a discrepant element is discovered, and reprocessing is needed to determine whether the discrepancy is an error of the original series. However, less is known about the neural mechanism underlying the checking process. Given that the checking effect involves cognitive control processes, such as the incongruent resolution, that are linked to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), this study hypothesizes that the right DLPFC may play a specific role in the checking process. To test the hypothesis, this study utilized the transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a non-invasive brain stimulation method that could modulate cortical excitability, and examined whether and how the stimulation of the right DLPFC via tDCS could modulate the checking effect during a number-series completion problem task. Ninety healthy participants were allocated to one of the anodal, cathodal, and sham groups. Subjects were required to verify whether number sequences formed rule-based series, and checking effect was assessed by the difference in performance between invalid and valid conditions. It was found that significantly longer response times (RTs) were exhibited in invalid condition compared with valid condition in groups of anodal, cathodal, and sham tDCS. Furthermore, the anodal tDCS significantly shortened the checking effect than those of the cathodal and sham groups, whereas no significantly prolonged checking effect was detected in the cathodal group. The current findings indicated that anodal tDCS affected the process of checking, which suggested that the right DLPFC might play a critical role in the checking process of numerical inductive reasoning by inhibiting incongruent response.</p>

<p>Humans learn motor skills (MSs) through practice and experience and may then retain them for recruitment, which is effective as a rapid response for novel contexts. For an MS to be recruited for novel contexts, its recruitment range must be extended. In addressing this issue, we hypothesized that an MS is dynamically modulated according to the feedback context to expand its recruitment range into novel contexts, which do not involve the learning of an MS. The following two sub-issues are considered. We previously demonstrated that the learned MS could be recruited in novel contexts through its modulation, which is driven by dynamically regulating the synergistic redundancy between muscles according to the feedback context. However, this modulation is trained in the dynamics under the MS learning context. Learning an MS in a specific condition naturally causes movement deviation from the desired state when the MS is executed in a novel context. We hypothesized that this deviation can be reduced with the additional modulation of an MS, which tunes the MS-produced muscle activities by using the feedback gain signals driven by the deviation from the desired state. Based on this hypothesis, we propose a feedback gain signal-driven tuning model of a learned MS for its robust recruitment. This model is based on the neurophysiological architecture in the cortico-basal ganglia circuit, in which an MS is plausibly retained as it was learned and is then recruited by tuning its muscle control signals according to the feedback context. In this study, through computational simulation, we show that the proposed model may be used to neurophysiologically describe the recruitment of a learned MS in novel contexts.</p>

<p>The mechanisms involved in generation of rhythmic locomotor activity in the mammalian spinal cord remain poorly understood. These mechanisms supposedly rely on both intrinsic properties of constituting neurons and interactions between them. A subset of Shox2 neurons was suggested to contribute to generation of spinal locomotor activity, but the possible cellular basis for rhythmic bursting in these neurons remains unknown. Ha and Dougherty (2018) recently revealed the presence of bidirectional electrical coupling between Shox2 neurons in neonatal spinal cords, which can be critically involved in neuronal synchronization and generation of populational bursting. Gap junctional connections found between functionally-related Shox2 interneurons decrease with age, possibly being replaced by increasing interactions through chemical synapses. Here, we developed a computational model of a heterogeneous population of neurons sparsely connected by electrical or/and chemical synapses and investigated the dependence of frequency of populational bursting on the type and strength of neuronal interconnections. The model proposes a mechanistic explanation that can account for the emergence of a synchronized rhythmic activity in the neuronal population and provides insights into the possible role of gap junctional coupling between Shox2 neurons in the spinal mechanisms for locomotor rhythm generation.</p>

<p>Krabbe's disease (KD) is primarily a demyelinating disorder, but recent studies have identified the presence of neuronal protein aggregates in the brain, at least partially composed by alpha-synuclein (α-syn). The role of this protein aggregation in the pathogenesis of KD is largely unknown, but it has added KD to a growing list of lysosomal storage diseases that can be also be considered as proteinopathies. While the presence of these protein aggregates within the KD brain is now appreciated, the remainder of the central nervous system (CNS) remains uncharacterized. This study is the first to report the presence of thioflavin-S reactive inclusions throughout the spinal cord of both murine and human spinal tissue. Stereological analysis revealed the temporal and spatial accumulation of these inclusions within the neurons of the ventral spinal cord vs. those located in the dorsal cord. This study also confirmed that these thio-S positive accumulations are present within neuronal populations and are made up at least in part by α-syn in both the twitcher mouse and cord autopsied material from affected human patients. Significantly, neonatal gene therapy for galactosylceramidase, a treatment that strongly improves the survival and health of KD mice, but not bone marrow transplantation prevents the formation of these inclusions in spinal neurons. These results expand the understanding of α-syn protein aggregation within the CNS of individuals afflicted with KD and underlines the tractability of this problem via early gene therapy, with potential impact to other synucleinopathies such as PD.</p>

<p>Chronic tear deficiency enhances the excitability of corneal cold-sensitive nerves that detect ocular dryness, which can lead to discomfort in patients with dry eye disease (DED). However, changes in corneal nerve excitations through the polymodal nociceptor “transient receptor potential vanilloid 1” (TRPV1) and the potential link between this receptor and symptoms of DED remain unclear. In this study, we examined the firing properties of corneal cold-sensitive nerves expressing TRPV1 and possible contributions of chronic tear deficiency to corneal nerve excitability by TRPV1 activation. The bilateral excision of lacrimal glands in guinea pigs decreased the tear volume and increased the frequency of spontaneous eyeblinks 1–4 weeks after surgery. An analysis of the firing properties of the cold-sensitive nerves was performed by single-unit recordings of corneal preparations 4 weeks after surgery in both the sham-operated and gland-excised groups. Perfusion of the TRPV1 agonist, capsaicin (1 μM), transiently increased the firing frequency in approximately 46–48% of the cold-sensitive nerves characterized by low-background activity and high threshold (LB-HT) cold thermoreceptors in both groups. Gland excision significantly decreased the latency of capsaicin-induced firing in cold-sensitive nerves; however, its magnitude was unchanged. Calcium imaging of cultured trigeminal ganglion neurons from both groups showed that intracellular calcium elevation of corneal neurons induced by a low concentration of capsaicin (0.03 μM) was significantly larger in the gland excision group, regardless of responsiveness to cold. An immunohistochemical study of the trigeminal ganglion revealed that gland excision significantly increased the proportion of corneal neurons enclosed by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-immunopositive satellite glial cells. Topical application of the TRPV1 antagonist, A784168 (30 μM), on the ocular surface attenuated eye-blink frequency after gland excision. Furthermore, gland excision enhanced blink behavior induced by a low concentration of capsaicin (0.1 μM). These results suggest that chronic tear deficiency sensitizes the TRPV1-mediated response in the corneal LB-HT cold thermoreceptors and cold-insensitive polymodal nociceptors, which may be linked to dry eye discomfort and hyperalgesia resulting from nociceptive stimuli in aqueous-deficient dry eyes.</p>

<p>Ferroptosis is a newly discovered form of necrotic cell death characterized by its dependency on iron and lipid peroxidation. Ferroptosis has attracted much attention recently in the area of neurodegeneration since the involvement of ferroptosis in Parkinson’s disease (PD), a major neurodegenerative disease, has been indicated using animal models. Although PD is associated with both genetic and environmental factors, sporadic forms of PD account for more than 90% of total PD. Following the importance of environmental factors, various neurotoxins are used as chemical inducers of PD both in vivo and in vitro. In contrast to other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s diseases (AD and HD), many of the characteristics of PD can be reproduced in vivo by the use of specific neurotoxins. Given the indication of ferroptosis in PD pathology, several studies have been conducted to examine whether ferroptosis plays role in the loss of dopaminergic neurons in PD. However, there are still few reports showing an authentic form of ferroptosis in neuronal cells during exposure to the neurotoxins used as PD inducers. In this review article, we summarize the history of the uses of chemicals to create PD models in vivo and in vitro. Besides, we also survey recent reports examining the possible involvement of ferroptosis in chemical models of PD.</p>

<p>The aging process causes many changes to the brain and is a major risk factor for the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Despite an already vast amount of research on AD, a greater understanding of the disease's pathology and therapeutic options are desperately needed. One important distinction that is also in need of further study is the ability to distinguish changes to the brain observed in early stages of AD vs. changes that occur with normal aging. Current FDA-approved therapeutic options for AD patients have proven to be ineffective and indicate the need for alternative therapies. Aging interventions including alterations in diet (such as caloric restriction, fasting, or methionine restriction) have been shown to be effective in mediating increased health and lifespan in mice and other model organisms. Because aging is the greatest risk factor for the development of neurodegenerative diseases, certain dietary interventions should be explored as they have the potential to act as a future treatment option for AD patients.</p>

Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a heterotrimer composed of scaffolding (A), catalytic (C), and regulatory (B) subunits. PP2A complexes with B56 subunits are targeted by Shugoshin and BUBR1 to protect centromeric cohesion and stabilise kinetochore-microtubule attachments in yeast and mouse meiosis. In <i>C. elegans </i>the closest BUBR1 ortholog lacks the B56-interaction domain and Shugoshin is not required for meiotic segregation. Therefore, the role of PP2A in <i>C. elegans </i>female meiosis is unknown. We report that PP2A is essential for meiotic spindle assembly and chromosome dynamics during <i>C. elegans</i> female meiosis. BUB-1 is the main chromosome-targeting factor for B56 subunits during prometaphase I. BUB-1 recruits PP2A:B56 to the chromosomes via a newly identified LxxIxE motif in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and this recruitment is important for proper chromosome congression. Our results highlight a novel mechanism for B56 recruitment, essential for recruiting a pool of PP2A involved in chromosome congression during meiosis I.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/63249">Cellular birthdate predicts laminar and regional cholinergic projection topography in the forebrain</a></h4>

The basal forebrain cholinergic system projects broadly throughout the cortex and constitutes a critical source of neuromodulation for arousal and attention. Traditionally, this system was thought to function diffusely. However, recent studies have revealed a high degree of spatiotemporal specificity in cholinergic signaling. How the organization of cholinergic afferents confers this level of precision remains unknown. Here, using intersectional genetic fate mapping, we demonstrate that cholinergic fibers within the mouse cortex exhibit remarkable laminar and regional specificity and that this is organized in accordance with cellular birthdate. Strikingly, birthdated cholinergic projections within the cortex follow an inside-out pattern of innervation. While early born cholinergic populations target deep layers, late born ones innervate superficial laminae. We also find that birthdate predicts cholinergic innervation patterns within the amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex. Our work reveals previously unappreciated specificity within the cholinergic system and the developmental logic by which these circuits are assembled.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59545">Specific Neuroligin3–αNeurexin1 signaling regulates GABAergic synaptic function in mouse hippocampus</a></h4>

Synapse formation and regulation require signaling interactions between pre- and postsynaptic proteins, notably cell adhesion molecules (CAMs). It has been proposed that the functions of neuroligins (Nlgns), postsynaptic CAMs, rely on the formation of trans-synaptic complexes with neurexins (Nrxns), presynaptic CAMs. Nlgn3 is a unique Nlgn isoform that localizes at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. However, Nlgn3 function mediated via Nrxn interactions is unknown. Here we demonstrate that Nlgn3 localizes at postsynaptic sites apposing vesicular glutamate transporter 3-expressing (VGT3+) inhibitory terminals and regulates VGT3+ inhibitory interneuron-mediated synaptic transmission in mouse organotypic slice cultures. Gene expression analysis of interneurons revealed that the αNrxn1+AS4 splice isoform is highly expressed in VGT3+ interneurons as compared with other interneurons. Most importantly, postsynaptic Nlgn3 requires presynaptic αNrxn1+AS4 expressed in VGT3+ interneurons to regulate inhibitory synaptic transmission. Our results indicate that specific Nlgn–Nrxn signaling generates distinct functional properties at synapses.

Small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT) is a rare and aggressive form of ovarian cancer. SCCOHT tumors have inactivating mutations in <i>SMARCA4 </i>(BRG1), one of the two mutually exclusive ATPases of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. To address the role that BRG1 loss plays in SCCOHT tumorigenesis, we performed integrative multi-omic analyses in SCCOHT cell lines +/- BRG1 re-expression. BRG1 re-expression induced a gene and protein signature similar to an epithelial cell and gained chromatin accessibility sites correlated with other epithelial originating TCGA tumors. Gained chromatin accessibility and BRG1 recruited sites were strongly enriched for transcription factor binding motifs of AP-1 family members. Furthermore, AP-1 motifs were enriched at the promoters of highly upregulated epithelial genes. Using a dominant negative AP-1 cell line, we found that both AP-1 DNA binding activity and BRG1 re-expression are necessary for the gene and protein expression of epithelial genes. Our study demonstrates that BRG1 re-expression drives an epithelial-like gene and protein signature in SCCOHT cells that depends upon by AP-1 activity.

<p>Although seizures are common in prehospital settings, standardized emergency medical services (EMS) treatment algorithms do not exist nationally. We examined nationwide variability in status epilepticus treatment by analyzing 33 publicly available statewide EMS protocols. All adult protocols recommend intravenous benzodiazepines (midazolam, n = 33; lorazepam, n = 23; diazepam, n = 24), 30 recommend intramuscular benzodiazepines (midazolam, n = 30; lorazepam, n = 8; diazepam, n = 3), and 27 recommend intranasal benzodiazepines (midazolam, n = 27; lorazepam, n = 3); pediatric protocols also frequently recommend rectal diazepam (n = 14). Recommended dosages vary widely, and first‐ and second‐line agents are designated in only 18 and 2 states, respectively. Given this degree of variability, standardized national EMS guidelines are needed. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (sCJD) comprises several subtypes as defined by genetic and prion protein characteristics, which are associated with distinct clinical and pathological phenotypes. To date, no clinical test can reliably diagnose the subtype. We established two procedures for the antemortem diagnosis of sCJD subtype using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>MRI of 1,458 patients referred to the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center were collected through its consultation service. One neuroradiologist blind to the diagnosis scored 12 brain regions and generated a lesion profile for each MRI scan. We selected 487 patients with autopsy‐confirmed diagnosis of “pure” sCJD subtype and at least one positive diffusion MRI examination. We designed and tested two data‐driven procedures for subtype diagnosis: the first procedure—prion subtype classification algorithm with MRI (PriSCA_MRI)—uses only MRI examinations; the second—PriSCA_MRI + Gen—includes knowledge of the prion protein codon 129 genotype, a major determinant of sCJD subtypes. Both procedures were tested on the first MRI and the last MRI follow‐up.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>PriSCA_MRI classified the 3 most prevalent subtypes with 82% accuracy.</p>
<p>PriSCA_MRI + Gen raised the accuracy to 89% and identified all subtypes.</p>
<p>Individually, the 2 most prevalent sCJD subtypes, MM1 and VV2, were diagnosed with sensitivities up to 95 and 97%, respectively. The performances of both procedures did not change in 168 patients with longitudinal MRI studies when the last examination was used.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study provides the first practical algorithms for antemortem diagnosis of sCJD subtypes. MRI diagnosis of subtype is likely to be attainable at early disease stages to prognosticate clinical course and design future therapeutic trials. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines are widely used in industry for biological drug production. During cell culture development, considerable effort is invested to understand the factors that greatly impact cell growth, specific productivity and product qualities of the biotherapeutics. While high-throughput omics approaches have been increasingly utilized to reveal cellular mechanisms associated with cell line phenotypes and guide process optimization, comprehensive omics data analysis and management have been a challenge. Here we developed CHOmics, a web-based tool for integrative analysis of CHO cell line omics data that provides an interactive visualization of omics analysis outputs and efficient data management. CHOmics has a built-in comprehensive pipeline for RNA sequencing data processing and multi-layer statistical modules to explore relevant genes or pathways. Moreover, advanced functionalities were provided to enable users to customize their analysis and visualize the output systematically and interactively. The tool was also designed with the flexibility to accommodate other types of omics data and thereby enabling multi-omics comparison and visualization at both gene and pathway levels. Collectively, CHOmics is an integrative platform for data analysis, visualization and management with expectations to promote the broader use of omics in CHO cell research.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sj7SQ1kIpEI" width="1" />

Biological measurements frequently involve measuring parameters as a function of time, space, or frequency. Later, during the analysis phase of the study, the researcher splits the recorded data trace into smaller sections, analyzes each section separately by finding a mean or fitting against a specified function, and uses the analysis results in the study. Here, we present the software that allows to analyze these data traces in a manner that ensures repeatability of the analysis and simplifies the application of FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) principles in such studies. At the same time, it simplifies the routine data analysis pipeline and gives access to a fast overview of the analysis results. For that, the software supports reading the raw data, processing the data as specified in the protocol, and storing all intermediate results in the laboratory database. The software can be extended by study- or hardware-specific modules to provide the required data import and analysis facilities. To simplify the development of the data entry web interfaces, that can be used to enter data describing the experiments, we released a web framework with an example implementation of such a site. The software is covered by open-source license and is available through several online channels.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lX_XzerFB6I" width="1" />

Microbial natural products constitute a wide variety of chemical compounds, many which can have antibiotic, antiviral, or anticancer properties that make them interesting for clinical purposes. Natural product classes include polyketides (PKs), nonribosomal peptides (NRPs), and ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). While variants of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) for known classes of natural products are easy to identify in genome sequences, BGCs for new compound classes escape attention. In particular, evidence is accumulating that for RiPPs, subclasses known thus far may only represent the tip of an iceberg. Here, we present decRiPPter (Data-driven Exploratory Class-independent RiPP TrackER), a RiPP genome mining algorithm aimed at the discovery of novel RiPP classes. DecRiPPter combines a Support Vector Machine (SVM) that identifies candidate RiPP precursors with pan-genomic analyses to identify which of these are encoded within operon-like structures that are part of the accessory genome of a genus. Subsequently, it prioritizes such regions based on the presence of new enzymology and based on patterns of gene cluster and precursor peptide conservation across species. We then applied decRiPPter to mine 1,295 <i>Streptomyces</i> genomes, which led to the identification of 42 new candidate RiPP families that could not be found by existing programs. One of these was studied further and elucidated as a representative of a novel subfamily of lanthipeptides, which we designate class V. The 2D structure of the new RiPP, which we name pristinin A3 (1), was solved using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data, and chemical labeling. Two previously unidentified modifying enzymes are proposed to create the hallmark lanthionine bridges. Taken together, our work highlights how novel natural product families can be discovered by methods going beyond sequence similarity searches to integrate multiple pathway discovery criteria.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/bknPhbPA6VM" width="1" />

Primordial follicle assembly in the mouse occurs during perinatal ages and largely determines the ovarian reserve that will be available to support the reproductive life span. The development of primordial follicles is controlled by a complex network of interactions between oocytes and ovarian somatic cells that remain poorly understood. In the present research, using single-cell RNA sequencing performed over a time series on murine ovaries, coupled with several bioinformatics analyses, the complete dynamic genetic programs of germ and granulosa cells from E16.5 to postnatal day (PD) 3 were reported. Along with confirming the previously reported expression of genes by germ cells and granulosa cells, our analyses identified 5 distinct cell clusters associated with germ cells and 6 with granulosa cells. Consequently, several new genes expressed at significant levels at each investigated stage were assigned. By building single-cell pseudotemporal trajectories, 3 states and 1 branch point of fate transition for the germ cells were revealed, as well as for the granulosa cells. Moreover, Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment enabled identification of the biological process most represented in germ cells and granulosa cells or common to both cell types at each specific stage, and the interactions of germ cells and granulosa cells basing on known and novel pathway were presented. Finally, by using single-cell regulatory network inference and clustering (SCENIC) algorithm, we were able to establish a network of regulons that can be postulated as likely candidates for sustaining germ cell-specific transcription programs throughout the period of investigation. Above all, this study provides the whole transcriptome landscape of ovarian cells and unearths new insights during primordial follicle assembly in mice.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/iFIJU6CdENw" width="1" />

<p>by Yi Shi, Ze Liu, Qian Zhang, Ingrid Vallee, Zhongying Mo, Shuji Kishi, Xiang-Lei Yang</p>

Hypoxia-induced angiogenesis maintains tissue oxygen supply and protects against ischemia but also enhances tumor progression and malignancy. This is mediated through activation of transcription factors like hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) and c-Myc, yet the impact of hypoxia on negative regulators of angiogenesis is unknown. During vascular development, seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS) regulates angiogenesis through a novel mechanism by counteracting c-Myc and transcriptionally repressing vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) expression. Here, we reveal that the transcriptional repressor role of SerRS is inactivated under hypoxia through phosphorylation by ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ataxia telangiectasia mutated and RAD3-related (ATR) at Ser101 and Ser241 to attenuate its DNA binding capacity. In zebrafish, SerRS<sup>S101D/S241D</sup>, a phosphorylation-mimicry mutant, cannot suppress VEGFA expression to support normal vascular development. Moreover, expression of SerRS<sup>S101A/S241A</sup>, a phosphorylation-deficient and constitutively active mutant, prevents hypoxia-induced binding of c-Myc and HIF-1 to the <i>VEGFA</i> promoter, and activation of VEGFA expression. Consistently, SerRS<sup>S101A/S241A</sup> strongly inhibits normal and tumor-derived angiogenesis in mice. Therefore, we reveal a key step regulating hypoxic angiogenesis and highlight the importance of nuclear SerRS in post-developmental angiogenesis regulation in addition to vascular development. The role of nuclear SerRS in inhibiting both c-Myc and HIF-1 may provide therapeutic opportunities to correct dysregulation of angiogenesis in pathological settings.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/rZ9l5M1hOJk" width="1" />

Computational protein design is rapidly becoming more powerful, and improving the accuracy of computational methods would greatly streamline protein engineering by eliminating the need for empirical optimization in the laboratory. In this work, we set out to design novel granulopoietic agents using a rescaffolding strategy with the goal of achieving simpler and more stable proteins. All of the 4 experimentally tested designs were folded, monomeric, and stable, while the 2 determined structures agreed with the design models within less than 2.5 Å. Despite the lack of significant topological or sequence similarity to their natural granulopoietic counterpart, 2 designs bound to the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor and exhibited potent, but delayed, in vitro proliferative activity in a G-CSF-dependent cell line. Interestingly, the designs also induced proliferation and differentiation of primary human hematopoietic stem cells into mature granulocytes, highlighting the utility of our approach to develop highly active therapeutic leads purely based on computational design.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/4g376v1rJ3I" width="1" />

Neurons extend long axons that require maintenance and are susceptible to degeneration. Long-term integrity of axons depends on intrinsic mechanisms including axonal transport and extrinsic support from adjacent glial cells. The mechanisms of support provided by myelinating oligodendrocytes to underlying axons are only partly understood. Oligodendrocytes release extracellular vesicles (EVs) with properties of exosomes, which upon delivery to neurons improve neuronal viability in vitro. Here, we show that oligodendroglial exosome secretion is impaired in 2 mouse mutants exhibiting secondary axonal degeneration due to oligodendrocyte-specific gene defects. Wild-type oligodendroglial exosomes support neurons by improving the metabolic state and promoting axonal transport in nutrient-deprived neurons. Mutant oligodendrocytes release fewer exosomes, which share a common signature of underrepresented proteins. Notably, mutant exosomes lack the ability to support nutrient-deprived neurons and to promote axonal transport. Together, these findings indicate that glia-to-neuron exosome transfer promotes neuronal long-term maintenance by facilitating axonal transport, providing a novel mechanistic link between myelin diseases and secondary loss of axonal integrity.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Ph2iKJtdsn8" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Scavenger receptor CD36 contributes significantly to lipid homeostasis, inflammation, and amyloid deposition, while CD36 deficiency is associated with restored cerebrovascular function in an Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model. Yet the distribution of CD36 has not been examined in the brain. Here, we characterized CD36 gene and protein expression in the brains of young, middle aged, aged, and elderly male and female C57BL/6J mice. Age‐related increases in CD36 mRNA expression were observed in the male hippocampus and female midbrain. Additionally, male mice had greater CD36 mRNA expression than females in the striatum, hippocampus, and midbrain. CD36 protein was primarily expressed intravascularly, and this expression differed by region, age, and sex in the mouse brain. Although male mice brains demonstrated an increase in CD36 protein with age in several cortices, basal ganglia, hippocampus, and midbrain, a decrease with age was observed in female mice in the same regions. These data suggest that distinctive age, region, and sex expression of CD36 in the brain may contribute to Aβ deposition and neuroinflammation in AD.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The brain's endogenous opioid and endocannabinoid systems are neuromodulatory of synaptic transmission, and play key roles in pain, memory, reward, and addiction. Recent clinical and pre‐clinical evidence suggests that opioid use may be reduced with cannabinoid intake. This suggests the presence of a functional interaction between these two systems. Emerging research indicates that cannabinoids and opioids can functionally interact at different levels. At the cellular level, opioid and cannabinoids can have direct receptor associations, alterations in endogenous opioid peptide or cannabinoid release, or post‐receptor activation interactions via shared signal transduction pathways. At the systems level, the nature of cannabinoid and opioid interaction might differ in brain circuits underlying different behavioral phenomenon, including reward‐seeking or antinociception. Given the rising use of opioid and cannabinoid drugs, a better understanding of how these endogenous signaling systems interact in the brain is of significant interest. This review focuses on the potential relationship of these neural systems in addiction‐related processes.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders, with no cure and preventive therapy. Misfolding and extracellular aggregation of Amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides are recognized as the main cause of AD progression, leading to the formation of toxic Aβ oligomers and to the deposition of β-amyloid plaques in the brain, representing the hallmarks of AD. Given the urgent need to provide alternative therapies, natural products serve as vital resources for novel drugs. In recent years, several natural compounds with different chemical structures, such as polyphenols, alkaloids, terpenes, flavonoids, tannins, saponins and vitamins from plants have received attention for their role against the neurodegenerative pathological processes. However, only for a small subset of them experimental evidences are provided on their mechanism of action. This review focuses on those natural compounds shown to interfere with Aβ aggregation by direct interaction with Aβ peptide and whose inhibitory mechanism has been investigated by means of biophysical and structural biology experimental approaches. In few cases, the combination of approaches offering a macroscopic characterization of the oligomers, such as TEM, AFM, fluorescence, together with high-resolution methods could shed light on the complex mechanism of inhibition. In particular, solution NMR spectroscopy, through peptide-based and ligand-based observation, was successfully employed to investigate the interactions of the natural compounds with both soluble NMR-visible (monomer and low molecular weight oligomers) and NMR-invisible (high molecular weight oligomers and protofibrils) species. The molecular determinants of the interaction of promising natural compounds are here compared to infer the chemical requirements of the inhibitors and the common mechanisms of inhibition. Most of the data converge to indicate that the Aβ regions relevant to perturb the aggregation cascade and regulate the toxicity of the stabilized oligomers, are the N-term and β1 region. The ability of the natural aggregation inhibitors to cross the brain blood barrier, together with the tactics to improve their low bioavailability are discussed. The analysis of the data ensemble can provide a rationale for the selection of natural compounds as molecular scaffolds for the design of new therapeutic strategies against the progression of early and late stages of AD.</p>

<p>Neurodegeneration of the central and enteric nervous systems is a common feature of aging and aging-related diseases, and is accelerated in individuals with metabolic dysfunction including obesity and diabetes. The molecular mechanisms of neurodegeneration in both the CNS and ENS are overlapping. Sirtuins are an important family of histone deacetylases that are important for genome stability, cellular response to stress, and nutrient and hormone sensing. They are activated by calorie restriction (CR) and by the coenzyme, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>). Sirtuins, specifically the nuclear SIRT1 and mitochondrial SIRT3, have been shown to have predominantly neuroprotective roles in the CNS while the cytoplasmic sirtuin, SIRT2 is largely associated with neurodegeneration. A systematic study of sirtuins in the ENS and their effect on enteric neuronal growth and survival has not been conducted. Recent studies, however, also link sirtuins with important hormones such as leptin, ghrelin, melatonin, and serotonin which influence many important processes including satiety, mood, circadian rhythm, and gut homeostasis. In this review, we address emerging roles of sirtuins in modulating the metabolic challenges from aging, obesity, and diabetes that lead to neurodegeneration in the ENS and CNS. We also highlight a novel role for sirtuins along the microbiota-gut-brain axis in modulating neurodegeneration.</p>

<p>We present a fully convolutional neural network (ConvNet), named RatLesNetv2, for segmenting lesions in rodent magnetic resonance (MR) brain images. RatLesNetv2 architecture resembles an autoencoder and it incorporates residual blocks that facilitate its optimization. RatLesNetv2 is trained end to end on three-dimensional images and it requires no preprocessing. We evaluated RatLesNetv2 on an exceptionally large dataset composed of 916 T2-weighted rat brain MRI scans of 671 rats at nine different lesion stages that were used to study focal cerebral ischemia for drug development. In addition, we compared its performance with three other ConvNets specifically designed for medical image segmentation. RatLesNetv2 obtained similar to higher Dice coefficient values than the other ConvNets and it produced much more realistic and compact segmentations with notably fewer holes and lower Hausdorff distance. The Dice scores of RatLesNetv2 segmentations also exceeded inter-rater agreement of manual segmentations. In conclusion, RatLesNetv2 could be used for automated lesion segmentation, reducing human workload and improving reproducibility. RatLesNetv2 is publicly available at https://github.com/jmlipman/RatLesNetv2.</p>

<p>Noise has been proven to have a beneficial role in non-linear systems, including the human brain, based on the stochastic resonance (SR) theory. Several studies have been implemented on single-modal SR. Cross-modal SR phenomenon has been confirmed in different human sensory systems. In our study, a cross-modal SR enhanced brain–computer interface (BCI) was proposed by applying auditory noise to visual stimuli. Fast Fourier transform and canonical correlation analysis methods were used to evaluate the influence of noise, results of which indicated that a moderate amount of auditory noise could enhance periodic components in visual responses. Directed transfer function was applied to investigate the functional connectivity patterns, and the flow gain value was used to measure the degree of activation of specific brain regions in the information transmission process. The results of flow gain maps showed that moderate intensity of auditory noise activated the brain area to a greater extent. Further analysis by weighted phase-lag index (wPLI) revealed that the phase synchronization between visual and auditory regions under auditory noise was significantly enhanced. Our study confirms the existence of cross-modal SR between visual and auditory regions and achieves a higher accuracy for recognition, along with shorter time window length. Such findings can be used to improve the performance of visual BCIs to a certain extent.</p>

<p>Adapted exercise is an effective non-pharmacological tool to improve functional, cognitive, and psychological parameters in multiple sclerosis (MS), in association with increased quality of life (QoL) and decreased disease severity. Adipose tissue, through the production of different adipokines, is involved in regulating energy metabolism and inflammation. Adiponectin, increased in MS, circulates as oligomers of low (LMW), medium (MMW), and high molecular weight (HMW), the latter mediating the main biological effects. The aim of study was to evaluate the effects of 4 months training at moderate intensity [65% heart rate reserve (HRR)] on BMI, adiponectin, and QoL in a volunteer with secondary progressive MS. The parameters were evaluated before (T0), after 4 months training (T1), and 6 months after the end of training (T2); total serum adiponectin and its oligomeric profile were evaluated. We found a reduction in BMI (−0.9%) and FAT (−2.6%), an improvement in perceived QoL and a reduced expression of total adiponectin and HMW oligomers together with decreased MS disability level at T1 measured by EDSS. Despite the limitations of a case study, this represent a starting point to understand the influence of exercise in MS and the relationship with adiponectin expression.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.558981">Semi-Automated and Direct Localization and Labeling of EEG Electrodes Using MR Structural Images for Simultaneous fMRI-EEG</a></h4>

<p>Electroencephalography (EEG) source reconstruction estimates spatial information from the brain’s electrical activity acquired using EEG. This method requires accurate identification of the EEG electrodes in a three-dimensional (3D) space and involves spatial localization and labeling of EEG electrodes. Here, we propose a new approach to tackle this two-step problem based on the simultaneous acquisition of EEG and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For the step of spatial localization of electrodes, we extract the electrode coordinates from the curvature of the protrusions formed in the high-resolution T1-weighted brain scans. In the next step, we assign labels to each electrode based on the distinguishing feature of the electrode’s distance profile in relation to other electrodes. We then compare the subject’s electrode data with template-based models of prelabeled distance profiles of correctly labeled subjects. Based on this approach, we could localize EEG electrodes in 26 head models with over 90% accuracy in the 3D localization of electrodes. Next, we performed electrode labeling of the subjects’ data with progressive improvements in accuracy: with ∼58% accuracy based on a single EEG-template, with ∼71% accuracy based on 3 EEG-templates, and with ∼76% accuracy using 5 EEG-templates. The proposed semi-automated method provides a simple alternative for the rapid localization and labeling of electrodes without the requirement of any additional equipment than what is already used in an EEG-fMRI setup.</p>

<p>In this study, voluntary and involuntary visual attention focused on different interpretations of a bistable image, were investigated using magnetoencephalography (MEG). A Necker cube with sinusoidally modulated pixels' intensity in the front and rear faces with frequencies 6.67 Hz (60/9) and 8.57 Hz (60/7), respectively, was presented to 12 healthy volunteers, who interpreted the cube as either left- or right-oriented. The tags of these frequencies and their second harmonics were identified in the average Fourier spectra of the MEG data recorded from the visual cortex. In the first part of the experiment, the subjects were asked to voluntarily control their attention by interpreting the cube orientation as either being on the left or right. Accordingly, we observed the dominance of the corresponding spectral component, and voluntary attention performance was measured. In the second part of the experiment, the subjects were asked to focus their gaze on a red marker at the center of the cube image without putting forth effort in its interpretation. The alternation of the dominant spectral energies at the second harmonics of the stimulation frequencies was treated as changes in the cube orientation. Based on the results of the first experimental stage and using a wavelet analysis, we developed a method which allowed us to identify the currently perceived cube orientation. Finally, we characterized involuntary attention using the distribution of dominance times when focusing attention on one of the cube orientations, which was related to voluntary attention performance and brain noise. In particular, we confirmed our hypothesis that higher attention performance is associated with stronger brain noise.</p>

<p>The Featurally Underspecified Lexicon (FUL) theory predicts that [coronal] is the language universal default place of articulation for phonemes. This assumption has been consistently supported with adult behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) data; however, this underspecification claim has not been tested in developmental populations. The purpose of this study was to determine whether children demonstrate [coronal] underspecification patterns similar to those of adults. Two English consonants differing in place of articulation, [labial] /b/ and [coronal] /d/, were presented to 24 children (ages 4–6 years) characterized by either a typically developing phonological system (TD) or a phonological disorder (PD). Two syllables, /bɑ/ and /dɑ/, were presented in an ERP oddball paradigm where both syllables served as the standard and deviant stimulus in opposite stimulus sets. Underspecification was examined with three analyses: traditional mean amplitude measurements, cluster-based permutation tests, and single-trial general linear model (GLM) analyses of single-subject data. Contrary to previous adult findings, children with PD demonstrated a large positive mismatch response (PMR) to /bɑ/ while the children with TD exhibited a negative mismatch response (MMN); significant group differences were not observed in the /dɑ/ responses. Moreover, the /bɑ/ deviant ERP response was significantly larger in the TD children than in the children with PD. At the single-subject level, more children demonstrated mismatch responses to /dɑ/ than to /bɑ/, though some children had a /bɑ/ mismatch response and no /dɑ/ mismatch response. While both groups of children demonstrated similar responses to the underspecified /dɑ/, their neural responses to the more specified /bɑ/ varied. These findings are interpreted within a proposed developmental model of phonological underspecification, wherein children with PD are functioning at a developmentally less mature stage of phonological acquisition than their same-aged TD peers. Thus, phonological underspecification is a phenomenon that likely develops over time with experience and exposure to language.</p>

<p>Experiments in animal models have shown that running increases neuronal activity in early visual areas in light as well as in darkness. This suggests that visual processing is influenced by locomotion independent of visual input. Combining mobile electroencephalography, motion- and eye-tracking, we investigated the influence of overground free walking on cortical alpha activity (~10 Hz) and eye movements in healthy humans. Alpha activity has been considered a valuable marker of inhibition of sensory processing and shown to negatively correlate with neuronal firing rates. We found that walking led to a decrease in alpha activity over occipital cortex compared to standing. This decrease was present during walking in darkness as well as during light. Importantly, eye movements could not explain the change in alpha activity. Nevertheless, we found that walking and eye related movements were linked. While the blink rate increased with increasing walking speed independent of light or darkness, saccade rate was only significantly linked to walking speed in the light. Pupil size, on the other hand, was larger during darkness than during light, but only showed a modulation by walking in darkness. Analyzing the effect of walking with respect to the stride cycle, we further found that blinks and saccades preferentially occurred during the double support phase of walking. Alpha power, as shown previously, was lower during the swing phase than during the double support phase. We however could exclude the possibility that the alpha modulation was introduced by a walking movement induced change in electrode impedance. Overall, our work indicates that the human visual system is influenced by the current locomotion state of the body. This influence affects eye movement pattern as well as neuronal activity in sensory areas and might form part of an implicit strategy to optimally extract sensory information during locomotion.</p>

<p>The question of whether artificial beings or machines could become self-aware or conscious has been a philosophical question for centuries. The main problem is that self-awareness cannot be observed from an outside perspective and the distinction of being really self-aware or merely a clever imitation cannot be answered without access to knowledge about the mechanism's inner workings. We investigate common machine learning approaches with respect to their potential ability to become self-aware. We realize that many important algorithmic steps toward machines with a core consciousness have already been taken.</p>

<p>A common feature of the primary processing structures of sensory systems is the presence of parallel output “channels” that convey different information about a stimulus. In the mammalian olfactory bulb, this is reflected in the mitral cells (MCs) and tufted cells (TCs) that have differing sensitivities to odors, with TCs being more sensitive than MCs. In this study, we examined potential mechanisms underlying the different responses of MCs vs. TCs. For TCs, we focused on superficial TCs (sTCs), which are a population of output TCs that reside in the superficial-most portion of the external plexiform layer, along with external tufted cells (eTCs), which are glutamatergic interneurons in the glomerular layer. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in mouse bulb slices, we first measured excitatory currents in MCs, sTCs, and eTCs following olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) stimulation, separating the responses into a fast, monosynaptic component reflecting direct inputs from OSNs and a prolonged component partially reflecting eTC-mediated feedforward excitation. Responses were measured to a wide range of OSN stimulation intensities, simulating the different levels of OSN activity that would be expected to be produced by varying odor concentrations in vivo. Over a range of stimulation intensities, we found that the monosynaptic current varied significantly between the cell types, in the order of eTC &gt; sTC &gt; MC. The prolonged component was smaller in sTCs vs. both MCs and eTCs. sTCs also had much higher whole-cell input resistances than MCs, reflecting their smaller size and greater membrane resistivity. To evaluate how these different electrophysiological aspects contributed to spiking of the output MCs and sTCs, we used computational modeling. By exchanging the different cell properties in our modeled MCs and sTCs, we could evaluate each property's contribution to spiking differences between these cell types. This analysis suggested that the higher sensitivity of spiking in sTCs vs. MCs reflected both their larger monosynaptic OSN signal as well as their higher input resistance, while their smaller prolonged currents had a modest opposing effect. Taken together, our results indicate that both synaptic and intrinsic cellular features contribute to the production of parallel output channels in the olfactory bulb.</p>

<p>The inhibitory effect of long intergenic non-coding RNA 00320 (LINC00320) in glioma cell proliferation has been proposed in a recent study. However, the mechanisms by which LINC00320 regulate aquaporin 9 (AQP9) in glioma require further exploration. Hence, this study aims to investigate effects of LINC00320 on tumorigenicity of glioma cells and angiogenesis of microvascular endothelial cells (MVECs). Expression of LINC00320 and AQP9 in glioma tissues and cells was measured by reverse transcription–quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. The relationship among LINC00320, nuclear factor κB subunit 1 (NFKB1) and AQP9 was examined by RNA immunoprecipitation, dual-luciferase reporter gene, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. The participation of LINC00320 and AQP9 in glioma cell proliferation and MVEC angiogenesis was analyzed using gain- and loss-of-function approaches. Finally, a nude mouse orthotopic xenograft model of glioma was established to investigate the effects of LINC00320 and AQP9 on glioma growth in vivo. LINC00320 was under-expressed and AQP9 was over-expressed in glioma tissues. Further mechanistic investigation showed that LINC00320 downregulated AQP9 by inhibiting the recruitment of NFKB1 to the promoter region of AQP9. LINC00320 overexpression or AQP9 silencing inhibited the proliferation of glioma cells and angiogenesis of MVECs. Also, upregulation of LINC00320 restrained tumor growth and angiogenesis in xenograft mice by downregulating AQP9. Taken together, LINC00320 acts as a tumor suppressor in glioma, thus presenting a novel therapeutic target.</p>

<p>This study aimed to investigate the effect of 12 weeks of dual-task training on cognitive status, physical performance, and brain oscillation of patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Twenty-six AD patients were randomly assigned to two groups, the training group (TG) and control group (CG). TG executed progressive combined exercises with visual stimulation twice a week for 12 weeks. Training included muscle endurance, balance, flexibility, and aerobic exercises with eyes closed and opened. Brain oscillation on electroencephalography (EEG) and a series of physical, cognitive, and mental tests were taken before and post-intervention. There was a significant improvement after training protocol in cognitive function, particularly in short-term and working memory, attention, and executive function (p &lt; 0.01). Besides, there were substantial improvements in depression status (GDS scale), aerobic fitness (6 min walking), flexibility (chair sit and reach) functional ability (chair stand, timed up and go test), strength (knee extensions, preacher biceps curl, handgrip) in TG compared to CG. These signs of progress were associated with a significant increase (p &lt; 0.05) in the frequency of brain oscillation and a decrease in the theta/alpha ratio. In addition to physical performance, the regular combined training with visual stimulation improves brain health as indicated by improving cognitive function and reducing the theta/alpha ratio.</p><p>Clinical Trial Registration: Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT) https://www.irct.ir/, identifier IRCT20190504043468N1—August 5, 2020.</p>

<p>Irisin is a PGC-1α-dependent myokine that causes increased energy expenditure by driving the development of white adipose tissue into brown fat-like tissue. Exercise can improve irisin levels and lead to its release into the blood. In ischemic stroke, neurons are always sensitive to energy supply; after a series of pathophysiological processes, reactive oxygen species that are detrimental to cell survival via mitochondrial dysfunction are generated in large quantities. As a protein associated with exercise, irisin can alleviate brain injury in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke. It is thought that irisin can upregulate the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which protects nerve cells from injury during ischemic stroke. Furthermore, the release of irisin into the blood via exercise influences the mitochondrial dynamics crucial to maintaining the normal function of nerve cells. Consequently, we intended to summarize the known effects of irisin during ischemic stroke.</p>

Synaptojanin1 (Synj1) is a phosphoinositide phosphatase, important in clathrin uncoating during endocytosis of presynaptic vesicles. It was identified as a potential drug target for Alzheimer's disease, Down syndrome and TBC1D24-associated epilepsy, while also loss-of-function mutations in Synj1 are associated with epilepsy and Parkinson's disease. Despite its involvement in a range of disorders, structural and detailed mechanistic information regarding the enzyme is lacking. Here, we report the crystal structure of the 5-phosphatase domain of Synj1. Moreover, we also present a structure of this domain bound to the substrate diC8-PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, providing the first image of a 5-phosphatase with a trapped substrate in its active site. Together with an analysis of the contribution of the different inositide phosphate groups to catalysis, these structures provide new insights in the Synj1 mechanism. Finally, we analyzed the effect of three clinical missense mutations (Y793C, R800C, Y849C) on catalysis, unveiling the molecular mechanisms underlying Synj1-associated disease.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/64389">In vitro reconstitution of dynamically interacting integral membrane subunits of energy-coupling factor transporters</a></h4>

Energy-coupling factor (ECF) transporters mediate import of micronutrients in prokaryotes. They consist of an integral membrane S-component (that binds substrate) and ECF module (that powers transport by ATP hydrolysis). It has been proposed that different S-components compete for docking onto the same ECF module, but a minimal liposome-reconstituted system, required to substantiate this idea, is lacking. Here, we co-reconstituted ECF transporters for folate (ECF-FolT2) and pantothenate (ECF-PanT) into proteoliposomes, and assayed for crosstalk during active transport. The kinetics of transport showed that exchange of S-components is part of the transport mechanism. Competition experiments suggest much slower substrate association with FolT2 than with PanT. Comparison of a crystal structure of ECF-PanT with previously determined structures of ECF-FolT2 revealed larger conformational changes upon binding of folate than pantothenate, which could explain the kinetic differences. Our work shows that a minimal in vitro system with two reconstituted transporters recapitulates intricate kinetics behaviour observed in vivo.

Cell proliferation and quiescence are intimately coordinated during metazoan development. Here, we adapt a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) sensor to uncouple these key events of the cell cycle in <i>C. elegans</i> and zebrafish through live-cell imaging. The CDK sensor consists of a fluorescently tagged CDK substrate that steadily translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in response to increasing CDK activity and consequent sensor phosphorylation. We show that the CDK sensor can distinguish cycling cells in G1 from quiescent cells in G0, revealing a possible commitment point and a cryptic stochasticity in an otherwise invariant <i>C. elegans </i>cell lineage. Finally, we derive a predictive model of future proliferation behavior in <i>C. elegans</i> based on a snapshot of CDK activity in newly born cells. Thus, we introduce a live-cell imaging tool to facilitate <i>in vivo</i> studies of cell cycle control in a wide-range of developmental contexts.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/62850">Individual differences in honey bee behavior enabled by plasticity in brain gene regulatory networks</a></h4>

Understanding the regulatory architecture of phenotypic variation is a fundamental goal in biology, but connections between gene regulatory network (GRN) activity and individual differences in behavior are poorly understood. We characterized the molecular basis of behavioral plasticity in queenless honey bee (<i>Apis mellifera</i>) colonies, where individuals engage in both reproductive and non-reproductive behaviors. Using high-throughput behavioral tracking, we discovered these colonies contain a continuum of phenotypes, with some individuals specialized for either egg-laying or foraging and ‘generalists’ that perform both. Brain gene expression and chromatin accessibility profiles were correlated with behavioral variation, with generalists intermediate in behavior and molecular profiles. Models of brain GRNs constructed for individuals revealed that transcription factor (TF) activity was highly predictive of behavior, and behavior-associated regulatory regions had more TF motifs. These results provide new insights into the important role played by brain GRN plasticity in the regulation of behavior, with implications for social evolution.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/62765">Phylogenomics of white-eyes, a 'great speciator', reveals Indonesian archipelago as the center of lineage diversity</a></h4>

Archipelagoes serve as important 'natural laboratories' which facilitate the study of island radiations and contribute to the understanding of evolutionary processes. The white-eye genus <i>Zosterops </i>is a classical example of a 'great speciator', comprising c. 100 species from across the Old World, most of them insular. We achieved an extensive geographic DNA sampling of <i>Zosterops </i>by using historical specimens and recently collected samples. Using over 700 genome-wide loci in conjunction with coalescent species tree methods and gene flow detection approaches, we untangled the reticulated evolutionary history of <i>Zosterops</i>, which comprises three main clades centered in Indo-Africa, Asia, and Australasia, respectively. Genetic introgression between species permeates the <i>Zosterops</i> phylogeny, regardless of how distantly related species are. Crucially, we identified the Indonesian archipelago, and specifically Borneo, as the major centre of diversity and the only area where all three main clades overlap, attesting to the evolutionary importance of this region.

<p>The mechanisms by which the brain undergoes neuroplasticity during sedentary versus active conditions are important in understanding how a sedentary lifestyle has become the leading cause of death due to modifiable risk factors. Neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) regulate ongoing sympathetic vasoconstriction and cardiac function under normal conditions, and their activity appears heightened in models of cardiovascular disease associated with sympathetic overactivity. The current study provides evidence of activity‐related neuroplasticity in the RVLM via increased glutamate levels and increased expression of NMDA receptors in the RVLM of sedentary compared to active rats. These mechanisms produce a complex framework by which RVLM neurons increase their influence on sympathoexcitation in sedentary compared to physically active conditions.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) is a brain region involved in normal regulation of the cardiovascular system and heightened sympathoexcitatory states of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Among major risk factors for CVD, sedentary lifestyles contribute to higher mortality than other modifiable risk factors. Previous studies suggest excessive glutamatergic excitation of presympathetic neurons in the RVLM occurs in sedentary animals. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine neuroplasticity in the glutamatergic system in the RVLM of sedentary and physically active rats. We hypothesized that relative to active rats, sedentary rats would exhibit higher expression of glutamate NMDA receptor subunits (GluN), phosphoGluN1 and the excitatory scaffold protein PSD95, while achieving higher glutamate levels. Male Sprague‐Dawley rats (4 wks old) were divided into sedentary and active (running wheel) conditions for 10‐12 weeks. We used retrograde tracing/triple‐labeling techniques; western blotting; and magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We report in sedentary versus physically active rats: 1) fewer bulbospinal non‐C1 neurons positive for GluN1, 2) significantly higher expression of GluN1 and GluN2B but lower levels of phosphoGluN1 (pSer896) and PSD95 and 3) higher levels of glutamate in the RVLM. Higher GluN expression is consistent with enhanced sympathoexcitation in sedentary animals; however, a more complex neuroplasticity occurs within subregions of the ventrolateral medulla. Our results in rodents may also indicate that alterations in glutamatergic excitation of the RVLM contribute to the increased incidence of CVD in humans who lead sedentary lifestyles. Thus, there is a strong need to further pursue mechanisms of inactivity‐related neuroplasticity in the RVLM.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To identify preoperative predictive factors of long‐term motor outcome in a large cohort of consecutive Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with bilateral subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN‐DBS).</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>All consecutive PD patients who underwent bilateral STN‐DBS at the Grenoble University Hospital (France) from 1993 to 2015 were evaluated before surgery, at 1 year (short‐term) and in the long‐term after surgery. All demographic variables, neuroimaging data and clinical characteristics available were collected. Preoperative predictors of long‐term motor outcome were investigated by performing survival and univariate/multivariate Cox regression analyses. Loss of motor benefit from stimulation in the long‐term was defined as a reduction lower than 25% of the Movement Disorder Society‐UPDRS (MDS‐UPDRS) part‐III scores compared to the baseline off‐medication scores. As secondary objective, potential predictors of short‐term motor outcome after STN‐DBS were assessed by performing univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the long‐term analyses (mean follow‐up: 8.4 ± 6.26 years; median: 10 years, 1–17 range), 138 patients were included. Preoperative higher Frontal Score and off‐medication MDS‐UDPRS part‐III scores predicted a better long‐term motor response to stimulation whereas the presence of vascular changes on neuroimaging predicted a worse motor outcome. In 357 patients available with 1‐year follow‐up, preoperative levodopa response, tremor dominant phenotype, baseline Frontal Score and off‐medication MDS‐UPDRS part‐III scores predicted the short‐term motor outcome.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Frontal lobe dysfunction, disease severity in the off‐medication condition and the presence of vascular changes on neuroimaging represent the main preoperative clinical predictors of long‐term motor STN‐DBS effects.</p>

<p>Synapse loss is the strongest correlate for cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease. The mechanisms underlying synapse loss have been extensively investigated using mouse models expressing genes with human familial Alzheimer's disease mutations. In this review, we summarize how multiphoton in vivo imaging has improved our understanding of synapse loss mechanisms associated with excessive amyloid in the living animal brain. We also discuss evidence obtained from these imaging studies for the role of cell-intrinsic calcium dyshomeostasis and cell-extrinsic activities of microglia, which are the immune cells of the brain, in mediating synapse loss.</p>

Tuberculosis disease is a major global public health concern and the growing prevalence of drug-resistant <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> is making disease control more difficult. However, the increasing application of whole-genome sequencing as a diagnostic tool is leading to the profiling of drug resistance to inform clinical practice and treatment decision making. Computational approaches for identifying established and novel resistance-conferring mutations in genomic data include genome-wide association study (GWAS) methodologies, tests for convergent evolution and machine learning techniques. These methods may be confounded by extensive co-occurrent resistance, where statistical models for a drug include unrelated mutations known to be causing resistance to other drugs. Here, we introduce a novel ‘cannibalistic’ elimination algorithm (“Hungry, Hungry SNPos”) that attempts to remove these co-occurrent resistant variants. Using an <i>M. tuberculosis</i> genomic dataset for the virulent Beijing strain-type (n = 3,574) with phenotypic resistance data across five drugs (isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, and streptomycin), we demonstrate that this new approach is considerably more robust than traditional methods and detects resistance-associated variants too rare to be likely picked up by correlation-based techniques like GWAS.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/okdPb6yDxS8" width="1" />

<p>by Tanguy Fardet, Anna Levina</p>

In this work, we introduce new phenomenological neuronal models (<i>e</i>LIF and mAdExp) that account for energy supply and demand in the cell as well as the inactivation of spike generation how these interact with subthreshold and spiking dynamics. Including these constraints, the new models reproduce a broad range of biologically-relevant behaviors that are identified to be crucial in many neurological disorders, but were not captured by commonly used phenomenological models. Because of their low dimensionality <i>e</i>LIF and mAdExp open the possibility of future large-scale simulations for more realistic studies of brain circuits involved in neuronal disorders. The new models enable both more accurate modeling and the possibility to study energy-associated disorders over the whole time-course of disease progression instead of only comparing the initially healthy status with the final diseased state. These models, therefore, provide new theoretical and computational methods to assess the opportunities of early diagnostics and the potential of energy-centered approaches to improve therapies.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vFKzK1Xrads" width="1" />

<p>by Ivan Borisov, Evgeny Metelkin</p>

Practical identifiability of Systems Biology models has received a lot of attention in recent scientific research. It addresses the crucial question for models’ predictability: how accurately can the models’ parameters be recovered from available experimental data. The methods based on profile likelihood are among the most reliable methods of practical identification. However, these methods are often computationally demanding or lead to inaccurate estimations of parameters’ confidence intervals. Development of methods, which can accurately produce parameters’ confidence intervals in reasonable computational time, is of utmost importance for Systems Biology and QSP modeling.
We propose an algorithm Confidence Intervals by Constraint Optimization (CICO) based on profile likelihood, designed to speed-up confidence intervals estimation and reduce computational cost. The numerical implementation of the algorithm includes settings to control the accuracy of confidence intervals estimates. The algorithm was tested on a number of Systems Biology models, including Taxol treatment model and STAT5 Dimerization model, discussed in the current article.

Simulations of tissue-specific effects of primary acute viral infections like COVID-19 are essential for understanding disease outcomes and optimizing therapies. Such simulations need to support continuous updating in response to rapid advances in understanding of infection mechanisms, and parallel development of components by multiple groups. We present an open-source platform for multiscale spatiotemporal simulation of an epithelial tissue, viral infection, cellular immune response and tissue damage, specifically designed to be modular and extensible to support continuous updating and parallel development. The base simulation of a simplified patch of epithelial tissue and immune response exhibits distinct patterns of infection dynamics from widespread infection, to recurrence, to clearance. Slower viral internalization and faster immune-cell recruitment slow infection and promote containment. Because antiviral drugs can have side effects and show reduced clinical effectiveness when given later during infection, we studied the effects on progression of treatment potency and time-of-first treatment after infection. In simulations, even a low potency therapy with a drug which reduces the replication rate of viral RNA greatly decreases the total tissue damage and virus burden when given near the beginning of infection. Many combinations of dosage and treatment time lead to stochastic outcomes, with some simulation replicas showing clearance or control (treatment success), while others show rapid infection of all epithelial cells (treatment failure). Thus, while a high potency therapy usually is less effective when given later, treatments at late times are occasionally effective. We illustrate how to extend the platform to model specific virus types (<i>e</i>.<i>g</i>., hepatitis C) and add additional cellular mechanisms (tissue recovery and variable cell susceptibility to infection), using our software modules and publicly-available software repository.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VHQEs_Hqk94" width="1" />

<p>by Christopher M. Pooley, Glenn Marion, Stephen C. Bishop, Richard I. Bailey, Andrea B. Doeschl-Wilson</p>

Individuals differ widely in their contribution to the spread of infection within and across populations. Three key epidemiological host traits affect infectious disease spread: susceptibility (propensity to acquire infection), infectivity (propensity to transmit infection to others) and recoverability (propensity to recover quickly). Interventions aiming to reduce disease spread may target improvement in any one of these traits, but the necessary statistical methods for obtaining risk estimates are lacking. In this paper we introduce a novel software tool called SIRE (standing for “Susceptibility, Infectivity and Recoverability Estimation”), which allows for the first time simultaneous estimation of the genetic effect of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), as well as non-genetic influences on these three unobservable host traits. SIRE implements a flexible Bayesian algorithm which accommodates a wide range of disease surveillance data comprising any combination of recorded individual infection and/or recovery times, or disease diagnostic test results. Different genetic and non-genetic regulations and data scenarios (representing realistic recording schemes) were simulated to validate SIRE and to assess their impact on the precision, accuracy and bias of parameter estimates. This analysis revealed that with few exceptions, SIRE provides unbiased, accurate parameter estimates associated with all three host traits. For most scenarios, SNP effects associated with recoverability can be estimated with highest precision, followed by susceptibility. For infectivity, many epidemics with few individuals give substantially more statistical power to identify SNP effects than the reverse. Importantly, precise estimates of SNP and other effects could be obtained even in the case of incomplete, censored and relatively infrequent measurements of individuals’ infection or survival status, albeit requiring more individuals to yield equivalent precision. SIRE represents a new tool for analysing a wide range of experimental and field disease data with the aim of discovering and validating SNPs and other factors controlling infectious disease transmission.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QjeuobbTQoc" width="1" />

<p>by Thomas F. Varley, Olaf Sporns, Aina Puce, John Beggs</p>

Whether the brain operates at a critical “tipping” point is a long standing scientific question, with evidence from both cellular and systems-scale studies suggesting that the brain does sit in, or near, a critical regime. Neuroimaging studies of humans in altered states of consciousness have prompted the suggestion that maintenance of critical dynamics is necessary for the emergence of consciousness and complex cognition, and that reduced or disorganized consciousness may be associated with deviations from criticality. Unfortunately, many of the cellular-level studies reporting signs of criticality were performed in non-conscious systems (in vitro neuronal cultures) or unconscious animals (e.g. anaesthetized rats). Here we attempted to address this knowledge gap by exploring critical brain dynamics in invasive ECoG recordings from multiple sessions with a single macaque as the animal transitioned from consciousness to unconsciousness under different anaesthetics (ketamine and propofol). We use a previously-validated test of criticality: avalanche dynamics to assess the differences in brain dynamics between normal consciousness and both drug-states. Propofol and ketamine were selected due to their differential effects on consciousness (ketamine, but not propofol, is known to induce an unusual state known as “dissociative anaesthesia”). Our analyses indicate that propofol dramatically restricted the size and duration of avalanches, while ketamine allowed for more awake-like dynamics to persist. In addition, propofol, but not ketamine, triggered a large reduction in the complexity of brain dynamics. All states, however, showed some signs of persistent criticality when testing for exponent relations and universal shape-collapse. Further, maintenance of critical brain dynamics may be important for regulation and control of conscious awareness.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_QTyAKQ-bYs" width="1" />

The broad concept of <i>emergence</i> is instrumental in various of the most challenging open scientific questions—yet, few quantitative theories of what constitutes emergent phenomena have been proposed. This article introduces a formal theory of causal emergence in multivariate systems, which studies the relationship between the dynamics of parts of a system and macroscopic features of interest. Our theory provides a quantitative definition of <i>downward causation</i>, and introduces a complementary modality of emergent behaviour—which we refer to as <i>causal decoupling</i>. Moreover, the theory allows practical criteria that can be efficiently calculated in large systems, making our framework applicable in a range of scenarios of practical interest. We illustrate our findings in a number of case studies, including Conway’s Game of Life, Reynolds’ flocking model, and neural activity as measured by electrocorticography.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YJdTyhyWdXI" width="1" />

Graph theoretical analyses of nervous systems usually omit the aspect of connection polarity, due to data insufficiency. The chemical synapse network of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> is a well-reconstructed directed network, but the signs of its connections are yet to be elucidated. Here, we present the gene expression-based sign prediction of the ionotropic chemical synapse connectome of <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i> (3,638 connections and 20,589 synapses total), incorporating available presynaptic neurotransmitter and postsynaptic receptor gene expression data for three major neurotransmitter systems. We made predictions for more than two-thirds of these chemical synapses and observed an excitatory-inhibitory (E:I) ratio close to 4:1 which was found similar to that observed in many real-world networks. Our open source tool (http://EleganSign.linkgroup.hu) is simple but efficient in predicting polarities by integrating neuronal connectome and gene expression data.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cFTifw-3DnI" width="1" />

<p>by Lorena Casado-Román, Guillermo V. Carbajal, David Pérez González, Manuel S. Malmierca</p>

The mismatch negativity (MMN) is a key biomarker of automatic deviance detection thought to emerge from 2 cortical sources. First, the auditory cortex (AC) encodes spectral regularities and reports frequency-specific deviances. Then, more abstract representations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) allow to detect contextual changes of potential behavioral relevance. However, the precise location and time asynchronies between neuronal correlates underlying this frontotemporal network remain unclear and elusive. Our study presented auditory oddball paradigms along with “no-repetition” controls to record mismatch responses in neuronal spiking activity and local field potentials at the rat medial PFC. Whereas mismatch responses in the auditory system are mainly induced by stimulus-dependent effects, we found that auditory responsiveness in the PFC was driven by unpredictability, yielding context-dependent, comparatively delayed, more robust and longer-lasting mismatch responses mostly comprised of prediction error signaling activity. This characteristically different composition discarded that mismatch responses in the PFC could be simply inherited or amplified downstream from the auditory system. Conversely, it is more plausible for the PFC to exert top-down influences on the AC, since the PFC exhibited flexible and potent predictive processing, capable of suppressing redundant input more efficiently than the AC. Remarkably, the time course of the mismatch responses we observed in the spiking activity and local field potentials of the AC and the PFC combined coincided with the time course of the large-scale MMN-like signals reported in the rat brain, thereby linking the microscopic, mesoscopic, and macroscopic levels of automatic deviance detection.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/rfwvinIx228" width="1" />

SARS Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late 2019, leading to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that continues to cause significant global mortality in human populations. Given its sequence similarity to SARS-CoV, as well as related coronaviruses circulating in bats, SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have originated in Chiroptera species in China. However, whether the virus spread directly to humans or through an intermediate host is currently unclear, as is the potential for this virus to infect companion animals, livestock, and wildlife that could act as viral reservoirs. Using a combination of surrogate entry assays and live virus, we demonstrate that, in addition to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the Spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 has a broad host tropism for mammalian ACE2 receptors, despite divergence in the amino acids at the Spike receptor binding site on these proteins. Of the 22 different hosts we investigated, ACE2 proteins from dog, cat, and cattle were the most permissive to SARS-CoV-2, while bat and bird ACE2 proteins were the least efficiently used receptors. The absence of a significant tropism for any of the 3 genetically distinct bat ACE2 proteins we examined indicates that SARS-CoV-2 receptor usage likely shifted during zoonotic transmission from bats into people, possibly in an intermediate reservoir. Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 receptor usage to the related coronaviruses SARS-CoV and RaTG13 identified distinct tropisms, with the 2 human viruses being more closely aligned. Finally, using bioinformatics, structural data, and targeted mutagenesis, we identified amino acid residues within the Spike–ACE2 interface, which may have played a pivotal role in the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in humans. The apparently broad tropism of SARS-CoV-2 at the point of viral entry confirms the potential risk of infection to a wide range of companion animals, livestock, and wildlife.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/m8cpZ3EpcOg" width="1" />

<p>by Christopher E. Ellison, Meenakshi S. Kagda, Weihuan Cao</p>

Coevolution between transposable elements (TEs) and their hosts can be antagonistic, where TEs evolve to avoid silencing and the host responds by reestablishing TE suppression, or mutualistic, where TEs are co-opted to benefit their host. The <i>TART-A</i> TE functions as an important component of <i>Drosophila</i> telomeres but has also reportedly inserted into the <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> nuclear export factor gene <i>nxf2</i>. We find that, rather than inserting into <i>nxf2</i>, <i>TART-A</i> has actually captured a portion of <i>nxf2</i> sequence. We show that <i>TART-A</i> produces abundant Piwi-interacting small RNAs (piRNAs), some of which are antisense to the <i>nxf2</i> transcript, and that the <i>TART</i>-like region of <i>nxf2</i> is evolving rapidly. Furthermore, in <i>D</i>. <i>melanogaster</i>, <i>TART-A</i> is present at higher copy numbers, and <i>nxf2</i> shows reduced expression, compared to the closely related species <i>Drosophila simulans</i>. We propose that capturing <i>nxf2</i> sequence allowed <i>TART-A</i> to target the <i>nxf2</i> gene for piRNA-mediated repression and that these 2 elements are engaged in antagonistic coevolution despite the fact that <i>TART-A</i> is serving a critical role for its host genome.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/VY2O9I8cFrM" width="1" />

<p>by Olga Krylova, David J. D. Earn</p>

Smallpox is unique among infectious diseases in the degree to which it devastated human populations, its long history of control interventions, and the fact that it has been successfully eradicated. Mortality from smallpox in London, England was carefully documented, weekly, for nearly 300 years, providing a rare and valuable source for the study of ecology and evolution of infectious disease. We describe and analyze smallpox mortality in London from 1664 to 1930. We digitized the weekly records published in the London Bills of Mortality (LBoM) and the Registrar General’s Weekly Returns (RGWRs). We annotated the resulting time series with a sequence of historical events that might have influenced smallpox dynamics in London. We present a spectral analysis that reveals how periodicities in reported smallpox mortality changed over decades and centuries; many of these changes in epidemic patterns are correlated with changes in control interventions and public health policies. We also examine how the seasonality of reported smallpox mortality changed from the 17th to 20th centuries in London.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/jF09DOqV7BQ" width="1" />

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Outcome prognostication unbiased by early care limitations (ECL) is essential for guiding treatment in patients presenting with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The aim of this study was to determine whether the max‐ICH (maximally treated ICH) Score provides improved and clinically useful prognostic estimation of functional long‐term outcomes after ICH.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This multicenter validation study compared the prognostication of the max‐ICH Score versus the ICH Score regarding diagnostic accuracy (discrimination and calibration) and clinical utility using decision curve analysis. We performed a joint investigation of individual participant data of consecutive spontaneous ICH patients (n = 4,677) from 2 retrospective German‐wide studies (RETRACE I + II; anticoagulation‐associated ICH only) conducted at 22 participating centers, one German prospective single‐center study (UKER‐ICH; nonanticoagulation‐associated ICH only), and 1 US‐based prospective longitudinal single‐center study (MGH; both anticoagulation‐ and nonanticoagulation‐associated ICH), treated between January 2006 and December 2015.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 4,677 included ICH patients, 1,017 (21.7%) were affected by ECL (German cohort: 15.6% [440 of 2,377]; MGH: 31.0% [577 of 1,283]). Validation of long‐term functional outcome prognostication by the max‐ICH Score provided good and superior discrimination in patients without ECL compared with the ICH Score (area under the receiver operating curve [AUROC], German cohort: 0.81 [0.78–0.83] vs 0.74 [0.72–0.77], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01; MGH: 0.85 [0.81–0.89] vs 0.78 [0.74–0.82], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01), and for the entire cohort (AUROC, German cohort: 0.84 [0.82–0.86] vs 0.80 [0.77–0.82], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01; MGH: 0.83 [0.81–0.85] vs 0.77 [0.75–0.79], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Both scores showed no evidence of poor calibration. The clinical utility investigated by decision curve analysis showed, at high threshold probabilities (0.8, aiming to avoid false‐positive poor outcome attribution), that the max‐ICH Score provided a clinical net benefit compared with the ICH Score (14.1 vs 2.1 net predicted poor outcomes per 100 patients).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The max‐ICH Score provides valid and improved prognostication of functional outcome after ICH. The associated clinical net benefit in minimizing false poor outcome attribution might potentially prevent unwarranted care limitations in patients with ICH. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<p>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) depends on precise delivery of electrical current to target tissues. However, the specific brain structures responsible for best outcome are still debated. We applied probabilistic stimulation mapping to a retrospective, multidisorder DBS dataset assembled over 15 years at our institution (n<sub>total</sub> = 482 patients; n<sub>Parkinson disease</sub> = 303; n<sub>dystonia</sub> = 64; n<sub>tremor</sub> = 39; n<sub>treatment‐resistant depression/anorexia nervosa</sub> = 76) to identify the neuroanatomical substrates of optimal clinical response. Using high‐resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging and activation volume modeling, probabilistic stimulation maps (PSMs) that delineated areas of above‐mean and below‐mean response for each patient cohort were generated and defined in terms of their relationships with surrounding anatomical structures. Our results show that overlap between PSMs and individual patients' activation volumes can serve as a guide to predict clinical outcomes, but that this is not the sole determinant of response. In the future, individualized models that incorporate advancements in mapping techniques with patient‐specific clinical variables will likely contribute to the optimization of DBS target selection and improved outcomes for patients.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.567075">Clmp Regulates AMPA and Kainate Receptor Responses in the Neonatal Hippocampal CA3 and Kainate Seizure Susceptibility in Mice</a></h4>

<p>Synaptic adhesion molecules regulate synapse development through trans-synaptic adhesion and assembly of diverse synaptic proteins. Many synaptic adhesion molecules positively regulate synapse development; some, however, exert negative regulation, although such cases are relatively rare. In addition, synaptic adhesion molecules regulate the amplitude of post-synaptic receptor responses, but whether adhesion molecules can regulate the kinetic properties of post-synaptic receptors remains unclear. Here we report that Clmp, a homophilic adhesion molecule of the Ig domain superfamily that is abundantly expressed in the brain, reaches peak expression at a neonatal stage (week 1) and associates with subunits of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) and kainate receptors (KARs). Clmp deletion in mice increased the frequency and amplitude of AMPAR-mediated miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents (mEPSCs) and the frequency, amplitude, and decay time constant of KAR-mediated mEPSCs in hippocampal CA3 neurons. Clmp deletion had minimal impacts on evoked excitatory synaptic currents at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses but increased extrasynaptic KAR, but not AMPAR, currents, suggesting that Clmp distinctly inhibits AMPAR and KAR responses. Behaviorally, Clmp deletion enhanced novel object recognition and susceptibility to kainate-induced seizures, without affecting contextual or auditory cued fear conditioning or pattern completion-based contextual fear conditioning. These results suggest that Clmp negatively regulates hippocampal excitatory synapse development and AMPAR and KAR responses in the neonatal hippocampal CA3 as well as object recognition and kainate seizure susceptibility in mice.</p>

<p>Recent studies have demonstrated structural and functional alterations in Parkinson’s disease (PD) with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, the topological patterns of functional brain networks in newly diagnosed PD patients with MCI are unclear so far. In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and graph theory approaches to explore the functional brain network in 45 PD patients with MCI (PD-MCI), 22 PD patients without MCI (PD-nMCI), and 18 healthy controls (HC). We found that the PD-MCI, PD-nMCI, and HC groups exhibited a small-world architecture in the functional brain network. However, early-stage PD-MCI patients had decreased clustering coefficient, increased characteristic path length, and changed nodal centrality in the default mode network (DMN), control network (CN), somatomotor network (SMN), and visual network (VN), which might contribute to factors for MCI symptoms in PD patients. Our results demonstrated that PD-MCI patients were associated with disrupted topological organization in the functional network, thus providing a topological network insight into the role of information exchange in the underlying development of MCI symptoms in PD patients.</p>

Objective<p>The aim of this study was to evaluate brain white matter (WM) fibers connectivity damage in stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI) subjects by direct electrophysiological imaging (DELPHI) that analyzes transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-evoked potentials (TEPs).</p>Methods<p>The study included 123 participants, out of which 53 subjects with WM-related pathologies (39 stroke, 14 TBI) and 70 healthy age-related controls.

A multidimensional approach was able to classify healthy from unhealthy with a balanced accuracy of 0.81 ± 0.02 and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.88 ± 0.01. Moreover, a multivariant regression model of DELPHI output measures achieved prediction of WM microstructure changes measured by FA with the highest correlations observed for fibers proximal to the stimulation area, such as frontal corpus callosum (r = 0.7 ± 0.02), anterior internal capsule (r = 0.7 ± 0.02), and fronto-occipital fasciculus (r = 0.65 ± 0.03).</p>Conclusion<p>These results indicate that features of TMS-evoked response are correlated to WM microstructure changes observed in pathological conditions, such as stroke and TBI, and that a multidimensional approach combining these features in supervised learning methods serves as a strong indicator for abnormalities and changes in WM integrity.</p>

<p>Extracts from Holothuria scabra (HS) have been shown to possess anti-inflammation, anti-oxidant and anti-cancer activities. More recently, it was shown to have neuroprotective potential in Caenorhabditis elegans PD model. Here, we assessed whether HS has neuroprotective and neurorestorative effects on dopaminergic neurons in both mouse and cellular models of PD. We found that both pre-treatment and post-treatment with HS improved motor deficits in PD mouse model induced with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) as determined by grid walk test. This was likely mediated by HS protective and restorative effects on maintaining the numbers of dopaminergic neurons and fibers in both substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and striatum. In a cellular model of PD, HS significantly attenuated 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP<sup>+</sup>)-induced apoptosis of DAergic-like neurons differentiated from SH-SY5Y cells by enhancing the expression of Bcl-2, suppressing the expression of cleaved Caspase 3 and preventing depolarization of mitochondrial membrane. In addition, HS could stimulate the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and suppressed the formation of α-synuclein protein. Taken together, our in vivo and in vitro findings suggested that HS is an attractive candidate for the neuroprotection rather than neurorestoration in PD.</p>

<p>Electroencephalograph (EEG) plays a significant role in the diagnostics process of epilepsy, but the detection rate is unsatisfactory when the length of interictal EEG signals is relatively short. Although the deliberate attacking theories for undirected brain network based on node removal method can extract potential network features, the node removal method fails to sufficiently consider the directionality of brain electrical activities. To solve the problems above, this study proposes a feature tensor-based epileptic detection method of directed brain networks. First, a directed functional brain network is constructed by calculating the transfer entropy of EEG signals between different electrodes. Second, the edge removal method is used to imitate the disruptions of brain connectivity, which may be related to the disorder of brain diseases, to obtain a sequence of residual networks. After that, topological features of these residual networks are extracted based on graph theory for constructing a five-way feature tensor. To exploit the inherent interactions among multiple modes of the feature tensor, this study uses the Tucker decomposition method to get a core tensor which is finally reshaped into a vector and input into the support vectors machine (SVM) classifier. Experiment results suggest that the proposed method has better epileptic screening performance for short-term interictal EEG data.</p>

<p>As the global population ages, the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is also increasing. At present, there are no widely recognized drugs able to ameliorate the cognitive dysfunction caused by AD. The failure of several promising clinical trials in recent years has highlighted the urgent need for novel strategies to both prevent and treat AD. Notably, a growing body of literature supports the efficacy of acupuncture for AD. In this review, we summarize the previously reported mechanisms of acupuncture's beneficial effects in AD, including the ability of acupuncture to modulate Aβ metabolism, tau phosphorylation, neurotransmitters, neurogenesis, synapse and neuron function, autophagy, neuronal apoptosis, neuroinflammation, cerebral glucose metabolism, and brain responses. Taken together, these findings suggest that acupuncture provides therapeutic effects for AD.</p>

<p>About one third of patients with epilepsy have seizures refractory to the medical treatment. Electrical stimulation mapping (ESM) is the gold standard for the identification of “eloquent” areas prior to resection of epileptogenic tissue. However, it is time-consuming and may cause undesired side effects. Broadband gamma activity (55–200 Hz) recorded with extraoperative electrocorticography (ECoG) during cognitive tasks may be an alternative to ESM but until now has not proven of definitive clinical value. Considering their role in cognition, the alpha (8–12 Hz) and beta (15–25 Hz) bands could further improve the identification of eloquent cortex. We compared gamma, alpha and beta activity, and their combinations for the identification of eloquent cortical areas defined by ESM. Ten patients with intractable focal epilepsy (age: 35.9 ± 9.1 years, range: 22–48, 8 females, 9 right handed) participated in a delayed-match-to-sample task, where syllable sounds were compared to visually presented letters. We used a generalized linear model (GLM) approach to find the optimal weighting of each band for predicting ESM-defined categories and estimated the diagnostic ability by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Gamma activity increased more in eloquent than in non-eloquent areas, whereas alpha and beta power decreased more in eloquent areas. Diagnostic ability of each band was close to 0.7 for all bands but depended on multiple factors including the time period of the cognitive task, the location of the electrodes and the patient’s degree of attention to the stimulus. We show that diagnostic ability can be increased by 3–5% by combining gamma and alpha and by 7.5–11% when gamma and beta were combined. We then show how ECoG power modulation from cognitive testing can be used to map the probability of eloquence in individual patients and how this probability map can be used in clinical settings to optimize ESM planning. We conclude that the combination of gamma and beta power modulation during cognitive testing can contribute to the identification of eloquent areas prior to ESM in patients with refractory focal epilepsy.</p>

<p>In the main control room (MCR) of a nuclear power plant (NPP), the quality of an operator's performance can depend on their level of attention to the task. Insufficient operator attention accounted for more than 26% of the total causes of human errors and is the highest category for errors. It is therefore necessary to check whether operators are sufficiently attentive either as supervisors or peers during reactor operation. Recently, digital control technologies have been introduced to the operating environment of an NPP MCR. These upgrades are expected to enhance plant and operator performance. At the same time, because personal computers are used in the advanced MCR, the operators perform more cognitive works than physical work. However, operators may not consciously check fellow operators' attention in this environment indicating potentially higher importance of the role of operator attention. Therefore, remote measurement of an operator's attention in real time would be a useful tool, providing feedback to supervisors. The objective of this study is to investigate the development of quantitative indicators that can identify an operator's attention, to diagnose or detect a lack of operator attention thus preventing potential human errors in advanced MCRs. To establish a robust baseline of operator attention, this study used two of the widely used biosignals: electroencephalography (EEG) and eye movement. We designed an experiment to collect EEG and eye movements of the subjects who were monitoring and diagnosing nuclear operator safety-relevant tasks. There was a statistically significant difference between biosignals with and without appropriate attention. Furthermore, an average classification accuracy of about 90% was obtained by the k-nearest neighbors and support vector machine classifiers with a few EEG and eye movements features. Potential applications of EEG and eye movement measures in monitoring and diagnosis tasks in an NPP MCR are also discussed.</p>

<p>Rhythmic activity in the brain fluctuates with behaviour and cognitive state, through a combination of coexisting and interacting frequencies. At large spatial scales such as those studied in human M/EEG, measured oscillatory dynamics are believed to arise primarily from a combination of cortical (intracolumnar) and corticothalamic rhythmogenic mechanisms. Whilst considerable progress has been made in characterizing these two types of neural circuit separately, relatively little work has been done that attempts to unify them into a single consistent picture. This is the aim of the present paper. We present and examine a whole-brain, connectome-based neural mass model with detailed long-range cortico-cortical connectivity and strong, recurrent corticothalamic circuitry. This system reproduces a variety of known features of human M/EEG recordings, including spectral peaks at canonical frequencies, and functional connectivity structure that is shaped by the underlying anatomical connectivity. Importantly, our model is able to capture state- (e.g., idling/active) dependent fluctuations in oscillatory activity and the coexistence of multiple oscillatory phenomena, as well as frequency-specific modulation of functional connectivity. We find that increasing the level of sensory drive to the thalamus triggers a suppression of the dominant low frequency rhythms generated by corticothalamic loops, and subsequent disinhibition of higher frequency endogenous rhythmic behaviour of intracolumnar microcircuits. These combine to yield simultaneous decreases in lower frequency and increases in higher frequency components of the M/EEG power spectrum during states of high sensory or cognitive drive. Building on this, we also explored the effect of pulsatile brain stimulation on ongoing oscillatory activity, and evaluated the impact of coexistent frequencies and state-dependent fluctuations on the response of cortical networks. Our results provide new insight into the role played by cortical and corticothalamic circuits in shaping intrinsic brain rhythms, and suggest new directions for brain stimulation therapies aimed at state-and frequency-specific control of oscillatory brain activity.</p>

<p>Neural processing occurs across a range of temporal scales. To facilitate this, the brain uses fast-changing representations reflecting momentary sensory input alongside more temporally extended representations, which integrate across both short and long temporal windows. The temporal flexibility of these representations allows animals to behave adaptively. Short temporal windows facilitate adaptive responding in dynamic environments, while longer temporal windows promote the gradual integration of information across time. In the cognitive and motor domains, the brain sets overarching goals to be achieved within a long temporal window, which must be broken down into sequences of actions and precise movement control processed across much shorter temporal windows. Previous human neuroimaging studies and large-scale artificial network models have ascribed different processing timescales to different cortical regions, linking this to each region’s position in an anatomical hierarchy determined by patterns of inter-regional connectivity. However, even within cortical regions, there is variability in responses when studied with single-neuron electrophysiology. Here, we review a series of recent electrophysiology experiments that demonstrate the heterogeneity of temporal receptive fields at the level of single neurons within a cortical region. This heterogeneity appears functionally relevant for the computations that neurons perform during decision-making and working memory. We consider anatomical and biophysical mechanisms that may give rise to a heterogeneity of timescales, including recurrent connectivity, cortical layer distribution, and neurotransmitter receptor expression. Finally, we reflect on the computational relevance of each brain region possessing a heterogeneity of neuronal timescales. We argue that this architecture is of particular importance for sensory, motor, and cognitive computations.</p>

<p>The corpus callosum, the principal structural avenue for interhemispheric neuronal communication, controls the brain’s lateralization. Developmental malformations of the corpus callosum (CCD) can lead to learning and intellectual disabilities. Currently, there is no clear explanation for these symptoms. Here, we used resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) to evaluate the dynamic resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) in both the cingulate cortex (CG) and the sensory areas (S1, S2, A1) in three marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) with spontaneous CCD. We also performed rsfMRI in 10 CCD human subjects (six hypoplasic and four agenesic). We observed no differences in the strength of rsFC between homotopic CG and sensory areas in both species when comparing them to healthy controls. However, in CCD marmosets, we found lower strength of quasi-periodic patterns (QPP) correlation in the posterior interhemispheric sensory areas. We also found a significant lag of interhemispheric communication in the medial CG, suggesting asynchrony between the two hemispheres. Correspondingly, in human subjects, we found that the CG of acallosal subjects had a higher QPP correlation than controls. In comparison, hypoplasic subjects had a lower QPP correlation and a delay of 1.6 s in the sensory regions. These results show that CCD affects the interhemispheric synchrony of both CG and sensory areas and that, in both species, its impact on cortical communication varies along the CC development gradient. Our study shines a light on how CCD misconnects homotopic regions and opens a line of research to explain the causes of the symptoms exhibited by CCD patients and how to mitigate them.</p>

<p>Objective: Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is a common complication in adult patients with moyamoya disease (MMD), and is reversible by surgical revascularization in its early stage of mild VCI. However, accurate diagnosis of mild VCI is difficult based on neuropsychological examination alone. This study proposed a method of dynamic resting-state functional connectivity (FC) network to recognize global cognitive impairment in MMD.</p><p>Methods: For MMD, 36 patients with VCI and 43 patients with intact cognition (Non-VCI) were included, as well as 26 normal controls (NCs). Using resting-state fMRI, dynamic low-order FC networks were first constructed with multiple brain regions which were generated through a sliding window approach and correlated in temporal dimension. In order to obtain more information of network interactions along the time, high-order FC networks were established by calculating correlations among each pair of brain regions. Afterwards, a sparse representation-based classifier was constructed to recognize MMD (experiment 1) and its cognitive impairment (experiment 2) with features extracted from both low- and high-order FC networks. Finally, the ten-fold cross-validation strategy was proposed to train and validate the performance of the classifier.</p><p>Results: The three groups did not differ significantly in demographic features (p &gt; 0.05), while the VCI group exhibited the lowest MMSE scores (p = 0.001). The Non-VCI and NCs groups did not differ significantly in MMSE scores (p = 0.054). As for the classification between MMD and NCs, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the classifier reached 90.70, 88.57, 93.67, and 73.08%, respectively. While for the classification between VCI and Non-VCI, the AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the classifier reached 91.02, 84.81, 80.56, and 88.37%, respectively.</p><p>Conclusion: This study not only develops a promising classifier to recognize VCI in adult MMD in its early stage, but also implies the significance of time-varying properties in dynamic FC networks.</p>

<p>Microglia are central nervous system (CNS) resident immune cells that have been implicated in neuroinflammatory pathogenesis of a variety of neurological conditions. Their manifold context-dependent contributions to neuroinflammation are only beginning to be elucidated, which can be attributed in part to the challenges of studying microglia in vivo and the lack of tractable in vitro systems to study microglia function. Organotypic brain slice cultures offer a tissue-relevant context that enables the study of CNS resident cells and the analysis of brain slice microglial phenotypes has provided important insights, in particular into neuroprotective functions. Here we use RNA sequencing, direct digital quantification of gene expression with nCounter® technology and targeted analysis of individual microglial signature genes, to characterize brain slice microglia relative to acutely-isolated counterparts and 2-dimensional (2D) primary microglia cultures, a widely used in vitro surrogate. Analysis using single cell and population-based methods found brain slice microglia exhibited better preservation of canonical microglia markers and overall gene expression with stronger fidelity to acutely-isolated adult microglia, relative to in vitro cells. We characterized the dynamic phenotypic changes of brain slice microglia over time, after plating in culture. Mechanical damage associated with slice preparation prompted an initial period of inflammation, which resolved over time. Based on flow cytometry and gene expression profiling we identified the 2-week timepoint as optimal for investigation of microglia responses to exogenously-applied stimuli as exemplified by treatment-induced neuroinflammatory changes observed in microglia following LPS, TNF and GM-CSF addition to the culture medium. Altogether these findings indicate that brain slice cultures provide an experimental system superior to in vitro culture of microglia as a surrogate to investigate microglia functions, and the impact of soluble factors and cellular context on their physiology.</p>

<p>This study aimed to explore the molecular regulatory network among microRNA-125b (miR-125b), forkhead box Q1 (FOXQ1), prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), as well as their effects on cell apoptosis, neurite outgrowth, and inflammation in Alzheimer disease (AD). Rat embryo cerebral cortex neurons and nerve growth factor–stimulated PC12 cells were insulted by Aβ<sub>1−42</sub> to construct two AD cellular models. Negative control (NC) inhibitor, miR-125b inhibitor, NC siRNA, FOXQ1 siRNA, PTGS2 siRNA, and CDK5 siRNA were transferred into the two AD cellular models alone or combined. Then, cell apoptosis, neurite outgrowth, proinflammatory cytokines, miR-125b, FOXQ1, PTGS2, and CDK5 expressions were detected. MiR-125b inhibition facilitated neurite outgrowth but suppressed cell apoptosis and proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin 1β, and interleukin 6); meanwhile, it upregulated FOXQ1 but downregulated PTGS2 and CDK5. Furthermore, FOXQ1 inhibition promoted cell apoptosis and proinflammatory cytokines but repressed neurite outgrowth; PTGS2 inhibition achieved the opposite effects; CDK5 inhibition attenuated cell apoptosis, whereas it less affected neurite outgrowth and inflammation. Notably, FOXQ1 inhibition attenuated, whereas PTGS2 inhibition elevated the effect of miR-125b inhibition on regulating neurite outgrowth, cell apoptosis, and proinflammatory cytokines. As for CDK5 inhibition, it enhanced the effect of miR-125b inhibition on regulating cell apoptosis, but less impacted the neurite outgrowth and proinflammatory cytokines. Additionally, PTGS2 inhibition and CDK5 inhibition both reversed the effect of FOXQ1 inhibition on regulating cell apoptosis, neurite outgrowth, and proinflammatory cytokines. In conclusion, targeting miR-125b alleviates AD progression via blocking PTGS2 and CDK5 in a FOXQ1-dependent way.</p>

<p>Osteoporosis and neurodegenerative diseases are two kinds of common disorders of the elderly, which often co-occur. Previous studies have shown the skeletal and central nervous systems are closely related to pathophysiology. As the main structural scaffold of the body, the bone is also a reservoir for stem cells, a primary lymphoid organ, and an important endocrine organ. It can interact with the brain through various bone-derived cells, mostly the mesenchymal and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The bone marrow is also a place for generating immune cells, which could greatly influence brain functions. Finally, the proteins secreted by bones (osteokines) also play important roles in the growth and function of the brain. This article reviews the latest research studying the impact of bone-derived cells, bone-controlled immune system, and bone-secreted proteins on the brain, and evaluates how these factors are implicated in the progress of neurodegenerative diseases and their potential use in the diagnosis and treatment of these diseases.</p>

<p>Background: Several vascular risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes, body mass index, and smoking status are found to be associated with cognitive decline and the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We aimed to investigate whether an aggregation of vascular risk factors modulates the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).</p><p>Methods: Forty-three MCI patients and twenty-nine healthy controls (HCs) underwent resting-state functional MRI scans, and spontaneous brain activity was measured by the ALFF technique. The vascular risk profile was represented with the Framingham Heart Study general cardiovascular disease (FHS-CVD) risk score, and each group was further divided into high and low risk subgroups. Two-way ANOVA was performed to explore the main effects of diagnosis and vascular risk and their interaction on ALFF.</p><p>Results: The main effect of diagnosis on ALFF was found in left middle temporal gyrus (LMTG) and left superior parietal gyrus (LSPG), and the main effect of risk on ALFF was detected in left fusiform gyrus (LFFG), left precuneus (LPCUN), and left cerebellum posterior lobe (LCPL). Patients with MCI exhibited increased ALFF in the LMTG and LSPG than HCs, and participants with high vascular risk showed increased ALFF in the LFFG and LCPL, while decreased ALFF in the LPCUN. An interaction between diagnosis (MCI vs. HC) and FHS-CVD risk (high vs. low) regarding ALFF was observed in the left hippocampus (LHIP). HCs with high vascular risk showed significantly increased ALFF in the LHIP than those with low vascular risk, while MCI patients with high vascular risk showed decreased ALFF in the LHIP than HCs with high vascular risk. Interestingly, the mean ALFF of LHIP positively correlated with word recall test in HCs with high vascular risk (rho = 0.630, P = 0.016), while negatively correlated with the same test in MCI patients with high vascular risk (rho = −0.607, P = 0.001).</p><p>Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence highlighting that the aggregation of vascular risk factors modulates the spontaneous brain activity in MCI patients, and this may serve as a potential imaging mechanism underlying vascular contribution to AD.</p>

<p>Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are two major neurodegenerative diseases worldwide. Demographic aging is in rapid progress in China. Up-to-date estimates of AD and PD prevalence have not been provided.</p><p>Methods: Studies that reported the prevalence of AD and PD in China were identified via a systematic database search from 1985 to 2018. Meta-analysis, local polynomial regression and autoregressive integrated moving average model were used for analyses.</p><p>Results: A total of 99 studies were included in the study with populations of 385,312 and 227,228, respectively for AD and PD. The overall prevalence of AD and PD following age standardization was 3.20% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.17–3.23] and 1.06% (95% CI = 1.02–1.10), respectively in individuals over 60 years old. The rates increased drastically for every 10-years increment of age. The yearly prevalence of AD was predicted to increase from 3.81 to 6.17% in the next 5 years. Significant differences were observed between genders [male to female odds ratio (OR) for AD = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.51–0.64; OR for PD = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.06–1.46], and between education levels (Illiterate to non-illiterate OR for AD = 2.99, 95% CI = 2.38–3.75), but not between urban and rural settings.</p><p>Conclusion: Our results provide an updated insight into the epidemiology of AD and PD in China and their associated rates and ratios. The findings may facilitate China policy makers and health professionals mitigate the related health issues.</p>

<p>Face recognition deficits are frequently reported in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and often attributed to memory impairment. However, it has been hypothesized that failure in identifying familiar people could also be due to deficits in higher-level perceptual processes, since there is evidence showing a reduced inversion effect for faces but not for cars in AD. To address the involvement of these higher processes, we investigated event-related potential (ERP) neural correlates of faces in a patient with AD showing a face recognition deficit. Eight healthy participants were tested as a control group. Participants performed different tasks following the stimulus presentation. In experiment 1, they should indicate whether the stimulus was either a face or a house or a scrambled image. In experiments 2 and 3, they should discriminate between upright and inverted faces (in experiment 2, stimuli were faces with neutral or fearful expressions, while in experiment 3, stimuli were famous or unfamiliar faces). Electrophysiological results reveal that the typical face-specific modulation of the N170 component, which is thought to reflect the structural encoding of faces, was not present in patient MCG, despite being affected by the emotional content of the face implicitly processed by MCG. Conversely, the N400 component, which is thought to reflect the recruitment of the memory trace of the face identity, was found to be implicitly modulated in MCG. These results may identify a possible role for gnosic processes in face recognition deficits in AD and suggest the importance of adopting an integrated approach to the AD diagnosis while considering electrophysiological markers.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The mammalian nervous system is a complex network of interconnected cells. We review emerging techniques that use the axonal transport of adeno‐associated virus (AAV) vectors to dissect neural circuits. These intersectional approaches specifically target AAV‐mediated gene expression to discrete neuron populations based on their axonal connectivity, including: (a) neurons with one defined output, (b) neurons with one defined input, (c) neurons with one defined input and one defined output, and (d) neurons with two defined inputs or outputs. The number of labeled neurons can be directly controlled to trace axonal projections and examine cellular morphology. These approaches can precisely target the expression of fluorescent reporters, optogenetic ion channels, chemogenetic receptors, disease‐associated proteins, and other factors to defined neural circuits in mammals ranging from mice to macaques, and thereby provide a powerful new means to understand the structure and function of the nervous system.</p>

<p>All HCN channel subtypes were located at subcellular level in human and compared with other mammals such as guinea pig, cat, and three mouse strains.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neuronal diversity in the cochlea is largely determined by ion channels. Among voltage‐gated channels, hyperpolarization‐activated cyclic nucleotide‐gated (HCN) channels open with hyperpolarization and depolarize the cell until the resting membrane potential. The functions for hearing are not well elucidated and knowledge about localization is controversial. We created a detailed map of subcellular location and co‐expression of all four HCN subunits across different mammalian species including CBA/J, C57Bl/6N, Ly5.1 mice, guinea pigs, cats, and human subjects. We correlated age‐related hearing deterioration in CBA/J and C57Bl/6N with expression levels of HCN1, −2, and −4 in individual auditory neurons from the same cohort. Spatiotemporal expression during murine postnatal development exposed HCN2 and HCN4 involvement in a critical phase of hair cell innervation. The huge diversity of subunit composition, but lack of relevant heteromeric pairing along the perisomatic membrane and axon initial segments, highlighted an active role for auditory neurons. Neuron clusters were found to be the hot spots of HCN1, −2, and −4 immunostaining. HCN channels were also located in afferent and efferent fibers of the sensory epithelium. Age‐related changes on HCN subtype expression were not uniform among mice and could not be directly correlated with audiometric data. The oldest mice groups revealed HCN channel up‐ or downregulation, depending on the mouse strain. The unexpected involvement of HCN channels in outer hair cell function where HCN3 overlaps prestin location emphasized the importance for auditory function. A better understanding may open up new possibilities to tune neuronal responses evoked through electrical stimulation by cochlear implants.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) accounts for significant global health burden. Effects of TBI can become chronic even following mild injury. There is a need to develop effective therapies to attenuate the damaging effects of TBI and improve recovery outcomes. This literature review using a priori criteria (PROSPERO; CRD42018100623) summarized 43 studies between January 1998 and July 2019 that investigated nutritional interventions (NUT) delivered with the objective of altering neurophysiological (NP) outcomes following TBI. Risk of bias was assessed for included studies, and NP outcomes recorded. The systematic search resulted in 43 of 3,748 identified studies met inclusion criteria. No studies evaluated the effect of a NUT on NP outcomes of TBI in humans. Biomarkers of morphological changes and apoptosis, oxidative stress, and plasticity, neurogenesis, and neurotransmission were the most evaluated NP outcomes across the 43 studies that used 2,897 animals. The risk of bias was unclear in all reviewed studies due to poorly detailed methodology sections. Taking these limitations into account, anti‐oxidants, branched chain amino acids, and ω‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have shown the most promising pre‐clinical results for altering NP outcomes following TBI. Refinement of pre‐clinical methodologies used to evaluate effects of interventions on secondary damage of TBI would improve the likelihood of translation to clinical populations.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>With global increases in the aging population, the number of patients with dementia is greatly increasing, which has become a big social problem. Many studies have shown strong associations between oral disorders and systemic disorders, such as diabetes, arthritis, sepsis, aspiration pneumonia, arteriosclerosis, bacterial endocarditis, and other cardiovascular diseases. Similarly, numerous cross‐sectional studies showed that patients with dementia usually have poor oral conditions and tooth loss. These have long been considered as a result of difficulty with oral care due to impaired cognitive function, memory, and physical ability in patients with dementia. Indeed, even in patients with mild cognitive impairment, oral care becomes insufficient owing to decreases in spontaneity of grooming and finger dexterity. However, recent studies have shown that tooth loss and occlusal dysfunction may affect brain function and trigger the onset of dementia found in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease. In this review, we highlight the relationships among aging, oral dysfunction, and the development of dementia. Increasing evidence suggests that oral dysfunction is not only a result of dementia in the elderly people, but could also be a causative factor for the onset of dementia.</p>

<p>Mouse cochlear glial cells have region‐specific membrane properties. Within dissociated cultures, satellite glial cells (SGCs) have large weak inwardly rectifying currents, likely mediated by Kir4.1 channels. Presumptive Schwann cells lack these currents. Soon after birth, Kir4.1 subunits appear in both glial subtypes, but become restricted to SGCs around hearing onset.</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) are the primary afferent neurons of the auditory system, and together with their attendant glia, form the auditory nerve. Within the cochlea, satellite glial cells (SGCs) encapsulate the cell body of SGNs, whereas Schwann cells (SCs) wrap their peripherally‐ and centrally‐directed neurites. Despite their likely importance in auditory nerve function and homeostasis, the physiological properties of auditory glial cells have evaded description. Here, we characterized the voltage‐activated membrane currents of glial cells from the mouse cochlea. We identified a prominent weak inwardly rectifying current in SGCs within cochlear slice preparations (postnatal day P5‐P6), which was also present in presumptive SGCs within dissociated cultures prepared from the cochleae of hearing mice (P14‐P15). Pharmacological block by Ba<sup>2+</sup> and desipramine suggested that channels belonging to the Kir4 family mediated the weak inwardly rectifying current, and <i>post hoc</i> immunofluorescence implicated the involvement of Kir4.1 subunits. Additional electrophysiological profiles were identified for glial cells within dissociated cultures, suggesting that glial subtypes may have specific membrane properties to support distinct physiological roles. Immunofluorescence using fixed cochlear sections revealed that although Kir4.1 is restricted to SGCs after the onset of hearing, these channels are more widely distributed within the glial population earlier in postnatal development (i.e., within both SGCs and SCs). The decrease in Kir4.1 immunofluorescence during SC maturation was coincident with a reduction of Sox2 expression and advancing neurite myelination. The data suggest a diversification of glial properties occurs in preparation for sound‐driven activity in the auditory nerve.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) primarily affects fertile, overweight women, and presents with the symptoms of raised intracranial pressure. The etiology is unknown but has been thought to relate to cerebrospinal fluid disturbance or cerebral venous stenosis. We have previously found evidence that IIH is also a disease of the brain parenchyma, evidenced by alterations at the neurogliovascular interface, including astrogliosis, pathological changes in the basement membrane and pericytes, and alterations of perivascular aquaporin‐4. The aim of this present electron microscopic study was to examine whether mitochondria phenotype was changed in IIH, particularly focusing on perivascular astrocytic endfeet and neurons (soma and pre‐ and postsynaptic terminals). Cortical brain biopsies of nine reference individuals and eight IIH patients were analyzed for subcellular distribution and phenotypical features of mitochondria using transmission electron microscopy. We found significantly increased prevalence of pathological mitochondria and reduced number of normal mitochondria in astrocytic endfeet of IIH patients. The degree of astrogliosis correlated negatively with the number of normal mitochondria in astrocytic endfoot processes. Moreover, we found significantly increased number of pathological mitochondria in pre‐ and postsynaptic neuronal terminals, as well as significantly shortened distance between mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum contacts. Finally, the length of postsynaptic density, a marker of synaptic strength, was on average reduced in IIH. The present data provide evidence of pathological mitochondria in perivascular astrocytes endfeet and neurons of IIH patients, highlighting that impaired metabolism at the neurogliovascular interface may be a facet of IIH.</p>

<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Soccer, as a contact sport, exposes players to repetitive head impacts, especially through heading the ball. The question of a long‐term brain cumulative effect remains. Our objective was to determine whether exposure to head impacts over one soccer season was associated with changes in functional brain connectivity at rest, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this prospective cohort study, 10 semi‐professional men soccer players, aged 18–25 years, and 20 age‐matched men athletes without a concussion history and who do not practice any contact sport were recruited in Bordeaux (France). Exposure to head impacts per soccer player during competitive games over one season was measured using video analysis. Resting‐state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired for both groups at two times, before and after the season. With a seed‐based analysis, resting‐state networks that have been intimately associated with aspects of cognitive functioning were investigated. The results showed a mean head impacts of 42 (±33) per soccer player over the season, mainly intentional head‐to‐ball impacts and no concussion. No head impact was found among the other athletes. The number of head impacts between the two MRI acquisitions before and after the season was associated with increased connectivity within the default mode network and the cortico‐cerebellar network. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the brain functioning changes over one soccer season in association with exposure to repetitive head impacts.</p>

<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Individuals who regularly shift their sleep timing, like night and/or shift‐workers suffer from circadian desynchrony and are at risk of developing cardiometabolic diseases and cancer. Also, shift‐work is are suggested to be a risk factor for the development of mood disorders such as the burn out syndrome, anxiety, and depression. Experimental and clinical studies provide evidence that food intake restricted to the normal activity phase is a potent synchronizer for the circadian system and can prevent the detrimental health effects associated with circadian disruption. Here, we explored whether adult male Wistar rats exposed to an experimental model of shift‐work (W‐AL) developed depressive and/or anxiety‐like behaviors and whether this was associated with neuroinflammation in brain areas involved with mood regulation. We also tested whether time‐restricted feeding (TRF) to the active phase could ameliorate circadian disruption and therefore would prevent depressive and anxiety‐like behaviors as well as neuroinflammation. In male Wistar rats, W‐AL induced depressive‐like behavior characterized by hypoactivity and anhedonia and induced increased anxiety‐like behavior in the open field test. This was associated with increased number of glial fibrillary acidic protein and IBA‐1‐positive cells in the prefrontal cortex and basolateral amygdala. Moreover W‐AL caused morphological changes in the microglia in the CA3 area of the hippocampus indicating microglial activation. Importantly, TRF prevented behavioral changes and decreased neuroinflammation markers in the brain. Present results add up evidence about the importance that TRF in synchrony with the light–dark cycle can prevent neuroinflammation leading to healthy mood states in spite of circadian disruptive conditions.</p>

<p>Time‐to‐contact (TTC) perception refers to the ability of an observer to estimate the remaining time before an object reaches a point in the environment, and is of crucial importance in daily life. Noninvasive correlational approaches have identified several brain areas sensitive to TTC information. Here we report the results of two studies, including one during an awake brain surgery, that aimed to identify the specific areas causally engaged in the TTC estimation process. In Study 1, we tested 40 patients with brain tumor in a TTC estimation task. The results showed that four of the six patients with impaired performance had tumors in right upper parietal cortex, although this tumoral location represented only six over 40 patients. In Study 2, 15 patients underwent awake brain surgery electrostimulation mapping to examine the implication of various brain areas in the TTC estimation process. We acquired and normalized to MNI space the coordinates of the functional areas that influenced task performance. Our results seem to demonstrate that the early stage of the TTC estimation process involved specific cortical territories in the ventral region of the right intraparietal sulcus. Downstream processing of TTC could also involve the frontal eye field (middle frontal gyrus) related to ocular search. We also found that deactivating language areas in the left hemisphere interfered with the TTC estimation process. These findings demonstrate a fine grained, cortical representation of TTC processing close to the ventral right intraparietal sulcus and complement those described in other human studies.</p>

<p>Volume of hippocampal subregions (presubiculum/subiculum) are reduced in elderly subjects presenting cortical β‐amyloid deposition and signs of neurodegeneration.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Changes in hippocampal subfield volumes (HSV) along the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum have been scarcely investigated to date in elderly subjects classified based on the presence of β‐amyloid aggregation and signs of neurodegeneration. We classified patients (either sex) with mild dementia compatible with AD (<i>n</i> = 35) or amnestic mild cognitive impairment (<i>n</i> = 39), and cognitively unimpaired subjects (either sex; <i>n</i> = 26) using [<sup>11</sup>C]PIB‐PET to assess β‐amyloid aggregation (A+) and [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG‐PET to account for neurodegeneration ((N)+). Magnetic resonance imaging‐based automated methods were used for HSV and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) measurements. Significant HSV reductions were found in A+(N)+ subjects in the presubiculum/subiculum complex and molecular layer, related to worse memory performance. In both the A+(N)+ and A+(N)− categories, subicular volumes were inversely correlated with the degree of Aβ deposition. The A−(N)+ subgroup showed reduced HSV relative to the A−(N)− subgroup also in the subiculum/presubiculum. Combining all (N)− subjects, HSV were lower in subjects presenting significant cognitive decline irrespective of A+/A− classification (controlling for WMH load); these between‐group differences were detected again in the presubiculum, but also involved the CA4 and granular layer. These findings demonstrate that differential HSV reductions are detectable both in (N)+ and (N)− categories along the AD continuum, and are directly related to the severity of cognitive deficits. HSV reductions are larger both in A+(N)+ and A+(N)− subjects in direct proportion to the degree of Aβ deposition. The meaningful HSV reductions detected in the A−(N)+ subgroup highlights the strength of biomarker‐based classifications outside of the classical AD continuum.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>After peripheral nerve injury, Schwann cells (SCs) are crucially involved in several steps of the subsequent regenerative processes, such as the Wallerian degeneration. They promote lysis and phagocytosis of myelin, secrete numbers of neurotrophic factors and cytokines, and recruit macrophages for a biological debridement. However, nerve injuries with a defect size of &gt;1 cm do not show proper tissue regeneration and require a surgical nerve gap reconstruction. To find a sufficient alternative to the current gold standard—the autologous nerve transplant—several cell‐based therapies have been developed and were experimentally investigated. One approach aims on the use of adipose tissue stem cells (ASCs). These are multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells that can differentiate into multiple phenotypes along the mesodermal lineage, such as osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and myocytes. Furthermore, ASCs also possess neurotrophic features, that is, they secrete neurotrophic factors like the nerve growth factor, brain‐derived neurotrophic factor, neurotrophin‐3, ciliary neurotrophic factor, glial cell‐derived neurotrophic factor, and artemin. They can also differentiate into the so‐called Schwann cell‐like cells (SCLCs). These cells share features with naturally occurring SCs, as they also promote nerve regeneration in the periphery. This review gives a comprehensive overview of the use of ASCs in peripheral nerve regeneration and peripheral nerve tissue engineering both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. While the sustainability of differentiation of ASCs to SCLCs <i>in vivo</i> is still questionable, ASCs used with different nerve conduits, such as hydrogels or silk fibers, have been shown to promote nerve regeneration.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Adolescent alcohol drinking, primarily in the form of binge‐drinking episodes, is a serious public health concern. Binge drinking in laboratory animals has been modeled by a procedure involving chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) administration, as compared with chronic intermittent water (CIW). The prolonged effects of adolescent binge alcohol exposure in adults, such as high risk of developing alcohol use disorder, are severe but available treatments in the clinic are limited. One reason is the lack of sufficient understanding about the associated neuronal alterations. The involvement of the insular cortex, particularly the anterior agranular insula (AAI), has emerged as a critical region to explain neuronal mechanisms of substance abuse. This study was designed to evaluate the functional output of the AAI by measuring the intrinsic excitability of pyramidal neurons from male rats 2 or 21 days after adolescent or adult CIE treatment. Decreases in intrinsic excitability in AAI pyramidal neurons were detected 21 days, relative to 2 days, after adolescent CIE. Interestingly, the decreased intrinsic excitability in the AAI pyramidal neurons was observed 2 days after adult CIE, compared to adult CIW, but no difference was found between 2 versus 21 days after adult CIE. These data indicate that, although the AAI is influenced within a limited period after adult but not adolescent CIE, neuronal alterations in AAI are affected during the prolonged period of withdrawal from adolescent but not adult CIE. This may explain the prolonged vulnerability to mental disorders of subjects with an alcohol binge history during their adolescent stage.</p>

<p>In this research, the potential anti‐relapse efficacy of N‐acetylcysteine (NAC), using the alcohol deprivation effect (ADE) model in long‐term experienced male Wistar rats, has been explored. Two different experiments were performed in order to: (a) test the efficacy of NAC to prevent relapse and (b) discriminate the best administration schedule (intermittent vs. continuous) for the drug.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Alcohol use disorders are chronic and highly relapsing disorders, thus alcoholic patients have a high rate of recidivism for drug use even after long periods of abstinence. The literature points to the potential usefulness of N‐acetylcysteine (NAC) in the management of several substance use disorders probably due to its capacity to restore brain homeostasis of the glutamate system disrupted in addiction. However, there is little evidence in the case of alcohol. The aim of this study was to explore the potential anti‐relapse efficacy of NAC using the alcohol deprivation effect (ADE) model in long‐term experienced rats. Two experiments were performed in male Wistar rats to: (a) test the efficacy of NAC to prevent relapse and (b) discriminate the best administration schedule (intermittent vs. continuous) for NAC. In the first experiment, animals were implanted with mini‐osmotic pumps delivering 0 or 1 mg/hr NAC during 14 days. In a second experiment, rats received 0, 60, or 100 mg/kg once daily by subcutaneous injection. The efficacy to prevent ADE was evaluated in both experiments. NAC subcutaneously administered, either by continuous infusion or by intermittent injections regimen, is able to block the ADE. The best results were obtained after using 60 mg/kg NAC dose. Our findings support the hypothesis that NAC may represent a valuable therapy in the management of alcohol relapse.</p>

<p>In 125 healthy older adults we highlighted the importance of routinely accounting for factors that impact cognition both directly as well as indirectly via structural brain changes. Temporal stem diffusion changes demonstrated specificity for explaining the differential impacts of a number of cognitive risk factors on memory performance.</p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Prior research investigating associations between hypertension, obesity, and apolipoprotein (<i>APOE</i>) genotype status with memory performance among older adults has yielded inconsistent results. This may reflect, in part, a lack of first accounting for the effects these variables have on structural brain changes, that in turn contribute to age‐related memory impairment. The current study sought to clarify the relationships between these factors via path modeling. We hypothesized that higher body mass index (BMI), hypertension, and being an <i>APOE</i>‐ε4 allele carrier would predict poorer memory scores, with much of these effects accounted for by indirect effects operating via differences in the integrity of temporal stem white matter. Participants included 125 healthy older adults who underwent neuropsychological assessment and diffusion‐weighted MRI scanning. Direct effects were found for hypertension and demographic variables including age, sex, and education. Importantly, indirect effects were found for BMI, hypertension, <i>APOE</i>‐ε4 status, age, and sex, where these factors predicted memory scores via their impact on temporal stem diffusion measures. There was also a dual effect of sex, with a direct effect indicating that females had better memory performance overall, and an indirect effect indicating that females with greater temporal stem diffusion had poorer memory performance. Results suggest that changes to the integrity of temporal white matter in aging may underpin reduced memory performance. These results highlight that accounting for variables that not only directly impact cognition, but also for those that indirectly impact cognition via structural brain changes, is crucial for understanding the impact of risk factors on cognition.</p>

<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Oxidative stress has been implicated in a variety of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Astrocytes play a significant role in maintaining survival of neurons by supplying antioxidants such as glutathione (GSH) to neurons. Recently, we found that noradrenaline increased the intracellular GSH concentration in astrocytes via β<sub>3</sub>‐adrenoceptor stimulation. These observations suggest that noradrenaline protects neurons from oxidative stress‐induced death by increasing the supply of GSH from astrocytes to neurons via the stimulation of β<sub>3</sub>‐adrenoceptor in astrocytes. In the present study, we examined the protective effect of noradrenaline against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>‐induced neurotoxicity using two different mixed cultures: the mixed culture of human astrocytoma U‐251 MG cells and human neuroblastoma SH‐SY5Y cells, and the mouse primary cerebrum mixed culture of neurons and astrocytes. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>‐induced neuronal cell death was significantly attenuated by pretreatment with noradrenaline in both mixed cultures but not in single culture of SH‐SY5Y cells or in mouse cerebrum neuron‐rich culture. The neuroprotective effect of noradrenaline was inhibited by SR59230A, a selective β<sub>3</sub>‐adrenoceptor antagonist, and CL316243, a selective β<sub>3</sub>‐adrenoceptor agonist, mimicked the neuroprotective effect of noradrenaline. DL‐buthionine‐[S,R]‐sulfoximine, a GSH synthesis inhibitor, negated the neuroprotective effect of noradrenaline in both mixed cultures. MK571, which inhibits the export of GSH from astrocytes mediated by multidrug resistance‐associated protein 1, also prevented the neuroprotective effect of noradrenaline. These results suggest that noradrenaline protects neurons against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>‐induced death by increasing the supply of GSH from astrocytes via β<sub>3</sub>‐adrenoceptor stimulation.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The effect of stress on animal behavior and brain activity has been attracting growing attention in the last decades. Stress dramatically affects several aspects of animal behavior, including motivation and cognitive functioning, and has been used to model human pathologies such as post‐traumatic stress disorder. A key question is whether stress alters the plastic potential of synaptic circuits. In this work, we evaluated if stress affects dopamine (DA)‐dependent synaptic plasticity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). On male adolescent rats, we characterized anxiety‐ and depressive‐like behaviors using behavioral testing before and after exposure to a mild stress (elevated platform, EP). After the behavioral protocols, we investigated DA‐dependent long‐term potentiation (DA‐LTP) and depression (DA‐LTD) on acute slices of mPFC and evaluated the activation of DA‐producing brain regions by western and dot blot analysis. We show that exposure to the EP stress enhances DA‐LTP and that desipramine (DMI) treatment abolishes this effect. We also found that DA‐LTD is not affected by EP stress unless when this is followed by DMI treatment. In addition, EP stress reduces anxiety, an effect abolished by both DMI and ketamine, while motivation is promoted by previous exposure to EP stress independently of pharmacological treatments. Finally, this form of stress reduces the expression of the early gene cFOS in the ventral tegmental area. These findings support the idea that mild stressors can promote synaptic plasticity in PFC through a dopaminergic mechanism, an effect that might increase the sensitivity of mPFC to subsequent stressful experiences.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Due to the discovery of Rett Syndrome (RTT) genetic mutations, animal models have been developed. Sleep research in RTT animal models may unravel novel neural mechanisms for this severe neurodevelopmental heritable rare disease. In this systematic literature review we summarize the findings on sleep research of 13 studies in animal models of RTT. We found disturbed efficacy and continuity of sleep in all genetically mutated models of mice, cynomolgus monkeys, and <i>Drosophila</i>. Models presented highly fragmented sleep with distinct differences in 24‐hr sleep/wake cyclicity and circadian arrhythmicity. Overall, animal models mimic sleep complaints reported in individuals with RTT. However, contrary to human studies, in mutant mice, attenuated sleep delta waves, and sleep apneas in non‐rapid eye movement sleep were reported. Future studies may focus on sleep structure and EEG alterations, potential central mechanisms involved in sleep fragmentation and the occurrence of sleep apnea across different sleep stages. Given that locomotor dysfunction is characteristic of individuals with RTT, studies may consider to integrate its potential impact on the behavioral analysis of sleep.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Stroke severely impairs quality of life and has a high mortality rate. On the other hand, dietary docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) prevents neuronal damage. In this review, we describe the effects of dietary DHA on ischemic stroke‐associated neuronal damage and its role in stroke prevention. Recent epidemiological studies have been conducted to analyze stroke prevention through DHA intake. The effects of dietary intake and supply of DHA to neuronal cells, DHA‐mediated inhibition of neuronal damage, and its mechanism, including the effects of the DHA metabolite, neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1), were investigated. These studies revealed that DHA intake was associated with a reduced risk of stroke. Moreover, studies have shown that DHA intake may reduce stroke mortality rates. DHA, which is abundant in fish oil, passes through the blood–brain barrier to accumulate as a constituent of phospholipids in the cell membranes of neuronal cells and astrocytes. Astrocytes supply DHA to neuronal cells, and neuronal DHA, in turn, activates Akt and Raf‐1 to prevent neuronal death or damage. Therefore, DHA indirectly prevents neuronal damage. Furthermore, NDP1 blocks neuronal apoptosis. DHA, together with NPD1, may block neuronal damage and prevent stroke. The inhibitory effect on neuronal damage is achieved through the antioxidant (via inducing the Nrf2/HO‐1 system) and anti‐inflammatory effects (via promoting JNK/AP‐1 signaling) of DHA.</p>

<p>Internal jugular vein compression, by means of an externally worn neck collar (right side of image), is a potentially viable solution to intervene on the diffusion and anisotropic properties of white matter that change following a season of American tackle football. </p>
<br />
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The purpose of this clinical trial was to examine whether internal jugular vein compression (JVC)—using an externally worn neck collar—modulated the relationships between differential head impact exposure levels and pre‐ to postseason changes in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)‐derived diffusivity and anisotropy metrics of white matter following a season of American tackle football. Male high‐school athletes (<i>n</i> = 284) were prospectively assigned to a non‐collar group or a collar group. Magnetic resonance imaging data were collected from participants pre‐ and postseason and head impact exposure was monitored by accelerometers during every practice and game throughout the competitive season. Athletes' accumulated head impact exposure was systematically thresholded based on the frequency of impacts of progressively higher magnitudes (10 g intervals between 20 to 150 g) and modeled with pre‐ to postseason changes in DTI measures of white matter as a function of JVC neck collar wear. The findings revealed that the JVC neck collar modulated the relationships between greater high‐magnitude head impact exposure (110 to 140 g) and longitudinal changes to white matter, with each group showing associations that varied in directionality. Results also revealed that the JVC neck collar group partially preserved longitudinal changes in DTI metrics. Collectively, these data indicate that a JVC neck collar can provide a mechanistic response to the diffusion and anisotropic properties of brain white matter following the highly diverse exposure to repetitive head impacts in American tackle football.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a heterogeneous inflammatory demyelinating disease. Iron distribution is altered in MS patients' brains, suggesting iron liberation within active lesions amplifies demyelination and neurodegeneration. Whether the amount and distribution of iron are similar or different among different MS immunopatterns is currently unknown.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used synchrotron X‐ray fluorescence imaging, histology, and immunohistochemistry to compare the iron quantity and distribution between immunopattern II and III early active MS lesions. We analyzed archival autopsy and biopsy tissue from 21 MS patients.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Immunopattern II early active lesions contain 64% more iron (95% confidence interval [CI] = 17–127%, <i>p</i> = 0.004) than immunopattern III lesions, and 30% more iron than the surrounding periplaque white matter (95% CI = 3–64%, <i>p</i> = 0.03). Iron in immunopattern III lesions is 28% lower than in the periplaque white matter (95% CI = −40 to −14%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). When normalizing the iron content of early active lesions to that of surrounding periplaque white matter, the ratio is significantly higher in immunopattern II (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Microfocused X‐ray fluorescence imaging shows that iron in immunopattern II lesions localizes to macrophages, whereas macrophages in immunopattern III lesions contain little iron.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Iron distribution and content are heterogeneous in early active MS lesions. Iron accumulates in macrophages in immunopattern II, but not immunopattern III lesions. This heterogeneity in the two most common MS immunopatterns may be explained by different macrophage polarization, origin, or different demyelination mechanisms, and paves the way for developing new or using existing iron‐sensitive magnetic resonance imaging techniques to differentiate among immunopatterns in the general nonbiopsied MS patient population.

<p>by Ali Khalilimeybodi, Alexander M. Paap, Steven L. M. Christiansen, Jeffrey J. Saucerman</p>

Cardiac hypertrophy is a context-dependent phenomenon wherein a myriad of biochemical and biomechanical factors regulate myocardial growth through a complex large-scale signaling network. Although numerous studies have investigated hypertrophic signaling pathways, less is known about hypertrophy signaling as a whole network and how this network acts in a context-dependent manner. Here, we developed a systematic approach, CLASSED (Context-specific Logic-bASed Signaling nEtwork Development), to revise a large-scale signaling model based on context-specific data and identify main reactions and new crosstalks regulating context-specific response. CLASSED involves four sequential stages with an automated validation module as a core which builds a logic-based ODE model from the interaction graph and outputs the model validation percent. The context-specific model is developed by estimation of default parameters, classified qualitative validation, hybrid Morris-Sobol global sensitivity analysis, and discovery of missing context-dependent crosstalks. Applying this pipeline to our prior-knowledge hypertrophy network with context-specific data revealed key signaling reactions which distinctly regulate cell response to isoproterenol, phenylephrine, angiotensin II and stretch. Furthermore, with CLASSED we developed a context-specific model of β-adrenergic cardiac hypertrophy. The model predicted new crosstalks between calcium/calmodulin-dependent pathways and upstream signaling of Ras in the ISO-specific context. Experiments in cardiomyocytes validated the model’s predictions on the role of CaMKII-Gβγ and CaN-Gβγ interactions in mediating hypertrophic signals in ISO-specific context and revealed a difference in the phosphorylation magnitude and translocation of ERK1/2 between cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts. CLASSED is a systematic approach for developing context-specific large-scale signaling networks, yielding insights into new-found crosstalks in β-adrenergic cardiac hypertrophy.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TlW4AIWo_BY" width="1" />

<p>by Scott Rich, Andreea O. Diaconescu, John D. Griffiths, Milad Lankarany</p>

The increased democratization of the creation, implementation, and attendance of academic conferences has been a serendipitous benefit of the movement toward virtual meetings. The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has accelerated the transition to online conferences and, in parallel, their democratization, by necessity. This manifests not just in the mitigation of barriers to attending traditional physical conferences but also in the presentation of new, and more importantly attainable, opportunities for young scientists to carve out a niche in the landscape of academic meetings. Here, we describe an early “proof of principle” of this democratizing power via our experience organizing the Canadian Computational Neuroscience Spotlight (CCNS; crowdcast.io/e/CCNS), a free 2-day virtual meeting that was built entirely amid the pandemic using only virtual tools. While our experience was unique considering the obstacles faced in creating a conference during a pandemic, this was not the only factor differentiating both our experience and the resulting meeting from other contemporary online conferences. Specifically, CCNS was crafted entirely by early career researchers (ECRs) without any sponsors or partners, advertised primarily using social media and “word of mouth,” and designed specifically to highlight and engage trainees. From this experience, we have distilled “10 simple rules” as a blueprint for the design of new virtual academic meetings, especially in the absence of institutional support or partnerships, in this unprecedented environment. By highlighting the lessons learned in implementing our meeting under these arduous circumstances, we hope to encourage other young scientists to embrace this challenge, which would serve as a critical next step in further democratizing academic meetings.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1ireKZLGZ0I" width="1" />

<p>by Jack E. Bowyer, Chloe Ding, Benjamin H. Weinberg, Wilson W. Wong, Declan G. Bates</p>

Boolean logic and arithmetic through DNA excision (BLADE) is a recently developed platform for implementing inducible and logical control over gene expression in mammalian cells, which has the potential to revolutionise cell engineering for therapeutic applications. This 2-input 2-output platform can implement 256 different logical circuits that exploit the specificity and stability of DNA recombination. Here, we develop the first mechanistic mathematical model of the 2-input BLADE platform based on Cre- and Flp-mediated DNA excision. After calibrating the model on experimental data from two circuits, we demonstrate close agreement between model outputs and data on the other 111 circuits that have so far been experimentally constructed using the 2-input BLADE platform. Model simulations of the remaining 143 circuits that have yet to be tested experimentally predict excellent performance of the 2-input BLADE platform across the range of possible circuits. Circuits from both the tested and untested subsets that perform less well consist of a disproportionally high number of STOP sequences. Model predictions suggested that circuit performance declines with a decrease in recombinase expression and new experimental data was generated that confirms this relationship.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HRamH5rpeLo" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Adult neurogenesis has been implicated in learning and memory of complex spatial environments. However, new neurons also play a role in nonmnemonic behavior, including the stress response and attention shifting. Many commonly used spatial tasks are very simple, and unsuitable for detecting neurogenesis effects, or are aversively motivated, making it difficult to dissociate effects on spatial learning and memory from effects on stress. We have therefore created a novel complex spatial environment, the flex maze, to enable reward‐mediated testing of spatial learning in a flexibly configurable labyrinth. Using a pharmacogenetic method to completely inhibit neurogenesis in adulthood, we found that rats lacking new neurons (TK rats) and wild type controls completed and remembered most mazes equally well. However, control rats were slower to complete peppermint‐scented mazes than other mazes, while neurogenesis‐deficient rats showed no effect of mint on maze behavior, completing these mazes significantly faster than control rats. Additional testing found that wild type and TK rats showed similar detection of, avoidance of, and glucocorticoid response to the mint odor. These results suggest that spatial learning and memory in a labyrinth task is unaffected by the loss of new neurons, but that these cells affect the ability of an aversive stimulus to distract rats from completing the maze.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Place and grid cells in the hippocampal formation are commonly thought to support a unified and coherent cognitive map of space. This mapping mechanism faces a challenge when a navigator is placed in a familiar environment that has been deformed from its original shape. Under such circumstances, many transformations could plausibly serve to map a navigator's familiar cognitive map to the deformed space. Previous empirical results indicate that the firing fields of rodent place and grid cells stretch or compress in a manner that approximately matches the environmental deformation, and human spatial memory exhibits similar distortions. These effects have been interpreted as evidence that reshaping a familiar environment elicits an analogously reshaped cognitive map. However, recent work has suggested an alternative explanation, whereby deformation‐induced distortions of the grid code are attributable to a mechanism that dynamically anchors grid fields to the most recently experienced boundary, thus causing history‐dependent shifts in grid phase. This interpretation raises the possibility that human spatial memory will exhibit similar history‐dependent dynamics. To test this prediction, we taught participants the locations of objects in a virtual environment and then probed their memory for these locations in deformed versions of this environment. Across three experiments with variable access to visual and vestibular cues, we observed the predicted pattern, whereby the remembered locations of objects were shifted from trial to trial depending on the boundary of origin of the participant's movement trajectory. These results provide evidence for a dynamic anchoring mechanism that governs both neuronal firing and spatial memory.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus is known to play a critical role in a variety of complex abilities, including visual‐spatial reasoning, social functioning, and math. Nonverbal learning disability (NVLD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in visual‐spatial reasoning that are accompanied by impairment in social function or mathematics, as well as motor or executive function skills. Despite the overlap between behaviors supported by the hippocampus and impairments in NVLD, the structure and function of the hippocampus in NVLD has not been studied. To address this gap in the literature, we first compared hippocampal volume and resting‐state functional connectivity in children with NVLD (<i>n</i> = 24) and typically developing (TD) children (<i>n</i> = 20). We then explored associations between hippocampal structure, connectivity, and performance on measures of spatial, social, and mathematical ability. Relative to TD children, those with NVLD showed significant reductions in left hippocampal volume and greater hippocampal‐cerebellar connectivity. In children with NVLD, reduced hippocampal volume associated with worse mathematical problem solving. Although children with NVLD exhibited more social problems (social responsiveness scale [SRS]) and higher hippocampal‐cerebellar connectivity relative to TD children, greater connectivity was associated with fewer social problems among children with NVLD but not TD children. Such an effect may suggest a compensatory mechanism. These structural and functional alterations of the hippocampus may disrupt its putative role in organizing conceptual frameworks through cognitive mapping, thus contributing to the cross‐domain difficulties that characterize NVLD.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Alcohol withdrawal directly impacts the brain's stress and memory systems, which may underlie individual susceptibility to persistent drug and alcohol‐seeking behaviors. Numerous studies demonstrate that forced alcohol abstinence, which may lead to withdrawal, can impair fear‐related memory processes in rodents such as extinction learning; however, the underlying neural circuits mediating these impairments remain elusive. Here, we tested an optogenetic strategy aimed at mitigating fear extinction retrieval impairments in male c57BL/6 mice following exposure to alcohol (i.e., ethanol) and forced abstinence. In the first experiment, extensive behavioral extinction training in a fear‐conditioned context was impaired in ethanol‐exposed mice compared to controls. In the second experiment, neuronal ensembles processing a contextual fear memory in the dorsal hippocampus were tagged and optogenetically reactivated repeatedly in a distinct context in ethanol‐exposed and control mice. Chronic activation of these cells resulted in a context‐specific, extinction‐like reduction in fear responses in both control and ethanol‐exposed mice. These findings suggest that while ethanol can impair the retrieval an extinction memory, optogenetic manipulation of a fear engram is sufficient to induce an extinction‐like reduction in fear responses.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In rodents, gene‐expression, neuronal tuning, connectivity and neurogenesis studies have postulated that the dorsal, the intermediate and the ventral hippocampal formation (HF) are distinct entities. These findings are underpinned by behavioral studies showing a dissociable role of dorsal and ventral HF in learning, memory, stress and emotional processing. However, up to now, the molecular basis of such differences in relation to discrete boundaries is largely unknown. Therefore, we analyzed binding site densities for glutamatergic AMPA, NMDA, kainate and mGluR<sub>2/3</sub>, GABAergic GABA<sub>A</sub> (including benzodiazepine binding sites), GABA<sub>B</sub>, dopaminergic D<sub>1/5</sub> and noradrenergic α<sub>1</sub> and α<sub>2</sub> receptors as key modulators for signal transmission in hippocampal functions, using quantitative in vitro receptor autoradiography along the dorsal‐ventral axis of the mouse HF. Beside general different receptor profiles of the dentate gyrus (DG) and Cornu Ammonis fields (CA1, CA2, CA3, CA4/hilus), we detected substantial differences between dorsal, intermediate and ventral subdivisions and individual layers for all investigated receptor types, except GABA<sub>B</sub>. For example, striking higher densities of α<sub>2</sub> receptors were detected in the ventral DG, while the dorsal DG possesses higher numbers of kainate, NMDA, GABA<sub>A</sub> and D<sub>1/5</sub> receptors. CA1 dorsal and intermediate subdivisions showed higher AMPA, NMDA, mGluR<sub>2/3</sub>, GABA<sub>A</sub>, D<sub>1/5</sub> receptors, while kainate receptors are higher expressed in ventral CA1, and noradrenergic α<sub>1</sub> and α<sub>2</sub> receptors in the intermediate region of CA1. CA2 dorsal was distinguished by higher kainate, α<sub>1</sub> and α<sub>2</sub> receptors in the intermediate region, while CA3 showed a more complex dissociation. Our findings resulted not only in a clear segmentation of the mouse hippocampus along the dorsal‐ventral axis, but also provides insights into the neurochemical basis and likely associated physiological processes in hippocampal functions. Therein, the presented data has a high impact for future studies modeling and investigating dorsal, intermediate and ventral hippocampal dysfunction in relation to neurodegenerative diseases or psychiatric disorders.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Space and time are both essential features of episodic memory, for which the hippocampus is critical (Howard &amp; Eichenbaum, 2015). Spatial tasks have been used effectively to study the behavioral relevance of place cells. However, the behavioral paradigms utilized for the study of time cells have not used time duration as a variable that animals need to be aware of to solve the task. Therefore, the behavioral relevance of this cell firing is unclear. In order to directly study the role of the hippocampus in processing elapsed time, we created a novel time duration discrimination task. Rats learned to make a decision to turn left or right depending on the preceding tone duration (10 s, left turn; 20 s, right turn). Once the rats reached criterion performance of 90% correct on two out of three consecutive days, they received either an excitotoxic hippocampal lesion or a sham‐lesion surgery. After recovery, rats were tested to determine hippocampal involvement in discriminating time duration. Rats with hippocampal lesions performed at chance level on their first testing day postlesion, and they were impaired relative to the sham‐lesioned rats. Although the hippocampal‐lesioned rats began discriminating at above chance level, their performance never returned to criterion even with 50 days of postoperative testing. Furthermore, while sham rats showed no difference in the number of errors they made on 10‐ versus 20‐s delay trials, hippocampal lesion rats similarly improved their performance under the 10‐s delay condition, but not under the 20‐s delay condition. Results indicate that hippocampal lesions resulted in a selective impairment in discriminating elapsed time only during the longer delay trials. The implications of these results are discussed in relation to the limits of working‐memory capacity and to the role of sustained hippocampal time cell activity in memory performance depending on the perceived relevance of the delay period.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Replicas of an aspect of an experienced event can serve as effective reminders, yet little is known about the neural basis of such reminding effects. Here we examined the neural activity underlying the memory‐enhancing effect of reminders 1 week after encoding of naturalistic film clip events. We used fMRI to determine differences in network activity associated with recently reactivated memories relative to comparably aged, non‐reactivated memories. Reminders were effective in facilitating overall retrieval of memory for film clips, in an all‐or‐none fashion. Prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were activated during both reminders and retrieval. Peak activation in ventro‐lateral prefrontal cortex (vPFC) preceded peak activation in the right hippocampus during the reminders. For film clips that were successfully retrieved after 7 days, pre‐retrieval reminders did not enhance the quality of the retrieved memory or the number of details retrieved, nor did they more strongly engage regions of the recollection network than did successful retrieval of a non‐reminded film clip. These results suggest that reminders prior to retrieval are an effective means of boosting retrieval of otherwise inaccessible episodic events, and that the inability to recall certain events after a delay of a week largely reflects a retrieval deficit, rather than a storage deficit for this information. The results extend other evidence that vPFC drives activation of the hippocampus to facilitate memory retrieval and scene construction, and show that this facilitation also occurs when reminder cues precede successful retrieval attempts. The time course of vPFC‐hippocampal activity during the reminder suggests that reminders may first engage schematic information meditated by vPFC followed by a recollection process mediated by the hippocampus.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Hippocampal circuit alterations that differentially affect hippocampal subfields are associated with age‐related memory decline. Additionally, functional organization along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus has revealed distinctions between anterior and posterior (A‐P) connectivity. Here, we examined the functional connectivity (FC) differences between young and older adults at high‐resolution within the medial temporal lobe network (entorhinal, perirhinal, and parahippocampal cortices), allowing us to explore how hippocampal subfield connectivity across the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus changes with age. Overall, we found reliably greater connectivity for younger adults than older adults between the hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex (PHC) and perirhinal cortex (PRC). This drop in functional connectivity was more pronounced in the anterior regions of the hippocampus than the posterior ones, consistent for each of the hippocampal subfields. Further, intra‐hippocampal connectivity also reflected an age‐related decrease in functional connectivity within the anterior hippocampus in older adults that was offset by an increase in posterior hippocampal functional connectivity. Interestingly, the anterior–posterior dysfunction in older adults between hippocampus and PHC was predictive of lure discrimination performance on the Mnemonic similarity task (MST), suggesting a role in memory performance. While age‐related dysfunction within the hippocampal subfields has been well‐documented, these results suggest that the age‐related dysfunction in hippocampal connectivity across the longitudinal axis may also contribute significantly to memory decline in older adults.</p>

<p>The structural features of a synapse help determine its function. Synapses are extremely small and tightly packed with vesicles and other organelles. Visualizing synaptic structure requires imaging by electron microscopy, and the features in micrographs must be quantified, a process called morphometry. Three parameters are typically assessed from each specimen: (1) the sizes of individual vesicles and organelles; (2) the absolute number and densities of organelles; and (3) distances between organelles and key features at synapses, such as active zone membranes and dense projections. For data to be meaningful, the analysis must be repeated from hundreds to thousands of images from several biological replicates, a daunting task. Here we report a custom computer program to analyze key structural features of synapses: SynapsEM. In short, we developed ImageJ/Fiji macros to record x,y-coordinates of segmented structures. The coordinates are then exported as text files. Independent investigators can reload the images and text files to reexamine the segmentation using ImageJ. The Matlab program then calculates and reports key synaptic parameters from the coordinates. Since the values are calculated from coordinates, rather than measured from each micrograph, other parameters such as locations of docked vesicles relative to the center of an active zone can be extracted in Matlab by additional scripting. Thus, this program can accelerate the morphometry of synapses and promote a more comprehensive analysis of synaptic ultrastructure.</p>

<p>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the leading monogenetic cause of autism spectrum disorder and inherited cause of intellectual disability that affects approximately one in 7,000 males and one in 11,000 females. In FXS, the Fmr1 gene is silenced and prevents the expression of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) that directly targets mRNA transcripts of multiple GABA<sub>A</sub> subunits. Therefore, FMRP loss adversely impacts the neuronal firing of the GABAergic system which creates an imbalance in the excitatory/inhibitory ratio within the brain. Current FXS treatment strategies focus on curing symptoms, such as anxiety or decreased social function. While treating symptoms can be helpful, incorporating non-invasive imaging to evaluate how treatments change the brain’s biology may explain what molecular aberrations are associated with disease pathology. Thus, the GABAergic system is suitable to explore developing novel therapeutic strategies for FXS. To understand how the GABAergic system may be affected by this loss-of-function mutation, GABA concentrations were examined within the frontal cortex and thalamus of 5-day-old wild type and Fmr1 knockout mice using both <sup>1</sup>H magnetic resonance imaging (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Our objective was to develop a reliable scanning method for neonatal mice in vivo and evaluate whether <sup>1</sup>H-MRS is suitable to capture regional GABA concentration differences at the front end of the critical cortical period where abnormal neurodevelopment occurs due to FMRP loss is first detected. <sup>1</sup>H-MRS quantified GABA concentrations in both frontal cortex and thalamus of wild type and Fmr1 knockout mice. To substantiate the results of our <sup>1</sup>H-MRS studies, in vitro LC-MS/MS was also performed on brain homogenates from age-matched mice. We found significant changes in GABA concentration between the frontal cortex and thalamus within each mouse from both wild type and Fmr1 knockout mice using <sup>1</sup>H-MRS and LC-MS/MS. Significant GABA levels were also detected in these same regions between wild type and Fmr1 knockout mice by LC-MS/MS, validating that FMRP loss directly affects the GABAergic system. Thus, these new findings support the need to develop an effective non-invasive imaging method to monitor novel GABAergic strategies aimed at treating patients with FXS.</p>

<p>Vision impairment and blindness in humans are most frequently caused by the degeneration and loss of photoreceptor cells in the outer retina, as is the case for age-related macular degeneration, retinitis pigmentosa, retinal detachment and many other diseases. While inner retinal neurons survive degeneration, they undergo fundamental pathophysiological changes, collectively known as “remodeling.” Inner retinal remodeling downstream to photoreceptor death occurs across mammalian retinas from mice to humans, independently of the cause of degeneration. It results in pervasive spontaneous hyperactivity and membrane hyperpermeability in retinal ganglion cells, which funnel all retinal signals to the brain. Remodeling reduces light detection in vision-impaired patients and precludes meaningful vision restoration in blind individuals. In this review, we summarize current hypotheses proposed to explain remodeling and their potential medical significance highlighting the important role played by retinoic acid and its receptor.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.617513">Role of NDE1 in the Development and Evolution of the Gyrified Cortex</a></h4>

<p>An expanded cortex is a hallmark of human neurodevelopment and endows increased cognitive capabilities. Recent work has shown that the cell cycle-related gene NDE1 is essential for proper cortical development. Patients who have mutations in NDE1 exhibit congenital microcephaly as a primary phenotype. At the cellular level, NDE1 is essential for interkinetic nuclear migration and mitosis of radial glial cells, which translates to an indispensable role in neurodevelopment. The nuclear migration function of NDE1 is well conserved across Opisthokonta. In mammals, multiple isoforms containing alternate terminal exons, which influence the functionality of NDE1, have been reported. It has been noted that the pattern of terminal exon usage mirrors patterns of cortical complexity in mammals. To provide context to these findings, here, we provide a comprehensive review of the literature regarding NDE1, its molecular biology and physiological relevance at the cellular and organismal levels. In particular, we outline the potential roles of NDE1 in progenitor cell behavior and explore the spectrum of NDE1 pathogenic variants. Moreover, we assessed the evolutionary conservation of NDE1 and interrogated whether the usage of alternative terminal exons is characteristic of species with gyrencephalic cortices. We found that gyrencephalic species are more likely to express transcripts that use the human-associated terminal exon, whereas lissencephalic species tend to express transcripts that use the mouse-associated terminal exon. Among gyrencephalic species, the human-associated terminal exon was preferentially expressed by those with a high order of gyrification. These findings underscore phylogenetic relationships between the preferential usage of NDE1 terminal exon and high-order gyrification, which provide insight into cortical evolution underlying high-order brain functions.</p>

<p>The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) is usually based on clinical symptoms and signs of damage to the central nervous system, which is assessed using magnetic resonance imaging. The correct interpretation of these data requires excellent clinical expertise and experience. Deep neural networks aim to assist clinicians in identifying MS using imaging data. However, before such networks can be integrated into clinical workflow, it is crucial to understand their classification strategy. In this study, we propose to use a convolutional neural network to identify MS patients in combination with attribution algorithms to investigate the classification decisions. The network was trained using images acquired with susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI), which is known to be sensitive to the presence of paramagnetic iron components and is routinely applied in imaging protocols for MS patients. Different attribution algorithms were used to the trained network resulting in heatmaps visualizing the contribution of each input voxel to the classification decision. Based on the quantitative image perturbation method, we selected DeepLIFT heatmaps for further investigation. Single-subject analysis revealed veins and adjacent voxels as signs for MS, while the population-based study revealed relevant brain areas common to most subjects in a class. This pattern was found to be stable across different echo times and also for a multi-echo trained network. Intensity analysis of the relevant voxels revealed a group difference, which was found to be primarily based on the T1w magnitude images, which are part of the SWI calculation. This difference was not observed in the phase mask data.</p>

<p>Alzheimer disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by extracellular accumulation of amyloid-beta and formation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. Microglia activation and neuroinflammation play important roles in the pathogenesis of AD; Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)—a key component of the innate immune system—in microglia is also thought to be involved based on the observed association between TLR gene polymorphisms and AD risk. TLR4 has been shown to exert both detrimental and beneficial effects on AD-related pathologies. In preclinical models, experimental manipulations targeting TLR4 were shown to improve learning and memory, which was related to inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine release and reduction of oxidative stress. In this review, we summarize the key evidence supporting TLR4 as a promising therapeutic target in AD treatment.</p>

<p>Prefrontal cortex (PFC) asymmetry is an important marker in affective neuroscience and has attracted significant interest, having been associated with studies of motivation, eating behavior, empathy, risk propensity, and clinical depression. The data presented in this paper are the result of three different experiments using PFC asymmetry neurofeedback (NF) as a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) paradigm, rather than a therapeutic mechanism aiming at long-term effects, using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) which is known to be particularly well-suited to the study of PFC asymmetry and is less sensitive to artifacts. From an experimental perspective the BCI context brings more emphasis on individual subjects' baselines, successful and sustained activation during epochs, and minimal training. The subject pool is also drawn from the general population, with less bias toward specific behavioral patterns, and no inclusion of any patient data. We accompany our datasets with a detailed description of data formats, experiment and protocol designs, as well as analysis of the individualized metrics for definitions of success scores based on baseline thresholds as well as reference tasks. The work presented in this paper is the result of several experiments in the domain of BCI where participants are interacting with continuous visual feedback following a real-time NF paradigm, arising from our long-standing research in the field of affective computing. We offer the community access to our fNIRS datasets from these experiments. We specifically provide data drawn from our empirical studies in the field of affective interactions with computer-generated narratives as well as interfacing with algorithms, such as heuristic search, which all provide a mechanism to improve the ability of the participants to engage in active BCI due to their realistic visual feedback. Beyond providing details of the methodologies used where participants received real-time NF of left-asymmetric increase in activation in their dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), we re-establish the need for carefully designing protocols to ensure the benefits of NF paradigm in BCI are enhanced by the ability of the real-time visual feedback to adapt to the individual responses of the participants. Individualized feedback is paramount to the success of NF in BCIs.</p>

Background<p>Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a form of long-lasting neuropathic pain that can severely affect patients’ quality of life. Pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) has been proven to be effective in treating PHN, but the optimal radiofrequency parameters are still not well defined. This retrospective study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of CT-guided PRF at three different voltages for the treatment of PHN patients.</p>Methods<p>This study included 109 patients with PHN involving the thoracic dermatome who were treated in the Department of Pain Management of Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, from January 2017 to May 2019. They were divided into three groups based on the PRF voltage used: group A (45 V), group B (55 V), and group C (65 V). The PRF therapy (voltage 45, 55, and 65 V) was performed in all patients by targeting the thoracic dorsal root ganglion. After surgery, patients were followed at 3 days, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. Observation at each follow-up included basic patient characteristics, visual analog scale (VAS), 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) scores, patient satisfaction, complications, and side effects.</p>Results<p>Visual analog scale scores decreased and SF-36 scores increased for all patients in the three groups at each post-operative time point (1, 3, 6, and 12 months; all P &lt; 0.01). Pain relief, improvement in quality of life, and overall satisfaction were more significant for patients in group C than for those in groups A and B at the 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups (all P &lt; 0.05). Patients in group B had lower VAS scores and higher overall satisfaction levels than those in group A (both P &lt; 0.01). A small number of patients from each group (n ≤ 3) experienced mild intraoperative and post-operative complications, which bore no relationship with group assignment (all P &gt; 0.05). At post-operative day 3, patients in group C had skin numbness affecting a larger area than patients in the other two groups (both P &lt; 0.05), but the differences were no longer statistically significant at day 30 after the operation. All patients experienced a drop in numbness area of more than 30% after surgery.</p>Conclusion<p>Compared with PFR at 45 and 55 V, PFR at 65 V had superior efficacy in treating PNH, with a favorable safety profile.</p>

<p>Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are systems that allow users to control devices using brain activity alone. However, the ability of participants to command BCIs varies from subject to subject. About 20% of potential users of sensorimotor BCIs do not gain reliable control of the system. The inefficiency to decode user's intentions requires the identification of neurophysiological factors determining “good” and “poor” BCI performers. One of the important neurophysiological aspects in BCI research is that the neuronal oscillations, used to control these systems, show a rich repertoire of spatial sensorimotor interactions. Considering this, we hypothesized that neuronal connectivity in sensorimotor areas would define BCI performance. Analyses for this study were performed on a large dataset of 80 inexperienced participants. They took part in a calibration and an online feedback session recorded on the same day. Undirected functional connectivity was computed over sensorimotor areas by means of the imaginary part of coherency. The results show that post- as well as pre-stimulus connectivity in the calibration recording is significantly correlated to online feedback performance in μ and feedback frequency bands. Importantly, the significance of the correlation between connectivity and BCI feedback accuracy was not due to the signal-to-noise ratio of the oscillations in the corresponding post and pre-stimulus intervals. Thus, this study demonstrates that BCI performance is not only dependent on the amplitude of sensorimotor oscillations as shown previously, but that it also relates to sensorimotor connectivity measured during the preceding training session. The presence of such connectivity between motor and somatosensory systems is likely to facilitate motor imagery, which in turn is associated with the generation of a more pronounced modulation of sensorimotor oscillations (manifested in ERD/ERS) required for the adequate BCI performance. We also discuss strategies for the up-regulation of such connectivity in order to enhance BCI performance.</p>

<p>Findings suggest a positive impact of bilingualism on cognition, including the later onset of dementia. However, it is not clear to what extent these effects are influenced by variations in attentional control demands in response to specific task requirements. In this study, 20 bilingual and 20 monolingual older adults performed a task-switching task under explicit task-cuing vs. memory-based switching conditions. In the cued condition, task switches occurred in random order and a visual cue signaled the next task to be performed. In the memory-based condition, the task alternated after every second trial in a predictable sequence without presenting a cue. The performance of bilinguals did not vary across experimental conditions, whereas monolinguals experienced a pronounced increase in response latencies and error rates in the cued condition. Both groups produced similar switch costs (difference in performance on switch trials as opposed to repeating trials within the mixed-task block) and mixing costs (difference in performance on repeat trials of a mixed-task block as opposed to trials of a single-task block), but bilinguals produced them with lower response latencies. The cognitive benefits of bilingualism seem not to apply to executive functions per se but to affect specific cognitive processes that involve task-relevant context processing. The present results suggest that lifelong bilingualism could promote in older adults a flexible adjustment to environmental cues, but only with increased task demands. However, due to the small sample size, the results should be interpreted with caution.</p>

Background<p>To probe the functional role of brain oscillations, transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has proven to be a useful neuroscientific tool. Because of the excessive tACS-caused artifact at the stimulation frequency in electroencephalography (EEG) signals, tACS + EEG studies have been mostly limited to compare brain activity between recordings before and after concurrent tACS. Critically, attempts to suppress the artifact in the data cannot assure that the entire artifact is removed while brain activity is preserved.

<p>Brain pericytes reside on the abluminal surface of capillaries, and their processes cover ~90% of the length of the capillary bed. These cells were first described almost 150 years ago (Eberth, 1871; Rouget, 1873) and have been the subject of intense experimental scrutiny in recent years, but their physiological roles remain uncertain and little is known of the complement of signaling elements that they employ to carry out their functions. In this review, we synthesize functional data with single-cell RNAseq screens to explore the ion channel and G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) toolkit of mesh and thin-strand pericytes of the brain, with the aim of providing a framework for deeper explorations of the molecular mechanisms that govern pericyte physiology. We argue that their complement of channels and receptors ideally positions capillary pericytes to play a central role in adapting blood flow to meet the challenge of satisfying neuronal energy requirements from deep within the capillary bed, by enabling dynamic regulation of their membrane potential to influence the electrical output of the cell. In particular, we outline how genetic and functional evidence suggest an important role for G<sub>s</sub>-coupled GPCRs and ATP-sensitive potassium (K<sub>ATP</sub>) channels in this context. We put forth a predictive model for long-range hyperpolarizing electrical signaling from pericytes to upstream arterioles, and detail the TRP and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and G<sub>q</sub>, G<sub>i/o</sub>, and G<sub>12/13</sub> signaling processes that counterbalance this. We underscore critical questions that need to be addressed to further advance our understanding of the signaling topology of capillary pericytes, and how this contributes to their physiological roles and their dysfunction in disease.</p>

<p>Motherhood entails changes in behavior with increased motivation for pups, induced in part by pregnancy hormones acting upon the brain. This work explores whether this alters sensory processing of pup-derived chemosignals. To do so, we analyse the expression of immediate early genes (IEGs) in the vomeronasal organ (VNO; Egr1) and centers of the olfactory and vomeronasal brain pathways (cFos) in virgin and late-pregnant females exposed to pups, as compared to buttons (socially neutral control). In pup-exposed females, we quantified diverse behaviors including pup retrieval, sniffing, pup-directed attack, nest building and time in nest or on nest, as well as time off nest. Pups induce Egr1 expression in the VNO of females, irrespective of their physiological condition, thus suggesting the existence of VNO-detected pup chemosignals. A similar situation is found in the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) and posteromedial part of the medial bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTMPM). By contrast, in the medial amygdala and posteromedial cortical amygdala (PMCo), responses to pups-vs-buttons are different in virgin and late-pregnant females, thus suggesting altered sensory processing during late pregnancy. The olfactory system also shows changes in sensory processing with pregnancy. In the main olfactory bulbs, as well as the anterior and posterior piriform cortex, buttons activate cFos expression in virgins more than in pregnant females. By contrast, in the anterior and especially posterior piriform cortex, pregnant females show more activation by pups than buttons. Correlation between IEGs expression and behavior suggests the existence of two vomeronasal subsystems: one associated to pup care (with PMCo as its main center) and another related to pup-directed aggression observed in some pregnant females (with the BSTMPM as the main nucleus). Our data also suggest a coactivation of the olfactory and vomeronasal systems during interaction with pups in pregnant females.</p>

<p>The prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)—a type of neurodevelopmental disorder—is increasing and is around 2% in North America, Asia, and Europe. Besides the known genetic link, environmental, epigenetic, and metabolic factors have been implicated in ASD etiology. Although highly heterogeneous at the behavioral level, ASD comprises a set of core symptoms including impaired communication and social interaction skills as well as stereotyped and repetitive behaviors. This has led to the suggestion that a large part of the ASD phenotype is caused by changes in a few and common set of signaling pathways, the identification of which is a fundamental aim of autism research. Using advanced bioinformatics tools and the abundantly available genetic data, it is possible to classify the large number of ASD-associated genes according to cellular function and pathways. Cellular processes known to be impaired in ASD include gene regulation, synaptic transmission affecting the excitation/inhibition balance, neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, development of short-/long-range connectivity (circuits and networks), and mitochondrial function. Such alterations often occur during early postnatal neurodevelopment. Among the neurons most affected in ASD as well as in schizophrenia are those expressing the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein parvalbumin (PV). These mainly inhibitory interneurons present in many different brain regions in humans and rodents are characterized by rapid, non-adaptive firing and have a high energy requirement. PV expression is often reduced at both messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels in human ASD brain samples and mouse ASD (and schizophrenia) models. Although the human PVALB gene is not a high-ranking susceptibility/risk gene for either disorder and is currently only listed in the SFARI Gene Archive, we propose and present supporting evidence for the Parvalbumin Hypothesis, which posits that decreased PV level is causally related to the etiology of ASD (and possibly schizophrenia).</p>

<p>Introduction of new imaging modalities for the equine brain have refocused attention on the horse as a natural model for ethological, neuroanatomical, and neuroscientific investigations. As opposed to imaging studies, strategies for equine neurodissection still lack a structured approach, standardization and reproducibility. In contrast to other species, where adapted protocols for sampling have been published, no comparable guideline is currently available for equids. Hence, we developed a species-specific slice protocol for whole brain vs. hemispheric dissection and tested its applicability and practicability in the field, as well as its neuroanatomical accuracy and reproducibility. Dissection steps are concisely described and depicted by schematic illustrations, photographs and instructional videos. Care was taken to show the brain in relation to the raters' hands, cutting devices and bench surface. Guidance is based on a minimum of external anatomical landmarks followed by geometric instructions that led to procurement of 14 targeted slabs. The protocol was performed on 55 formalin-fixed brains by three groups of investigators with different neuroanatomical skills. Validation of brain dissection outcomes addressed the aptitude of slabs for neuroanatomical studies as opposed to simplified routine diagnostic purposes. Across all raters, as much as 95.2% of slabs were appropriate for neuroanatomical studies, and 100% of slabs qualified for a routine diagnostic setting. Neither autolysis nor subfixation significantly affected neuroanatomical accuracy score, while a significant negative effect was observed with brain extraction artifacts. Procedure times ranged from 14 to 66 min and reached a mean duration of 23.25 ± 7.93 min in the last of five trials in inexperienced raters vs. 16 ± 2.83 min in experts, while acceleration of the dissection did not negatively impact neuroanatomical accuracy. This protocol, derived analogously to the consensus report of the International Veterinary Epilepsy Task Force in dogs and cats, allows for systematic, quick and easy dissection of the equine brain, even for inexperienced investigators. Obtained slabs feature virtually all functional subcompartments at suitable planes for both diagnostic and neuroscientific investigations and complement the data obtained from imaging studies. The instructive protocol and brain dissection videos are available in Supplementary Material.</p>

<p>Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have recently been discovered as a novel type of endogenous non-coding RNA that may regulate gene expression in mammals. In the central nervous system (CNS), circRNAs are relevant to many neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we attempted to identify an aberrant circRNA, hsa_circ_0003391, which is significantly downregulated in the peripheral blood of patients with AD, and to explore the relationship between hsa_circ_0003391 and the clinical manifestation of AD. The expression of hsa_circ_0003391 had a specific decrease in the peripheral blood of patients with AD compared to those with other types of dementia. To evaluate the potential diagnostic value of the circRNA, we performed a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The area under the curve (AUC) value was 0.7283 for hsa_circ_0003391, which was statistically significant. The natural form of hsa_circ_0003391 in the peripheral blood was a loop structure with good stability. We found a potential correlation between the expression of hsa_circ_0003391 and the clinical manifestations of AD. Bioinformatic analysis was carried out to predict the latent target microRNAs (miRNA) of hsa_circ_0003391. Furthermore, microRNAs targeted by hsa_circ_0003391 were successfully detected, and miR-574-5p had an expected elevation in the AD groups, suggesting that miR-574-5p might be a potential microRNA target for hsa_circ_0003391. Our results suggest that the downregulation of hsa_circ_0003391 in the peripheral blood has a potential relationship with AD. Our findings not only provide an important latent biomarker but also highlight an important perspective for the following study into AD pathogenesis. This may promote the process of novel therapeutics targeting non-coding RNA.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to describe clinical features, [<sup>18</sup>F]‐fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)‐positron emission tomography (PET) metabolism and digital pathology in patients with logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA) and pathologic diagnosis of diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD) and compare to patients with LPA with other pathologies, as well as patients with classical features of probable dementia with Lewy bodies (pDLB).</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This is a clinicopathologic case‐control study of 45 patients, including 20 prospectively recruited patients with LPA among whom 6 were diagnosed with LPA‐DLBD. We analyzed clinical features and compared FDG‐PET metabolism in LPA‐DLBD to an independent group of patients with clinical pDLB and regional α‐synuclein burden on digital pathology to a second independent group of autopsied patients with DLBD pathology and antemortem pDLB (DLB‐DLBD).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>All patients with LPA‐DLBD were men. Neurological, speech, and neuropsychological characteristics were similar across LPA‐DLBD, LPA‐Alzheimer's disease (LPA‐AD), and LPA‐frontotemporal lobar degeneration (LPA‐FTLD). Genetic screening of AD, DLBD, and FTLD linked genes were negative with the exception of <i>APOE ε4</i> allele present in 83% of LPA‐DLBD patients. Seventy‐five percent of the patients with LPA‐DLBD showed a parietal‐dominant pattern of hy pometabolism; LPA‐FTLD – temporal‐dominant pattern, whereas LPA‐AD showed heterogeneous patterns of hypometabolism. LPA‐DLBD had more asymmetrical hypometabolism affecting frontal lobes, with relatively spared occipital lobe in the nondominantly affected hemisphere, compared to pDLB. LPA‐DLBD had minimal atrophy on gross brain examination, higher cortical Lewy body counts, and higher α‐synuclein burden in the middle frontal and inferior parietal cortices compared to DLB‐DLBD.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Whereas AD is the most frequent underlying pathology of LPA, DLBD can also be present and may contribute to the LPA phenotype possibly due to α‐synuclein‐associated functional impairment of the dominant parietal lobe. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Severe complications of SARS‐CoV‐2 include arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) in adults and pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome. Whether stroke is a frequent complication of pediatric SARS‐CoV‐2 is unknown. This study aimed to determine the proportion of pediatric SARS‐CoV‐2 cases with ischemic stroke and the proportion of pediatric strokes with SARS‐CoV‐2 in the first three months of the pandemic in an international cohort.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We surveyed 61 international sites with pediatric stroke expertise. Survey questions included: numbers of hospitalized pediatric (≤18 years) SARS‐CoV‐2 patients; numbers of incident neonatal and childhood ischemic strokes; frequency of SARS‐CoV‐2 testing for pediatric stroke patients; and numbers of stroke cases positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 March 1–May 31, 2020.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 42 centers with SAR‐CoV‐2 hospitalization numbers, 8/971 (0.82%) with SARS‐CoV‐2 had ischemic strokes. Proportions of stroke cases positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 from March–May 2020 were: 1/108 neonatal AIS (0.9%), 0/33 neonatal cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (CSVT; 0%), 6/166 childhood AIS (3.6%), and 1/54 childhood CSVT (1.9%) cases. However, only 30.5% of neonates and 60% of children with strokes were tested for SARS‐CoV‐2. Therefore, these proportions represent 2.9%, 0%, 6.1%, and 3.0% of stroke cases tested for SARS‐CoV‐2. Seven of eight with SARS‐CoV‐2 had additional established stroke risk factors.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>As in adults, pediatric stroke is an infrequent complication of SARS‐CoV‐2, and SARS‐CoV‐2 was detected in only 4.7% of pediatric ischemic stroke patients tested. However, &lt;50% of strokes were tested. SARS‐CoV‐2 testing should be considered in pediatric stroke patients as the pandemic continues to determine SARS‐CoV‐2’s role in pediatric stroke.</p>

Reverse transcription, an essential event in the HIV-1 life cycle, requires deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) to fuel DNA synthesis, thus requiring penetration of dNTPs into the viral capsid. The central cavity of the capsid protein (CA) hexamer reveals itself as a plausible channel that allows the passage of dNTPs into assembled capsids. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism of nucleotide import into the capsid remains unknown. Employing all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we established that cooperative binding between nucleotides inside a CA hexamer cavity results in energetically favorable conditions for passive translocation of dNTPs into the HIV-1 capsid. Furthermore, binding of the host cell metabolite inositol hexakisphosphate (IP<sub>6</sub>) enhances dNTP import, while binding of synthesized molecules like benzenehexacarboxylic acid (BHC) inhibits it. The enhancing effect on reverse transcription by IP<sub>6</sub> and the consequences of interactions between CA and nucleotides were corroborated using atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and virological assays. Collectively, our results provide an atomistic description of the permeability of the HIV-1 capsid to small molecules and reveal a novel mechanism for the involvement of metabolites in HIV-1 capsid stabilization, nucleotide import, and reverse transcription.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/CpYzL7eAJF4" width="1" />

The antimicrobial resistance crisis has persisted despite broad attempts at intervention. It has been proposed that an important driver of resistance is selection imposed on bacterial populations that are not the intended target of antimicrobial therapy. But to date, there has been limited quantitative measure of the mean and variance of resistance following antibiotic exposure. Here we focus on the important nosocomial pathogen <i>Enterococcus faecium</i> in a hospital system where resistance to daptomycin is evolving despite standard interventions. We hypothesized that the intravenous use of daptomycin generates off-target selection for resistance in transmissible gastrointestinal (carriage) populations of <i>E</i>. <i>faecium</i>. We performed a cohort study in which the daptomycin resistance of <i>E</i>. <i>faecium</i> isolated from rectal swabs from daptomycin-exposed patients was compared to a control group of patients exposed to linezolid, a drug with similar indications. In the daptomycin-exposed group, daptomycin resistance of <i>E</i>. <i>faecium</i> from the off-target population was on average 50% higher than resistance in the control group (<i>n</i> = 428 clones from 22 patients). There was also greater phenotypic diversity in daptomycin resistance within daptomycin-exposed patients. In patients where multiple samples over time were available, a wide variability in temporal dynamics were observed, from long-term maintenance of resistance to rapid return to sensitivity after daptomycin treatment stopped. Sequencing of isolates from a subset of patients supports the argument that selection occurs within patients. Our results demonstrate that off-target gastrointestinal populations rapidly respond to intravenous antibiotic exposure. Focusing on the off-target evolutionary dynamics may offer novel avenues to slow the spread of antibiotic resistance.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Kkmye7te-0c" width="1" />

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a crucial role in the innate immune response. Although endosomal TLR7 recognizes single-stranded RNAs, their endogenous RNA ligands have not been fully explored. Here, we report 5′-tRNA half molecules as abundant activators of TLR7. Mycobacterial infection and accompanying surface TLR activation up-regulate the expression of 5′-tRNA half molecules in human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDMs). The abundant accumulation of 5′-tRNA halves also occur in HMDM-secreted extracellular vehicles (EVs); the abundance of EV-5′-tRNA<sup>HisGUG</sup> half molecules is &gt;200-fold higher than that of the most abundant EV-microRNA (miRNA). Sequence identification of the 5′-tRNA halves using cP-RNA-seq revealed abundant and selective packaging of specific 5′-tRNA half species into EVs. The EV-5′-tRNA<sup>HisGUG</sup> half was experimentally demonstrated to be delivered into endosomes in recipient cells and to activate endosomal TLR7. Up-regulation of the 5′-tRNA half molecules was also observed in the plasma of patients infected with <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>. These results unveil a novel tRNA-engaged pathway in the innate immune response and assign the role of “immune activators” to 5′-tRNA half molecules.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/tpa9O3HlOqo" width="1" />

<p>Genetic ablation of G protein‐coupled receptor 37‐like 1 results in increased patched 1 expression and internalization. This leads to the intracellular accumulation of cholesterol, with concomitant stimulation of sonic hedgehog (Shh) production and activation of Shh‐induced proliferative signaling.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Mammalian cerebellar astrocytes critically regulate the differentiation and maturation of neuronal Purkinje cells and granule precursors. The G protein‐coupled receptor 37‐like 1 (Gpr37l1) is expressed by Bergmann astrocytes and interacts with patched 1 (Ptch1) at peri‐ciliary membranes. Cerebellar primary astrocyte cultures from wild‐type and <i>Gpr37l1</i> null mutant mouse pups were established and studied. Primary cilia were produced by cultures of both genotypes, as well as Ptch1 and smoothened (Smo) components of the sonic hedgehog (Shh) mitogenic pathway. Compared to wild‐type cells, <i>Gpr37l1<sup>−/−</sup>
</i> astrocytes displayed striking increases in proliferative activity, Ptch1 protein expression and internalization, intracellular cholesterol content, ciliary localization of Smo, as well as a marked production of active Shh. Similar effects were reproduced by treating wild‐type astrocytes with a putative prosaptide ligand of Gpr37l1. These findings indicate that Gpr37l1–Ptch1 interactions specifically regulate Ptch1 internalization and trafficking, with consequent stimulation of Shh production and activation of proliferative signaling.</p>

<p>Introduction: Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) are a diverse group of inherited neuromuscular disorders characterized by a failure of synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). CMS often present early with fatigable weakness and can be fatal through respiratory complications. The AGRN gene is one of over 30 genes known to harbor mutations causative for CMS. In this study, we aimed to determine if a compound (NT1654), developed to stimulate the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clustering pathway, would benefit a mouse model of CMS caused by a loss-of-function mutation in Agrn (Agrn<sup>nmf380</sup> mouse).</p><p>Methods:Agrn<sup>nmf380</sup> mice received an injection of either NT1654 or vehicle compound daily, with wild-type litter mates used for comparison. Animals were weighed daily and underwent grip strength assessments. After 30 days of treatment animals were sacrificed, and muscles collected. Investigations into NMJ and muscle morphology were performed on collected tissue.</p><p>Results: While minimal improvements in NMJ ultrastructure were observed with electron microscopy, gross NMJ structure analysis using fluorescent labelling and confocal microscopy revealed extensive postsynaptic improvements in Agrn<sup>nmf380</sup> mice with NT1654 administration, with variables frequently returning to wild type levels. An improvement in muscle weight and myofiber characteristics helped increase forelimb grip strength and body weight.</p><p>Conclusions: We conclude that NT1654 restores NMJ postsynaptic structure and improves muscle strength through normalization of muscle fiber composition and the prevention of atrophy. We hypothesize this occurs through the AChR clustering pathway in Agrn<sup>nmf380</sup> mice. Future studies should investigate if this may represent a viable treatment option for patients with CMS, especially those with mutations in proteins of the AChR clustering pathway.</p>

<p>The deployment of electroencephalographic techniques for commercial applications has undergone a rapid growth in recent decades. As they continue to expand in the consumer markets as suitable techniques for monitoring the brain activity, their transformative potential necessitates equally significant ethical inquiries. One of the main questions, which arises then when evaluating these kinds of applications, is whether they should be aligned or not with the main ethical concerns reported by scholars and experts. Thus, the present work attempts to unify these disciplines of knowledge by performing a comprehensive scan of the major electroencephalographic market applications as well as their most relevant ethical concerns arising from the existing literature. In this literature review, different databases were consulted, which presented conceptual and empirical discussions and findings about commercial and ethical aspects of electroencephalography. Subsequently, the content was extracted from the articles and the main conclusions were presented. Finally, an external assessment of the outcomes was conducted in consultation with an expert panel in some of the topic areas such as biomedical engineering, biomechatronics, and neuroscience. The ultimate purpose of this review is to provide a genuine insight into the cutting-edge practical attempts at electroencephalography. By the same token, it seeks to highlight the overlap between the market needs and the ethical standards that should govern the deployment of electroencephalographic consumer-grade solutions, providing a practical approach that overcomes the engineering myopia of certain ethical discussions.</p>

<p>Objectives: The N2b is an event-related potential (ERP) component thought to index higher-order executive function. While the impact of concussion on executive functioning is frequently discussed in the literature, limited research has been done on the role of N2b in evaluating executive functioning in patients with concussion. The aims of this review are to consolidate an understanding of the cognitive functions reflected by the N2b and to account for discrepancies in literature findings regarding the N2b and concussion.</p><p>Methods: A scoping review was conducted on studies that used the N2b to measure cognitive functioning in healthy control populations, as well as in people with concussions.</p><p>Results: Sixty-six articles that met inclusion criteria demonstrated that the N2b effectively represents stimulus-response conflict management, response selection, and response inhibition. However, the 19 included articles investigating head injury (using terms such as concussion, mild head injury, and mild traumatic brain injury) found widely varied results: some studies found the amplitude of the N2b to be increased in the concussion group, while others found it to be decreased or unchanged.</p><p>Conclusion: Based on the available evidence, differences in the amplitude of the N2b have been linked to response selection, conflict, and inhibition deficits in concussion. However, due to large variations in methodology across studies, findings about the directionality of this effect remain inconclusive. The results of this review suggest that future research should be conducted with greater standardization and consistency.</p>

<p>The expansion of research on deep brain stimulation (DBS) and adaptive DBS (aDBS) raises important neuroethics and policy questions related to data sharing. However, there has been little empirical research on the perspectives of experts developing these technologies. We conducted semi-structured, open-ended interviews with aDBS researchers regarding their data sharing practices and their perspectives on ethical and policy issues related to sharing. Researchers expressed support for and a commitment to sharing, with most saying that they were either sharing their data or would share in the future and that doing so was important for advancing the field. However, those who are sharing reported a variety of sharing partners, suggesting heterogeneity in sharing practices and lack of the broad sharing that would reflect principles of open science. Researchers described several concerns and barriers related to sharing, including privacy and confidentiality, the usability of shared data by others, ownership and control of data (including potential commercialization), and limited resources for sharing. They also suggested potential solutions to these challenges, including additional safeguards to address privacy issues, standardization and transparency in analysis to address issues of data usability, professional norms and heightened cooperation to address issues of ownership and control, and streamlining of data transmission to address resource limitations. Researchers also offered a range of views on the sensitivity of neural activity data (NAD) and data related to mental health in the context of sharing. These findings are an important input to deliberations by researchers, policymakers, neuroethicists, and other stakeholders as they navigate ethics and policy questions related to aDBS research.</p>

<p>Previous research has indicated that frontal midline theta (FMθ) reflects a domain-general cognitive control mechanism of the prefrontal cortex. Brain imaging studies have shown that the inhibition of implicit stereotypes was dependent on this domain-general cognitive control mechanism. Based on this knowledge, the present study investigated the neural oscillatory correlates of implicit gender stereotype control in an extrinsic affective Simon task (EAST) using electrophysiological methods. Participants in this task conducted verification to white gender names and colored gender traits, and their behavioral response and electroencephalogram (EEG) were recorded during their performances. As predicted, stereotype-inconsistent trials resulted in reduced response accuracies and slower response times than stereotype-consistent trials. For the event-related potential (ERP) results, the enhanced performance of stereotype-inconsistent trials was accompanied by an enhanced N400 amplitude but an attenuated late positive potential amplitude. In contrast, early attentional components such as P2 and N2 as well as their amplitudes were impacted by the experimental manipulations and individual differences in gender factors. In addition, based on time–frequency (TF) analysis, we found that the enhanced performance of stereotype-inconsistent trials was also accompanied by an event-related synchronization on the frontal theta oscillation. This frontal theta appeared at a late processing stage and persisted across a time window from N400 to late positive potential. Additionally, this enhanced frontal theta effect was not modulated by the experimental manipulations and individual differences in gender factors. Based on these findings, the feature of frontal theta oscillation in the implicit gender stereotype control process was discussed.</p>

<p>Social fear and avoidance of social partners and social situations represent the core behavioral symptom of Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD), a prevalent psychiatric disorder worldwide. The pathological mechanism of SAD remains elusive and there are no specific and satisfactory therapeutic options currently available. With the development of appropriate animal models, growing studies start to unravel neuronal circuit mechanisms underlying social fear, and underscore a fundamental role of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Prefrontal cortical functions are implemented by a finely wired microcircuit composed of excitatory principal neurons (PNs) and diverse subtypes of inhibitory interneurons (INs). Disinhibition, defined as a break in inhibition via interactions between IN subtypes that enhances the output of excitatory PNs, has recently been discovered to serve as an efficient strategy in cortical information processing. Here, we review the rodent animal models of social fear, the prefrontal IN diversity, and their circuits with a particular emphasis on a novel disinhibitory microcircuit mediated by somatostatin-expressing INs in gating social fear behavior. The INs subtype distinct and microcircuit-based mechanism advances our understanding of the etiology of social fear and sheds light on developing future treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders associated with social fear.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.602116">Dysfunctional Autophagy and Endolysosomal System in Neurodegenerative Diseases: Relevance and Therapeutic Options</a></h4>

<p>Autophagy and endolysosomal trafficking are crucial in neuronal development, function and survival. These processes ensure efficient removal of misfolded aggregation-prone proteins and damaged organelles, such as dysfunctional mitochondria, thus allowing the maintenance of proper cellular homeostasis. Beside this, emerging evidence has pointed to their involvement in the regulation of the synaptic proteome needed to guarantee an efficient neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity. Along this line, an intimate interplay between the molecular machinery regulating synaptic vesicle endocytosis and synaptic autophagy is emerging, suggesting that synaptic quality control mechanisms need to be tightly coupled to neurosecretion to secure release accuracy. Defects in autophagy and endolysosomal pathway have been associated with neuronal dysfunction and extensively reported in Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Huntington’s and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis among other neurodegenerative diseases, with common features and emerging genetic bases. In this review, we focus on the multiple roles of autophagy and endolysosomal system in neuronal homeostasis and highlight how their defects probably contribute to synaptic default and neurodegeneration in the above-mentioned diseases, discussing the most recent options explored for therapeutic interventions.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.602688">Age-Dependent Activation and Neuronal Differentiation of Lgr5+ Basal Cells in Injured Olfactory Epithelium via Notch Signaling Pathway</a></h4>

<p>Aging is an important factor affecting function of smell, leading to the degeneration of mature olfactory sensory neurons and inducing the occurrence of smell loss. The mammalian olfactory epithelium (OE) can regenerate when subjected to chemical assaults. However, this capacity is not limitless. Inactivation of globose basal cells and failure to generate sensory neurons are the main obstacles to prevent the OE regeneration. Here, we found the significant attenuation in mature sensory neuronal generation and apparent transcriptional alternation in the OE from aged mice compared with young ones. The recruitment of leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5)-positive cells in injured OE was weakened in aged mice, and more Lgr5+ cells remained quiescence in aged OE postinjury. Lineage-traced progenies from Lgr5+ cells were significantly fewer in the OE with aging. Moreover, Notch activation enhanced the neuronal regeneration in aged OE, making the regenerative capacity of aged OE comparable with that of young animals after injury. The growth and morphology of three-dimensional (3D)-cultured organoids from the OE of young and aged mice varied and was modulated by small molecules regulating the Notch signaling pathway. Thus, we concluded that activation of Lgr5+ cells in injured OE was age dependent and Notch activation could enhance the capacity of neuronal generation from Lgr5+ cells in aged OE after injury.</p>

<p>Purpose: To develop and validate an integrative nomogram based on white matter (WM) radiomics biomarkers and nonmotor symptoms for the identification of early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD).</p><p>Methods: The brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical characteristics of 336 subjects, including 168 patients with PD, were collected from the Parkinson's Progress Markers Initiative (PPMI) database. All subjects were randomly divided into training and test sets. According to the baseline MRI scans of patients in the training set, the WM was segmented to extract the radiomic features of each patient and develop radiomics biomarkers, which were then combined with nonmotor symptoms to build an integrative nomogram using machine learning. Finally, the diagnostic accuracy and reliability of the nomogram were evaluated using a receiver operating characteristic curve and test data, respectively. In addition, we investigated 58 patients with atypical PD who had imaging scans without evidence of dopaminergic deficit (SWEDD) to verify whether the nomogram was able to distinguish patients with typical PD from patients with SWEDD. A decision curve analysis was also performed to validate the clinical practicality of the nomogram.</p><p>Results: The area under the curve values of the integrative nomogram for the training, testing and verification sets were 0.937, 0.922, and 0.836, respectively; the specificity values were 83.8, 88.2, and 91.38%, respectively; and the sensitivity values were 84.6, 82.4, and 70.69%, respectively. A significant difference in the number of patients with PD was observed between the high-risk group and the low-risk group based on the nomogram (P &lt; 0.05).</p><p>Conclusion: This integrative nomogram is a new potential method to identify patients with early-stage PD.</p>

Objective
We aimed to characterize the phenotypic spectrum and functional consequences associated with variants in the gene GABRB2, coding for the GABAA receptor subunit β2.


Methods
We recruited and systematically evaluated 25 individuals with variants in GABRB2, 17 of whom are newly described and 8 previously reported with additional clinical data. Functional analysis was performed using a Xenopus laevis oocyte model system.


Results
Our cohort of 25 individuals from 22 families with variants in GABRB2 demonstrated a range of epilepsy phenotypes from genetic generalized epilepsy to developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. Fifty‐eight percent of individuals had pharmaco‐resistant epilepsy; response to medications targeting the GABAergic pathway was inconsistent. Developmental disability (present in 84%) ranged from mild intellectual disability to severe global disability; movement disorders (present in 44%) included choreoathetosis, dystonia and ataxia. Disease‐associated variants cluster in the extracellular N‐terminus and transmembrane domains 1–3, with more severe phenotypes seen in association with variants in transmembrane domains 1 and 2 and the allosteric binding site between transmembrane domains 2 and 3. Functional analysis of 4 variants in transmembrane domains 1 or 2 (p.Ile246Thr, p.Pro252Leu, p.Ile288Ser, p.Val282Ala) revealed strongly reduced amplitudes of GABA‐evoked anionic currents.


Interpretation
GABRB2‐related epilepsy ranges broadly in severity from genetic generalized epilepsy to developmental and epileptic encephalopathies. Developmental disability and movement disorder are key features. The phenotypic spectrum is comparable to other GABAA receptor‐encoding genes. Phenotypic severity varied by protein domain. Experimental evidence supports loss of GABA‐ergic inhibition as the mechanism underlying GABRB2‐associated neurodevelopmental disorders.

<p>In this paper we investigate the usage of machine learning for interpreting
measured sensor values in sensor modules. In particular we analyze the
potential of artificial neural networks (ANNs) on low-cost micro-controllers
with a few kilobytes of memory to semantically enrich data captured by sensors.
The focus is on classifying temporal data series with a high level of
reliability. Design and implementation of ANNs are analyzed considering Feed
Forward Neural Networks (FFNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). We
validate the developed ANNs in a case study of optical hand gesture recognition
on an 8-bit micro-controller. The best reliability was found for an FFNN with
two layers and 1493 parameters requiring an execution time of 36 ms. We propose
a workflow to develop ANNs for embedded devices.

<p>Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based inference on battery-powered devices
can be made more energy-efficient by restricting the synaptic weights to be
binary, hence eliminating the need to perform multiplications. An alternative,
emerging, approach relies on the use of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs),
biologically inspired, dynamic, event-driven models that enhance energy
efficiency via the use of binary, sparse, activations. In this paper, an SNN
model is introduced that combines the benefits of temporally sparse binary
activations and of binary weights. Two learning rules are derived, the first
based on the combination of straight-through and surrogate gradient techniques,
and the second based on a Bayesian paradigm. Experiments validate the
performance loss with respect to full-precision implementations, and
demonstrate the advantage of the Bayesian paradigm in terms of accuracy and
calibration.

<p>Tangled Program Graph (TPG) is a reinforcement learning technique based on
genetic programming concepts. On state-of-the-art learning environments, TPGs
have been shown to offer comparable competence with Deep Neural Networks
(DNNs), for a fraction of their computational and storage cost. This lightness
of TPGs, both for training and inference, makes them an interesting model to
implement Artificial Intelligences (AIs) on embedded systems with limited
computational and storage resources. In this paper, we introduce the Gegelati
library for TPGs. Besides introducing the general concepts and features of the
library, two main contributions are detailed in the paper: 1/ The
parallelization of the deterministic training process of TPGs, for supporting
heterogeneous Multiprocessor Systems-on-Chips (MPSoCs). 2/ The support for
customizable instruction sets and data types within the genetically evolved
programs of the TPG model. The scalability of the parallel training process is
demonstrated through experiments on architectures ranging from a high-end
24-core processor to a low-power heterogeneous MPSoC. The impact of
customizable instructions on the outcome of a training process is demonstrated
on a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning environment. CCS Concepts:
$\bullet$ Computer systems organization $\rightarrow$ Embedded systems;
$\bullet$ Computing methodologies $\rightarrow$ Machine learning.

different problems, our approach \emph{switches} between different

<p>To handle different types of Many-Objective Optimization Problems (MaOPs),
Many-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MaOEAs) need to simultaneously maintain
convergence and population diversity in the high-dimensional objective space.
In order to balance the relationship between diversity and convergence, we
introduce a Kernel Matrix and probability model called Determinantal Point
Processes (DPPs). Our Many-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm with Determinantal
Point Processes (MaOEADPPs) is presented and compared with several
state-of-the-art algorithms on various types of MaOPs \textcolor{blue}{with
different numbers of objectives}. The experimental results demonstrate that
MaOEADPPs is competitive.

<p>The brain is composed of electrically excitable neuronal networks regulated
by the activity of voltage-gated ion channels. Further portraying the molecular
composition of the brain, however, will not reveal anything remotely
reminiscent of a feeling, a sensation or a conscious experience. In classical
physics, addressing the mind-brain problem is a formidable task because no
physical mechanism is able to explain how the brain generates the unobservable,
inner psychological world of conscious experiences and how in turn those
conscious experiences steer the underlying brain processes toward desired
behavior. Yet, this setback does not establish that consciousness is
non-physical. Modern quantum physics affirms the interplay between two types of
physical entities in Hilbert space: unobservable quantum states, which are
vectors describing what exists in the physical world, and quantum observables,
which are operators describing what can be observed in quantum measurements.
Quantum no-go theorems further provide a framework for studying quantum brain
dynamics, which has to be governed by a physically admissible Hamiltonian.
Comprising consciousness of unobservable quantum information integrated in
quantum brain states explains the origin of the inner privacy of conscious
experiences and revisits the dynamic timescale of conscious processes to
picosecond conformational transitions of neural biomolecules. The observable
brain is then an objective construction created from classical bits of
information, which are bound by Holevo's theorem, and obtained through the
measurement of quantum brain observables. Thus, quantum information theory
clarifies the distinction between the unobservable mind and the observable
brain, and supports a solid physical foundation for consciousness research.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03671">Joint analysis of structural connectivity and cortical surface features: correlates with mild traumatic brain injury. (arXiv:2012.03671v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</a></h4>

<p>Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a complex syndrome that affects up to
600 per 100,000 individuals, with a particular concentration among military
personnel. About half of all mTBI patients experience a diverse array of
chronic symptoms which persist long after the acute injury. Hence, there is an
urgent need for better understanding of the white matter and gray matter
pathologies associated with mTBI to map which specific brain systems are
impacted and identify courses of intervention. Previous works have linked mTBI
to disruptions in white matter pathways and cortical surface abnormalities.
Herein, we examine these hypothesized links in an exploratory study of joint
structural connectivity and cortical surface changes associated with mTBI and
its chronic symptoms. Briefly, we consider a cohort of 12 mTBI and 26 control
subjects. A set of 588 cortical surface metrics and 4,753 structural
connectivity metrics were extracted from cortical surface regions and diffusion
weighted magnetic resonance imaging in each subject. Principal component
analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the dimensionality of each metric set. We
then applied independent component analysis (ICA) both to each PCA space
individually and together in a joint ICA approach. We identified a stable
independent component across the connectivity-only and joint ICAs which
presented significant group differences in subject loadings (p&lt;0.05,
corrected). Additionally, we found that two mTBI symptoms, slowed thinking and
forgetfulness, were significantly correlated (p&lt;0.05, corrected) with mTBI
subject loadings in a surface-only ICA. These surface-only loadings captured an
increase in bilateral cortical thickness.

autoencoder (RTG-AE), which encodes trees via a bottom-up parser and decodes
trees via a tree grammar, both controlled by neural networks that minimize the
variational autoencoder loss. The resulting encoding and decoding functions can
then be employed in subsequent tasks, such as optimization and time series
prediction. RTG-AE combines variational autoencoders, grammatical knowledge,
and recursive processing. Our key message is that this combination improves
performance compared to only combining two of these three components. In
particular, we show experimentally that our proposed method improves the
autoencoding error, training time, and optimization score on four benchmark
datasets compared to baselines from the literature.

<p>In today's clinical practice, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is routinely
accelerated through subsampling of the associated Fourier domain. Currently,
the construction of these subsampling strategies - known as experimental design
- relies primarily on heuristics. We propose to learn experimental design
strategies for accelerated MRI with policy gradient methods. Unexpectedly, our
experiments show that a simple greedy approximation of the objective leads to
solutions nearly on-par with the more general non-greedy approach. We offer a
partial explanation for this phenomenon rooted in greater variance in the
non-greedy objective's gradient estimates, and experimentally verify that this
variance hampers non-greedy models in adapting their policies to individual MR
images. We empirically show that this adaptivity is key to improving
subsampling designs.

<p>We introduce a new class of time-continuous recurrent neural network models.
Instead of declaring a learning system's dynamics by implicit nonlinearities,
we construct networks of linear first-order dynamical systems modulated via
nonlinear interlinked gates. The resulting models represent dynamical systems
with varying (i.e., liquid) time-constants coupled to their hidden state, with
outputs being computed by numerical differential equation solvers. These neural
networks exhibit stable and bounded behavior, yield superior expressivity
within the family of neural ordinary differential equations, and give rise to
improved performance on time-series prediction tasks. To demonstrate these
properties, we first take a theoretical approach to find bounds over their
dynamics and compute their expressive power by the trajectory length measure in
latent trajectory space. We then conduct a series of time-series prediction
experiments to manifest the approximation capability of Liquid Time-Constant
Networks (LTCs) compared to classical and modern RNNs. Code and data are
available at https://github.com/raminmh/liquid_time_constant_networks

<p>Analogy is core to human cognition. It allows us to solve problems based on
prior experience, it governs the way we conceptualize new information, and it
even influences our visual perception. The importance of analogy to humans has
made it an active area of research in the broader field of artificial
intelligence, resulting in data-efficient models that learn and reason in
human-like ways. While cognitive perspectives of analogy and deep learning have
generally been studied independently of one another, the integration of the two
lines of research is a promising step towards more robust and efficient
learning techniques. As part of a growing body of research on such an
integration, we introduce the Analogical Matching Network: a neural
architecture that learns to produce analogies between structured, symbolic
representations that are largely consistent with the principles of
Structure-Mapping Theory.

<p>In studies of the visual system as well as in computer vision, the focus is
often on contrast edges. However, the primate visual system contains a large
number of cells that are insensitive to spatial contrast and, instead, respond
to uniform homogeneous illumination of their visual field. The purpose of this
information remains unclear. Here, we propose a mechanism that detects feature
homogeneity in visual areas, based on latency coding and spike time
coincidence, in a purely feed-forward and therefore rapid manner. We
demonstrate how homogeneity information can interact with information on
contrast edges to potentially support rapid image segmentation. Furthermore, we
analyze how neuronal crosstalk (noise) affects the mechanism's performance. We
show that the detrimental effects of crosstalk can be partly mitigated through
delayed feed-forward inhibition that shapes bi-phasic post-synaptic events. The
delay of the feed-forward inhibition allows effectively controlling the size of
the temporal integration window and, thereby, the coincidence threshold. The
proposed model is based on single-spike latency codes in a purely feed-forward
architecture that supports low-latency processing, making it an attractive
scheme of computation in spiking neuronal networks where rapid responses and
low spike counts are desired.

Using a cross-sectional study design with data collected at a single time-point, event-related potentials were elicited during a cued continuous performance test from 20 women with endometriosis (mean age = 28.5 ± 5.2 years) and 20 age- and gender-matched controls (mean age = 28.5 ± 5.2 years). Event-related potential components were extracted and P3 component amplitudes were derived with temporal principal components analysis. Behavioral and ERP outcomes were compared between groups and subjective pain severity was correlated with ERP component amplitudes. No significant behavioral differences were seen in task performance between the groups (all p &gt; 0.094). Target P3b (all p &lt; 0.034) and SW (all p &lt; 0.040), and non-target early P3a (eP3a; all p &lt; 0.023) and late P3a (lP3a; all p &lt; 0.035) amplitudes were smaller for the endometriosis compared to the healthy control group. Lower non-target eP3a (p &lt; 0.001), lP3a (p = 0.013), and SW (p = 0.019) amplitudes were correlated with higher pain severity scores. Findings suggest that endometriosis-associated chronic pelvic pain is linked to alterations in stimulus-response processing and inhibitory control networks, but not impaired behavioral performance, due to compensatory neuroplastic changes in overlapping cognitive control and pain networks.</p>

<p>Insight into lipids’ roles in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathophysiology is limited because brain membrane lipids have not been characterized in cognitively healthy (CH) individuals. Since age is a significant risk factor of AD, we hypothesize that aging renders the amyloid precursor protein (APP) more susceptible to abnormal processing because of deteriorating membrane lipids. To reflect brain membranes, we studied their lipid components in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain-derived CSF nanoparticle membranes. Based on CSF Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Tau levels established biomarkers of AD, we define a subset of CH participants with normal Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Tau (CH-NAT) and another group with abnormal or pathological Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Tau (CH-PAT). We report that glycerophospholipids are differentially metabolized in the CSF supernatant fluid and nanoparticle membrane fractions from CH-NAT, CH-PAT, and AD participants. Phosphatidylcholine molecular species from the supernatant fraction of CH-PAT were higher than in the CH-NAT and AD participants. Sphingomyelin levels in the supernatant fraction were lower in the CH-PAT and AD than in the CH-NAT group. The decrease in sphingomyelin corresponded with an increase in ceramide and dihydroceramide and an increase in the ceramide to sphingomyelin ratio in AD. In contrast to the supernatant fraction, sphingomyelin is higher in the nanoparticle fraction from the CH-PAT group, accompanied by lower ceramide and dihydroceramide and a decrease in the ratio of ceramide to sphingomyelin in CH-PAT compared with CH-NAT. On investigating the mechanism for the lipid changes in AD, we observed that phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> (PLA<sub>2</sub>) activity was higher in the AD group than the CH groups. Paradoxically, acid and neutral sphingomyelinase (SMase) activities were lower in AD compared to the CH groups. Considering external influences on lipids, the clinical groups did not differ in their fasting blood lipids or dietary lipids, consistent with the CSF lipid changes originating from brain pathophysiology. The lipid accumulation in a prodromal AD biomarker positive stage identifies perturbation of lipid metabolism and disturbances in APP/Amyloid beta (Aβ) as early events in AD pathophysiology. Our results identify increased lipid turnover in CH participants with AD biomarkers, switching to a predominantly lipolytic state in dementia. This knowledge may be useful for targeting and testing new AD treatments.</p>

<p>Interactions between two brains constitute the essence of social communication. Daily movements are commonly executed during social interactions and are determined by different mental states that may express different positive or negative behavioral intent. In this context, the effective recognition of festive or violent intent before the action execution remains crucial for survival. Here, we hypothesize that the EEG signals contain the distinctive features characterizing movement intent already expressed before movement execution and that such distinctive information can be identified by state-of-the-art classification algorithms based on Riemannian geometry. We demonstrated for the first time that a classifier based on covariance matrices and Riemannian geometry can effectively discriminate between neutral, festive, and violent mental states only on the basis of non-invasive EEG signals in both the actor and observer participants. These results pave the way for new electrophysiological discrimination of mental states based on non-invasive EEG recordings and cutting-edge machine learning techniques.</p>

<p>The judgement of human ability is ubiquitous, from school admissions to job performance reviews. The exact make-up of ability traits, however, is often narrowly defined and lacks a comprehensive basis. We attempt to simplify the spectrum of human ability, similar to how five personality traits are widely believed to describe most personalities. Finding such a basis for human ability would be invaluable since neuropsychiatric disease diagnoses and symptom severity are commonly related to such differences in performance. Here, we identified four underlying ability traits within the National Institutes of Health Toolbox normative data (n = 1, 369): (1) Motor-endurance, (2) Emotional processing, (3) Executive and cognitive function, and (4) Social interaction. We used the Human Connectome Project young adult dataset (n = 778) to show that Motor-endurance and Executive and cognitive function were reliably associated with specific brain functional networks (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.305 ± 0.021), and the biological nature of these ability traits was also shown by calculating their heritability (31 and 49%, respectively) from twin data.</p>

<p>Purpose: This experimental cross-sectional research study examined the emotional reactivity and emotion regulation in preschool-age children who do (CWS) and do not stutter (CWNS) by assessing their psychophysiological response during rest and while viewing pictures from the International Affective Picture System (Lang et al., 2008).</p><p>Method: Participants were 18 CWS (16 boys and two girls; mean age 4 years, 5 months) and 18 age- and gender-matched CWNS. Participants' psychophysiological responses were measured during two baselines and two picture viewing conditions. Skin conductance level (SCL) and heart rate were measured to assess emotional reactivity. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) was measured to assess emotional regulation. Participants' shyness and executive function were assessed via parent report and considered for their effects on participants' psychophysiological responses.</p><p>Results: First, CWNS and CWS did not differ in their initial baseline SCL, heart rate, or RSA, but all participants had higher SCL and lower RSA in the second baseline, subsequent to the first challenge condition, compared to the first baseline. Second, during the challenge conditions, CWS did not differ from CWNS in their SCL, but showed a significantly higher heart rate than CWNS. Third, CWS exhibited a significantly lower RSA during the challenge conditions compared to CWNS. Lastly, the temperamental quality of shyness was associated with preschool-age children's SCL, such that participants who were rated higher in shyness had a higher SCL during the challenge conditions. Participants' executive function had a marginally significant effect on the RSA, such that the participants who had higher executive function composite scores exhibited lower RSA during the challenge conditions.</p><p>Conclusions: Our findings suggest that CWS and CWNS did not differ in their emotional reactivity and emotional regulation abilities at rest. During challenge conditions, however, CWS tended to be more emotionally reactive, as indicated by a higher heart rate, and also employed more emotional regulation, indexed by a greater decrease in RSA, compared to CWNS. Preschool-age children's behavior is largely dominated by reactivity, but there is the emergence of regulation, which can help children adjust to various contextual demands. For CWS who are more emotionally reactive, regulatory skills may be particularly critical to their prognosis and treatment.</p>

<p>In the human-computer interaction (HCI), electroencephalogram (EEG) access for automatic emotion recognition is an effective way for robot brains to perceive human behavior. In order to improve the accuracy of the emotion recognition, a method of EEG access for emotion recognition based on a deep hybrid network was proposed in this paper. Firstly, the collected EEG was decomposed into four frequency band signals, and the multiscale sample entropy (MSE) features of each frequency band were extracted. Secondly, the constructed 3D MSE feature matrices were fed into a deep hybrid network for autonomous learning. The deep hybrid network was composed of a continuous convolutional neural network (CNN) and hidden Markov models (HMMs). Lastly, HMMs trained with multiple observation sequences were used to replace the artificial neural network classifier in the CNN, and the emotion recognition task was completed by HMM classifiers. The proposed method was applied to the DEAP dataset for emotion recognition experiments, and the average accuracy could achieve 79.77% on arousal, 83.09% on valence, and 81.83% on dominance. Compared with the latest related methods, the accuracy was improved by 0.99% on valence and 14.58% on dominance, which verified the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p>

<p>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been widely utilized in research settings and modulates brain activity. The application of anodal tDCS on the prefrontal cortex has indicated improvement in cognitive functioning. The cingulate cortex, situated in the medial aspect of the prefrontal cortex, has been identified as a core region performing cognitive functions. Most of the previous studies investigating the impact of stimulation on the prefrontal cortex stimulated the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), however, the impact of stimulation on cingulate has not been explored. The current study investigates the effect of stimulation on the resting-state functional connectivity of the anterior cingulate cortex with other regions of the brain and changes in behavioral results in a color-word Stroop task, which has repeatedly elicited activation in different regions of the cingulate. Twenty subjects were randomly assigned to the experimental and sham group, and their medial prefrontal area was stimulated using MRI compatible tDCS. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and cognitive Stroop task were monitored before, during, and after the stimulation. Neuroimaging results indicated a significant decrease in resting-state functional connectivity in the experimental group during and after stimulation as compared to before stimulation in two clusters including right insular cortex, right central operculum cortex, right frontal operculum cortex and right planum polare with the left anterior cingulate cortex (L-ACC) selected as the seed. The behavioral results indicated a significant decrease in reaction time (RT) following stimulation in the experimental group compared to the sham group. Moreover, the change in functional connectivity in subcortical regions with L-ACC as the seed and change in RT was positively correlated. The results demonstrated that ACC has a close functional relationship with the subcortical regions, and stimulation of ACC can modulate these connections, which subsequently improves behavioral performance, thus, providing another potential target of stimulation for cognitive enhancement.</p><p>Clinical Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04318522.</p>

<p>A fundamental neuroscience question is how memories are maintained from days to a lifetime, given turnover of proteins that underlie expression of long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) or “tag” synapses as eligible for LTP. A likely solution relies on synaptic positive feedback loops, prominently including persistent activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) and self-activated synthesis of protein kinase M ζ (PKMζ). Data also suggest positive feedback based on recurrent synaptic reactivation within neuron assemblies, or engrams, is necessary to maintain memories. The relative importance of these mechanisms is controversial. To explore the likelihood that each mechanism is necessary or sufficient to maintain memory, we simulated maintenance of LTP with a simplified model incorporating persistent kinase activation, synaptic tagging, and preferential reactivation of strong synapses, and analyzed implications of recent data. We simulated three model variants, each maintaining LTP with one feedback loop: autonomous, self-activated PKMζ synthesis (model variant I); self-activated CamKII (model variant II); and recurrent reactivation of strengthened synapses (model variant III). Variant I predicts that, for successful maintenance of LTP, either 1) PKMζ contributes to synaptic tagging, or 2) a low constitutive tag level persists during maintenance independent of PKMζ, or 3) maintenance of LTP is independent of tagging. Variant II maintains LTP and suggests persistent CaMKII activation could maintain PKMζ activity, a feedforward interaction not previously considered. However, we note data challenging the CaMKII feedback loop. In Variant III synaptic reactivation drives, and thus predicts, recurrent or persistent activation of CamKII and other necessary kinases, plausibly contributing to persistent elevation of PKMζ levels. Reactivation is thus predicted to sustain recurrent rounds of synaptic tagging and incorporation of plasticity-related proteins. We also suggest (model variant IV) that synaptic reactivation and autonomous kinase activation could synergistically maintain LTP. We propose experiments that could discriminate these maintenance mechanisms.</p>

<p>CLN1 disease (OMIM #256730) is an inherited neurological disorder of early childhood with epileptic seizures and premature death. It is associated with mutations in CLN1 coding for Palmitoyl-Protein Thioesterase 1 (PPT1), a lysosomal enzyme which affects the recycling and degradation of lipid-modified (S-acylated) proteins by removing palmitate residues. Transcriptomic evidence from a neuronal-like cellular model derived from differentiated SH-SY5Y cells disclosed the potential negative roles of CLN1 overexpression, affecting the elongation of neuronal processes and the expression of selected proteins of the synaptic region. Bioinformatic inquiries of transcriptomic data pinpointed a dysregulated expression of several genes coding for proteins related to voltage-gated ion channels, including subunits of calcium and potassium channels (VGCC and VGKC). In SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing CLN1 (SH-CLN1 cells), the resting potential and the membrane conductance in the range of voltages close to the resting potential were not affected. However, patch-clamp recordings indicated a reduction of Ba<sup>2+</sup> currents through VGCC of SH-CLN1 cells; Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging revealed reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in the same cellular setting. The results of the biochemical and morphological investigations of CACNA2D2/α<sub>2</sub>δ-2, an accessory subunit of VGCC, were in accordance with the downregulation of the corresponding gene and consistent with the hypothesis that a lower number of functional channels may reach the plasma membrane. The combined use of 4-AP and NS-1643, two drugs with opposing effects on K<sub>v</sub>11 and K<sub>v</sub>12 subfamilies of VGKC coded by the KCNH gene family, provides evidence for reduced functional K<sub>v</sub>12 channels in SH-CLN1 cells, consistent with transcriptomic data indicating the downregulation of KCNH4. The lack of compelling evidence supporting the palmitoylation of many ion channels subunits investigated in this study stimulates inquiries about the role of PPT1 in the trafficking of channels to the plasma membrane. Altogether, these results indicate a reduction of functional voltage-gated ion channels in response to CLN1/PPT1 overexpression in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells and provide new insights into the altered neuronal excitability which may underlie the severe epileptic phenotype of CLN1 disease. It remains to be shown if remodeling of such functional channels on plasma membrane can occur as a downstream effect of CLN1 disease.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.618538">Systematic and Comprehensive Automated Ventricle Segmentation on Ventricle Images of the Elderly Patients: A Retrospective Study</a></h4>

<p>Background and Objective: Ventricle volume is closely related to hydrocephalus, brain atrophy, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's syndrome, and other diseases. To accurately measure the volume of the ventricles for elderly patients, we use deep learning to establish a systematic and comprehensive automated ventricle segmentation framework.</p><p>Methods: The study participation included 20 normal elderly people, 20 patients with cerebral atrophy, 64 patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus, and 51 patients with acquired hydrocephalus. Second, get their imaging data through the picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) system. Then use ITK software to manually label participants' ventricular structures. Finally, extract imaging features through machine learning.</p><p>Results: This automated ventricle segmentation method can be applied not only to CT and MRI images but also to images with different scan slice thicknesses. More importantly, it produces excellent segmentation results (Dice &gt; 0.9).</p><p>Conclusion: This automated ventricle segmentation method has wide applicability and clinical practicability. It can help clinicians find early disease, diagnose disease, understand the patient's disease progression, and evaluate the patient's treatment effect.</p>
