<p>by Anna Hutchinson, Hope Watson, Chris Wallace</p>

Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have successfully identified thousands of loci associated with human diseases. Bayesian genetic fine-mapping studies aim to identify the specific causal variants within GWAS loci responsible for each association, reporting credible sets of plausible causal variants, which are interpreted as containing the causal variant with some “coverage probability”. Here, we use simulations to demonstrate that the coverage probabilities are over-conservative in most fine-mapping situations. We show that this is because fine-mapping data sets are not randomly selected from amongst all causal variants, but from amongst causal variants with larger effect sizes. We present a method to re-estimate the coverage of credible sets using rapid simulations based on the observed, or estimated, SNP correlation structure, we call this the “adjusted coverage estimate”. This is extended to find “adjusted credible sets”, which are the smallest set of variants such that their adjusted coverage estimate meets the target coverage. We use our method to improve the resolution of a fine-mapping study of type 1 diabetes. We found that in 27 out of 39 associated genomic regions our method could reduce the number of potentially causal variants to consider for follow-up, and found that none of the 95% or 99% credible sets required the inclusion of more variants—a pattern matched in simulations of well powered GWAS. Crucially, our method requires only GWAS summary statistics and remains accurate when SNP correlations are estimated from a large reference panel. Using our method to improve the resolution of fine-mapping studies will enable more efficient expenditure of resources in the follow-up process of annotating the variants in the credible set to determine the implicated genes and pathways in human diseases.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZTeJWkGsGCg" width="1" />

<p>by Marco Mauri, Jean-Luc Gouzé, Hidde de Jong, Eugenio Cinquemani</p>

Synthetic microbial consortia have been increasingly utilized in biotechnology and experimental evidence shows that suitably engineered consortia can outperform individual species in the synthesis of valuable products. Despite significant achievements, though, a quantitative understanding of the conditions that make this possible, and of the trade-offs due to the concurrent growth of multiple species, is still limited. In this work, we contribute to filling this gap by the investigation of a known prototypical synthetic consortium. A first <i>E. coli</i> strain, producing a heterologous protein, is sided by a second <i>E. coli</i> strain engineered to scavenge toxic byproducts, thus favoring the growth of the producer at the expense of diverting part of the resources to the growth of the cleaner. The simplicity of the consortium is ideal to perform an in depth-analysis and draw conclusions of more general interest. We develop a coarse-grained mathematical model that quantitatively accounts for literature data from different key growth phenotypes. Based on this, assuming growth in chemostat, we first investigate the conditions enabling stable coexistence of both strains and the effect of the metabolic load due to heterologous protein production. In these conditions, we establish when and to what extent the consortium outperforms the producer alone in terms of productivity. Finally, we show in chemostat as well as in a fed-batch scenario that gain in productivity comes at the price of a reduced yield, reflecting at the level of the consortium resource allocation trade-offs that are well-known for individual species.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yUpRNtkUMDo" width="1" />

Widefield calcium imaging enables recording of large-scale neural activity across the mouse dorsal cortex. In order to examine the relationship of these neural signals to the resulting behavior, it is critical to demix the recordings into meaningful spatial and temporal components that can be mapped onto well-defined brain regions. However, no current tools satisfactorily extract the activity of the different brain regions in individual mice in a data-driven manner, while taking into account mouse-specific and preparation-specific differences. Here, we introduce Localized semi-Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (LocaNMF), a method that efficiently decomposes widefield video data and allows us to directly compare activity across multiple mice by outputting mouse-specific localized functional regions that are significantly more interpretable than more traditional decomposition techniques. Moreover, it provides a natural subspace to directly compare correlation maps and neural dynamics across different behaviors, mice, and experimental conditions, and enables identification of task- and movement-related brain regions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CDkfhRwyf0Y" width="1" />

<p>by Nicholas T. Franklin, Michael J. Frank</p>

Humans routinely face novel environments in which they have to generalize in order to act adaptively. However, doing so involves the non-trivial challenge of deciding which aspects of a task domain to generalize. While it is sometimes appropriate to simply re-use a learned behavior, often adaptive generalization entails recombining distinct components of knowledge acquired across multiple contexts. Theoretical work has suggested a computational trade-off in which it can be more or less useful to learn and generalize aspects of task structure jointly or compositionally, depending on previous task statistics, but it is unknown whether humans modulate their generalization strategy accordingly. Here we develop a series of navigation tasks that separately manipulate the statistics of goal values (“what to do”) and state transitions (“how to do it”) across contexts and assess whether human subjects generalize these task components separately or conjunctively. We find that human generalization is sensitive to the statistics of the previously experienced task domain, favoring compositional or conjunctive generalization when the task statistics are indicative of such structures, and a mixture of the two when they are more ambiguous. These results support a normative “meta-generalization” account and suggests that people not only generalize previous task components but also generalize the statistical structure most likely to support generalization.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jkWq3zlKQgI" width="1" />

<p>by Christian Quirouette, Nada P. Younis, Micaela B. Reddy, Catherine A. A. Beauchemin</p>

Within the human respiratory tract (HRT), virus diffuses through the periciliary fluid (PCF) bathing the epithelium. But virus also undergoes advection: as the mucus layer sitting atop the PCF is pushed along by the ciliated cell’s beating cilia, the PCF and its virus content are also pushed along, upwards towards the nose and mouth. While many mathematical models (MMs) have described the course of influenza A virus (IAV) infections in vivo, none have considered the impact of both diffusion and advection on the kinetics and localization of the infection. The MM herein represents the HRT as a one-dimensional track extending from the nose down towards the lower HRT, wherein stationary cells interact with IAV which moves within (diffusion) and along with (advection) the PCF. Diffusion was found to be negligible in the presence of advection which effectively sweeps away IAV, preventing infection from disseminating below the depth at which virus first deposits. Higher virus production rates (10-fold) are required at higher advection speeds (40 μm/s) to maintain equivalent infection severity and timing. Because virus is entrained upwards, upper parts of the HRT see more virus than lower parts. As such, infection peaks and resolves faster in the upper than in the lower HRT, making it appear as though infection progresses from the upper towards the lower HRT, as reported in mice. When the spatial MM is expanded to include cellular regeneration and an immune response, it reproduces tissue damage levels reported in patients. It also captures the kinetics of seasonal and avian IAV infections, via parameter changes consistent with reported differences between these strains, enabling comparison of their treatment with antivirals. This new MM offers a convenient and unique platform from which to study the localization and spread of respiratory viral infections within the HRT.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/e50KlDmALV0" width="1" />

<p>by Jean-Baptiste Lugagne, Haonan Lin, Mary J. Dunlop</p>

Microscopy image analysis is a major bottleneck in quantification of single-cell microscopy data, typically requiring human oversight and curation, which limit both accuracy and throughput. To address this, we developed a deep learning-based image analysis pipeline that performs segmentation, tracking, and lineage reconstruction. Our analysis focuses on time-lapse movies of <i>Escherichia coli</i> cells trapped in a "mother machine" microfluidic device, a scalable platform for long-term single-cell analysis that is widely used in the field. While deep learning has been applied to cell segmentation problems before, our approach is fundamentally innovative in that it also uses machine learning to perform cell tracking and lineage reconstruction. With this framework we are able to get high fidelity results (1% error rate), without human intervention. Further, the algorithm is fast, with complete analysis of a typical frame containing ~150 cells taking &lt;700msec. The framework is not constrained to a particular experimental set up and has the potential to generalize to time-lapse images of other organisms or different experimental configurations. These advances open the door to a myriad of applications including real-time tracking of gene expression and high throughput analysis of strain libraries at single-cell resolution.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yhxcQeuqnCk" width="1" />

Studies of complex disorders benefit from integrative analyses of multiple omics data. Yet, sample mix-ups frequently occur in multi-omics studies, weakening statistical power and risking false findings. Accurately aligning sample information, genotype, and corresponding omics data is critical for integrative analyses. We developed DRAMS (https://github.com/Yi-Jiang/DRAMS) to Detect and Re-Align Mixed-up Samples to address the sample mix-up problem. It uses a logistic regression model followed by a modified topological sorting algorithm to identify the potential true IDs based on data relationships of multi-omics. According to tests using simulated data, the more types of omics data used or the smaller the proportion of mix-ups, the better that DRAMS performs. Applying DRAMS to real data from the PsychENCODE BrainGVEX project, we detected and corrected 201 (12.5% of total data generated) mix-ups. Of the 21 mix-ups involving errors of racial identity, DRAMS re-assigned all data to the correct racial group in the 1000 Genomes project. In doing so, quantitative trait loci (QTL) (FDR&lt;0.01) increased by an average of 1.62-fold. The use of DRAMS in multi-omics studies will strengthen statistical power of the study and improve quality of the results. Even though very limited studies have multi-omics data in place, we expect such data will increase quickly with the needs of DRAMS.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v735bzy17ts" width="1" />

<p>by Chloé Pasture, Anna Montagnini, Laurent Udo Perrinet</p>

Animal behavior constantly adapts to changes, for example when the statistical properties of the environment change unexpectedly. For an agent that interacts with this volatile setting, it is important to react accurately and as quickly as possible. It has already been shown that when a random sequence of motion ramps of a visual target is biased to one direction (e.g. right or left), human observers adapt their eye movements to accurately anticipate the target’s expected direction. Here, we prove that this ability extends to a volatile environment where the probability bias could change at random switching times. In addition, we also recorded the explicit prediction of the next outcome as reported by observers using a rating scale. Both results were compared to the estimates of a probabilistic agent that is optimal in relation to the assumed generative model. Compared to the classical leaky integrator model, we found a better match between our probabilistic agent and the behavioral responses, both for the anticipatory eye movements and the explicit task. Furthermore, by controlling the level of preference between exploitation and exploration in the model, we were able to fit for each individual’s experimental dataset the most likely level of volatility and analyze inter-individual variability across participants. These results prove that in such an unstable environment, human observers can still represent an internal belief about the environmental contingencies, and use this representation both for sensory-motor control and for explicit judgments. This work offers an innovative approach to more generically test the diversity of human cognitive abilities in uncertain and dynamic environments.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bv9wsfV3c6Q" width="1" />

<p>by Miguel Brun-Usan, Christoph Thies, Richard A. Watson</p>

Cell differentiation in multicellular organisms requires cells to respond to complex combinations of extracellular cues, such as morphogen concentrations. Some models of phenotypic plasticity conceptualise the response as a relatively simple function of a single environmental cues (e.g. a linear function of one cue), which facilitates rigorous analysis. Conversely, more mechanistic models such those implementing GRNs allows for a more general class of response functions but makes analysis more difficult. Therefore, a general theory describing how cells integrate multi-dimensional signals is lacking. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework for understanding the relationships between environmental cues (inputs) and phenotypic responses (outputs) underlying cell plasticity. We describe the relationship between environment and cell phenotype using logical functions, making the evolution of cell plasticity equivalent to a simple categorisation learning task. This abstraction allows us to apply principles derived from learning theory to understand the evolution of multi-dimensional plasticity. Our results show that natural selection is capable of discovering adaptive forms of cell plasticity associated with complex logical functions. However, developmental dynamics cause simpler functions to evolve more readily than complex ones. By using conceptual tools derived from learning theory we show that this developmental bias can be interpreted as a learning bias in the acquisition of plasticity functions. Because of that bias, the evolution of plasticity enables cells, under some circumstances, to display appropriate plastic responses to environmental conditions that they have not experienced in their evolutionary past. This is possible when the selective environment mirrors the bias of the developmental dynamics favouring the acquisition of simple plasticity functions–an example of the necessary conditions for generalisation in learning systems. These results illustrate the functional parallelisms between learning in neural networks and the action of natural selection on environmentally sensitive gene regulatory networks. This offers a theoretical framework for the evolution of plastic responses that integrate information from multiple cues, a phenomenon that underpins the evolution of multicellularity and developmental robustness.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jVs6kVBFgC4" width="1" />

<p>by Yifei Guo, Rory John Bufacchi, Giacomo Novembre, Marina Kilintari, Massieh Moayedi, Li Hu, Gian Domenico Iannetti</p>

Nervous systems exploit regularities in the sensory environment to predict sensory input, adjust behavior, and thereby maximize fitness. Entrainment of neural oscillations allows retaining temporal regularities of sensory information, a prerequisite for prediction. Entrainment has been extensively described at the frequencies of periodic inputs most commonly present in visual and auditory landscapes (e.g., &gt;0.5 Hz). An open question is whether neural entrainment also occurs for regularities at much longer timescales. Here, we exploited the fact that the temporal dynamics of thermal stimuli in natural environment can unfold very slowly. We show that ultralow-frequency neural oscillations preserved a long-lasting trace of sensory information through neural entrainment to periodic thermo-nociceptive input as low as 0.1 Hz. Importantly, revealing the functional significance of this phenomenon, both power and phase of the entrainment predicted individual pain sensitivity. In contrast, periodic auditory input at the same ultralow frequency did not entrain ultralow-frequency oscillations. These results demonstrate that a functionally significant neural entrainment can occur at temporal scales far longer than those commonly explored. The non-supramodal nature of our results suggests that ultralow-frequency entrainment might be tuned to the temporal scale of the statistical regularities characteristic of different sensory modalities.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/KKPxATUxu5Q" width="1" />

<p>There has not been a major change in how neuroscientists approach stereotaxic methods in decades. Here, we present a new stereotaxic method that provides an alternative approach to a traditional u-frame stereotaxic device and reduces costs, surgical time, and aids repeatability. The RatHat brain implantation system is a 3D-printable stereotaxic device for rats that is fabricated prior to surgery and fits to the shape of the skull. RatHat builds are directly implanted into the brain without the need for head-leveling or coordinate-mapping during surgery. The RatHat can be used in conjunction with the traditional u-frame stereotaxic device, but does not require the use of a micromanipulator for successful implantations. Each RatHat contains several primary components including the implant for mounting intracranial components, the surgical stencil for targeting drill sites, and the protective cap for preventing damage from impacts and debris. Each component serves a unique function and can be used together or separately. We demonstrate the feasibility of the RatHat in four different proof-of-principle experiments: (1) a three-pole cannula apparatus, (2) an optrode-electrode assembly, (3) a fixed-electrode array, and (4) a tetrode hyperdrive. Implants were successful, durable, and long-lasting (up to nine months). RatHat print files are easily created, can be modified in computer aided design (CAD) software for a variety of applications, and are easily shared, contributing to open science goals and replications. The RatHat has been adapted to multiple experimental paradigms in our lab and should be a useful new way to conduct stereotaxic implant surgeries in rodents.</p>

<p>In this paper, a novel approach called GSA-DenseNet121-COVID-19 based on a
hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is proposed using an
optimization algorithm. The CNN architecture that was used is called
DenseNet121 and the optimization algorithm that was used is called the
gravitational search algorithm (GSA). The GSA is adapted to determine the best
values for the hyperparameters of the DenseNet121 architecture, and to achieve
a high level of accuracy in diagnosing COVID-19 disease through chest x-ray
image analysis. The obtained results showed that the proposed approach was able
to correctly classify 98% of the test set. To test the efficacy of the GSA in
setting the optimum values for the hyperparameters of DenseNet121, it was
compared to another optimization algorithm called social ski driver (SSD). The
comparison results demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed
GSA-DenseNet121-COVID-19 and its ability to better diagnose COVID-19 disease
than the SSD-DenseNet121 as the second was able to diagnose only 94% of the
test set. As well as, the proposed approach was compared to an approach based
on a CNN architecture called Inception-v3 and the manual search method for
determining the values of the hyperparameters. The results of the comparison
showed that the GSA-DenseNet121 was able to beat the other approach, as the
second was able to classify only 95% of the test set samples.

<p>We check the robustness of a recently proposed dynamical model of associative
Pavlovian learning that extends the Rescorla-Wagner (RW) model in a natural way
and predicts progressively damped oscillations in the response of the subjects.
Using the data of two experiments, we compare the dynamical oscillatory model
(DOM) with a non-associative oscillatory model (NAOM) made of the superposition
of the RW learning curve and oscillations. Not only do data clearly show an
oscillatory pattern, but they also favour the DOM over the NAOM, thus pointing
out that these oscillations are the manifestation of an associative process.
The latter is interpreted as the fact that subjects make predictions on trial
outcomes more extended in time than in the RW model, but with more uncertainty.

<p>Domination-based multi-objective (MO) evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are today
arguably the most frequently used type of MOEA. These methods however stagnate
when the majority of the population becomes non-dominated, preventing
convergence to the Pareto set. Hypervolume-based MO optimization has shown
promising results to overcome this. Direct use of the hypervolume however
results in no selection pressure for dominated solutions. The recently
introduced Sofomore framework overcomes this by solving multiple interleaved
single-objective dynamic problems that iteratively improve a single
approximation set, based on the uncrowded hypervolume improvement (UHVI). It
thereby however loses many advantages of population-based MO optimization, such
as handling multimodality. Here, we reformulate the UHVI as a quality measure
for approximation sets, called the uncrowded hypervolume (UHV), which can be
used to directly solve MO optimization problems with a single-objective
optimizer. We use the state-of-the-art gene-pool optimal mixing evolutionary
algorithm (GOMEA) that is capable of efficiently exploiting the intrinsically
available grey-box properties of this problem. The resulting algorithm,
UHV-GOMEA, is compared to Sofomore equipped with GOMEA, and the
domination-based MO-GOMEA. In doing so, we investigate in which scenarios
either domination-based or hypervolume-based methods are preferred. Finally, we
construct a simple hybrid approach that combines MO-GOMEA with UHV-GOMEA and
outperforms both.

<p>With elementary means, we prove a stronger run time guarantee for the
univariate marginal distribution algorithm (UMDA) optimizing the LeadingOnes
benchmark function in the desirable regime with low genetic drift. If the
population size is at least quasilinear, then, with high probability, the UMDA
samples the optimum within a number of iterations that is linear in the problem
size divided by the logarithm of the UMDA's selection rate. This improves over
the previous guarantee, obtained by Dang and Lehre (2015) via the deep
level-based population method, both in terms of the run time and by
demonstrating further run time gains from small selection rates. With similar
arguments as in our upper-bound analysis, we also obtain the first lower bound
for this problem. Under similar assumptions, we prove that a bound that matches
our upper bound up to constant factors holds with high probability.

<p>Deep learning is a state of the art method for a lot of applications. The
main issue is that most of the real-time data is highly imbalanced in nature.
In order to avoid bias in training, cost-sensitive approach can be used. In
this paper, we propose cost-sensitive deep learning based frameworks and the
performance of the frameworks is evaluated on three different Cyber Security
use cases which are Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA), Electronic mail (Email),
and Uniform Resource Locator (URL). Various experiments were performed using
cost-insensitive as well as cost-sensitive methods and parameters for both of
these methods are set based on hyperparameter tuning. In all experiments, the
cost-sensitive deep learning methods performed better than the cost-insensitive
approaches. This is mainly due to the reason that cost-sensitive approach gives
importance to the classes which have a very less number of samples during
training and this helps to learn all the classes in a more efficient manner.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04796">Using Skill Rating as Fitness on the Evolution of GANs. (arXiv:2004.04796v1 [cs.NE])</a></h4>

<p>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are an adversarial model that achieved
impressive results on generative tasks. In spite of the relevant results, GANs
present some challenges regarding stability, making the training usually a
hit-and-miss process. To overcome these challenges, several improvements were
proposed to better handle the internal characteristics of the model, such as
alternative loss functions or architectural changes on the neural networks used
by the generator and the discriminator. Recent works proposed the use of
evolutionary algorithms on GAN training, aiming to solve these challenges and
to provide an automatic way to find good models. In this context, COEGAN
proposes the use of coevolution and neuroevolution to orchestrate the training
of GANs. However, previous experiments detected that some of the fitness
functions used to guide the evolution are not ideal. In this work we propose
the evaluation of a game-based fitness function to be used within the COEGAN
method. Skill rating is a metric to quantify the skill of players in a game and
has already been used to evaluate GANs. We extend this idea using the skill
rating in an evolutionary algorithm to train GANs. The results show that skill
rating can be used as fitness to guide the evolution in COEGAN without the
dependence of an external evaluator.

<p>Since the earliest electroencephalography experiments, large scale
oscillations have been observed in the mammalian brain. More recently, they
have been identified not only in the cerebral cortex and thalamus, but
pervasively in the healthy basal ganglia. The basal ganglia mediated
synchronization model, introduced here, implicates these oscillations in the
combination of cortical association mechanisms with stimulus-response and
reinforcement mechanisms in the basal ganglia. In the core mechanism of the
model, oscillatory patterns in cortex are selected by and routed through the
basal ganglia to the thalamus phase-coherently, then circulated back to widely
separated areas of cortex, synchronizing those areas and functionally
connecting them. Corticostriatal and striatonigral conduction delays are
crucial to this mechanism, and evidence suggests that these delays are
unusually long, and unusually varied, in arrangements that might facilitate
learning of useful time alignments and associated resonant frequencies. Other
structural arrangements in the basal ganglia show further specialization for
this role, with convergence in the inputs from cortex, and divergence in many
of the return paths to cortex, that systematically reflect corticocortical
anatomical connectivity. The basal ganglia also target the dopaminergic,
cholinergic, and serotonergic centers of the brainstem and basal forebrain, and
the reticular nucleus of the thalamus, structures broadly implicated in the
modulation of oscillatory network activity and expressions of plasticity. By
learning to coordinate these various output channels, the basal ganglia are
positioned to facilitate and synchronize activity in selected areas of cortex,
broadly impart selective receptivity, attenuate and disconnect interfering
activity, and recurrently process the resulting patterns of activity,
channeling cognition and promoting goal [...]

Introduction: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is considered as the most robust environmental risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Besides direct neuronal injury and neuroinflammation, vascular impairment is also a hallmark event of the pathological cascade after TBI. However, the vascular connection between TBI and subsequent AD pathogenesis remains underexplored. Methods: We established a closed-head mild TBI (mTBI) model in mice with controlled cortical impact, and examined the time courses of microvascular injury, blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, gliosis and motor function impairment in wild type C57BL/6 mice. We also determined brain clearance of {beta}-amyloid, as well as amyloid pathology and cognitive functions after mTBI in the 5xFAD mouse model of AD. Results: mTBI induced microvascular injury with BBB breakdown, pericyte loss and cerebral blood flow reduction in mice, which preceded gliosis. mTBI also impaired brain amyloid clearance via the vascular pathways. More importantly, mTBI accelerated amyloid pathology and cognitive impairment in the 5xFAD mice. Discussion: Our data demonstrated that microvascular injury plays a key role in the pathogenesis of AD after mTBI. Therefore, restoring vascular functions might be beneficial for patients with mTBI, and potentially reduce the risk of developing AD

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.11.037333v1?rss=1">Parallel visual pathways with topographic versus non-topographic organization connect the Drosophila eyes to the central brain</a></h4>

One hallmark of the visual system is the strict retinotopic organization from the periphery towards the central brain, spanning multiple layers of synaptic integration. Recent Drosophila studies on the computation of distinct visual features have shown that retinotopic representation is often lost beyond the optic lobes, due to convergence of columnar neuron types onto optic glomeruli. Nevertheless, functional imaging revealed a spatially accurate representation of visual cues in the central complex (CX), raising the question how this is implemented on a circuit level. By characterizing the afferents to a specific visual glomerulus, the anterior optic tubercle (AOTU), we discovered a spatial segregation of topographic versus non-topographic projections from molecularly distinct classes of medulla projection neurons (medullo-tubercular, or MeTu neurons). Distinct classes of topographic versus non-topographic MeTus form parallel channels, terminating in separate AOTU domains. Both types then synapse onto separate matching topographic fields of tubercular-bulbar (TuBu) neurons which relay visual information towards the dendritic fields of central complex ring neurons in the bulb neuropil, where distinct bulb sectors correspond to a distinct ring domain in the ellipsoid body. Hence, peripheral topography is maintained due to stereotypic circuitry within each TuBu class, providing the structural basis for spatial representation of visual information in the central complex. Together with previous data showing rough topography of lobula projections to a different AOTU subunit, our results further highlight the AOTUs role as a prominent relay station for spatial information from the retina to the central brain.

Rationale: In rodents, exposure to novel environments elicits initial anxiety-like behavior (neophobia) followed by intense exploration (neophilia) that gradually subsides as the environment becomes familiar. Thus, innate novelty-induced behaviors are useful indices of anxiety and motivation in animal models of psychiatric disease. Noradrenergic neurons are activated by novelty and implicated in exploratory and anxiety-like responses, but the role of norepinephrine (NE) in neophobia has not been clearly delineated. Objective: We sought to define the role of central NE transmission in neophilic and neophobic behaviors. Methods: We assessed dopamine {beta}-hydroxylase knockout (Dbh -/-) mice lacking NE and their NE-competent (Dbh +/-) littermate controls in neophilic (novelty-induced locomotion; NIL) and neophobic (novelty-suppressed feeding; NSF) behavioral tests with subsequent quantification of brain-wide c-fos induction. We complimented the gene knockout approach with pharmacological interventions. Results: Dbh -/- mice exhibited blunted locomotor responses in the NIL task and completely lacked neophobia in the NSF test. Neophobia was rescued in Dbh -/- mice by acute pharmacological restoration of central NE with the synthetic precursor L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylserine (DOPS), and attenuated in control mice by the inhibitory 2-adrenergic autoreceptor agonist guanfacine. Following either NSF or NIL, Dbh -/- mice demonstrated reduced c-fos in the anterior cingulate cortex, medial septum, ventral hippocampus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and basolateral amygdala. Conclusion: These findings indicate that central NE signaling is required for the expression of both neophilic and neophobic behaviors. Further, we describe a putative noradrenergic novelty network as a potential therapeutic target for treating anxiety and substance abuse disorders.

Human scene categorization is characterized by its remarkable speed. While many visual and conceptual features have been linked to this ability, significant correlations exist between feature spaces, impeding our ability to determine their relative contributions to scene categorization. Here, we employed a whitening transformation to decorrelate a variety of visual and conceptual features and assess the time course of their unique contributions to scene categorization. Participants (both sexes) viewed 2,250 full-color scene images drawn from 30 different scene categories while having their brain activity measured through 256-channel EEG. We examined the variance explained at each electrode and time point of visual event-related potential (vERP) data from nine different whitened encoding models. These ranged from low-level features obtained from filter outputs to high-level conceptual features requiring human annotation. The amount of category information in the vERPs was assessed through multivariate decoding methods. Behavioral similarity measures were obtained in separate crowdsourced experiments. We found that all nine models together contributed 78% of the variance of human scene similarity assessments and was within the noise ceiling of the vERP data. Low-level models explained earlier vERP variability (88 ms post-image onset), while high-level models explained later variance (169 ms). Critically, only high-level models shared vERP variability with behavior. Taken together, these results suggest that scene categorization is primarily a high-level process, but reliant on previously extracted low-level features.

The purpose of this coordinate based meta-analysis (CBMA) was to summarise the available evidence related to regional grey matter (GM) changes in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). CBMA is a way to find the consistent results across multiple independent studies that are otherwise not easily comparable due to methodological differences. The coordinate based random effect size (CBRES) meta-analysis method utilizes the reported coordinates (foci of the clusters of GM loss) and Z score standardised by number of subjects, controlling type I error rate by false cluster discovery rate (FCDR). Thirty-four published articles reporting forty-five independent studies using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) for the assessment of GM atrophy between MS or CIS patients and healthy controls were identified from electronic databases. The primary meta-analysis identified clusters of spatially consistent cross-study reporting of GM atrophy; subgroup analyses and meta-regression were also performed. This meta-analysis demonstrates consistent areas of GM loss in MS or CIS, in the form of significant clusters. Some clusters also demonstrate correlation with disease duration.

A major effort is now underway across the brain sciences to identify, characterize and manipulate mesoscale neural circuits in order to elucidate the mechanisms underlying sensory perception, cognition and behavior. Optical imaging technologies, in conjunction with genetically encoded sensors and actuators, serve as important tools toward these goals, allowing access to large-scale genetically defined neuronal populations. In particular, one-photon miniature microscopes, coupled with genetically encoded calcium indicators and microendoscopic gradient-refractive index (GRIN) lenses, enable unprecedented readout of neural circuit dynamics in cortical and deep subcortical brain regions during active behavior in rodents. This has already led to breakthrough discoveries across a wide array of rodent brain regions and behaviors. However, in order to study the neural circuit mechanisms underlying more complex and clinically relevant human behaviors and cognitive functions, it is crucial to translate this technology to non-human primates. Here, we describe the first successful application of this technology in the rhesus macaque. We identified a viral strategy for robust expression of GCaMP, optimized a surgical protocol for microendoscope GRIN lens insertion, and created a chronic cranial chamber and lens mounting system for imaging in gyral cortex. Using these methods, we demonstrate the ability to perform plug-and-play, head-mounted recordings of cellular-resolution calcium dynamics from over 100 genetically-targeted neurons simultaneously in dorsal premotor cortex while the macaque performs a naturalistic motor reach task with the head unrestrained and freely moving. The recorded population of neurons exhibited calcium dynamics selective to the direction of reach, which we show can be used to decode the animal's trial-by-trial motor behavior. Recordings were stable over several months, allowing us to longitudinally track large populations of individual neurons and monitor their relationship to motor behavior over time. Finally, we demonstrate the ability to conduct simultaneous, multi-site imaging in bilateral dorsal premotor cortices, offering an opportunity to study distributed networks underlying complex behavior and cognition. Together, this work establishes head-mounted microendoscopic calcium imaging in macaque as a powerful new approach for studying the neural circuit mechanisms underlying complex and clinically relevant behaviors, and promises to greatly advance our understanding of human brain function, as well as its dysfunction in neurological disease.

The failure of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a key component of degenerative neuromuscular disease, yet how NMJs degenerate in disease is unclear. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) offer the ability to model disease via differentiation toward affected cell types, however, the re-creation of an in vitro neuromuscular system has proven challenging. Here we present a scalable, all-hiPSC-derived co-culture system composed of independently derived spinal motor neurons (MNs) and skeletal myotubes (sKM). In a model of C9orf72-associated disease, co-cultures form functional NMJs that can be manipulated through optical stimulation, eliciting muscle contraction and measurable calcium flux in innervated sKM. Furthermore, co-cultures grown on multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) permit the pharmacological interrogation of neuromuscular physiology. Utilization of this co-culture model as a tunable, patient-derived system may offer significant insights into NMJ formation, maturation, repair, or pathogenic mechanisms that underlie NMJ dysfunction in disease.

A central goal of systems neuroscience is to understand the relationships amongst constituent units in neural populations and their modulation by external factors using high-dimensional and stochastic neural recordings. Statistical models, particularly parametric models, play an instrumental role in accomplishing this goal, because their fitted parameters can provide insight into the underlying biological processes that generated the data. However, extracting conclusions from a parametric model requires that it is fit using an inference procedure capable of selecting the correct parameters and properly estimating their values. Traditional approaches to parameter inference have been shown to suffer from failures in both selection and estimation. Recent development of algorithms that ameliorate these deficiencies raises the question of whether past work relying on such inference procedures have produced inaccurate systems neuroscience models, thereby impairing their interpretation. Here, we used the Union of Intersections, a statistical inference framework capable of state-of-the-art selection and estimation performance, to fit functional coupling, encoding, and decoding models across a battery of neural datasets. We found that, compared to baseline procedures, UoI inferred models with increased sparsity, improved stability, and qualitatively different parameter distributions, while maintaining predictive performance across recording modality, brain region, and task. Specifically, we obtained highly sparse functional coupling networks with substantially different community structure, more parsimonious encoding models, and decoding models that rely on fewer single-units. Together, these results demonstrate that accurate parameter inference reshapes interpretation in diverse neuroscience contexts. The ubiquity of model-based data-driven discovery in biology suggests that analogous results would be seen in other fields.

Introduction: Cross-sectional studies suggest that cardiovascular risk factors and Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers are associated with abnormal brain resting-state functional connectivity in aging and AD; however, evidence is missing regarding longitudinal changes in functional connectivity. In this study, we investigate whether cholesterol levels and blood pressure are associated with changes in functional connectivity over time in asymptomatic individuals at risk for AD. The analyses were repeated with cerebral {beta}-amyloid (A{beta}) and tau deposition in a subset of the participants. Methods: The study sample included 247 cognitively unimpaired individuals (185 women/ 62 men; mean [SD] age of 63 [5.3] years) of the PREVENT-AD cohort with a parental or multiple-sibling history of sporadic AD. Plasma total-, HDL-, and LDL-cholesterol and systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured at baseline. Global brain functional connectivity, and connectivity from canonical functional networks, were computed from resting-state functional MRI obtained at baseline and up to four years of annual follow-ups, using a predefined functional parcellation. A subset of participants underwent tau-PET ([18F]Flortaucipir) and A{beta}-PET ([18F]NAV4694). Vascular and AD measures were examined as predictors of brain functional connectivity changes in linear mixed-effects models. Results: Higher total-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels were associated with greater reduction of functional connectivity in the default-mode network over time. In addition, while overall whole-brain functional connectivity showed an increase over time across the entire sample higher diastolic blood pressure was associated with reduction in whole-brain functional connectivity. The associations were similar when the analyses were repeated using two other functional brain parcellations. The findings with total-cholesterol and diastolic blood pressure were also similar but attenuated when performed in a subsample of participants with PET (n=91), whereas AD biomarkers were not associated with changes in functional connectivity over time in this subsample. Conclusion: These findings provide evidence that vascular burden is associated with a decrease in brain functional connectivity over time in older adults with elevated risk for AD. The impact of vascular risk factors on functional brain changes might precede AD pathology-related changes.

Humans have the ability to retrieve memories with various degrees of specificity, and recent advances in reinforcement learning have identified benefits to learning when past experience is represented at different levels of temporal abstraction. How this flexibility might be implemented in the brain remains unclear. We analyzed the temporal organization of rat hippocampal population spiking to identify potential substrates for temporally flexible representations. We examined activity both during locomotion and during memory-retrieval-associated population events known as sharp wave-ripples (SWRs). We found that spiking during SWRs is rhythmically organized with higher event-to-event variability than spiking during locomotion-associated population events. Decoding analyses using clusterless methods further suggest that similar spatial experience can be replayed in multiple SWRs, each time with a different rhythmic structure whose periodicity is sampled from a lognormal distribution. This variability is preserved despite the decline in SWR rates that occurs as environments become more familiar: in more familiar environments the width of the lognormal distribution increases, further enhancing the range of temporal variability. We hypothesize that the variability in temporal organization of hippocampal spiking provides a mechanism for retrieving remembered experiences with various degrees of specificity.

LRRK2 mutations cause Parkinson's, but the molecular link from increased kinase activity to pathological neurodegeneration remains undetermined. Previous in vitro assays indicate that LRRK2 substrates include at least 8 Rab GTPases. We have now examined this hypothesis in vivo in a functional, electroretinogram screen, expressing each Rab with/without LRRK2-G2019S in selected Drosophila dopaminergic neurons. Our screen discriminated Rab10 from Rab3. The strongest Rab/LRRK2-G2019S interaction is with Rab10; the weakest with Rab3. Rab10is expressed in dopaminergic neurons controlling vision where Rab3 is undetectable. Thus, anatomical and physiological patterns of Rab10 are related. We conclude that Rab10 is a valid substrate of LRRK2 in dopaminergic neurons in vivo. We propose that variations in Rab expression contribute to differences in the rate of neurodegeneration recorded in different dopaminergic nuclei in Parkinson's.

Widely available low-cost electronics encourage the development of open-source tools for neuroscientific research. In recent years, many neuroscientists recognized the open science movement for its potential to stimulate and encourage science that is less focused on money, and more on robustness, validity, questioning and understanding. Here, we wanted to contribute to this global community by creating a research platform based on a common digital kitchen scale. This everyday ordinary kitchen tool is sometimes used in neuroscience research in various ways; however, its use is limited by sampling rate and inability to store and analyze data. To tackle this problem we developed a Platform for Auditory STArtle or PASTA. This robust and simple platform enables users to obtain data from kitchen scale load cells at a high sampling rate, store it and analyze it. Here, we used it to analyze acoustic startle and prepulse inhibition sensorimotor gating in rats treated intracerebroventricularly with streptozotocin, but the system can be easily modified and upgraded for other purposes. In accordance with open science principles, we shared complete hardware design with instructions. Furthermore, we also disclose our software codes written for PASTA data acquisition (C++, Arduino) and acoustic startle experimental protocol (Python) and analysis (R-based Awesome Toolbox for PASTA, ratPASTA R package). To further encourage the development of our PASTA platform we demonstrate its sensitivity by using PASTA-gathered data to extract breathing patterns during rat freezing behavior in our experimental protocol.

Imaging of large-scale circuit dynamics is crucial to gain a better understanding of brain function, but most techniques have a limited depth of field. Here we describe vfUSI, a platform for brain-wide volumetric functional ultrasound imaging of hemodynamic activity in awake head-fixed mice. We combined high-frequency 1024-channel 2D-array transducer with advanced multiplexing and high-performance computing for real-time 3D Power Doppler imaging at high spatiotemporal resolution (220x280x175-m3 voxel size, up to 6 Hz). In addition, we developed a standardized software pipeline for registration and segmentation based on the Allen Mouse Common Coordinate Framework, allowing for temporal analysis in 268 individual brain regions. We demonstrate the high sensitivity of vfUSI in multiple experimental situations where stimulus-evoked activity can be recorded using a minimal number of trials. We also mapped neural circuits in vivo across the whole brain during optogenetic activation of specific cell-types. Moreover, we revealed the sequential activation of sensory-motor regions during a grasping water droplet task. vfUSI will become a key neuroimaging technology because it combines ease of use, reliability, and affordability.

<p>Histological sections and electroretinography suggest the presence of a heavily rod dominated (and possibly rod‐only) retina in Port Jackson sharks. Mapping of the distribution of retinal neurons reveals a specialisation for higher visual acuity in a narrow horizontal band that corresponds to the part of the visual field covering the water‐substrate interface. Such a specialized retina would be well‐adapted to low‐light (scotopic) vision and a benthic lifestyle, and may assist the shark in finding food and avoiding predators.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In this study, we investigated the visual system of the Port Jackson shark <i>Heterodontus portusjacksoni</i>, a shallow‐dwelling benthic species and generalist predator endemic to the temperate coastal waters around southern Australia. Measurements of retinal spectral sensitivity in juvenile sharks, made using single flash and heterochromatic flicker photometry under conditions of dark‐ or light‐adaptation, indicated a peak sensitivity at around 500 nm, with no evidence of a spectral shift with increasing levels of light adaptation. Histological sections of the retina revealed a heavily rod dominated retina containing only a few small cell profiles in the photoreceptor layer that might represent a sparse cone population or may be immature rods. Assessment of retinal topography in juvenile sharks indicated the presence of a distinct specialisation for increased visual spatial acuity in the form of a horizontal streak of higher rod photoreceptor (~80,000 rods mm<sup>−2</sup>) and ganglion cell (~1,800 cells mm<sup>−2</sup>) densities across the horizontal meridian of the eye. This specialization would be adaptive for panoramic sampling of the part of the visual field corresponding to the substrate‐water interface and remove the need for <i>H. portusjacksoni</i> to move its eyes extensively when resting on the sea floor. The estimated upper limit of spatial resolving power in juvenile <i>H. portusjacksoni</i> was 3.14 cycles deg<sup>−1</sup>, which is at the lower end of values measured in elasmobranchs. Taken together, these results suggest that the retina of <i>H. portusjacksoni</i> is well adapted for nocturnal vision.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Depression is a mental illness which is harmful seriously to the society. This study investigated the effects of fluoxetine on the CNPase<sup>+</sup> oligodendrocytes in hippocampus of the depressed rats to explore the new target structure of antidepressants. Male Sprague–Dawley rats were used to build chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) depressed model of rats. Then, the depressed rats were divided into the CUS standard group and the CUS + fluoxetine (CUS/FLX) group. The CUS/FLX group was treated with fluoxetine at dose of 5 mg/(kg·d) from the fifth week to seventh week. After 7 weeks CUS intervention, the sucrose preference of the CUS standard group was significantly lower than that of the control group and the CUS/FLX group. The stereological results showed that the total number of the CNPase<sup>+</sup> cells in the CA1, CA3, and DG subfield of the hippocampus in the CUS standard group were significantly decreased, when compared with the CNPase<sup>+</sup> cells in the control group. However, the total number of the CNPase<sup>+</sup> cells in the CA1 and CA3 subfield of the hippocampus in the CUS standard group was significantly decreased when it compared with CNPase<sup>+</sup> cells in the CUS/FLX group. Therefore, fluoxetine might prevent the loss of CNPase<sup>+</sup> oligodendrocytes in CA1 and CA3 subfields of hippocampus of the depressed rats. The oligodendrocytes in hippocampus may play an important role in the pathogenesis of depression. The current result might provide structural basis for the future studies that search for new antidepressant strategies.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Observational studies point to an inverse correlation between LDL cholesterol levels and risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), but it remains unclear whether this association is causal. We tested the hypothesis that genetically‐elevated LDL is associated with reduced risk of ICH.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We constructed one polygenic risk score (PRS) per lipid trait (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL and triglycerides) using independent genome‐wide significant SNPs for each trait. We used data from 316,428 individuals enrolled in the UK Biobank to estimate the effect of each PRS on its corresponding trait, and data from 1,286 ICH cases and 1,261 matched controls to estimate the effect of each PRS on ICH risk. We used these estimates to conduct Mendelian Randomization analyses.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 410, 339, 393, and 317 lipid‐related SNPs for total cholesterol, LDL, HDL and triglycerides, respectively. All four PRSs were strongly associated with their corresponding trait (all p&lt;1x10<sup>‐100</sup>). While one standard deviation increase in the PRSs for total cholesterol (OR 0.92, 95%CI 0.85‐0.99; <i>p</i>=0.03) and LDL cholesterol (OR 0.88; 95%CI, 0.81‐0.95; <i>p</i>=0.002) were inversely associated with ICH risk, no significant associations were found for HDL and triglycerides (both p&gt;0.05). Mendelian Randomization analyses indicated that 1 mmol/L (38.67 mg/dL) increase of genetically‐instrumented total and LDL cholesterol were associated with 23% (OR 0.77; 95%CI 0.65‐0.98; <i>p</i>=0.03) and 41% lower risks of ICH (OR 0.59; 95%CI 0.42‐0.82; <i>p</i>=0.002), respectively.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Genetically elevated LDL levels were associated with lower risk of ICH, providing support for a potential causal role of LDL cholesterol in ICH.</p>

Clinical observations support the hypothesis that stressful events increase relapse occurrence in multiple sclerosis patients, while stress-reduction strategies can modulate this effect. However, a direct cause-effect relationship between stress level and relapse cannot be firmly established from these data. The purpose of this work was to address whether modulation of stress could interfere with symptom relapse in an animal model of multiple sclerosis with relapsing-remitting course. We report that repeated acute stress induced a twofold increase in relapse incidence in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. On the other hand, environmental enrichment reduced relapse incidence and severity, and reversed the effects of repeated acute stress. These data provide the platform for further studies on the biological processes that link stress and multiple sclerosis relapses in a suitable animal model.

Repetitive behavior is a core symptom of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), and has been associated with impairments in cognitive control. However, it is unclear how cognitive control and associated neural circuitry relate to the development of repetitive behavior in children with these disorders. In a multicenter, longitudinal study (TACTICS; Translational Adolescent and Childhood Therapeutic Interventions in Compulsive Syndromes), the development of cognitive control was assessed during late childhood using a longitudinal fMRI design with a modified stop-signal task in children with ASD or OCD, and typically developing (TD) children (baseline: N=122 (8-12y), follow-up: N=72 (10-14y), average interval: 1.2y). Stop-signal reaction time (SSRT) decreased over development, regardless of diagnosis. Repetitive behavior in children with ASD and OCD was not associated with performance on the stop-signal task. There were no whole-brain between-group differences in brain activity, but ROI-analyses showed increases in activity in right precentral gyrus over development for children with OCD. In sum, even though subtle differences were observed in the development of brain activity in children with OCD, the findings overall suggest that the development of cognitive control, as assessed by the stop signal task, is similar in children with and without ASD or OCD.

<p>by Loïc Marrec, Anne-Florence Bitbol</p>

The evolution of antimicrobial resistance can be strongly affected by variations of antimicrobial concentration. Here, we study the impact of periodic alternations of absence and presence of antimicrobial on resistance evolution in a microbial population, using a stochastic model that includes variations of both population composition and size, and fully incorporates stochastic population extinctions. We show that fast alternations of presence and absence of antimicrobial are inefficient to eradicate the microbial population and strongly favor the establishment of resistance, unless the antimicrobial increases enough the death rate. We further demonstrate that if the period of alternations is longer than a threshold value, the microbial population goes extinct upon the first addition of antimicrobial, if it is not rescued by resistance. We express the probability that the population is eradicated upon the first addition of antimicrobial, assuming rare mutations. Rescue by resistance can happen either if resistant mutants preexist, or if they appear after antimicrobial is added to the environment. Importantly, the latter case is fully prevented by perfect biostatic antimicrobials that completely stop division of sensitive microorganisms. By contrast, we show that the parameter regime where treatment is efficient is larger for biocidal drugs than for biostatic drugs. This sheds light on the respective merits of different antimicrobial modes of action.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FzN99y_HHm0" width="1" />

<p>by Augusto Anguita-Ruiz, Alberto Segura-Delgado, Rafael Alcalá, Concepción M. Aguilera, Jesús Alcalá-Fdez</p>

Until date, several machine learning approaches have been proposed for the dynamic modeling of temporal omics data. Although they have yielded impressive results in terms of model accuracy and predictive ability, most of these applications are based on “Black-box” algorithms and more interpretable models have been claimed by the research community. The recent eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) revolution offers a solution for this issue, were rule-based approaches are highly suitable for explanatory purposes. The further integration of the data mining process along with functional-annotation and pathway analyses is an additional way towards more explanatory and biologically soundness models. In this paper, we present a novel rule-based XAI strategy (including pre-processing, knowledge-extraction and functional validation) for finding biologically relevant sequential patterns from longitudinal human gene expression data (GED). To illustrate the performance of our pipeline, we work on <i>in vivo</i> temporal GED collected within the course of a long-term dietary intervention in 57 subjects with obesity (GSE77962). As validation populations, we employ three independent datasets following the same experimental design. As a result, we validate primarily extracted gene patterns and prove the goodness of our strategy for the mining of biologically relevant gene-gene temporal relations. Our whole pipeline has been gathered under open-source software and could be easily extended to other human temporal GED applications.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VxEAvEP_3rw" width="1" />

<p>by Pablo Rodríguez-Sínchez, Egbert H. Van Nes, Marten Scheffer</p>

Stability landscapes are useful for understanding the properties of dynamical systems. These landscapes can be calculated from the system’s dynamical equations using the physical concept of scalar potential. Unfortunately, it is well known that for most systems with two or more state variables such potentials do not exist. Here we use an analogy with art to provide an accessible explanation of why this happens and briefly review some of the possible alternatives. Additionally, we introduce a novel and simple computational tool that implements one of those solutions: the decomposition of the differential equations into a gradient term, that has an associated potential, and a non-gradient term, that lacks it. In regions of the state space where the magnitude of the non-gradient term is small compared to the gradient part, we use the gradient term to approximate the potential as quasi-potential. The non-gradient to gradient ratio can be used to estimate the local error introduced by our approximation. Both the algorithm and a ready-to-use implementation in the form of an R package are provided.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6kMIiATtZHs" width="1" />

<p>by Neythen J. Treloar, Alex J. H. Fedorec, Brian Ingalls, Chris P. Barnes</p>

Multi-species microbial communities are widespread in natural ecosystems. When employed for biomanufacturing, engineered synthetic communities have shown increased productivity in comparison with monocultures and allow for the reduction of metabolic load by compartmentalising bioprocesses between multiple sub-populations. Despite these benefits, co-cultures are rarely used in practice because control over the constituent species of an assembled community has proven challenging. Here we demonstrate, <i>in silico</i>, the efficacy of an approach from artificial intelligence—reinforcement learning—for the control of co-cultures within continuous bioreactors. We confirm that feedback via a trained reinforcement learning agent can be used to maintain populations at target levels, and that model-free performance with bang-bang control can outperform a traditional proportional integral controller with continuous control, when faced with infrequent sampling. Further, we demonstrate that a satisfactory control policy can be learned in one twenty-four hour experiment by running five bioreactors in parallel. Finally, we show that reinforcement learning can directly optimise the output of a co-culture bioprocess. Overall, reinforcement learning is a promising technique for the control of microbial communities.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EZVzHlzJKjo" width="1" />

<p>by Yangqing Deng, Wei Pan</p>

Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS and PrediXcan) have been increasingly applied to detect associations between genetically predicted gene expressions and GWAS traits, which may suggest, however do not completely determine, causal genes for GWAS traits, due to the likely violation of their imposed strong assumptions for causal inference. Testing colocalization moves it closer to establishing causal relationships: if a GWAS trait and a gene’s expression share the same associated SNP, it may suggest a regulatory (and thus putative causal) role of the SNP medicated through the gene on the GWAS trait. Accordingly, it is of interest to develop and apply various colocalization testing approaches. The existing approaches may each have some severe limitations. For instance, some methods test the null hypothesis that there is colocalization, which is not ideal because often the null hypothesis cannot be rejected simply due to limited statistical power (with too small sample sizes). Some other methods arbitrarily restrict the maximum number of causal SNPs in a locus, which may lead to loss of power in the presence of wide-spread allelic heterogeneity. Importantly, most methods cannot be applied to either GWAS/eQTL summary statistics or cases with more than two possibly correlated traits. Here we present a simple and general approach based on conditional analysis of a locus on multiple traits, overcoming the above and other shortcomings of the existing methods. We demonstrate that, compared with other methods, our new method can be applied to a wider range of scenarios and often perform better. We showcase its applications to both simulated and real data, including a large-scale Alzheimer’s disease GWAS summary dataset and a gene expression dataset, and a large-scale blood lipid GWAS summary association dataset. An R package “jointsum” implementing the proposed method is publicly available at github.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/X5AKR64ZCtk" width="1" />

Precision oncology has primarily relied on coding mutations as biomarkers of response to therapies. While transcriptome analysis can provide valuable information, incorporation into workflows has been difficult. For example, the relative rather than absolute gene expression level needs to be considered, requiring differential expression analysis across samples. However, expression programs related to the cell-of-origin and tumor microenvironment effects confound the search for cancer-specific expression changes. To address these challenges, we developed an unsupervised clustering approach for discovering differential pathway expression within cancer cohorts using gene expression measurements. The hydra approach uses a Dirichlet process mixture model to automatically detect multimodally distributed genes and expression signatures without the need for matched normal tissue. We demonstrate that the hydra approach is more sensitive than widely-used gene set enrichment approaches for detecting multimodal expression signatures. Application of the hydra analysis framework to small blue round cell tumors (including rhabdomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, neuroblastoma, Ewing sarcoma, and osteosarcoma) identified expression signatures associated with changes in the tumor microenvironment. The hydra approach also identified an association between <i>ATRX</i> deletions and elevated immune marker expression in high-risk neuroblastoma. Notably, hydra analysis of all small blue round cell tumors revealed similar subtypes, characterized by changes to infiltrating immune and stromal expression signatures.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3f0I3ie1vpQ" width="1" />

<p>by David F. Little, Joel S. Snyder, Mounya Elhilali</p>

Perceptual bistability—the spontaneous, irregular fluctuation of perception between two interpretations of a stimulus—occurs when observing a large variety of ambiguous stimulus configurations. This phenomenon has the potential to serve as a tool for, among other things, understanding how function varies across individuals due to the large individual differences that manifest during perceptual bistability. Yet it remains difficult to interpret the functional processes at work, without knowing where bistability arises during perception. In this study we explore the hypothesis that bistability originates from multiple sources distributed across the perceptual hierarchy. We develop a hierarchical model of auditory processing comprised of three distinct levels: a Peripheral, tonotopic analysis, a Central analysis computing features found more centrally in the auditory system, and an Object analysis, where sounds are segmented into different streams. We model bistable perception within this system by applying adaptation, inhibition and noise into one or all of the three levels of the hierarchy. We evaluate a large ensemble of variations of this hierarchical model, where each model has a different configuration of adaptation, inhibition and noise. This approach avoids the assumption that a single configuration must be invoked to explain the data. Each model is evaluated based on its ability to replicate two hallmarks of bistability during auditory streaming: the selectivity of bistability to specific stimulus configurations, and the characteristic log-normal pattern of perceptual switches. Consistent with a distributed origin, a broad range of model parameters across this hierarchy lead to a plausible form of perceptual bistability.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/N1GrRito7qo" width="1" />

<p>by Guido Maiello, Manuela Chessa, Peter J. Bex, Fabio Solari</p>

The human visual system is foveated: we can see fine spatial details in central vision, whereas resolution is poor in our peripheral visual field, and this loss of resolution follows an approximately logarithmic decrease. Additionally, our brain organizes visual input in polar coordinates. Therefore, the image projection occurring between retina and primary visual cortex can be mathematically described by the log-polar transform. Here, we test and model how this space-variant visual processing affects how we process binocular disparity, a key component of human depth perception. We observe that the fovea preferentially processes disparities at fine spatial scales, whereas the visual periphery is tuned for coarse spatial scales, in line with the naturally occurring distributions of depths and disparities in the real-world. We further show that the visual system integrates disparity information across the visual field, in a near-optimal fashion. We develop a foveated, log-polar model that mimics the processing of depth information in primary visual cortex and that can process disparity directly in the cortical domain representation. This model takes real images as input and recreates the observed topography of human disparity sensitivity. Our findings support the notion that our foveated, binocular visual system has been moulded by the statistics of our visual environment.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0piufpx5arc" width="1" />

The development of novel analgesics with improved safety profiles to combat the opioid epidemic represents a central question to G protein coupled receptor structural biology and pharmacology: What chemical features dictate G protein or β-arrestin signaling? Here we use adaptively biased molecular dynamics simulations to determine how fentanyl, a potent β-arrestin biased agonist, binds the μ-opioid receptor (μOR). The resulting fentanyl-bound pose provides rational insight into a wealth of historical structure-activity-relationship on its chemical scaffold. Following an in-silico derived hypothesis we found that fentanyl and the synthetic opioid peptide DAMGO require M153 to induce β-arrestin coupling, while M153 was dispensable for G protein coupling. We propose and validate an activation mechanism where the n-aniline ring of fentanyl mediates μOR β-arrestin through a novel M153 “microswitch” by synthesizing fentanyl-based derivatives that exhibit complete, clinically desirable, G protein biased coupling. Together, these results provide molecular insight into fentanyl mediated β-arrestin biased signaling and a rational framework for further optimization of fentanyl-based analgesics with improved safety profiles.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CkJXXUV_S5w" width="1" />

Accurate manipulation of metabolites in monolignol biosynthesis is a key step for controlling lignin content, structure, and other wood properties important to the bioenergy and biomaterial industries. A crucial component of this strategy is predicting how single and combinatorial knockdowns of monolignol specific gene transcripts influence the abundance of monolignol proteins, which are the driving mechanisms of monolignol biosynthesis. Computational models have been developed to estimate protein abundances from transcript perturbations of monolignol specific genes. The accuracy of these models, however, is hindered by their inability to capture indirect regulatory influences on other pathway genes. Here, we examine the manifestation of these indirect influences on transgenic transcript and protein abundances, identifying putative indirect regulatory influences that occur when one or more specific monolignol pathway genes are perturbed. We created a computational model using sparse maximum likelihood to estimate the resulting monolignol transcript and protein abundances in transgenic <i>Populus trichocarpa</i> based on targeted knockdowns of specific monolignol genes. Using <i>in-silico</i> simulations of this model and root mean square error, we showed that our model more accurately estimated transcript and protein abundances, in comparison to previous models, when individual and families of monolignol genes were perturbed. We leveraged insight from the inferred network structure obtained from our model to identify potential genes, including <i>PtrHCT</i>, <i>PtrCAD</i>, and <i>Ptr4CL</i>, involved in post-transcriptional and/or post-translational regulation. Our model provides a useful computational tool for exploring the cascaded impact of single and combinatorial modifications of monolignol specific genes on lignin and other wood properties.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/posucfjp_EY" width="1" />

DNA methylation is a heritable epigenetic modification that plays an essential role in mammalian development. Genomic methylation patterns are dynamically maintained, with DNA methyltransferases mediating inheritance of methyl marks onto nascent DNA over cycles of replication. A recently developed experimental technique employing immunoprecipitation of bromodeoxyuridine labeled nascent DNA followed by bisulfite sequencing (Repli-BS) measures post-replication temporal evolution of cytosine methylation, thus enabling genome-wide monitoring of methylation maintenance. In this work, we combine statistical analysis and stochastic mathematical modeling to analyze Repli-BS data from human embryonic stem cells. We estimate site-specific kinetic rate constants for the restoration of methyl marks on &gt;10 million uniquely mapped cytosines within the CpG (cytosine-phosphate-guanine) dinucleotide context across the genome using Maximum Likelihood Estimation. We find that post-replication remethylation rate constants span approximately two orders of magnitude, with half-lives of per-site recovery of steady-state methylation levels ranging from shorter than ten minutes to five hours and longer. Furthermore, we find that kinetic constants of maintenance methylation are correlated among neighboring CpG sites. Stochastic mathematical modeling provides insight to the biological mechanisms underlying the inference results, suggesting that enzyme processivity and/or collaboration can produce the observed kinetic correlations. Our combined statistical/mathematical modeling approach expands the utility of genomic datasets and disentangles heterogeneity in methylation patterns arising from replication-associated temporal dynamics versus stable cell-to-cell differences.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/x4NZ8btGDwI" width="1" />

It is well known that various developmental signals play diverse roles in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) production; however, how these signaling pathways are orchestrated remains incompletely understood. Here, we report that Rab5c is essential for HSPC specification by endocytic trafficking of Notch and AKT signaling in zebrafish embryos. Rab5c deficiency leads to defects in HSPC production. Mechanistically, Rab5c regulates hemogenic endothelium (HE) specification by endocytic trafficking of Notch ligands and receptor. We further show that the interaction between Rab5c and Appl1 in the endosome is required for the survival of HE in the ventral wall of the dorsal aorta through AKT signaling. Interestingly, Rab5c overactivation can also lead to defects in HSPC production, which is attributed to excessive endolysosomal trafficking inducing Notch signaling defect. Taken together, our findings establish a previously unrecognized role of Rab5c-mediated endocytic trafficking in HSPC development and provide new insights into how spatiotemporal signals are orchestrated to accurately execute cell fate transition.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/3grO__e7BHw" width="1" />

5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is the most prevalent intermediate on the oxidative DNA demethylation pathway and is implicated in regulation of embryogenesis, neurological processes, and cancerogenesis. Profiling of this relatively scarce genomic modification in clinical samples requires cost-effective high-resolution techniques that avoid harsh chemical treatment. Here, we present a bisulfite-free approach for 5hmC profiling at single-nucleotide resolution, named hmTOP-seq (5hmC-specific tethered oligonucleotide–primed sequencing), which is based on direct sequence readout primed at covalently labeled 5hmC sites from an in situ tethered DNA oligonucleotide. Examination of distinct conjugation chemistries suggested a structural model for the tether-directed nonhomologous polymerase priming enabling theoretical evaluation of suitable tethers at the design stage. The hmTOP-seq procedure was optimized and validated on a small model genome and mouse embryonic stem cells, which allowed construction of single-nucleotide 5hmC maps reflecting subtle differences in strand-specific CG hydroxymethylation. Collectively, hmTOP-seq provides a new valuable tool for cost-effective and precise identification of 5hmC in characterizing its biological role and epigenetic changes associated with human disease.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/gTHTldw7j58" width="1" />

The correct subcellular distribution of proteins establishes the complex morphology and function of neurons. Fluorescence microscopy techniques are invaluable to investigate subcellular protein distribution, but they suffer from the limited ability to efficiently and reliably label endogenous proteins with fluorescent probes. We developed ORANGE: Open Resource for the Application of Neuronal Genome Editing, which mediates targeted genomic integration of epitope tags in rodent dissociated neuronal culture, in organotypic slices, and in vivo. ORANGE includes a knock-in library for in-depth investigation of endogenous protein distribution, viral vectors, and a detailed two-step cloning protocol to develop knock-ins for novel targets. Using ORANGE with (live-cell) superresolution microscopy, we revealed the dynamic nanoscale organization of endogenous neurotransmitter receptors and synaptic scaffolding proteins, as well as previously uncharacterized proteins. Finally, we developed a mechanism to create multiple knock-ins in neurons, mediating multiplex imaging of endogenous proteins. Thus, ORANGE enables quantification of expression, distribution, and dynamics for virtually any protein in neurons at nanoscale resolution.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/gHdYOFd1lD8" width="1" />

<p>Transformations between sensory representations are shaped by neural mechanisms at the cellular and the circuit level. In the insect olfactory system, the encoding of odor information undergoes a transition from a dense spatiotemporal population code in the antennal lobe to a sparse code in the mushroom body. However, the exact mechanisms shaping odor representations and their role in sensory processing are incompletely identified. Here, we investigate the transformation from dense to sparse odor representations in a spiking model of the insect olfactory system, focusing on two ubiquitous neural mechanisms: spike frequency adaptation at the cellular level and lateral inhibition at the circuit level. We find that cellular adaptation is essential for sparse representations in time (temporal sparseness), while lateral inhibition regulates sparseness in the neuronal space (population sparseness). The interplay of both mechanisms shapes spatiotemporal odor representations, which are optimized for the discrimination of odors during stimulus onset and offset. Response pattern correlation across different stimuli showed a nonmonotonic dependence on the strength of lateral inhibition with an optimum at intermediate levels, which is explained by two counteracting mechanisms. In addition, we find that odor identity is stored on a prolonged timescale in the adaptation levels but not in the spiking activity of the principal cells of the mushroom body, providing a testable hypothesis for the location of the so-called odor trace.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The study of cortical gyrification in Alzheimer's disease (AD) could help to further understanding of the changes undergone in the brain during neurodegeneration. Here we aimed to study brain gyrification differences between healthy controls (HC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, and AD patients, and explore how cerebral gyrification patterns were associated with memory and other cognitive functions.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We applied surface‐based morphometry techniques in two large, independent cross‐sectional samples, obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) project. Both samples, encompassing a total of 1,270 participants, were analyzed independently.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Unexpectedly, we found that AD patients presented a more gyrificated entorhinal cortex than HC. Conversely, the insular cortex of AD patients was hypogyrificated. A decrease in the gyrification of the insular cortex was also found in older HC participants as compared with younger HC, which argues against the specificity of this finding in AD. However, an increased degree of folding of the insular cortex was specifically associated with better memory function and semantic fluency, only in AD patients. Overall, MCI patients presented an intermediate gyrification pattern. All these findings were consistently observed in the two samples.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The marked atrophy of the medial temporal lobe observed in AD patients may explain the increased folding of the entorhinal cortex. We additionally speculate with alternative mechanisms that may also alter its folding. The association between increased gyrification of the insular cortex and memory function, specifically observed in AD, could be suggestive of compensatory mechanisms to overcome the loss of memory function.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Assess occurrence of the dendritic spine scaffolding protein drebrin as a pathophysiologically relevant autoantibody target in patients with recurrent seizures and suspected encephalitis as leading symptoms.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Sera of 4 patients with adult onset epilepsy and suspected encephalitis of unresolved etiology and equivalent results in autoantibody screening were subjected to epitope identification. We combined a wide array of approaches, ranging from immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, subcellular binding pattern analyses in primary neuronal cultures, and immunohistochemistry in brains of wild‐type and drebrin knockout mice to in vitro analyses of impaired synapse formation, morphology, and aberrant neuronal excitability by antibody exposure.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the serum of a patient with adult onset epilepsy and suspected encephalitis, a strong signal at ∼70kDa was detected by immunoblotting, for which mass spectrometry revealed drebrin as the putative antigen. Three other patients whose sera also showed strong immunoreactivity around 70kDa on Western blotting were also anti‐Drebrin‐positive. Seizures, memory impairment, and increased protein content in cerebrospinal fluid occurred in anti‐Drebrin‐seropositive patients. Alterations in cerebral magnetic resonance imaging comprised amygdalohippocampal T2‐signal increase and hippocampal sclerosis. Diagnostic biopsy revealed T‐lymphocytic encephalitis in an anti‐Drebrin‐seropositive patient. Exposure of primary hippocampal neurons to anti‐Drebrin autoantibodies resulted in aberrant synapse composition and drebrin distribution as well as increased spike rates and the emergence of burst discharges reflecting network hyperexcitability.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Anti‐drebrin autoantibodies define a chronic syndrome of recurrent seizures and neuropsychiatric impairment as well as inflammation of limbic and occasionally cortical structures. Immunosuppressant therapies should be considered in this disorder. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<p>Observational studies have shown alcohol drinking behaviors may be associated with the risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but contradictory findings have emerged, and whether such an association is causal is unclear. We here investigate the causal relationship between alcohol consumption and ALS. By leveraging instruments from large‐scale genome‐wide association studies, we performed a comprehensive Mendelian randomization analysis and found alcohol consumption was causally associated with ALS, leading to ∼1.5‐fold (95% confidence interval = 1.4–3.4) higher risk of ALS for each ∼10g/day increase in alcohol intake. Our findings suggest accumulative alcohol consumption may serve as a crucial risk factor in the pathogenesis of ALS. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus and dorsal striatum are both associated with temporal processing, but they are thought to play distinct roles. The hippocampus has been reported to contribute to storing temporal structure of events in memory, whereas the striatum contributes to temporal motor preparation and reward anticipation. Here, we asked whether the striatum cooperates with the hippocampus in processing the temporal context of memorized visual associations. In our task, participants were trained to implicitly form temporal expectations for one of two possible time intervals associated to specific cue‐target associations, and subsequently were scanned using ultra‐high‐field 7T functional magnetic resonance imaging. During scanning, learned temporal expectations could be violated when the pairs were presented at either the associated or not‐associated time intervals. When temporal expectations were met during testing trials, activity in left and right hippocampal subfields and right putamen decreased, compared to when temporal expectations were not met. Further, psycho‐physiological interactions showed that functional connectivity between left hippocampal subfields and caudate decreased when temporal expectations were not met. Our results indicate that the hippocampus and striatum cooperate to process implicit temporal expectation from mnemonic associations. Our findings provide further support for a hippocampal‐striatal network in temporal associative processing.</p>

<p>Music Generation (MG) is an interesting research topic that links the art of
music and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The goal is to train an artificial
composer to generate infinite, fresh, and pleasurable musical pieces. Music has
different parts such as melody, harmony, and rhythm. In this paper, we propose
a Generative Genetic Algorithm (GGA) to produce a melody automatically. The
main GGA uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network as the
objective function, which should be trained by a spectrum of bad-to-good
melodies. These melodies have to be provided by another GGA with a different
objective function. Good melodies have been provided by CAMPINs collection. We
have considered the rhythm in this work, too. The experimental results clearly
show that the proposed GGA method is able to generate eligible melodies with
natural transitions and without rhythm error.

<p>Understanding the decision process underlying gaze control is an important
question in cognitive neuroscience with applications in diverse fields ranging
from psychology to computer vision. The decision for choosing an upcoming
saccade target can be framed as a dilemma: Should the observer further exploit
the information near the current gaze position or continue with exploration of
other patches within the given scene? While several models attempt to describe
the dynamics of saccade target selection, none of them explicitly addresses the
underlying Exploration--Exploitation dilemma. Here we propose and investigate a
mathematical model motivated by the Exploration--Exploitation dilemma in scene
viewing. The model is derived from a minimal set of assumptions that generates
realistic eye movement behavior. We implemented a Bayesian approach for model
parameter inference based on the model's likelihood function. In order to
simplify the inference, we applied data augmentation methods that allowed the
use of conjugate priors and the construction of an efficient Gibbs sampler.
This approach turned out to be numerically efficient and permitted fitting
interindividual differences in saccade statistics. Thus, the main contribution
of our modeling approach is two--fold; first, we propose a new model for
saccade generation in scene viewing. Second, we demonstrate the use of novel
methods from Bayesian inference in the field of scan path modeling.

while reducing training resource requirements, e.g. time and memory. We ask how
much data reduction impacts generator performance and gauge the additive value
of generator ensembles. In addition to considering stand-alone GAN training and
ensembles of generator models, we also consider reduced data training on an
evolutionary GAN training framework named Redux-Lipizzaner. Redux-Lipizzaner
makes GAN training more robust and accurate by exploiting overlapping
neighborhood-based training on a spatial 2D grid. We conduct empirical
experiments on Redux-Lipizzaner using the MNIST and CelebA data sets.

<p>Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are widely used to learn generative
models. GANs consist of two networks, a generator and a discriminator, that
apply adversarial learning to optimize their parameters. This article presents
a parallel/distributed implementation of a cellular competitive coevolutionary
method to train two populations of GANs. A distributed memory parallel
implementation is proposed for execution in high performance/supercomputing
centers. Efficient results are reported on addressing the generation of
handwritten digits (MNIST dataset samples). Moreover, the proposed
implementation is able to reduce the training times and scale properly when
considering different grid sizes for training.

<p>Non-rigid cortical registration is an important and challenging task due to
the geometric complexity of the human cortex and the high degree of
inter-subject variability. A conventional solution is to use a spherical
representation of surface properties and perform registration by aligning
cortical folding patterns in that space. This strategy produces accurate
spatial alignment but often requires a high computational cost. Recently,
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated the potential to
dramatically speed up volumetric registration. However, due to distortions
introduced by projecting a sphere to a 2D plane, a direct application of recent
learning-based methods to surfaces yields poor results. In this study, we
present SphereMorph, a diffeomorphic registration framework for cortical
surfaces using deep networks that addresses these issues. SphereMorph uses a
UNet-style network associated with a spherical kernel to learn the displacement
field and warps the sphere using a modified spatial transformer layer. We
propose a resampling weight in computing the data fitting loss to account for
distortions introduced by polar projection, and demonstrate the performance of
our proposed method on two tasks, including cortical parcellation and
group-wise functional area alignment. The experiments show that the proposed
SphereMorph is capable of modeling the geometric registration problem in a CNN
framework and demonstrate superior registration accuracy and computational
efficiency.

<p>Compliant robots can be more versatile than traditional robots, but their
control is more complex. The dynamics of compliant bodies can however be turned
into an advantage using the physical reservoir computing frame-work. By feeding
sensor signals to the reservoir and extracting motor signals from the
reservoir, closed loop robot control is possible. Here, we present a novel
framework for implementing central pattern generators with spiking neural
networks to obtain closed loop robot control. Using the FORCE learning
paradigm, we train a reservoir of spiking neuron populations to act as a
central pattern generator. We demonstrate the learning of predefined gait
patterns, speed control and gait transition on a simulated model of a compliant
quadrupedal robot.

<p>Recently it has been proved that a simple algorithm configurator called
ParamRLS can efficiently identify the optimal neighbourhood size to be used by
stochastic local search to optimise two standard benchmark problem classes. In
this paper we analyse the performance of algorithm configurators for tuning the
more sophisticated global mutation operator used in standard evolutionary
algorithms, which flips each of the $n$ bits independently with probability
$\chi/n$ and the best value for $\chi$ has to be identified. We compare the
performance of configurators when the best-found fitness values within the
cutoff time $\kappa$ are used to compare configurations against the actual
optimisation time for two standard benchmark problem classes, Ridge and
LeadingOnes. We rigorously prove that all algorithm configurators that use
optimisation time as performance metric require cutoff times that are at least
as large as the expected optimisation time to identify the optimal
configuration. Matters are considerably different if the fitness metric is
used. To show this we prove that the simple ParamRLS-F configurator can
identify the optimal mutation rates even when using cutoff times that are
considerably smaller than the expected optimisation time of the best parameter
value for both problem classes.

<p>The possibility of simulating in detail in-vivo experiments could be highly
beneficial to the neuroscientific community. It could easily allow for
preliminary testing of different experimental conditions without having to be
constrained by factors such as training of the subjects or resting times
between experimental trials. In order to achieve this, the simulation of the
environment, of the subject and of the neural system, should be as accurate as
possible. Unfortunately, it is not possible to completely simulate physical
systems, alongside their neural counterparts, without greatly increasing the
computational cost of the simulation. For this reason, it is crucial to limit
the simulation to all physical and neural areas that are involved in the
experiment. We propose that using a combination of data analysis and simulated
models is beneficial in determining the minimal subset of entities that have to
be included in the simulation to replicate the in-vivo experiment. In
particular, we focused on a pulling task performed by mice on a robotic
platform before and after lesion of the central nervous system. Here, we show
that, while it is possible to replicate the behaviour of the healthy mouse just
by including models of the mouse forelimb, spinal cord, and recording of the
rostral forelimb area (RFA), it is not possible to reproduce the behaviour of
the post-stroke mouse. This can give us insights on what other elements would
be needed to replicate the complete experiment.

<p>The dynamical mechanism underlying the processes of anesthesia-induced loss
of consciousness and recovery is key to gaining insights into the working of
the nervous system. Previous experiments revealed an asymmetry between neural
signals during the anesthesia and recovery processes. Here we obtain
experimental evidence for the hysteresis loop and articulate the dynamical
mechanism based on percolation on multilayer complex networks with
self-similarity. Model analysis reveals that, during anesthesia, the network is
able to maintain its neural pathways despite the loss of a substantial fraction
of the edges. A predictive and potentially testable result is that, in the
forward process of anesthesia, the average shortest path and the clustering
coefficient of the neural network are markedly smaller than those associated
with the recovery process. This suggests that the network strives to maintain
certain neurological functions by adapting to a relatively more compact
structure in response to anesthesia.

<p>We present a unified statistical framework for characterizing community
structure of brain functional networks that captures variation across
individuals and evolution over time. Existing methods for community detection
focus only on single-subject analysis of dynamic networks; while recent
extensions to multiple-subjects analysis are limited to static networks. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a multi-subject, Markov-switching
stochastic block model (MSS-SBM) to identify state-related changes in brain
community organization over a group of individuals. We first formulate a
multilayer extension of SBM to describe the time-dependent, multi-subject brain
networks. We develop a novel procedure for fitting the multilayer SBM that
builds on multislice modularity maximization which can uncover a common
community partition of all layers (subjects) simultaneously. By augmenting with
a dynamic Markov switching process, our proposed method is able to capture a
set of distinct, recurring temporal states with respect to inter-community
interactions over subjects and the change points between them. Simulation shows
accurate community recovery and tracking of dynamic community regimes over
multilayer networks by the MSS-SBM. Application to task fMRI reveals meaningful
non-assortative brain community motifs, e.g., core-periphery structure at the
group level, that are associated with language comprehension and motor
functions suggesting their putative role in complex information integration.
Our approach detected dynamic reconfiguration of modular connectivity elicited
by varying task demands and identified unique profiles of intra and
inter-community connectivity across different task conditions. The proposed
multilayer network representation provides a principled way of detecting
synchronous, dynamic modularity in brain networks across subjects.

<p>Due to recent technological advances, large brain imaging data sets can now
be collected. Such data are highly complex so extraction of meaningful
information from them remains challenging. Thus, there is an urgent need for
statistical procedures that are computationally scalable and can provide
accurate estimates that capture the neuronal structures and their
functionalities. We propose a fast method for estimating the fiber orientation
distribution(FOD) based on diffusion MRI data. This method models the observed
dMRI signal at any voxel as a convolved and noisy version of the underlying
FOD, and utilizes the spherical harmonics basis for representing the FOD, where
the spherical harmonic coefficients are adaptively and nonlinearly shrunk by
using a James-Stein type estimator. To further improve the estimation accuracy
by enhancing the localized peaks of the FOD, as a second step a
super-resolution sharpening process is then applied. The resulting estimated
FODs can be fed to a fiber tracking algorithm to reconstruct the white matter
fiber tracts. We illustrate the overall methodology using both synthetic data
and data from the Human Connectome Project.

<p>In the contemporary big data realm, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are evolving
towards more complex architectures to achieve higher inference accuracy. Model
compression techniques can be leveraged to efficiently deploy such
compute-intensive architectures on resource-limited mobile devices. Such
methods comprise various hyper-parameters that require per-layer customization
to ensure high accuracy. Choosing such hyper-parameters is cumbersome as the
pertinent search space grows exponentially with model layers. This paper
introduces GeneCAI, a novel optimization method that automatically learns how
to tune per-layer compression hyper-parameters. We devise a bijective
translation scheme that encodes compressed DNNs to the genotype space. The
optimality of each genotype is measured using a multi-objective score based on
accuracy and number of floating point operations. We develop customized genetic
operations to iteratively evolve the non-dominated solutions towards the
optimal Pareto front, thus, capturing the optimal trade-off between model
accuracy and complexity. GeneCAI optimization method is highly scalable and can
achieve a near-linear performance boost on distributed multi-GPU platforms. Our
extensive evaluations demonstrate that GeneCAI outperforms existing rule-based
and reinforcement learning methods in DNN compression by finding models that
lie on a better accuracy-complexity Pareto curve.

<p>To thrive in dynamic environments, animals can generate flexible behavior and
rapidly adapt responses to a changing context and internal state. Examples of
behavioral flexibility include faster stimulus responses when attentive and
slower responses when distracted. Contextual modulations may occur early in the
cortical hierarchy and may be implemented via afferent projections from
top-down pathways or neuromodulation onto sensory cortex. However, the
computational mechanisms mediating the effects of such projections are not
known. Here, we investigate the effects of afferent projections on the
information processing speed of cortical circuits. Using a biologically
plausible model based on recurrent networks of excitatory and inhibitory
neurons arranged in cluster, we classify the effects of cell-type specific
perturbations on the circuit's stimulus-processing capability. We found that
perturbations differentially controlled processing speed, leading to
counterintuitive effects such as improved performance with increased input
variance. Our theory explains the effects of all perturbations in terms of gain
modulation, which controls the timescale of the circuit dynamics. We tested our
model using large-scale electrophysiological recordings from the visual
hierarchy in freely running mice, where a decrease in single-cell gain during
locomotion explained the observed acceleration of visual processing speed. Our
results establish a novel theory of cell-type specific perturbations linking
connectivity, dynamics, and information processing via gain modulations.

<p>Objective: Identifying bio-signals based-sleep stages requires time-consuming
and tedious labor of skilled clinicians. Deep learning approaches have been
introduced in order to challenge the automatic sleep stage classification
conundrum. However, disadvantages can be posed in replacing the clinicians with
the automatic system. Thus, we aim to develop a framework, capable of assisting
the clinicians and lessening the workload. Methods: We proposed the transfer
learning framework entitled MetaSleepLearner, using a Model Agnostic
Meta-Learning (MAML), in order to transfer the acquired sleep staging knowledge
from a large dataset to new individual subject. The capability of MAML was
elicited for this task by allowing clinicians to label for a few samples and
let the rest be handled by the system. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP)
was also applied to understand the learning course of our approach. Results: In
all acquired datasets, in comparison to the conventional approach,
MetaSleepLearner achieved a range of 6.15 % to 12.12 % improvement with
statistical difference in the mean of both approaches. The illustration of the
model interpretation after the adaptation to each subject also confirmed that
the performance was directed towards reasonable learning. Conclusion:
MetaSleepLearner outperformed the conventional approach as a result from the
fine-tuning using the recordings of both healthy subjects and patients.
Significance: This is the first paper that investigated a non-conventional
pre-training method, MAML, in this task, resulting in a framework for
human-machine collaboration in sleep stage classification, easing the burden of
the clinicians in labelling the sleep stages through only several epochs rather
than an entire recording.

<p>Terry Sejnowski's 2020 paper [<a href="http://export.arxiv.org/abs/2002.04806">arXiv:2002.04806</a>] is entitled "The unreasonable
effectiveness of deep learning in artificial intelligence". However, the paper
doesn't attempt to answer the implied question of why Deep Convolutional Neural
Networks (DCNNs) can approximate so many of the mappings that they have been
trained to model. While there are detailed mathematical analyses, this short
paper attempts to look at the issue differently, considering the way that these
networks are used, the subset of these functions that can be achieved by
training (starting from some location in the original function space), as well
as the functions to which these networks will actually be applied.

<p>Memristors close the loop for I-V characteristics of the traditional,
passive, semi-conductor devices. Originally proposed in 1971, the hunt for the
memristor has been going ever since. The key feature of a memristor is that its
current resitance is a function of its previous resistance. As such, the
behaviour of the device is influenced by changing the way in which potential is
applied across it. Ultimately, information can be encoded on memristors.
Biological substrates have already been shown to exhibit some memristive
properties. However, many memristive devices are yet to be found. Here we show
that the fruit bodies of grey oyster fungi Pleurotus ostreatus exhibit
memristive behaviours. This paper presents the I-V characteristics of the
mushrooms. By examination of the conducted current for a given voltage applied
as a function of the previous voltage, it is shown that the mushroom is a
memristor. Our results demonstrate that nature continues to provide specimens
that hold these unique and valuable electrical characteristics and which have
the potential to advance the field of hybrid electronic systems.

<p>We present a dataset and experiments on applying recurrent neural networks
(RNNs) for guiding clause selection in the connection tableau proof calculus.
The RNN encodes a sequence of literals from the current branch of the partial
proof tree to a hidden vector state; using it, the system selects a clause for
extending the proof tree. The training data and learning setup are described,
and the results are discussed and compared with state of the art using gradient
boosted trees. Additionally, we perform a conjecturing experiment in which the
RNN does not just select an existing clause, but completely constructs the next
tableau goal.

<p>Action real-time strategy gaming (ARSG) is a cognitively demanding task which requires attention, sensorimotor skills, team cooperation, and strategy-making abilities. A recent study found that ARSG experts had superior visual selective attention (VSA) for detecting the location of a moving object that could appear in one of 24 different peripheral locations (Qiu et al., 2018), suggesting that ARSG experience is related to improvements in the spatial component of VSA. However, the influence of ARSG experience on the temporal component of VSA—the detection of an item among a sequence of items presented consecutively and quickly at a single location—still remains understudied. Using behavioral and electrophysiological measures, this study examined whether ARSG experts had superior temporal VSA performance compared to non-experts in an attentional blink (AB) task, which is typically used to examine temporal VSA. The results showed that the experts outperformed the non-experts in their detection rates of targets. Furthermore, compared to the non-experts, the experts had faster information processing as indicated by earlier P3 peak latencies in an AB period, more attentional resources distributed to targets as indicated by stronger P3 amplitudes, and a more flexible deployment of attentional resources. These findings suggest that experts were less prone to the AB effect. Thus, long-term ARSG experience is related to improvements in temporal VSA. The current findings support the benefit of video gaming experience on the development of VSA.</p>

To compare findings across species, neuroscience relies on cross-species homologies, particularly in terms of brain areas. For cingulate cortex, a structure implicated in behavioural adaptation and control, a homologous definition across mammals is available – but currently not employed by most rodent researchers. The standard partitioning of rodent cingulate cortex is inconsistent with that in any other model species, including humans. Reviewing the existing literature, we show that the homologous definition better aligns results of rodent studies with those of other species, and reveals a clearer structural and functional organisation within rodent cingulate cortex itself.

This study examines whether bilingual exposure has a profound effect on the functional organization of the developing human brain during infancy. Recent behavioural research attests that monolingual vs. bilingual experience affects cognitive and linguistic processes already during the first months of life. However, to what extent the intrinsic organization of the infant human brain adapts to monolingual vs. bilingual environments is unclear. We measured spontaneous hemodynamic brain activity using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) in a large cohort (N=99) of 4-month-old monolingual and bilingual infants. We implemented well-established analysis approaches of functional brain imaging that enabled us to reveal the functional organization of the infant brain in large-scale cortical networks, and to perform group-level comparisons (i.e., monolingual vs. bilingual groups) in a reliable manner. Our results revealed no differences between the intrinsic functional organization of the developing monolingual and bilingual infant brain at 4 months of age.

INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to evaluate whether mid-life and late life participation in leisure activities is linked to measures of brain structure, functional connectivity and cognition in early old age. METHODS: We examined data collected from 7,152 participants of the UK Biobank study. Weekly participation in six leisure activities was assessed twice. A cognitive battery and 3T MRI brain scan were administered at the second visit. RESULTS: Weekly computer use at mid-life associated with larger volumes of the left putamen and higher scores for fluid intelligence, alphanumeric and numeric trail making tasks and prospective memory. Frequent attendance at a sports club or gym at mid-life was associated with stronger connectivity of the sensorimotor network with the lateral visual and cerebellar networks. No other associations were significant. DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates that not all leisure activities contribute to cognitive health equally, nor is there one unifying neural signature across leisure activities.

Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the human brain and plays a key role in several brain functions and neuropsychiatric disorders such as anxiety, epilepsy, and depression. The binding of benzodiazepines to the benzodiazepine receptor sites (BZR) located on GABAA receptors (GABAARs) potentiates the inhibitory effect of GABA leading to the anxiolytic, anticonvulsant and sedative effects used for treatment of those disorders. However, the function of GABAARs and the expression of BZR protein is determined by the GABAAR subunit stoichiometry (19 genes coding for individual subunits), and it remains to be established how the pentamer composition varies between brain regions and individuals. Here, we present a quantitative high-resolution in vivo atlas of the human brain BZRs, generated on the basis of [11C]flumazenil Positron Emission Tomography (PET) data. Next, based on autoradiography data, we transform the PET-generated atlas from binding values into BZR protein density. Finally, we examine the brain regional association with mRNA expression for the 19 subunits in the GABAAR, including an estimation of the minimally required expression of mRNA levels for each subunit to translate into BZR protein. This represents the first publicly available quantitative high-resolution in vivo atlas of the spatial distribution of BZR densities in the healthy human brain. The atlas provides a unique neuroscientific tool as well as novel insights into the association between mRNA expression for individual subunits in the GABAAR and the BZR density at each location in the brain.

Fast-moving animals need fast-acting sensory systems. Flying insects have thus evolved exceptionally quick visual (1) and olfactory processing ability (2). For example, flighted insects can track the temporal structure of turbulent odor plumes at rates above 100 Hz (3). The evolutionary lability of such sensory systems, however, remains unknown. We test for rapid evolutionary shifts in olfactory processing speed associated with flight loss, through neurobiological comparisons of sympatric flighted versus flightless lineages within a wing-polymorphic stonefly species. Our analyses of sensory responses reveal that recently-evolved flightless lineages have substantially degraded olfactory acuity. By comparing flighted versus flightless ecotypes with similar genetic backgrounds (4), we eliminate other confounding factors that might have affected the evolution of their olfactory reception mechanisms. Our detection of different patterns of degraded olfactory sensitivity and speed in independently wing-reduced lineages highlights parallel evolution of sensory degeneration. These reductions in sensory ability also echo the rapid vestigialization of wings themselves (4, 5), and represent a neurobiological parallel to the convergent phenotypic shifts seen under sharp selective gradients in other systems (e.g. parallel loss of vision in diverse cave fauna (6)). Our study provides the first direct evidence for the hypothesis that flight poses a selective pressure on the speed of olfactory receptor neurons. Our findings also emphasize the energetic costs of rapid olfaction, and the key role of natural selection in shaping dramatic neurobiological shifts.

Background: The analysis of connectivity has become a fundamental tool in human neuroscience. Granger Causality Mapping is a data-driven method that uses Granger Causality (GC) to assess the existence and direction of influence between signals, based on temporal precedence of information. More recently, a theory of Granger causality has been developed for state-space (SS-GC) processes, but little is known about its statistical validation and application on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. New Method: We implemented a new heuristic, focusing on the application of SS-GC with a distinct statistical validation technique - Time Reversed Testing - to generative synthetic models and compare it to classical multivariate computational frameworks. We also test a range of experimental parameters, including block structure, sampling frequency, noise and system mean pairwise correlation, using a statistical framework of binary classification. Results: We found that SS-GC with time reversed testing outperforms other frameworks. The results validate the application of SS-GC to generative models. When estimating reliable causal relations, SS-GC returns promising results, especially when considering synthetic data with an high impact of noise and sampling rate. Conclusions: SS-GC with time reversed testing offers a possible framework for future analysis of fMRI data in the context of data-driven causality analysis.

We have described a novel temporal encoding mechanism in the somatosensory system, where tactile pulses grouped into periodic bursts create a perceived frequency based on the duration of the silent gap between bursts, rather than the mean rate or the periodicity. This coding strategy may offer new opportunities for transmitting information to the brain using various sensory neural prostheses and brain-machine interfaces. However, it was not known whether the same coding mechanisms apply when electrical, rather than mechanical, stimulation is used. Here, we demonstrate that the predictions of the burst gap coding model for frequency perception apply to burst stimuli delivered with electrical pulses, re-emphasising the importance of the temporal structure of spike patterns in neural processing and perception of tactile stimuli. Reciprocally, the electrical stimulation data confirm that the results observed with mechanical stimulation do indeed depend on neural processing mechanisms in the central nervous system and are not due to mechanical effects in the skin or afferent population activation patterns. Our results suggest that spike intervals contribute to perceived frequency with perceptual weights that depend on their duration, and that a generalised frequency processing system would explain the constancy of vibrotactile frequency perception across different receptor types.

A simple method for deriving composite, non-redundant measures of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) is developed on the basis of the power law scaling of the Fourier spectra. Measures derived are the spectral intercept, the slope (spectral exponent), as well as the maximal whitened spectral peak amplitude and frequency in the sleep spindle range. As a proof of concept, we apply these measures on a large sleep EEG dataset (N = 175; age range: 17-60 years) with previously demonstrated effects of age, sex and intelligence. As predicted, aging is associated with decreased overall spectral slopes (increased exponents) and whitened spectral peak amplitudes in the spindle frequency range. In addition, age associates with decreased sleep spindle spectral peak frequencies in the frontal region. Women were characterized by higher spectral intercepts and higher spectral peak frequencies in the sleep spindle range. No sex differences in whitened spectral peak amplitudes of the sleep spindle range were found. Intelligence correlated positively with whitened spectral peak amplitudes of the spindle frequency range in women, but not in men. Last, age-related increases in spectral exponents did not differ in subjects with average and high intelligence. Our findings replicate and complete previous reports in the literature, indicating that the number of variables describing NREM sleep EEG can be effectively reduced in order to overcome redundancy and Type I statistical errors in future electrophysiological studies of sleep.

Aging is a main risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease. It is often accompanied by reduced cognitive functions, gray-matter volume, and dendritic integrity. Although age-related brain structural changes have been observed across multiple scales, their functional implications remain largely unknown. Here we simulate the aging effects on neuronal morphology as dendritic pruning and characterize its dynamical implications. Utilizing a minimal computational modeling approach, we simulate the dynamics of detailed digitally reconstructed pyramidal neurons of humans obtained from the online repository Neuromorpho.org. We show that as aging progressively affects neuronal integrity, neuronal firing rate is reduced, which causes a reduction in energy consumption, energy efficiency, and dynamic range. Pruned neurons require less energy but their function is often impaired, which can explain the diminished ability to distinguish between similar experiences (pattern separation) in older people. Our measures indicate that the resilience of neuronal dynamics is neuron-specific, heterogeneous, and strongly affected by dendritic topology and the centrality of the soma. Based on the emergent neuronal dynamics, we propose to classify the effects of dendritic deterioration, and put forward that soma centrality measures neuronal reserve. Moreover, our findings suggest that increasing dendritic excitability could partially mitigate the dynamical effects of aging.

Despite the essential role of protein intake for health and development, very little is known about the impact of protein restriction on neurobiological functions, especially at different stages of the lifespan. The dopamine system is a central actor in the integration of food-related processes and is influenced by physiological state and food-related signals. Moreover, it is highly sensitive to dietary effects during early life periods such as adolescence due to its late maturation. In the present study, we investigated the impact of protein restriction either during adolescence or adulthood on the function of the mesolimbic (nucleus accumbens) and nigrostriatal (dorsal striatum) dopamine pathways using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry in rat brain slices. In the nucleus accumbens, protein restriction in adults increased dopamine release in response to high frequency trains of stimulation (10-20 Hz) with no effect on single pulse evoked release. By contrast, protein restriction performed at adolescence decreased nucleus accumbens dopamine release evoked by both single pulses and trains of stimulation pulses (5-10 Hz). In the dorsal striatum, protein restriction has no impact on dopamine release when performed at adulthood but in adolescent rats we observed frequency-dependent increases in stimulated dopamine release. Taken together, our results highlight the sensitivity of the different dopamine pathways to the effect of protein restriction, as well as their vulnerability to deleterious diet effects at different life stages.

Resting-state EEG is dominated by sustained alpha oscillations, and low-frequency activities (short theta bursts and non-oscillatory 1/f slope). Resting alpha power decreases with age and correlates with intelligence. We propose that alpha facilitates proactive control (requiring task set maintenance in preparation for expected conditions), whereas theta bursts relate to reactive control, requiring task-set updating in response to unexpected demands. Less is known about 1/f slope. To investigate these relationships, we recorded eyes-open and eyes-closed resting EEG from younger and older adults and subsequently tested their performance on a cued flanker task, expected to elicit proactive and reactive control processes. Alpha power and 1/f slope were smaller in older adults, whereas theta power did not show age-related reductions. Resting alpha power and 1/f slope predicted proactive control performance, whereas theta predicted reactive control. Resting theta may indicate greater sensitivity to distraction, reflected in frequent spontaneous updating operations. All predictive associations were present beyond the effect of age, suggesting that these EEG correlates may serve as biomarkers of individual differences in cognitive control.

AMPA type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) mediate the majority of fast excitatory neurotransmission in the brain. The continuous trafficking of AMPARs into and out of synapses is a core feature of synaptic plasticity, which is considered as the cellular basis of learning and memory. The molecular mechanisms underlying the postsynaptic AMPAR trafficking, however, are still not fully understood. In this work, we demonstrate that the Protein Kinase D (PKD) family promotes basal and activity-induced AMPAR endocytosis in primary hippocampal neurons. Pharmacological inhibition of PKD increased synaptic levels of GluA1-containing AMPARs and slowed down their endocytic trafficking. By contrast, ectopic expression of constitutive active PKD decreased the synaptic level of AMPARs, while increasing their co-localization with early endosomes. On a molecular level, we identify PKD-mediated phosphorylation of the Rab5 effector protein Rabaptin-5 to be required for promoting activity-dependent AMPAR endocytosis. Our results thus establish an important role for PKD in the regulation of postsynaptic AMPAR trafficking during synaptic plasticity.

Identifying the cell types constituting brain circuits is a fundamental question in neuroscience and motivates the generation of taxonomies based on electrophysiological, morphological and molecular single cell properties. Establishing the correspondence across data modalities and understanding the underlying principles has proven challenging. Bio-realistic computational models offer the ability to probe cause-and-effect and have historically been used to explore phenomena at the single-neuron level. Here we introduce a computational optimization workflow used for the generation and evaluation of more than 130 million single neuron models with active conductances. These models were based on 230 in vitro electrophysiological experiments followed by morphological reconstruction from the mouse visual cortex. We show that distinct ion channel conductance vectors exist that distinguish between major cortical classes with passive and h-channel conductances emerging as particularly important for classification. Next, using models of genetically defined classes, we show that differences in specific conductances predicted from the models reflect differences in gene expression in excitatory and inhibitory cell types as experimentally validated by single-cell RNA-sequencing. The differences in these conductances, in turn, explain many of the electrophysiological differences observed between cell types. Finally, we show the robustness of the herein generated single-cell models as representations and realizations of specific cell types in face of biological variability and optimization complexity. Our computational effort generated models that reconcile major single-cell data modalities that define cell types allowing for causal relationships to be examined.

Consumption of cannabis during pregnancy and the lactation period is a rising public health concern (Scheyer et al., 2019). We have previously shown that exposure to synthetic or plant-derived cannabinoids via lactation disrupts perinatal programming of the gamma-aminobutyric acid trajectory in the prefrontal cortex and early-life behaviors (Scheyer et al., 2020b). Recently, we described lasting behavioral and neuronal consequences of {triangleup}9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) perinatal exposure via lactation (Scheyer et al., 2020a). Here, we extend upon these findings by testing the effects in offspring of maternal exposure to the synthetic cannabinoid agonist WIN 55,12,2 (WIN). The data demonstrate that rats exposed during lactation to WIN display social, cognitive and motivational deficits at adulthood. These behavioral changes were paralleled by a specific loss of endocannabinoid-mediated long-term depression in the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens, while other forms of synaptic plasticity remained intact. Thus, similarly to THC, perinatal WIN exposure via lactation induces behavioral and synaptic abnormalities lasting into adulthood.

Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurological disorder characterized by motor disturbances. HD pathology is most prominent in the striatum, the central hub of basal ganglia. The cortex is the main striatal afference and progressive cortico-striatal disconnection characterizes HD. We mapped cortico-striatal dysfunction in HD mice to ultimately modulate the activity of selected cortico-striatal circuits to ameliorate motor symptoms and recover synaptic plasticity. Multimodal MRI in vivo suggested prominent functional network deficits in fronto-striatal compared to motor-striatal pathways, which were accompanied by reduced glutamate levels in the striatum of HD mice. Moreover, optogenetically-stimulated glutamate release from fronto-striatal terminals was reduced in HD mice and electrophysiological responses in striatal neurons were blunted. Remarkably, repeated M2 Cortex-dorsolateral striatum optogenetic stimulation normalized motor behavior in HD mice and evoked a sustained increase of synaptic plasticity. Overall, these results reveal that the selective stimulation of fronto-striatal pathways can become an effective therapeutic strategy in HD.

Alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC) is a rare neurodevelopmental disease caused by heterozygous de novo missense mutations in the ATP1A3 gene that encodes the neuronal specific 3 subunit of the Na,K-ATPase (NKA) pump. Mechanisms underlying patient episodes including environmental triggers remain poorly understood, and there are no empirically proven treatments for AHC. In this study, we generated patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and isogenic controls for the E815K ATP1A3 mutation that causes the most phenotypically severe form of AHC. Using an in vitro iPSC-derived cortical neuron disease model, we found elevated levels of ATP1A3 mRNA in AHC lines compared to controls, without significant perturbations in protein expression. Microelectrode array analyses demonstrated that in cortical neuronal cultures, ATP1A3+/E815K iPSC-derived neurons displayed a non-significant trend toward less overall activity than neurons differentiated from isogenic mutation-corrected and unrelated control cell lines. However, induction of cellular stress by elevated temperature revealed a hyperactivity phenotype following heat stress in ATP1A3+/E815K lines compared to control lines. Treatment with flunarizine, a drug commonly used to prevent AHC episodes, did not impact this stress-triggered phenotype. These findings support the use of iPSC-derived neuronal cultures for studying complex neurodevelopmental conditions such as AHC and provide a potential route toward future therapeutic screening and mechanistic discovery in a human disease model.

The co-localization of Cluster-of-Differentiation-44 protein (CD44) and cytoplasmic adaptors in specific membrane environments is crucial for cell adhesion and migration. The process is controlled by two different pathways: On the one hand palmitoylation keeps CD44 in lipid raft domains and disables the linking to the cytoplasmic adaptor, whereas on the other hand, the presence of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) lipids accelerates the formation of the CD44-adaptor complex. The molecular mechanism explaining how CD44 is migrating into and out of the lipid raft domains and its dependence on both palmitoylations and the presence of PIP2 remains, however, elusive. In this study, we performed extensive molecular dynamics simulations to study the raft affinity and translocation of CD44 in phase separated model membranes as well as more realistic plasma membrane environments. We observe a delicate balance between the influence of the palmitoylations and the presence of PIP2 lipids: whereas the palmitoylations of CD44 increases the affinity for raft domains, PIP2 lipids have the opposite effect. Additionally, we studied the association between CD44 and the membrane adaptor FERM in dependence of these factors. We find that the presence of PIP2 lipids allows CD44 and FERM to associate in an experimentally observed binding mode whereas the highly palmitoylated species shows no binding affinity. Together, our results shed light on the sophisticated mechanism on how membrane translocation and peripheral protein association can be controlled by both protein modifications and membrane composition.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uwRwfeq_96o" width="1" />

<p>by Shiva Kamkar, Fatemeh Ghezloo, Hamid Abrishami Moghaddam, Ali Borji, Reza Lashgari</p>

Humans are able to track multiple objects at any given time in their daily activities—for example, we can drive a car while monitoring obstacles, pedestrians, and other vehicles. Several past studies have examined how humans track targets simultaneously and what underlying behavioral and neural mechanisms they use. At the same time, computer-vision researchers have proposed different algorithms to track multiple targets automatically. These algorithms are useful for video surveillance, team-sport analysis, video analysis, video summarization, and human–computer interaction. Although there are several efficient biologically inspired algorithms in artificial intelligence, the human multiple-target tracking (MTT) ability is rarely imitated in computer-vision algorithms. In this paper, we review MTT studies in neuroscience and biologically inspired MTT methods in computer vision and discuss the ways in which they can be seen as complementary.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PRe5iXfghCo" width="1" />

<p>by Simone Carlo Surace, Jean-Pascal Pfister, Wulfram Gerstner, Johanni Brea</p>

This is a <i>PLOS Computational Biology</i> Education paper.
The idea that the brain functions so as to minimize certain costs pervades theoretical neuroscience. Because a cost function by itself does not predict how the brain finds its minima, additional assumptions about the optimization method need to be made to predict the dynamics of physiological quantities. In this context, steepest descent (also called gradient descent) is often suggested as an algorithmic principle of optimization potentially implemented by the brain. In practice, researchers often consider the vector of partial derivatives as the gradient. However, the definition of the gradient and the notion of a steepest direction depend on the choice of a metric. Because the choice of the metric involves a large number of degrees of freedom, the predictive power of models that are based on gradient descent must be called into question, unless there are strong constraints on the choice of the metric. Here, we provide a didactic review of the mathematics of gradient descent, illustrate common pitfalls of using gradient descent as a principle of brain function with examples from the literature, and propose ways forward to constrain the metric.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AXmPsakotaM" width="1" />

Chemokines and their receptors are orchestrators of cell migration in humans. Because dysregulation of the receptor-chemokine system leads to inflammation and cancer, both chemokines and receptors are highly sought therapeutic targets. Yet one of the barriers for their therapeutic targeting is the limited understanding of the structural principles behind receptor-chemokine recognition and selectivity. The existing structures do not include CXC subfamily complexes and lack information about the receptor distal N-termini, despite the importance of the latter in signaling, regulation, and bias. Here, we report the discovery of the geometry of the complex between full-length CXCR4, a prototypical CXC receptor and driver of cancer metastasis, and its endogenous ligand CXCL12. By comprehensive disulfide cross-linking, we establish the existence and the structure of a novel interface between the CXCR4 distal N-terminus and CXCL12 β1-strand, while also recapitulating earlier findings from nuclear magnetic resonance, modeling and crystallography of homologous receptors. A cross-linking–informed high-resolution model of the CXCR4-CXCL12 complex pinpoints the interaction determinants and reveals the occupancy of the receptor major subpocket by the CXCL12 proximal N terminus. This newly found positioning of the chemokine proximal N-terminus provides a structural explanation of CXC receptor-chemokine selectivity against other subfamilies. Our findings challenge the traditional two-site understanding of receptor-chemokine recognition, suggest the possibility of new affinity and signaling determinants, and fill a critical void on the structural map of an important class of therapeutic targets. These results will aid the rational design of selective chemokine-receptor targeting small molecules and biologics with novel pharmacology.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/SCircO8PAXE" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Estrogen synthesis and signaling in the brains of vertebrates has pleotropic effects ranging from neurogenesis to modulation of behaviors. The majority of studies on brain‐derived estrogens focus on males, but estrogenic signaling in females likely plays important roles in regulation of reproductive cycling and social behaviors. We used females of the mouth brooding African cichlid fish, <i>Astatotilapia burtoni</i>, to test for reproductive state‐dependent changes in estrogenic signaling capacity within microdissected brain nuclei that are important for social behaviors. Expression levels of the rate‐limiting enzyme aromatase, but not estrogen receptors, measured by qPCR changes across the reproductive cycle. Gravid females that are close to spawning had higher aromatase levels in all brain regions compared to females with lower reproductive potential. This brain aromatase expression was positively correlated with circulating estradiol levels and ovarian readiness. Using chromogenic in situ hybridization we localized aromatase‐expressing cells to ependymal regions bordering the ventricles from the forebrain to the hindbrain, and observed more abundant staining in gravid compared to mouth brooding females in most regions. Staining was most prominent in subpallial telencephalic regions, and diencephalic regions of the preoptic area, thalamus, and hypothalamus, but was also observed in sensory and sensorimotor areas of the midbrain and hindbrain. Aromatase expression was observed in radial glial cells, revealed by co‐localization with the glial marker GFAP and absence of co‐localization with the neuronal marker HuC/D. Collectively these results support the idea that brain‐derived estradiol in females may serve important functions in reproductive state‐dependent physiological and behavioral processes across vertebrates.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cerebrospinal fluid contacting neurons (CSF‐cNs) represent a specific class of neurons located in close vicinity of brain ventricles and central canal. In contrast with knowledge gained from other vertebrate species, we found that vast majority of CSF‐cNs in the spinal cord of C57Bl/6N mice is located in ectopic distal ventral position. However, we found that small number of ectopic CSF‐cNs is present also in spinal cord of other investigated experimental mice strains (C57Bl/6J, Balb/C) and mammalian species (Wistar rats, New Zealand White rabbits). Similarly, as the proximal populations, ectopic CSF‐cNs retain PKD2L1‐immunoreactivity and synaptic contacts with other neurons. On the other side, they show rather multipolar morphology lacking thick dendrite contacting central canal lumen. Ectopic CSF‐cNs in the spinal cord of C57Bl/6N mice emerge during whole period devoted to production of CSF‐cNs and reach their ventral destinations during first postnatal weeks. In order to identify major gene, whose impairment could trigger translocation of CSF‐cNs outside the central canal area, we took advantage of close consanguinity of C57Bl/6J substrain with normal CSF‐cN distribution and C57Bl/6N substrain with majority of CSF‐cNs in ectopic position. Employing in silico analyses, we ranked polymorphisms in C57Bl/6N substrain and selected genes <i>Crb1, Cyfip2</i>, <i>Adamts12</i>, <i>Plk1</i>, and <i>Herpud2</i> as the most probable candidates, whose product dysfunction might be responsible for the ectopic distribution of CSF‐cNs. Furthermore, segregation analysis of F2 progeny of parental C57Bl/6N and Balb/C mice revealed that polymorphic loci of <i>Crb1 </i>and <i>Cyfip2</i> underlie the ectopic position of CSF‐cNs in the spinal cord of C57Bl/6N mice.</p>

Abstract
<p>Vagal afferent sensory nerves, originating in jugular and nodose ganglia, are composed of functionally distinct subsets whose activation evokes distinct thoracic and abdominal reflex responses. We used Cre-expressing mouse strains to identify specific vagal afferent populations and map their central projections within the brainstem. We show that Pirt is expressed in virtually all vagal afferents; whereas, 5-HT3 is expressed only in nodose neurons, with little expression in jugular neurons. Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), the capsaicin receptor, is expressed in a subset of small nodose and jugular neurons. Tac1, the gene for tachykinins, is expressed predominantly in jugular neurons, some of which also express TRPV1. Vagal fibers project centrally to the nucleus tractus solitarius (nTS), paratrigeminal complex, area postrema, and to a limited extent the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus. nTS subnuclei preferentially receive projections by specific afferent subsets, with TRPV1<sup>+</sup> fibers terminating in medial and dorsal regions predominantly caudal of obex, whereas TRPV1<sup>–</sup> fibers terminate in ventral and lateral regions throughout the rostral–caudal aspect of the medulla. Many vagal Tac1<sup>+</sup> afferents (mostly derived from the jugular ganglion) terminate in the nTS. The paratrigeminal complex was the target of multiple vagal afferent subsets. Importantly, lung-specific TRPV1<sup>+</sup> and Tac1<sup>+</sup> afferent terminations were restricted to the caudal medial nTS, with no innervation of other medulla regions. In summary, this study identifies the specific medulla regions innervated by vagal afferent subsets. The distinct terminations provide a neuroanatomic substrate for the diverse range of reflexes initiated by vagal afferent activation.</p>

<p>Even when we are wearing gloves, we can easily detect whether a surface that we are touching is sticky or not. However, we know little about the similarities between brain activations elicited by this glove contact and by direct contact with our bare skin. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we investigated which brain regions represent stickiness intensity information obtained in both touch conditions, i.e., skin contact and glove contact. First, we searched for neural representations mediating stickiness for each touch condition separately and found regions responding to both mainly in the supramarginal gyrus and the secondary somatosensory cortex. Second, we explored whether surface stickiness is encoded in common neural patterns irrespective of how participants touched the sticky stimuli. Using a cross-condition decoding method, we tested whether the stickiness intensities could be decoded from fMRI signals evoked by skin contact using a classifier trained on the responses elicited by glove contact, and vice versa. Our results found shared neural encoding patterns in the bilateral angular gyri and the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and suggest that these areas represent stickiness intensity information regardless of how participants touched the sticky stimuli. Interestingly, we observed that neural encoding patterns of these areas were reflected in participants’ intensity ratings. This study revealed common and distinct brain activation patterns of tactile stickiness using two different touch conditions, which may broaden the understanding of neural mechanisms related to surface texture perception.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>There is a strong correlation between aging and onset of idiopathic Parkinson's disease, but little is known about whether cellular changes occur during normal aging that may explain this association. Here, proteomic and bioinformatic analysis was conducted on the substantia nigra (SN) of rats at four stages of life to identify and quantify protein changes throughout aging. This analysis revealed that proteins associated with cell adhesion, protein aggregation and oxidation‐reduction are dysregulated as early as middle age in rats. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was identified as a network hub connecting the greatest number of proteins altered during aging. Furthermore, the isoform of GFAP expressed in the SN varied throughout life. However, the expression levels of the rate‐limiting enzyme for dopamine production, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), were maintained even in the oldest animals, despite a reduction in the number of dopamine neurons in the SN pars compact(SNc) as aging progressed. This age‐related increase in TH expression per neuron would likely to increase the vulnerability of neurons, since increased dopamine production would be an additional source of oxidative stress. This, in turn, would place a high demand on support systems from local astrocytes, which themselves show protein changes that could affect their functionality. Taken together, this study highlights key processes that are altered with age in the rat SN, each of which converges upon GFAP. These findings offer insight into the relationship between aging and increased challenges to neuronal viability, and indicate an important role for glial cells in the aging process.</p>

<p>We propose a concept for reservoir computing on oscillators using the
high-order synchronization effect. The reservoir output is presented in the
form of oscillator synchronization metrics: fractional high-order
synchronization value and synchronization efficiency, expressed as a
percentage. Using two coupled relaxation oscillators built on VO2 switches, we
created an oscillator reservoir that allows simulating the XOR operation. The
reservoir can operate as with static input data (power currents, coupling
forces), as with dynamic data in the form of spike sequences. Having a small
number of oscillators and significant non-linearity, the reservoir expresses a
wide range of dynamic states. The proposed computing concept can be implemented
on oscillators of diverse nature.

<p>The ability to learn in dynamic, nonstationary environments without
forgetting previous knowledge, also known as Continual Learning (CL), is a key
enabler for scalable and trustworthy deployments of adaptive solutions. While
the importance of continual learning is largely acknowledged in machine vision
and reinforcement learning problems, this is mostly under-documented for
sequence processing tasks. This work proposes a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
model for CL that is able to deal with concept drift in input distribution
without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. We also implement and test a
popular CL approach, Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), on top of two
different types of RNNs. Finally, we compare the performances of our enhanced
architecture against EWC and RNNs on a set of standard CL benchmarks, adapted
to the sequential data processing scenario. Results show the superior
performance of our architecture and highlight the need for special solutions
designed to address CL in RNNs.

<p>Public transportation system commuters are often interested in getting
accurate travel time information to plan their daily activities. However, this
information is often difficult to predict accurately due to the irregularities
of road traffic, caused by factors such as weather conditions, road accidents,
and traffic jams. In this study, two neural network models namely
multi-layer(MLP) perceptron and long short-term model(LSTM) are developed for
predicting link travel time of a busy route with input generated using
Origin-Destination travel time matrix derived from a historical GPS dataset.
The experiment result showed that both models can make near-accurate
predictions however, LSTM is more susceptible to noise as time step increases.

<p>In this paper, we propose a system for file classification in large data sets
based on spiking neural networks (SNNs). File information contained in
key-value metadata pairs is mapped by a novel correlative temporal encoding
scheme to spike patterns that are input to an SNN. The correlation between
input spike patterns is determined by a file similarity measure. Unsupervised
training of such networks using spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is
addressed first. Then, supervised SNN training is considered by backpropagation
of an error signal that is obtained by comparing the spike pattern at the
output neurons with a target pattern representing the desired class. The
classification accuracy is measured for various publicly available data sets
with tens of thousands of elements, and compared with other learning
algorithms, including logistic regression and support vector machines.
Simulation results indicate that the proposed SNN-based system using memristive
synapses may represent a valid alternative to classical machine learning
algorithms for inference tasks, especially in environments with asynchronous
ingest of input data and limited resources.

<p>Current neural networks are mostly built upon the MP model, which usually
formulates the neuron as executing an activation function on the real-valued
weighted aggregation of signals received from other neurons. In this paper, we
propose the Flexible Transmitter (FT) model, a novel bio-plausible neuron with
flexible plasticity. The FT model employs a pair of parameters to model the
transmitter between neurons and sets up a neurotransmitter regulated memory
unit to record the long-term learning information of the concerned neuron, thus
leading to the formulation of the FT model as a two-variable two-valued
function, which takes the commonly-used MP neuron model as its special case.
The FT model can handle more complicated data, even time series signals. To
exhibit the power and potential of our FT model, we present the Flexible
Transmitter Network (FTNet), which is built in the most common fully-connected
feed-forward architecture by incorporating the FT neuron as the basic building
block. FTNet allows gradient calculation and can be implemented by an extension
of the backpropagation algorithm in the complex domain. Experiments on a board
range of tasks show the superiority of the proposed FTNet. This study provides
an alternative basic building block in neural networks and exhibits the
feasibility of developing artificial neural networks with neuronal plasticity.

<p>This review surveys physiological, behavioral, and morphological evidence converging to the view of the cerebro-cerebellum as loci of internal forward models. The cerebro-cerebellum, the phylogenetically newest expansion in the cerebellum, receives convergent inputs from cortical, subcortical, and spinal sources, and is thought to perform the predictive computation for both motor control, motor learning, and cognitive functions. This predictive computation is known as an internal forward model. First, we elucidate the theoretical foundations of an internal forward model and its role in motor control and motor learning within the framework of the optimal feedback control model. Then, we discuss a neural mechanism that generates various patterns of outputs from the cerebro-cerebellum. Three lines of supporting evidence for the internal-forward-model hypothesis are presented in detail. First, we provide physiological evidence that the cerebellar outputs (activities of dentate nucleus cells) are predictive for the cerebellar inputs [activities of mossy fibers (MFs)]. Second, we provide behavioral evidence that a component of movement kinematics is predictive for target motion in control subjects but lags behind a target motion in patients with cerebellar ataxia. Third, we provide morphological evidence that the cerebellar cortex and the dentate nucleus receive separate MF projections, a prerequisite for optimal estimation. Finally, we speculate that the predictive computation in the cerebro-cerebellum could be deployed to not only motor control but also to non-motor, cognitive functions. This review concludes that the predictive computation of the internal forward model is the unifying algorithmic principle for understanding diverse functions played by the cerebro-cerebellum.</p>

<p>Music-based therapy for rehabilitation induces neuromodulation at the brain level and improves the functional recovery. In line with this, musical rhythmicity improves post-stroke gait. Moreover, an external distractor also helps stroke patients to improve locomotion. We raised the question whether music with irregular tempo (arrhythmic music), and its possible influence on attention would induce neuromodulation and improve the post-stroke gait. We tested music-induced neuromodulation at the level of a propriospinal reflex, known to be particularly involved in the control of stabilized locomotion; after stroke, the reflex is enhanced on the hemiparetic side. The study was conducted in 12 post-stroke patients and 12 controls. Quadriceps EMG was conditioned by electrical stimulation of the common peroneal nerve, which produces a biphasic facilitation on EMG, reflecting the level of activity of the propriospinal reflex between ankle dorsiflexors and quadriceps (CPQ reflex). The CPQ reflex was tested during treadmill locomotion at the preferred speed of each individual, in 3 conditions randomly alternated: without music vs. 2 arrhythmic music tracks, including a pleasant melody and unpleasant aleatory electronic sounds (AES); biomechanical and physiological parameters were also investigated. The CPQ reflex was significantly larger in patients during walking without sound, compared to controls. During walking with music, irrespective of the theme, there was no more difference between groups. In controls, music had no influence on the size of CPQ reflex. In patients, CPQ reflex was significantly larger during walking without sound than when listening to the melody or AES. No significant differences have been revealed concerning the biomechanical and the physiological parameters in both groups. Arrhythmic music listening modulates the spinal excitability during post-stroke walking, restoring the CPQ reflex activity to normality. The plasticity was not accompanied by any clear improvement of gait parameters, but the patients reported to prefer walking with music than without. The role of music as external focus of attention is discussed. This study has shown that music can modulate propriospinal neural network particularly involved in the gait control during the first training session. It is speculated that repetition may help to consolidate plasticity and would contribute to gait recovery after stroke.</p>

<p>Clinical research in neurodevelopmental disorders remains reliant upon clinician and caregiver measures. Limitations of these approaches indicate a need for objective, quantitative, and reliable biomarkers to advance clinical research. Extant research suggests the potential utility of multiple candidate biomarkers; however, effective application of these markers in trials requires additional understanding of replicability, individual differences, and intra-individual stability over time. The Autism Biomarkers Consortium for Clinical Trials (ABC-CT) is a multi-site study designed to investigate a battery of electrophysiological (EEG) and eye-tracking (ET) indices as candidate biomarkers for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The study complements published biomarker research through: inclusion of large, deeply phenotyped cohorts of children with ASD and typical development; a longitudinal design; a focus on well-evidenced candidate biomarkers harmonized with an independent sample; high levels of clinical, regulatory, technical, and statistical rigor; adoption of a governance structure incorporating diverse expertise in the ASD biomarker discovery and qualification process; prioritization of open science, including creation of a repository containing biomarker, clinical, and genetic data; and use of economical and scalable technologies that are applicable in developmental populations and those with special needs. The ABC-CT approach has yielded encouraging results, with one measure accepted into the FDA’s Biomarker Qualification Program to date. Through these advances, the ABC-CT and other biomarker studies in progress hold promise to deliver novel tools to improve clinical trials research in ASD.</p>

<p>Individuals with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) have atypical white matter integrity and neural connectivity in the brain, including language pathways. To explore functional activity associated with auditory and language processing in individuals with TSC, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to examine basic auditory correlates of detection (P1, N2, N4) and discrimination (mismatch negativity, MMN) of speech and non-speech stimuli for children with TSC and age- and sex-matched typically developing (TD) children. Children with TSC (TSC group) and without TSC (typically developing, TD group) participated in an auditory MMN paradigm containing two blocks of vowels (/a/and/u/) and two blocks of tones (800 Hz and 400 Hz). Continuous EEG data were collected. Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) was used to explore functional specificity of neural auditory processing. Speech-specific P1, N2, and N4 waveform components of the auditory evoked potential (AEP) were compared, and the mismatch response was calculated for both speech and tones. MVPA showed that the TD group, but not the TSC group, demonstrated above-chance pairwise decoding between speech and tones. The AEP component analysis suggested that while the TD group had an increased P1 amplitude in response to vowels compared to tones, the TSC group did not show this enhanced response to vowels. Additionally, the TD group had a greater N2 amplitude in response to vowels, but not tones, compared to the TSC group. The TSC group also demonstrated a longer N4 latency to vowels compared to tones, which was not seen in the TD group. No group differences were observed in the MMN response. In this study we identified features of the auditory response to speech sounds, but not acoustically matched tones, which differentiate children with TSC from TD children.</p>

<p>Neuroinflammatory processes play an integral role in the exacerbation and progression of pathology in tauopathies, a class of neurodegenerative disease characterized by aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. The RNA binding protein (RBP) T-cell Intracellular Antigen 1 (TIA1) is an important regulator of the innate immune response in the periphery, dampening cytotoxic inflammation and apoptosis during cellular stress, however, its role in neuroinflammation is unknown. We have recently shown that TIA1 regulates tau pathophysiology and toxicity in part through the binding of phospho-tau oligomers into pathological stress granules, and that haploinsufficiency of TIA1 in the P301S mouse model of tauopathy results in reduced accumulation of toxic tau oligomers, pathologic stress granules, and the development of downstream pathological features of tauopathy. The putative role of TIA1 as a regulator of the peripheral immune response led us to investigate the effects of TIA1 on neuroinflammation in the context of tauopathy, a chronic stressor in the neural environment. Here, we evaluated indicators of neuroinflammation including; reactive microgliosis and phagocytosis, pro-inflammatory cytokine release, and oxidative stress in hippocampal neurons and glia of wildtype and P301S transgenic mice expressing TIA1<sup>+/+</sup>, TIA1<sup>+/–</sup>, and TIA1<sup>–/–</sup> in both early (5 month) and advanced (9 month) disease states through biochemical, ultrastructural, and histological analyses. Our data show that both TIA1 haploinsufficiency and TIA1 knockout exacerbate neuroinflammatory processes in advanced stages of tauopathy, suggesting that TIA1 dampens the immune response in the central nervous system during chronic stress.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00261">Coupled CP Decomposition of Simultaneous MEG-EEG Signals for Differentiating Oscillators During Photic Driving</a></h4>

<p>Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) are contemporary methods to investigate the function and organization of the brain. Simultaneously acquired MEG-EEG data are inherently multi-dimensional and exhibit coupling. This study uses a coupled tensor decomposition to extract the signal sources from MEG-EEG during intermittent photic stimulation (IPS). We employ the Coupled Semi-Algebraic framework for approximate CP decomposition via SImultaneous matrix diagonalization (C-SECSI). After comparing its performance with alternative methods using simulated benchmark data, we apply it to MEG-EEG recordings of 12 participants during IPS with fractions of the individual alpha frequency between 0.4 and 1.3. In the benchmark tests, C-SECSI is more accurate than SECSI and alternative methods, especially in ill-conditioned scenarios, e.g., involving collinear factors or noise sources with different variances. The component field-maps allow us to separate physiologically meaningful oscillations of visually evoked brain activity from background signals. The frequency signatures of the components identify either an entrainment to the respective stimulation frequency or its first harmonic, or an oscillation in the individual alpha band or theta band. In the group analysis of both, MEG and EEG data, we observe a reciprocal relationship between alpha and theta band oscillations. The coupled tensor decomposition using C-SECSI is a robust, powerful method for the extraction of physiologically meaningful sources from multidimensional biomedical data. Unsupervised signal source extraction is an essential solution for rendering advanced multi-modal signal acquisition technology accessible to clinical diagnostics, pre-surgical planning, and brain computer interface applications.</p>

<p>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder that affects 5% of the pediatric and adult population worldwide. The diagnosis remains essentially clinical, based on history and exam, with no available biomarkers. In this paper, we describe a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a four-layer architecture combining filtering and pooling, which we train using stacked multi-channel EEG time-frequency decompositions (spectrograms) of electroencephalography data (EEG), particularly of event-related potentials (ERP) from ADHD patients (n = 20) and healthy controls (n = 20) collected during the Flanker Task, with 2800 samples for each group. We treat the data as in audio or image classification approaches, where deep networks have proven successful by exploiting invariances and compositional features in the data. The model reaches a classification accuracy of 88% ± 1.12%, outperforming the Recurrent Neural Network and the Shallow Neural Network used for comparison, and with the key advantage, compared with other machine learning approaches, of avoiding the need for manual selection of EEG spectral or channel features. The event-related spectrograms also provide greater accuracy compared to resting state EEG spectrograms. Finally, through the use of feature visualization techniques such as DeepDream, we show that the main features exciting the CNN nodes are a decreased power in the alpha band and an increased power in the delta-theta band around 100 ms for ADHD patients compared to healthy controls, suggestive of attentional and inhibition deficits, which have been previously suggested as pathophyisiological signatures of ADHD. While confirmation with larger clinical samples is necessary, these results suggest that deep networks may provide a useful tool for the analysis of EEG dynamics even from relatively small datasets, highlighting the potential of this methodology to develop biomarkers of practical clinical utility.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00139">Persistence of EEG Alpha Entrainment Depends on Stimulus Phase at Offset</a></h4>

<p>Neural entrainment is the synchronization of neural activity to the frequency of repetitive external stimuli, which can be observed as an increase in the electroencephalogram (EEG) power spectrum at the driving frequency, -also known as the steady-state response. Although it has been systematically reported that the entrained EEG oscillation persists for approximately three cycles after stimulus offset, the neural mechanisms underpinning it remain unknown. Focusing on alpha oscillations, we adopt the dynamical excitation/inhibition framework, which suggests that phases of entrained EEG signals correspond to alternating excitatory/inhibitory states of the neural circuitry. We hypothesize that the duration of the persistence of entrainment is determined by the specific functional state of the entrained neural network at the time the stimulus ends. Steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) were elicited in 19 healthy volunteers at the participants’ individual alpha peaks. Visual stimulation consisted of a sinusoidally-varying light terminating at one of four phases: 0, π/2, π, and 3π/2. The persistence duration of the oscillatory activity was analyzed as a function of the terminating phase of the stimulus. Phases of the SSVEP at the stimulus termination were distributed within a constant range of values relative to the phase of the stimulus. Longer persistence durations were obtained when visual stimulation terminated towards the troughs of the alpha oscillations, while shorter persistence durations occurred when stimuli terminated near the peaks. Source localization analysis suggests that the persistence of entrainment reflects the functioning of fronto-occipital neuronal circuits, which might prime the sensory representation of incoming visual stimuli based on predictions about stimulus rhythmicity. Consequently, different states of the network at the end of the stimulation, corresponding to different states of intrinsic neuronal coupling, may determine the time windows over which coding of incoming sensory stimulation is modulated by the preceding oscillatory activity.</p>

<p>Enhancing performance levels of athletes during training and competition is a desired goal in sports. Quantifying training success is typically accompanied by performance diagnostics including the assessment of sports-relevant behavioral and physiological parameters. Even though optimal brain processing is a key factor for augmented motor performance and skill learning, neurodiagnostics is typically not implemented in performance diagnostics of athletes. We propose, that neurodiagnostics via non-invasive brain imaging techniques such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) will offer novel perspectives to quantify training-induced neuroplasticity and its relation to motor behavior. A better understanding of such a brain-behavior relationship during the execution of sport-specific movements might help to guide training processes and to optimize training outcomes. Furthermore, targeted non-invasive brain stimulation such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) might help to further enhance training outcomes by modulating brain areas that show training-induced neuroplasticity. However, we strongly suggest that ethical aspects in the use of non-invasive brain stimulation during training and/or competition need to be addressed before neuromodulation can be considered as a performance enhancer in sports.</p>

<p>Studies of spoken word recognition have reliably shown that both younger and older adults’ recognition of acoustically degraded words is facilitated by the presence of a linguistic context. Against this benefit, older adults’ word recognition can be differentially hampered by interference from other words that could also fit the context. These prior studies have primarily used off-line response measures such as the signal-to-noise ratio needed for a target word to be correctly identified. Less clear is the locus of these effects; whether facilitation and interference have their influence primarily during response selection, or whether their effects begin to operate even before a sentence-final target word has been uttered. This question was addressed by tracking 20 younger and 20 older adults’ eye fixations on a visually presented target word that corresponded to the final word of a contextually constraining or neutral sentence, accompanied by a second word on the computer screen that in some cases could also fit the sentence context. Growth curve analysis of the time-course of eye-gaze on a target word showed facilitation and inhibition effects begin to appear even as a spoken sentence is unfolding in time. Consistent with an age-related inhibition deficit, older adults’ word recognition was slowed by the presence of a semantic competitor to a degree not observed for younger adults, with this effect operating early in the recognition process.</p>

<p>Afferent feedback can appreciably alter the pharyngeal phase of swallow. In order to measure the stability of the swallow motor pattern during several types of alterations in afferent feedback, we assessed swallow during a conventional water challenge in four anesthetized cats, and compared that to swallows induced by fixed (20 Hz) and stochastic (1-20Hz) electrical stimulation applied to the superior laryngeal nerve. The swallow motor patterns were evaluated by electromyographic activity (EMG) of eight muscles, based on their functional significance: laryngeal elevators (mylohyoid, geniohyoid, and thyrohyoid); laryngeal adductor (thyroarytenoid); inferior pharyngeal constrictor (thyropharyngeus); upper esophageal sphincter (cricopharyngeus); and inspiratory activity (parasternal and costal diaphragm). Both the fixed and stochastic electrical stimulation paradigms increased activity of the laryngeal elevators, produced short-term facilitation evidenced by increasing swallow durations over the stimulus period, and conversely inhibited swallow-related diaphragm activity. Both the fixed and stochastic stimulus conditions also increased specific EMG amplitudes, which never occurred with the water challenges. Stochastic stimulation increased swallow excitability, as measured by an increase in the number of swallows produced. Consistent with our previous results, changes in the swallow motor pattern for pairs of muscles were only sometimes correlated with each other. We conclude that alterations in afferent feedback produced particular variations of the swallow motor pattern. We hypothesize that specific SLN feedback might modulate the swallow central pattern generator during aberrant feeding conditions (food/liquid entering the airway), which may protect the airway and serve as potentially important clinical diagnostic indicators.</p>

<p>The assessment of the consciousness level of Unresponsive Wakefulness Syndrome (UWS) patients often depends on a subjective interpretation of the observed spontaneous and volitional behavior. To date, the misdiagnosis level is around 30%. The aim of this study was to observe the behavior of UWS patients, during the administration of noxious stimulation by a Trace Conditioning protocol, assessed by the Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV) entropy. We recruited 13 Healthy Control (HC) and 30 UWS patients at 31 ± 9 days from the acute event evaluated by Coma Recovery Scale–Revised (CRS-R) and Nociception Coma Scale (NCS). Two different stimuli [musical stimulus (MUS) and nociceptive stimulus (NOC)], preceded, respectively by two different tones, were administered following the sequences (A) MUS1 – NOC1 – MUS2 – MUS3 – NOC2 – MUS4 – NOC3 – NOC<sup>*</sup>, and (B) MUS1<sup>*</sup>, NOC1<sup>*</sup>, NOC2<sup>*</sup>, MUS2<sup>*</sup>, NOC3<sup>*</sup>, MUS3<sup>*</sup>, NOC4<sup>*</sup>, MUS4<sup>*</sup>. All the (<sup>*</sup>) indicate the only tones administration. CRS-R and NCS assessments were repeated for three consecutive weeks. MUS4, NOC3, and NOC<sup>*</sup> were compared for GSR wave peak magnitude, time to reach the peak, and time of wave's decay by Wilcoxon's test to assess the Conditioned Response (CR). The Sample Entropy (SampEn) was recorded in baseline and both sequences. Machine Learning approach was used to identify a rule to discriminate the CR. The GSR magnitude of CR was higher comparing music stimulus (p &lt; 0.0001) and CR extinction (p &lt; 0.002) in nine patients and in HC. Patients with CR showed a higher SampEn in sequence A compared to patients without CR. Within the third and fourth weeks from protocol administration, eight of the nine patients (88.9%) evolved into MCS. The Machine-learning showed a high performance to differentiate presence/absence of CR (≥95%). The possibility to observe the CR to the noxious stimulus, by means of the GSR and SampEn, can represent a potential method to reduce the misdiagnosis in UWS patients.</p>

<p>Background: Pain and body perception are essentially two subjective mutually influencing experiences. However, in the field of musculoskeletal disorders and rheumatic diseases we lack of a comprehensive knowledge about the relationship between body perception dysfunctions and pain or disability. We systematically mapped the literature published about the topics of: (a) somatoperception; (b) body ownership; and (c) perception of space, analysing the relationship with pain and disability. The results were organized around the two main topics of the assessment and treatment of perceptual dysfunctions.</p><p>Methods: This scoping review followed the six-stage methodology suggested by Arksey and O'Malley. Ten electronic databases and grey literature were systematically searched. The PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews was used for reporting results. Two reviewers with different background, independently performed study screening and selection, and one author performed data extraction, that was checked by a second reviewer.</p><p>Results: Thirty-seven studies fulfilled the eligibility criteria. The majority of studies (68%) concerned the assessment methodology, and the remaining 32% investigated the effects of therapeutic interventions. Research designs, methodologies adopted, and settings varied considerably across studies. Evidence of distorted body experience were found mainly for explicit somatoperception, especially in studies adopting self-administered questionnaire and subjective measures, highlighting in some cases the presence of sub-groups with different perceptual features. Almost half of the intervention studies (42%) provided therapeutic approaches combining more than one perceptual task, or sensory-motor tasks together with perceptual strategies, thus it was difficult to estimate the relative effectiveness of each single therapeutic component.</p><p>Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to systematically map and summarize this research area in the field of musculoskeletal disorders and rheumatic diseases. Although methodological limitations limit the validity of the evidence obtained, some strategies of assessment tested and therapeutic strategies proposed represent useful starting points for future research. This review highlights preliminary evidence, strengths, and limitations of the literature published about the research questions, identifying key points that remain opened to be addressed, and make suggestions for future research studies. Body representation, as well as pain perception and treatment, can be better understood if an enlarged perspective including body and space perception is considered.</p>

<p>Background: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to be an inexpensive, safe, and effective way of augmenting a variety of cognitive abilities. Relatively recent advances in neuroimaging technology have provided the ability to measure brain activity concurrently during active brain stimulation rather than after stimulation. The effects on brain activity elicited by tDCS during active tDCS reported by initial studies have been somewhat conflicted and seemingly dependent on whether a behavioral improvement was observed.</p><p>Objective: The current study set out to address questions regarding behavioral change, within and between-participant designs as well as differentiating the effects on hemodynamic amplitude and baseline during active tDCS stimulation.</p><p>Methods: We tested the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on anterior hemodynamics in prefrontal cortex during performance on a spatial memory task. Prefrontal cortex activity was measured with functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), a wearable and portable neuroimaging technique that utilizes near infrared light to measure cortical oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin changes non-invasively. There were two groups, one group (n = 10) received only sham stimulation and the other group (n = 11) received sham followed by anodal stimulation to right ventral lateral prefrontal cortex.</p><p>Results: Analyses revealed an increase in spatial memory performance following tDCS stimulation. This augmented performance was accompanied by changes to oxygenation (HbO–HbR) at the onset of the hemodynamic response in bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and left ventral medial prefrontal cortex. In these regions we also observed that stimulation improved neural processing efficiency, by reducing oxygenation and increasing performance from block to block. During and following tDCS stimulation, it was also observed that in bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex the relationship between performance and oxygenation inverted, from a negative relationship to a positive relationship.</p><p>Conclusion: The results suggest that tDCS is predominately a mechanism for changing neurons propensity for activity as opposed to their strength of activity. tDCS not only alters the efficiency of task relevant processing, but also the nature in which hemodynamic resources are used during augmented task performance.</p>

<p>Biological realism of dendritic morphologies is important for simulating electrical stimulation of brain tissue. By adding point process modeling and conditional sampling to existing generation strategies, we provide a novel means of reproducing the nuanced branching behavior that occurs in different layers of granule cell dendritic morphologies. In this study, a heterogeneous Poisson point process was used to simulate branching events. Conditional distributions were then used to select branch angles depending on the orthogonal distance to the somatic plane. The proposed method was compared to an existing generation tool and a control version of the proposed method that used a homogeneous Poisson point process. Morphologies were generated with each method and then compared to a set of digitally reconstructed neurons. The introduction of a conditionally dependent branching rate resulted in the generation of morphologies that more accurately reproduced the emergent properties of dendritic material per layer, Sholl intersections, and proximal passive current flow. Conditional dependence was critically important for the generation of realistic granule cell dendritic morphologies.</p>

<p>Many epidemiology studies have shown that maternal polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) results in a greater risk of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) development, although the detailed mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential mechanism and provide a possible treatment for PCOS-mediated ASD through three experiments: Experiment 1: real-time PCR and western blots were employed to measure gene expression in human neurons, and the luciferase reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was used to map the responsive elements on related gene promoters. Experiment 2: pregnant dams were prenatally exposed to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), androgen receptor (AR) knockdown (shAR) in the amygdala, or berberine (BBR), and the subsequent male offspring were used for autism-like behavior (ALB) assay followed by biomedical analysis, including gene expression, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial function. Experiment 3: the male offspring from prenatal DHT exposed dams were postnatally treated by either shAR or BBR, and the offspring were used for ALB assay followed by biomedical analysis. Our findings showed that DHT treatment suppresses the expression of estrogen receptor β (ERβ) and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) through AR-mediated hypermethylation on the ERβ promoter, and BBR treatment suppresses AR expression through hypermethylation on the AR promoter. Prenatal DHT treatment induces ERβ suppression, oxidative stress and mitochondria dysfunction in the amygdala with subsequent ALB behavior in male offspring, and AR knockdown partly diminishes this effect. Furthermore, both prenatal and postnatal treatment of BBR partly restores prenatal DHT exposure-mediated ALB. In conclusion, DHT suppresses ERβ expression through the AR signaling pathway by hypermethylation on the ERβ promoter, and BBR restores this effect through AR suppression. Prenatal DHT exposure induces ALB in offspring through AR-mediated ERβ suppression, and both prenatal and postnatal treatment of BBR ameliorates this effect. We conclude that BBR ameliorates prenatal DHT exposure-induced ALB through AR suppression, this study may help elucidate the potential mechanism and identify a potential treatment through using BBR for PCOS-mediated ASD.</p>

<p>The intrinsic nervous system of the gut interacts with the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) via bidirectional neuroimmune interactions. The caecum is an understudied region of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract that houses a large supply of microbes and is involved in generating immune responses. The caecal patch is a lymphoid aggregate located within the caecum that regulates microbial content and immune responses. People with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD; autism) experience serious GI dysfunction, including inflammatory disorders, more frequently than the general population. Autism is a highly prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder defined by the presence of repetitive behavior or restricted interests, language impairment, and social deficits. Mutations in genes encoding synaptic adhesion proteins such as the R451C missense mutation in neuroligin-3 (NL3) are associated with autism and impair synaptic transmission. We previously reported that NL3<sup>R451C</sup> mice, a well-established model of autism, have altered enteric neurons and GI dysfunction; however, whether the autism-associated R451C mutation alters the caecal enteric nervous system and immune function is unknown. We assessed for gross anatomical changes in the caecum and quantified the proportions of caecal submucosal and myenteric neurons in wild-type and NL3<sup>R451C</sup> mice using immunofluorescence. In the caecal patch, we assessed total cellular density as well as the density and morphology of Iba-1 labeled macrophages to identify whether the R451C mutation affects neuro-immune interactions. NL3<sup>R451C</sup> mice have significantly reduced caecal weight compared to wild-type mice, irrespective of background strain. Caecal weight is also reduced in mice lacking Neuroligin-3. NL3<sup>R451C</sup> caecal ganglia contain more neurons overall and increased numbers of Nitric Oxide (NO) producing neurons (labeled by Nitric Oxide Synthase; NOS) per ganglion in both the submucosal and myenteric plexus. Overall caecal patch cell density was unchanged however NL3<sup>R451C</sup> mice have an increased density of Iba-1 labeled enteric macrophages. Macrophages in NL3<sup>R451C</sup> were smaller and more spherical in morphology. Here, we identify changes in both the nervous system and immune system caused by an autism-associated mutation in Nlgn3 encoding the postsynaptic cell adhesion protein, Neuroligin-3. These findings provide further insights into the potential modulation of neural and immune pathways.</p>

<p>Brain microvasculature forms a specialized structure, the blood-brain barrier (BBB), to maintain homeostasis and integrity of the central nervous system (CNS). The BBB dysfunction is emerging as a critical contributor to multiple neurological disorders, including stroke, traumatic brain injury, autoimmune multiple sclerosis, and neurodegenerative diseases. The brain microvasculature exhibits highly cellular and regional heterogeneity to accommodate dynamic changes of microenvironment during homeostasis and diseases. Thus, investigating the underlying mechanisms that contribute to molecular or cellular changes of the BBB is a significant challenge. Here, we describe an optimized protocol to purify microvessels from the mouse cerebral cortex using mechanical homogenization and density-gradient centrifugation, while maintaining the structural integrity and functional activity of the BBB. We show that the isolated microvessel fragments consist of BBB cell populations, including endothelial cells, astrocyte end-feet, pericytes, as well as tight junction proteins that seal endothelial cells. Furthermore, we describe the procedures to generate single-cell suspensions from isolated microvessel fragments. We demonstrate that cells in the single-cell suspensions are highly viable and suitable for single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis. This protocol does not require transgenic mice and cell sorting equipment to isolate fluorescence-labeled endothelial cells. The optimized procedures can be applied to different disease models to generate viable cells for single-cell analysis to uncover transcriptional or epigenetic landscapes of BBB component cells.</p>

<p>Astrocytes contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative proteinopathies as influencing neuronal degeneration or neuroprotection, and also act as potential mediators of the propagation or elimination of disease-associated proteins. Protein astrogliopathies can be observed in different forms of neurodegenerative conditions. Morphological characterization of astrogliopathy is used only for the classification of tauopathies. Currently, at least six types of astrocytic tau pathologies are distinguished. Astrocytic plaques (AP), tufted astrocytes (TAs), ramified astrocytes (RA), and globular astroglial inclusions are seen predominantly in primary tauopathies, while thorn-shaped astrocytes (TSA) and granular/fuzzy astrocytes (GFA) are evaluated in aging-related tau astrogliopathy (ARTAG). ARTAG can be seen in the white and gray matter and subpial, subependymal, and perivascular locations. Some of these overlap with the features of tau pathology seen in Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Furthermore, gray matter ARTAG shares features with primary tauopathy-related astrocytic tau pathology. Sequential distribution patterns have been described for tau astrogliopathies. Importantly, astrocytic tau pathology in primary tauopathies can be observed in brain areas without neuronal tau deposition. The various morphologies of tau astrogliopathy might reflect a role in the propagation of pathological tau protein, an early response to a yet unidentified neurodegeneration-inducing event, or, particularly for ARTAG, a response to a repeated or prolonged pathogenic process such as blood-brain barrier dysfunction or local mechanical impact. The concept of tau astrogliopathies and ARTAG facilitated communication among research disciplines and triggered the investigation of the significance of astrocytic lesions in neurodegenerative conditions.</p>

<p>Aging, even in the absence of clear pathology of dementia, is associated with cognitive decline. Neuroimaging, especially diffusion-weighted imaging, has been highly valuable in understanding some of these changes in live humans, non-invasively. Traditional tensor techniques have revealed that the integrity of the fornix and other white matter tracts significantly deteriorates with age, and that this deterioration is highly correlated with worsening cognitive performance. However, traditional tensor techniques are still not specific enough to indict explicit microstructural features that may be responsible for age-related cognitive decline and cannot be used to effectively study gray matter properties. Here, we sought to determine whether recent advances in diffusion-weighted imaging, including Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) and Constrained Spherical Deconvolution, would provide more sensitive measures of age-related changes in the microstructure of the medial temporal lobe. We evaluated these measures in a group of young (ages 20–38 years old) and older (ages 59–84 years old) adults and assessed their relationships with performance on tests of cognition. We found that the fiber density (FD) of the fornix and the neurite density index (NDI) of the fornix, hippocampal subfields (DG/CA3, CA1, and subiculum), and parahippocampal cortex, varied as a function of age in a cross-sectional cohort. Moreover, in the fornix, DG/CA3, and CA1, these changes correlated with memory performance on the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), even after regressing out the effect of age, suggesting that they were capturing neurobiological properties directly related to performance in this task. These measures provide more details regarding age-related neurobiological properties. For example, a change in fiber density could mean a reduction in axonal packing density or myelination, and the increase in NDI observed might be explained by changes in dendritic complexity or even sprouting. These results provide a far more comprehensive view than previously determined on the possible system-wide processes that may be occurring because of healthy aging and demonstrate that advanced diffusion-weighted imaging is evolving into a powerful tool to study more than just white matter properties.</p>

<p>In the inner ear, cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signaling has been described as facilitating otoprotection, which was previously observed through elevated cGMP levels achieved by phosphodiesterase 5 inhibition. However, to date, the upstream guanylyl cyclase (GC) subtype eliciting cGMP production is unknown. Here, we show that mice with a genetic disruption of the gene encoding the cGMP generator GC-A, the receptor for atrial and B-type natriuretic peptides, display a greater vulnerability of hair cells to hidden hearing loss and noise- and age-dependent hearing loss. This vulnerability was associated with GC-A expression in spiral ganglia and outer hair cells (OHCs) but not in inner hair cells (IHCs). GC-A knockout mice exhibited elevated hearing thresholds, most pronounced for the detection of high-frequency tones. Deficits in OHC input–output functions in high-frequency regions were already present in young GC-A-deficient mice, with no signs of an accelerated progression of age-related hearing loss or higher vulnerability to acoustic trauma. OHCs in these frequency regions in young GC-A knockout mice exhibited diminished levels of KCNQ4 expression, which is the dominant K<sup>+</sup> channel in OHCs, and decreased activation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1, an enzyme involved in DNA repair. Further, GC-A knockout mice had IHC synapse impairments and reduced amplitudes of auditory brainstem responses that progressed with age and with acoustic trauma, in contrast to OHCs, when compared to GC-A wild-type littermates. We conclude that GC-A/cGMP-dependent signaling pathways have otoprotective functions and GC-A gene disruption differentially contributes to hair-cell damage in a healthy, aged, or injured system. Thus, augmentation of natriuretic peptide GC-A signaling likely has potential to overcome hidden and noise-induced hearing loss, as well as presbycusis.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55370">CNGA3 acts as a cold sensor in hypothalamic neurons</a></h4>

Most mammals maintain their body temperature around 37°C, whereas in hibernators it can approach 0°C without triggering a thermogenic response. The remarkable plasticity of the thermoregulatory system allowed mammals to thrive in variable environmental conditions and occupy a wide range of geographical habitats, but the molecular basis of thermoregulation remains poorly understood. Here we leverage the thermoregulatory differences between mice and hibernating thirteen-lined ground squirrels (<i>Ictidomys tridecemlineatus</i>) to investigate the mechanism of cold sensitivity in the preoptic area (POA) of the hypothalamus, a critical thermoregulatory region. We report that, in comparison to squirrels, mice have a larger proportion of cold-sensitive neurons in the POA. We further show that mouse cold-sensitive neurons express the cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel CNGA3, and that mouse, but not squirrel, CNGA3 is potentiated by cold. Our data reveal CNGA3 as a hypothalamic cold sensor and a molecular marker to interrogate the neuronal circuitry underlying thermoregulation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55211">Cooperative enzymatic control of N-acyl amino acids by PM20D1 and FAAH</a></h4>

The N-acyl amino acids are a family of bioactive lipids with pleiotropic physiologic functions, including in energy homeostasis. Their endogenous levels are regulated by an extracellular mammalian N-acyl amino acid synthase/hydrolase called PM20D1 (peptidase M20 domain containing 1). Using an activity-guided biochemical approach, we report the molecular identification of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) as a second intracellular N-acyl amino acid synthase/hydrolase. In vitro, FAAH exhibits a more restricted substrate scope compared to PM20D1. In mice, genetic ablation or selective pharmacological inhibition of FAAH bidirectionally dysregulates intracellular, but not circulating, N-acyl amino acids. Dual blockade of both PM20D1 and FAAH reveals a dramatic and non-additive biochemical engagement of these two enzymatic pathways. These data establish FAAH as a second intracellular pathway for N-acyl amino acid metabolism and underscore enzymatic division of labor as an enabling strategy for the regulation of a structurally diverse bioactive lipid family.

The Norway rat has important impacts on our life. They are amongst the most used research subjects, resulting in ground-breaking advances. At the same time, wild rats live in close association with us, leading to various adverse interactions. In face of this relevance, it is surprising how little is known about their natural behaviour. While recent laboratory studies revealed their complex social skills, little is known about their social behaviour in the wild. An integration of these different scientific approaches is crucial to understand their social life, which will enable us to design more valid research paradigms, develop more effective management strategies, and to provide better welfare standards. Hence, I first summarise the literature on their natural social behaviour. Second, I provide an overview of recent developments concerning their social cognition. Third, I illustrate why an integration of these areas would be beneficial to optimise our interactions with them.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/52709">High-phytate/low-calcium diet is a risk factor for crystal nephropathies, renal phosphate wasting, and bone loss</a></h4>

Phosphate overload contributes to mineral bone disorders that are associated with crystal nephropathies. Phytate, the major form of phosphorus in plant seeds, is known as an indigestible and of negligible nutritional value in humans. However, the mechanism and adverse effects of high-phytate intake on Ca<sup>2+</sup> and phosphate absorption and homeostasis are unknown. Here, we show that excessive intake of phytate along with a low-Ca<sup>2+</sup> diet fed to rats contributed to the development of crystal nephropathies, renal phosphate wasting, and bone loss through tubular dysfunction secondary to dysregulation of intestinal calcium and phosphate absorption. Moreover, Ca<sup>2+</sup> supplementation alleviated the detrimental effects of excess dietary phytate on bone and kidney through excretion of undigested Ca<sup>2+</sup>-phytate, which prevented a vicious cycle of intestinal phosphate overload and renal phosphate wasting while improving intestinal Ca<sup>2+</sup> bioavailability. Thus, we demonstrate that phytate is digestible without a high-Ca<sup>2+</sup> diet and is a risk factor for phosphate overloading and for the development of crystal nephropathies and bone disease.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/48963">Differential expression of MAGEA6 toggles autophagy to promote pancreatic cancer progression</a></h4>

The melanoma-associated antigen family A (MAGEA) antigens are expressed in a wide variety of malignant tumors but not in adult somatic cells, rendering them attractive targets for cancer immunotherapy. Here we show that a number of cancer-associated MAGEA mutants that undergo proteasome-dependent degradation <i>in vitro</i> could negatively impact their utility as immunotherapeutic targets. Importantly, in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell models, MAGEA6 suppresses macroautophagy (autophagy). The inhibition of autophagy is released upon MAGEA6 degradation, which can be induced by nutrient deficiency or by acquisition of cancer-associated mutations. Using xenograft mouse models, we demonstrated that inhibition of autophagy is critical for tumor initiation whereas reinstitution of autophagy as a consequence of MAGEA6 degradation contributes to tumor progression. These findings could inform cancer immunotherapeutic strategies for targeting MAGEA antigens and provide mechanistic insight into the divergent roles of <i>MAGEA6</i> during pancreatic cancer initiation and progression.

<p>by Lara S. Burchardt, Mirjam Knörnschild</p>

Analyzing the rhythm of animals’ acoustic signals is of interest to a growing number of researchers: evolutionary biologists want to disentangle how these structures evolved and what patterns can be found, and ecologists and conservation biologists aim to discriminate cryptic species on the basis of parameters of acoustic signals such as temporal structures. Temporal structures are also relevant for research on vocal production learning, a part of which is for the animal to learn a temporal structure. These structures, in other words, these rhythms, are the topic of this paper. How can they be investigated in a meaningful, comparable and universal way? Several approaches exist. Here we used five methods to compare their suitability and interpretability for different questions and datasets and test how they support the reproducibility of results and bypass biases. Three very different datasets with regards to recording situation, length and context were analyzed: two social vocalizations of Neotropical bats (multisyllabic, medium long isolation calls of <i>Saccopteryx bilineata</i>, and monosyllabic, very short isolation calls of <i>Carollia perspicillata)</i> and click trains of sperm whales, <i>Physeter macrocephalus</i>. Techniques to be compared included Fourier analysis with a newly developed goodness-of-fit value, a generate-and-test approach where data was overlaid with varying artificial beats, and the analysis of inter-onset-intervals and calculations of a normalized Pairwise Variability Index (nPVI). We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the methods and we also show suggestions on how to best visualize rhythm analysis results. Furthermore, we developed a decision tree that will enable researchers to select a suitable and comparable method on the basis of their data.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/T27mpkMvTu4" width="1" />

<p>by Qili Fei, Zhongyu Zou, Ian A. Roundtree, Hui-Lung Sun, Chuan He</p>

The <i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) modification regulates mRNA stability and translation. Here, we show that transcriptomic m<sup>6</sup>A modification can be dynamic and the m<sup>6</sup>A reader protein YTH <i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine RNA binding protein 2 (YTHDF2) promotes mRNA decay during cell cycle. Depletion of YTHDF2 in HeLa cells leads to the delay of mitotic entry due to overaccumulation of negative regulators of cell cycle such as Wee1-like protein kinase (WEE1). We demonstrate that WEE1 transcripts contain m<sup>6</sup>A modification, which promotes their decay through YTHDF2. Moreover, we found that YTHDF2 protein stability is dependent on cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) activity. Thus, CDK1, YTHDF2, and WEE1 form a feedforward regulatory loop to promote mitotic entry. We further identified Cullin 1 (CUL1), Cullin 4A (CUL4A), damaged DNA-binding protein 1 (DDB1), and S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2) as components of E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes that mediate YTHDF2 proteolysis. Our study provides insights into how cell cycle mediators modulate transcriptomic m<sup>6</sup>A modification, which in turn regulates the cell cycle.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/IIrJs4b23Q8" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>Here we systematically tested the hypothesis that motivated behavioral responsiveness to preferred and avoided taste compounds is relatively independent of the olfactory system in mice whose olfactory bulbs (main and accessory) were surgically disconnected from the rest of the brain [bulbotomy (BULBx)]. BULBx was confirmed histologically as well as functionally with the buried food test. In brief access taste tests, animals received 10-s trials of various concentrations of a taste compound delivered quasirandomly. BULBx C57BL/6 (B6) mice displayed severely blunted concentration-dependent licking for the disaccharide sucrose, the maltodextrin Maltrin, and the fat emulsion Intralipid relative to their sham-operated controls (SHAM B6). Licking for the noncaloric sweetener saccharin was also blunted by bulbotomy, but less so. As expected, mice lacking a functional "sweet" receptor [T1R2+T1R3 knockout (KO)] displayed concentration-dependent responsiveness to Maltrin and severely attenuated licking to sucrose. Like in B6 mice, responsiveness to both stimuli was exceptionally curtailed by bulbotomy. In contrast to these deficits in taste-guided behavior for unconditionally preferred stimuli, BULBx in B6 and KO mice did not alter concentration-dependent decreases for the representative avoided stimuli quinine and citric acid. Nor did it temper the intake of and preference for high concentrations of affectively positive stimuli when presented in long-term (23-h) two-bottle tests, demonstrating that the surgery does not lead to a generalized motivational deficit. Collectively, these behavioral results demonstrate that specific aspects of taste-guided ingestive motivation are profoundly disturbed by eliminating the anatomic connections between the main/accessory olfactory bulbs and the rest of the brain.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To assess real‐world effectiveness of initial treatment with newer compared to injectable disease‐modifying therapies (DMTs) on disease activity in pediatric MS and clinically isolated syndrome (CIS).</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This is a cohort study of children with MS/CIS followed at 12 clinics in the US Network of Pediatric MS Centers, who received initial therapy with newer (fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide, natalizumab, rituximab, ocrelizumab) or injectable (interferon‐β, glatiramer acetate) DMTs. Propensity scores (PS) were computed including pre‐identified confounders. Relapse rate while on initial DMT was modeled with negative binomial regression, adjusted for PS‐quintile. Time to new/enlarging T2 hyperintense and gadolinium‐enhancing lesions on MRI brain were modeled with midpoint survival analyses, adjusted for PS‐quintile.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>741 children began therapy before 18 years, 197 with newer and 544 with injectable DMTs. Those started on newer DMTs were older (15.2 vs. injectable 14.4 years, p=0.001) and less likely to have a monofocal presentation. In PS‐quintile adjusted analysis, those on newer DMTs had lower relapse rate than those on injectables (rate ratio 0.45, 95%CI 0.29‐0.70, p&lt;0.001; rate difference 0.27, 0.14‐0.40, p=0.004). One would need to treat with newer over injectable DMTs for 3.7 person‐years to prevent one relapse. Those started on newer DMTs had lower rate of new/enlarging T2 (HR 0.51, 0.36‐0.72, p&lt;0.001) and gadolinium‐enhancing lesions (HR 0.38, 0.23‐0.63, p&lt;0.001) than those on injectables.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Initial treatment of pediatric MS/CIS with newer DMTs led to better disease activity control compared to injectables, supporting greater effectiveness of newer therapies. Long‐term safety data for newer DMTs are required.</p>

<p>Transcription factors regulate multiple processes during brain development and in the adult brain, from brain patterning to differentiation and maturation of highly specialized neurons as well as establishing and maintaining the functional neuronal connectivity. The members of the zinc-finger transcription factor family Bcl11 are mainly expressed in the hematopoietic and central nervous systems regulating the expression of numerous genes involved in a wide range of pathways. In the brain Bcl11 proteins are required to regulate progenitor cell proliferation as well as differentiation, migration, and functional integration of neural cells. Mutations of the human Bcl11 genes lead to anomalies in multiple systems including neurodevelopmental impairments like intellectual disabilities and autism spectrum disorders.</p>

<p>Automatic segmentation of brain tumors has the potential to enable volumetric measures and high-throughput analysis in the clinical setting. Reaching this potential seems almost achieved, considering the steady increase in segmentation accuracy. However, despite segmentation accuracy, the current methods still do not meet the robustness levels required for patient-centered clinical use. In this regard, uncertainty estimates are a promising direction to improve the robustness of automated segmentation systems. Different uncertainty estimation methods have been proposed, but little is known about their usefulness and limitations for brain tumor segmentation. In this study, we present an analysis of the most commonly used uncertainty estimation methods in regards to benefits and challenges for brain tumor segmentation. We evaluated their quality in terms of calibration, segmentation error localization, and segmentation failure detection. Our results show that the uncertainty methods are typically well-calibrated when evaluated at the dataset level. Evaluated at the subject level, we found notable miscalibrations and limited segmentation error localization (e.g., for correcting segmentations), which hinder the direct use of the voxel-wise uncertainties. Nevertheless, voxel-wise uncertainty showed value to detect failed segmentations when uncertainty estimates are aggregated at the subject level. Therefore, we suggest a careful usage of voxel-wise uncertainty measures and highlight the importance of developing solutions that address the subject-level requirements on calibration and segmentation error localization.</p>

Background<p>Surgery is a key approach for achieving seizure freedom in children with focal onset epilepsy. However, the resection can affect or be in the vicinity of the optic radiations. Multi-shell diffusion MRI and tractography can better characterize tissue structure and provide guidance to help minimize surgical related deficits. Whilst in adults tractography has been used to demonstrate that damage to the optic radiations leads to postoperative visual field deficits, this approach has yet to be properly explored in children.</p>Objective<p>To demonstrate the capabilities of multi-shell diffusion MRI and tractography in characterizing microstructural changes in children with epilepsy pre- and post-surgery affecting the occipital, parietal or temporal lobes.</p>Methods<p>Diffusion Tensor Imaging and the Spherical Mean Technique were used to investigate the microstructure of the optic radiations. Furthermore, tractography was used to evaluate whether pre-surgical reconstructions of the optic radiations overlap with the resection margin as measured using anatomical post-surgical T1-weighted MRI.</p>Results<p>Increased diffusivity in patients compared to controls at baseline was observed with evidence of decreased diffusivity, anisotropy, and neurite orientation distribution in contralateral hemisphere after surgery. Pre-surgical optic radiation tractography overlapped with post-surgical resection margins in 20/43 (46%) children, and where visual data was available before and after surgery, the presence of overlap indicated a visual field deficit.</p>Conclusion<p>This is the first report in a pediatric series which highlights the relevance of tractography for future pre-surgical evaluation in children undergoing epilepsy surgery and the usefulness of multi-shell diffusion MRI to characterize brain microstructure in these patients.</p>

<p>Aging is a condition that may be characterized by a decline in physical, sensory, and mental capacities, while increased morbidity and multimorbidity may be associated with disability. A wide range of clinical conditions (e.g., frailty, mild cognitive impairment, metabolic syndrome) and age-related diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, cancer, sarcopenia, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases) affect older people. Virtual reality (VR) is a novel and promising tool for assessment and rehabilitation in older people. Usability is a crucial factor that must be considered when designing virtual systems for medicine. We conducted a systematic review with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines concerning the usability of VR clinical systems in aging and provided suggestions to structure usability piloting. Findings show that different populations of older people have been recruited to mainly assess usability of non-immersive VR, with particular attention paid to motor/physical rehabilitation. Mixed approach (qualitative and quantitative tools together) is the preferred methodology; technology acceptance models are the most applied theoretical frameworks, however senior adapted models are the best within this context. Despite minor interaction issues and bugs, virtual systems are rated as usable and feasible. We encourage usability and user experience pilot studies to ameliorate interaction and improve acceptance and use of VR clinical applications in older people with the aid of suggestions (VR-USOP) provided by our analysis.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00085">The Relationship Between Socioeconomic Status and Brain Volume in Children and Adolescents With Prenatal Alcohol Exposure</a></h4>

<p>The positive relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and cognitive performance is mediated, in part, by differences in brain structure in typically developing youth. Associations between brain regions that relate to SES overlap with brain regions known to be sensitive to prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). Animal models demonstrate that PAE attenuates neural and cognitive benefits of early life enrichment. However, whether or not environmental factors related to SES are associated with brain development in youth affected by PAE remains unknown in humans.</p>Methods<p>T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were obtained in participants with PAE and compared to age- and sex- matched Controls (n = 197, 48% with PAE, 44% girls, 6.5–17.7 years old). General linear modeling was utilized to examine associations between SES and subcortical brain volumes for youth with PAE compared to Controls.</p>Results<p>Group by SES interactions were observed within the hippocampus (HPC), nucleus accumbens (NAc) and ventral diencephalon (vDC) (corrected p values &lt;0.05), where positive associations (e.g., higher SES related to larger subcortical volumes) were observed within Controls, but not youth with PAE. Post hoc analyses examined associations between SES and brain volumes within each group independently, and revealed widespread positive associations among Controls (Amyg, HPC, NAc, Pallidum, Putamen, vDC), but not youth with PAE. Across both groups, larger subcortical volumes were related to higher cognitive performance.</p>Conclusion<p>Typically developing youth exhibit increased subcortical volumes with increased SES, and surprisingly, this relationship is absent in adolescents with PAE. Findings suggest that subcortical brain volumes are neurocognitively relevant in both groups. The present results expand our understanding of the impact of PAE on the developing human brain within varying environmental contexts, and may inform novel environmental interventions that aim to improve, in part, on-going disruptions in brain development among youth with PAE. Our study highlights novel complexities in the pursuit to understand SES-brain associations, as we provide evidence that SES matters for brain outcomes among typically developing youth, and possibly not as much on an already altered brain as a result of PAE.</p>

<p>Accurate segmentation of different sub-regions of gliomas such as peritumoral edema, necrotic core, enhancing, and non-enhancing tumor core from multimodal MRI scans has important clinical relevance in diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of brain tumors. However, due to the highly heterogeneous appearance and shape of these tumors, segmentation of the sub-regions is challenging. Recent developments using deep learning models has proved its effectiveness in various semantic and medical image segmentation tasks, many of which are based on the U-Net network structure with symmetric encoding and decoding paths for end-to-end segmentation due to its high efficiency and good performance. In brain tumor segmentation, the 3D nature of multimodal MRI poses challenges such as memory and computation limitations and class imbalance when directly adopting the U-Net structure. In this study we aim to develop a deep learning model using a 3D U-Net with adaptations in the training and testing strategies, network structures, and model parameters for brain tumor segmentation. Furthermore, instead of picking one best model, an ensemble of multiple models trained with different hyper-parameters are used to reduce random errors from each model and yield improved performance. Preliminary results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method and achieved the 9th place in the very competitive 2018 Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge. In addition, to emphasize the clinical value of the developed segmentation method, a linear model based on the radiomics features extracted from segmentation and other clinical features are developed to predict patient overall survival. Evaluation of these innovations shows high prediction accuracy in both low-grade glioma and glioblastoma patients, which achieved the 1st place in the 2018 BraTS challenge.</p>

<p>Treatment for peripheral nerve injury remains limited. The inherent differences between motor and sensory nerve fibers in peripheral nerves should be considered to improve the effects of clinical treatment of peripheral nerve injury. In this study, we investigated the differences in protein expression and ultrastructure between the cutaneous and muscular branches of the femoral nerve in rats. Our results suggest that the cutaneous branch of the femoral nerve mainly contains sensory nerve fibers and few motor nerve fibers; Correspondingly, many motor nerve fibers and few sensory nerve fibers were observed in the muscular branch of the femoral nerve, which indicate that two branches of femoral nerve are mixed nerve. The mean thickness of the myelin sheath and basement membrane of the medullated fibers in the muscular branch of the femoral nerve was greater than that of the cutaneous branch of the femoral nerve. However, the cutaneous branch has a larger G-ratio. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis revealed that the cellular component term extracellular space was the most highly enriched, and more genes were upregulated in the muscular branch of the femoral nerve. Meanwhile, the expression of key proteins were validated by Western Blot, and immunofluorescence targets the expression of key proteins, which is consistent with the enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology. In conclusion, inherent differences in protein expression and ultrastructure were observed between the cutaneous and muscular branches of the femoral nerve in rats, which should be considered in future studies on the treatment of peripheral nerve injuries.</p>

<p>Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is characterized as a transitional phase between cognitive decline associated with normal aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measuring blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals provides complementary information considered essential for understanding disease progression. Previous studies suggested that multi-scale entropy (MSE) analysis quantifying the complexity of BOLD signals is a novel and promising method for investigating neurodegeneration associated with cognitive decline in different stages of MCI. Therefore, the current study used MSE to explore the changes in the complexity of resting-state brain BOLD signals in patients with early MCI (EMCI) and late MCI (LMCI). We recruited 345 participants’ data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database, including 176 normal control (NC) subjects, 87 patients with EMCI and 82 patients with LMCI. We observed a significant reduction of brain signal complexity toward regularity in the left fusiform gyrus region in the EMCI group and in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex in the LMCI group. Our results extend prior work by revealing that significant reductions of brain BOLD signal complexity can be detected in different stages of MCI independent of age, sex and regional atrophy. Notably, the reduction of BOLD signal complexity in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex was significantly associated with greater risk of progression to AD. The present study thus identified MSE as a potential imaging biomarker for the early diagnosis of pre-clinical Alzheimer’s disease and provides further insights into the neuropathology of cognitive decline in prodromal AD.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/53934">Single-molecule functional anatomy of endogenous HER2-HER3 heterodimers</a></h4>

Human epidermal growth factor receptors (HERs) are the primary targets of many directed cancer therapies. However, the reason a specific dimer of HERs generates a stronger proliferative signal than other permutations remains unclear. Here, we used single-molecule immunoprecipitation to develop a biochemical assay for endogenously-formed, entire HER2-HER3 heterodimers. We observed unexpected, large conformational fluctuations in juxta-membrane and kinase domains of the HER2-HER3 heterodimer. Nevertheless, the individual HER2-HER3 heterodimers catalyze tyrosine phosphorylation at an unusually high rate, while simultaneously interacting with multiple copies of downstream signaling effectors. Our results suggest that the high catalytic rate and multi-tasking capability make a concerted contribution to the strong signaling potency of the HER2-HER3 heterodimers.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/53683">Structural basis for ion selectivity in TMEM175 K<sup>+</sup> channels</a></h4>

The TMEM175 family constitutes recently discovered K<sup>+</sup> channels that are important for autophagosome turnover and lysosomal pH regulation and are associated with the early onset of Parkinson Disease. TMEM175 channels lack a P-loop selectivity filter, a hallmark of all known K<sup>+</sup> channels, raising the question how selectivity is achieved. Here, we report the X-ray structure of a closed bacterial TMEM175 channel in complex with a nanobody fusion-protein disclosing bound K<sup>+</sup> ions. Our analysis revealed that a highly conserved layer of threonine residues in the pore conveys a basal K<sup>+ </sup>selectivity. An additional layer comprising two serines in human TMEM175 increases selectivity further and renders this channel sensitive to 4-aminopyridine and Zn<sup>2+</sup>. Our findings suggest that large hydrophobic side chains occlude the pore, forming a physical gate, and that channel opening by iris-like motions simultaneously relocates the gate and exposes the otherwise concealed selectivity filter to the pore lumen.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/53357">Top-down machine learning approach for high-throughput single-molecule analysis</a></h4>

Single-molecule approaches provide enormous insight into the dynamics of biomolecules, but adequately sampling distributions of states and events often requires extensive sampling. Although emerging experimental techniques can generate such large datasets, existing analysis tools are not suitable to process the large volume of data obtained in high-throughput paradigms. Here, we present a new analysis platform (DISC) that accelerates unsupervised analysis of single-molecule trajectories. By merging model-free statistical learning with the Viterbi algorithm, DISC idealizes single-molecule trajectories up to three orders of magnitude faster with improved accuracy compared to other commonly used algorithms. Further, we demonstrate the utility of DISC algorithm to probe cooperativity between multiple binding events in the cyclic nucleotide binding domains of HCN pacemaker channel. Given the flexible and efficient nature of DISC, we anticipate it will be a powerful tool for unsupervised processing of high-throughput data across a range of single-molecule experiments.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/51787">Direct ETTIN-auxin interaction controls chromatin states in gynoecium development</a></h4>

Hormonal signalling in animals often involves direct transcription factor-hormone interactions that modulate gene expression<sup>1,2</sup>. In contrast, plant hormone signalling is most commonly based on de-repression via the degradation of transcriptional repressors<sup>3-5</sup>. Recently, we uncovered a non-canonical signalling mechanism for the plant hormone auxin whereby auxin directly affects the activity of the atypical auxin response factor (ARF), ETTIN towards target genes without the requirement for protein degradation<sup>6,7</sup>. Here we show that ETTIN directly binds auxin, leading to dissociation from co-repressor proteins of the TOPLESS/TOPLESS-RELATED family followed by histone acetylation and induction of gene expression. This mechanism is reminiscent of animal hormone signalling as it affects the activity towards regulation of target genes and provides the first example of a DNA-bound hormone receptor in plants. Whilst auxin affects canonical ARFs indirectly by facilitating degradation of Aux/IAA repressors, direct ETTIN-auxin interactions allow switching between repressive and de-repressive chromatin states in an instantly-reversible manner.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/51772">The axonal actin-spectrin lattice acts as a tension buffering shock absorber</a></h4>

Axons span extreme distances and are subjected to significant stretch deformations during limb movements or sudden head movements, especially during impacts. Yet, axon biomechanics, and its relation to the ultrastructure that allows axons to withstand mechanical stress, is poorly understood. Using a custom developed force apparatus, we demonstrate that chick dorsal root ganglion axons exhibit a tension buffering or strain-softening response, where its steady state elastic modulus decreases with increasing strain. We then explore the contributions from the various cytoskeletal components of the axon to show that the recently discovered membrane-associated actin-spectrin scaffold plays a prominent mechanical role. Finally, using a theoretical model, we argue that the actin-spectrin skeleton acts as an axonal tension buffer by reversibly unfolding repeat domains of the spectrin tetramers to release excess mechanical stress. Our results revise the current view point that microtubules and their associated proteins are the only significant load-bearing elements in axons.

Aberrant metabolism is a key factor in many neurological disorders. The ability to measure such metabolic impairment could lead to improved detection of disease progression, and development and monitoring of new therapeutic approaches. Hyperpolarized 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a developing imaging technique that enables non-invasive measurement of enzymatic activity in real time in living organisms. Primarily applied in the fields of cancer and cardiac disease so far, this metabolic imaging method has recently been used to investigate neurological disorders.

In this issue of Neuron, Morrens et al. (2020) show that stimulus-evoked dopamine responses are enhanced by novelty and increase the rate at which animals acquire conditioned responses. These results provide a candidate neural mechanism for latent inhibition and illustrate a new role of dopamine signals in learning.

Neurons in neocortical layer 1 (L1) are thought to regulate attentional processes through integration of long-range inputs and disinhibitory effects on the underlying cortex. A new study combines genetically targeted voltage imaging and optogenetics to elucidate the input-output transformations of the L1 network in the mouse somatosensory cortex, revealing unique features of sensory-evoked dynamics in L1 neurons.

<p>by Hans-Ulrich Klein, Martin Schäfer, David A. Bennett, Holger Schwender, Philip L. De Jager</p>

Biomedical research studies have generated large multi-omic datasets to study complex diseases like Alzheimer’s disease (AD). An important aim of these studies is the identification of candidate genes that demonstrate congruent disease-related alterations across the different data types measured by the study. We developed a new method to detect such candidate genes in large multi-omic case-control studies that measure multiple data types in the same set of samples. The method is based on a gene-centric integrative coefficient quantifying to what degree consistent differences are observed in the different data types. For statistical inference, a Bayesian hierarchical model is used to study the distribution of the integrative coefficient. The model employs a conditional autoregressive prior to integrate a functional gene network and to share information between genes known to be functionally related. We applied the method to an AD dataset consisting of histone acetylation, DNA methylation, and RNA transcription data from human cortical tissue samples of 233 subjects, and we detected 816 genes with consistent differences between persons with AD and controls. The findings were validated in protein data and in RNA transcription data from two independent AD studies. Finally, we found three subnetworks of jointly dysregulated genes within the functional gene network which capture three distinct biological processes: <i>myeloid cell differentiation</i>, <i>protein phosphorylation</i> and <i>synaptic signaling</i>. Further investigation of the myeloid network indicated an upregulation of this network in early stages of AD prior to accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau and suggested that increased <i>CSF1</i> transcription in astrocytes may contribute to microglial activation in AD. Thus, we developed a method that integrates multiple data types and external knowledge of gene function to detect candidate genes, applied the method to an AD dataset, and identified several disease-related genes and processes demonstrating the usefulness of the integrative approach.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v_jJDUF2TbI" width="1" />

<p>by Jamie L. Nosbisch, Anisur Rahman, Krithika Mohan, Timothy C. Elston, James E. Bear, Jason M. Haugh</p>

Chemotaxis of fibroblasts and other mesenchymal cells is critical for embryonic development and wound healing. Fibroblast chemotaxis directed by a gradient of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) requires signaling through the phospholipase C (PLC)/protein kinase C (PKC) pathway. Diacylglycerol (DAG), the lipid product of PLC that activates conventional PKCs, is focally enriched at the up-gradient leading edge of fibroblasts responding to a shallow gradient of PDGF, signifying polarization. To explain the underlying mechanisms, we formulated reaction-diffusion models including as many as three putative feedback loops based on known biochemistry. These include the previously analyzed mechanism of substrate-buffering by myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) and two newly considered feedback loops involving the lipid, phosphatidic acid (PA). DAG kinases and phospholipase D, the enzymes that produce PA, are identified as key regulators in the models. Paradoxically, increasing DAG kinase activity can enhance the robustness of DAG/active PKC polarization with respect to chemoattractant concentration while decreasing their whole-cell levels. Finally, in simulations of wound invasion, efficient collective migration is achieved with thresholds for chemotaxis matching those of polarization in the reaction-diffusion models. This multi-scale modeling framework offers testable predictions to guide further study of signal transduction and cell behavior that affect mesenchymal chemotaxis.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qkKouQvyIrw" width="1" />

<p>Similarities in gene expression patterns prompted our speculations on the common developmental and evolutionary origin of the claustrum and the subplate. Here we systematically compare the currently available data on cytoarchitecture, evolutionary origin, gene expression, cell types, birthdates, neurogenesis, lineage and migration, circuit connectivity and cell death of the neurons that contribute to the claustrum and subplate. Almost all of the markers we examined that were expressed in the subplate/layer 6b were also expressed in the claustral complex, but not all claustrum specific or enriched genes were expressed in subplate/layer 6b, suggesting overall similarities, but also some differences. There are numerous similarities between the adult connectivity patters of layer 6b and claustrum. In particular, both have extensive cortical connections. However, there are differences in the relative strength of their reciprocal connectivity with various other structures in the adult. Based on their similarities and differences we propose a partially common early evolutionary origin of the cells that become claustrum and subplate, a likely scenario that is shared in these cell populations across all amniotes.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The human claustrum, a major hub of widespread neocortical connections, is a thin, bilateral sheet of grey matter located between the insular cortex and the striatum. The subplate is a largely transient cortical structure that contains some of the earliest generated neurons of the cerebral cortex and has important developmental functions to establish intra and extracortical connections. In human and macaque some subplate cells undergo regulated cell death, but some remain as interstitial white matter cells. In mouse and rat brains a compact layer is formed, layer 6b, and it remains underneath the cortex, adjacent to the white matter. Whether layer 6b in rodents is homologous to primate subplate or interstitial white matter cells is still debated. Gene expression patterns, such as those of <i>Nurr1/Nr4a2</i>, have suggested that the rodent subplate and the persistent subplate cells in layer 6b and the claustrum might have similar origins. Moreover, the birthdates of the claustrum and layer 6b are similarly precocious in mice. These observations prompted our speculations on the common developmental and evolutionary origin of the claustrum and the subplate. Here we systematically compare the currently available data on cytoarchitecture, evolutionary origin, gene expression, cell types, birthdates, neurogenesis, lineage and migration, circuit connectivity and cell death of the neurons that contribute to the claustrum and subplate. Based on their similarities and differences we propose a partially common early evolutionary origin of the cells that become claustrum and subplate, a likely scenario that is shared in these cell populations across all amniotes.</p>

<p>Synodontid catfishes use an Elastic Spring Apparatus, including protractor muscles, to produce electric discharges or sounds. Anatomical characterization, together with motoneuron patch clamp recordings and protractor muscle EMGs suggest that adaptive changes in peripheral and central characters underlie transition from an ancestral sound to a derived electric discharge producing system.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>To what extent do modifications in the nervous system and peripheral effectors contribute to novel behaviors? Using a combination of morphometric analysis, neuroanatomical tract tracing and intracellular neuronal recording, we address this question in a sound producing and a weakly electric species of synodontid catfish, <i>Synodontis grandiops</i> and <i>S. nigriventris</i>, respectively. The same peripheral mechanism, a bilateral pair of protractor muscles associated with vertebral processes (elastic spring mechanism), is involved in both signaling systems. Although there were dramatic species differences in several morphometric measures, electromyograms provided strong evidence that simultaneous activation of paired protractor muscles accounts for individual sound and electric discharge pulses. While the general architecture of the neural network and the intrinsic properties of the motoneuron population driving each target were largely similar, differences could contribute to species‐specific patterns in electromyograms and the associated pulse repetition rate of sounds and electric discharges. Together, the results suggest that adaptive changes in both peripheral and central characters underlie the transition from an ancestral sound to a derived electric discharge producing system, and thus the evolution of a novel communication channel among synodontid catfish. Similarities with characters in other sonic and weakly electric teleost fish provide a striking example of convergent evolution in functional adaptations underlying the evolution of the two signaling systems among distantly related taxa.</p>

<p>In 1882, the Italian morphologist Giuseppe Bellonci correctly observed that crustaceans possess mushroom bodies, a finding only recently becoming substantiated: here the title page of his paper and a lithograph in it.



</p>
<br />
<p>In 1882, the Italian embryologist Giuseppe Bellonci introduced a nomenclature for structures in the stomatopod crustacean <i>Squilla mantis</i> that he claimed correspond to insect mushroom bodies, today recognized as cardinal centers that in insects mediate associative memory. The use of Bellonci's terminology has, through a series of misunderstandings and entrenched opinions, led to contesting views regarding whether centers in crustacean and insect brains that occupy corresponding locations and receive comparable multisensory inputs are homologous or homoplasic. The following describes the fate of terms used to denote sensory association neuropils in crustacean species and relates how those terms were deployed in the 1920s and 30s by the Swedish neuroanatomist Bertil Hanström to claim homology in insects and crustaceans. Yet the same terminology has been repurposed by subsequent researchers to promote the very opposite view: that mushroom bodies are a derived trait of hexapods and that equivalent centers in crustaceans evolved independently.</p>

Abstract
<p>Huntington’s disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease notably characterized by progressive motor symptoms. Although the loss of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the striatum has been associated with motor deficits, premanifest patients already present cognitive deficiencies and show early signs of motor disabilities. Here, in a YAC128 HD mouse model, we identified impairment in motor skill consolidation at the age of 11–14 weeks. Using optogenetic stimulation, we found that excitatory synaptic transmission from motor cortex to MSNs located in the dorsolateral part of the striatum (DLS) is altered. Using single pellet reaching task, we observed that while motor skill consolidation is accompanied by a dynamic change in AMPA/NMDA ratio in wild-type (WT) mice, this form of synaptic plasticity does not occur in YAC128 mice. This study not only proposes new meaningful insight in the synaptopathic mechanisms of HD, but also highlights that deficit in motor skill consolidation-dependent synaptic plasticity at motor cortex to DLS synapses represents an early biomarker for HD.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>To map <i>in vivo</i> cortical circuitry at the mesoscale we applied a novel approach to map inter‐areal functional connectivity. Electrical intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) in conjunction with optical imaging of intrinsic signals (OIS) was used map functional connections in somatosensory cortical areas in anesthetized squirrel monkeys. ICMS produced activations that were focal and that displayed responses which were stimulation intensity dependent. ICMS in supragranular layers of Brodmann areas 3b, 1, 2, 3a, and M1 evoked inter‐areal activation patterns that were topographically appropriate and appeared consistent with known anatomical connectivity. Specifically, ICMS revealed area 3b connections with area 1; area 1 connections with areas 2 and 3a; area 2 connections with areas 1, 3a, and M1; area 3a connections with areas M1, 1, and 2; and M1 connections with areas 3a, 1, and 2. These somatosensory connectivity patterns were reminiscent of feedforward patterns observed anatomically, although feedback contributions are also likely present. Further consistent with anatomical connectivity, intra‐areal and intra‐areal patterns of activation were patchy with patch sizes of 200–300 μm. In summary, ICMS with OIS is a novel approach for mapping inter‐areal and intra‐areal connections <i>in vivo</i>. Comparisons with feedforward and feedback anatomical connectivity is discussed.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Following the identification of the nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) peptide (NOP) as an endogenous ligand for the NOP receptor, ample evidence has revealed unique functional profiles of the N/OFQ‐NOP receptor system. NOP receptors are expressed in key neural substrates involved in pain and reward modulation. In nonhuman primates (NHPs), NOP receptor activation effectively exerts antinociception and anti‐hypersensitivity at the spinal and supraspinal levels. Moreover, NOP receptor activation inhibits dopaminergic transmission and synergistically enhances mu‐opioid peptide (MOP) receptor‐mediated analgesia. In this article, we have discussed the functional profiles of ligands with dual NOP and MOP receptor agonist activities and highlight their optimal functional efficacy for pain relief and drug abuse treatment. Through coactivation of NOP and MOP receptors, bifunctional NOP/MOP receptor “partial” agonists (e.g., AT‐121, BU08028, and BU10038) reveal a wider therapeutic window with fewer side effects. These newly developed ligands potently induce antinociception without MOP receptor agonist‐associated side effects such as abuse potential, respiratory depression, itching sensation, and physical dependence. In addition, in both rodent and NHP models, bifunctional NOP/MOP receptor agonists can attenuate reward processing and/or the reinforcing effects of opioids and other abused drugs. While a mixed NOP/opioid receptor “full” agonist cebranopadol is undergoing clinical trials, bifunctional NOP/MOP “partial” agonists exhibit promising therapeutic profiles in translational NHP models for the treatment of pain and opioid abuse. This class of drugs demonstrates the therapeutic advantage of NOP and MOP receptor coactivation, indicating a greater potential for future development.</p>

<p>Many brain imaging modalities reveal interpretable patterns after the data dimensionality is reduced and summarized via data-driven approaches. In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, such summarization is often achieved through independent component analysis (ICA). ICA transforms the original data into a relatively small number of interpretable bases in voxel space (referred to as ICA spatial components, or spatial maps) and corresponding bases in the time domain (referred to as time-courses of corresponding spatial maps) In this work, we use the word “basis” to broadly refer to either of the two factors resulting from the transformation. A precise summarization for fMRI requires accurately detecting co-activation of voxels by measuring temporal dependence. Accurate measurement of dependence requires a proper understanding of the underlying temporal characteristics of the data. One way to understand such characteristics is to study the frequency spectrum of fMRI data. Researchers have argued that information regarding the underlying neuronal activity might be spread over a range of frequencies as a result of the heterogeneous temporal nature of the neuronal activity, which is reflected in its frequency spectrum. Many studies have accounted for heterogeneous characteristics of the frequency of the signal by either directly inspecting the contents of frequency domain-transformed data or augmenting their analyses with such information. For example, studies on fMRI data have investigated brain functional connectivity by leveraging frequency-adjusted measures of dependence (e.g., when a correlation is measured as a function of frequency, as with “coherence”). Although these studies measure dependence as a function of frequency, the formulation does not capture all characteristics of the frequency-based dependence. Incorporating frequency information into a summarization approach would enable the retention of important frequency-related information that exists in the original space but might be lost after performing a frequency-independent summarization. We propose a novel data-driven approach built upon ICA, which is based on measuring dependence as a generalized function of frequency. Applying this approach to fMRI data provides evidence of existing cross-frequency functional connectivity between different areas of the brain.</p>

<p>Chronic tinnitus is a prevalent condition that could cause severe negative impact on an individual’s life. However, there has not been an established treatment due to a limited understanding of the pathophysiology of this multifarious disorder. In this study, we tested the efficacy of an integrative treatment, combining music therapy with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). We collected three groups of patients receiving three different treatments: Music-CBT, music therapy and CBT. We used both subjective (i.e., questionnaires) and objective (i.e., resting-state EEG data) measurements to assess the behavioral and neural changes brought upon by the treatments. Analyses of the subjective measurements found a significant improvement of scale scores in Music-CBT and CBT, but not in the Music group. Analysis of the EEG data further showed increased powers in alpha and theta band after the Music-CBT treatment, and increased gamma power after CBT, whereas no significant difference was found for the music therapy. Further source localization analysis of alpha and theta changes in the Music-CBT group found that primary sources of the changes were located at auditory processing regions such as superior temporal gyrus, and higher emotional and cognitive processing regions such as ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC), lateral prefrontal cortex and parahippocampus. These results indicated that Music-CBT was effective in improving tinnitus symptoms on both a behavioral and neural level, which is more robust than the music therapy or CBT alone.</p>

<p>Preclinical mental health research relies upon animal models, and whilst many encouraging advances are being made, reproducibility and translational relevance may be limited by sub-optimal testing or model choices. Animal behaviors are complex and test batteries should be designed to include their multifaceted nature. However, multiple behavioral testing is often avoided due to cost, availability or statistical rigor. Additionally, despite the disparity in the incidence of mental health problems between the sexes, a move toward reducing animal numbers could be a deterrent to including both male and female animals. The current study introduces a unified scoring system for specific behavioral traits with the aim of maximizing the use of all data generated whilst reducing the incidence of statistical errors. Female and male mice from two common background strains were tested on behavior batteries designed to probe multiple aspects of anxiety-related and social behavioral traits. Results for every outcome measure were normalized to generate scores for each test and combined to give each mouse a single unified score for each behavioral trait. The unified behavioral scores revealed clear differences in the anxiety and stress-related, and sociability traits of mice. Principle component analysis of data demonstrated significant clustering of animals into their experimental groups. In contrast, individual tests returned an ambiguous mixture of non-significant trends and significant effects for various outcome measures. Utilizing a range of behavioral measures and combining all outcome measure data to produce unified scores provides a useful tool for detecting subtle behavioral traits in preclinical models.</p>

<p>Neural transplantation in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) offers to replace cells lost during the progression of the disease process. Primary fetal ventral mesencephalon (VM), the origin of bona fide midbrain dopaminergic (DAergic) precursors, is currently the gold standard source of cells for transplantation in PD. However, the use of tissue from this source raises ethical and logistical constraints necessitating the need for alternative supplies of donor cells. The requirement of any alternative donor cell source is to have the capability to generate authentic mature DAergic neurons, which could be utilized in cell-replacement strategies. Mouse pluripotent stem cells can efficiently generate electrochemically mature midbrain DAergic precursors in vitro using a stepwise control of FGF signaling. Here, we have compared DAergic transplants derived from two progenitor cell sources in an allograft system: mouse epiblast stem cells (EpiSC) and primary fetal mouse VM tissue. Cells were transplanted into the striatum of 6-OHDA lesioned mice pre-treated with L-DOPA. Drug-induced rotations, a number of motor tests and drug-induced abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) were assessed. Functional improvements were demonstrated post-transplantation in some behavioral tests, with no difference in graft volume or the number of TH immuno-positive cells in the grafts of the two transplant groups. L-DOPA-induced AIMs and amphetamine-induced AIMs were observed in both transplant groups, with no differences in rate or severity between the two groups. Collectively, in this mouse-to-mouse allograft system, we report no significant differences in the functional ability between the gold standard primary VM derived and pluripotent stem cell-derived DAergic transplants.</p>

<p>Proteins of the 14-3-3 family are well known modulators of the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) regulating kinase activity, cellular localization, and ubiquitylation. Although binding between those proteins has been investigated, a comparative study of all human 14-3-3 isoforms interacting with LRRK2 is lacking so far. In a comprehensive approach, we quantitatively analyzed the interaction between the seven human 14-3-3 isoforms and LRRK2-derived peptides covering both, reported and putative 14-3-3 binding sites. We observed that phosphorylation is an absolute prerequisite for 14-3-3 binding and generated binding patterns of 14-3-3 isoforms to interact with peptides derived from the N-terminal phosphorylation cluster (S910 and S935), the Roc domain (S1444) and the C-terminus. The tested 14-3-3 binding sites in LRRK2 preferentially were recognized by the isoforms γ and η, whereas the isoforms ϵ and especially σ showed the weakest or no binding. Interestingly, the possible pathogenic mutation Q930R in LRRK2 drastically increases binding affinity to a peptide encompassing pS935. We then identified the autophosphorylation site T2524 as a so far not described 14-3-3 binding site at the very C-terminus of LRRK2. Binding affinities of all seven 14-3-3 isoforms were quantified for all three binding regions with pS1444 displaying the highest affinity of all measured singly phosphorylated peptides. The strongest binding was detected for the combined phosphosites S910 and S935, suggesting that avidity effects are important for high affinity interaction between 14-3-3 proteins and LRRK2.</p>

<p>This article reviews the basic principles of frequency-domain near-infrared spectroscopy (FD-NIRS), which relies on intensity-modulated light sources and phase-sensitive optical detection, and its non-invasive applications to the brain. The simpler instrumentation and more straightforward data analysis of continuous-wave NIRS (CW-NIRS) accounts for the fact that almost all the current commercial instruments for cerebral NIRS have embraced the CW technique. However, FD-NIRS provides data with richer information content, which complements or exceeds the capabilities of CW-NIRS. One example is the ability of FD-NIRS to measure the absolute optical properties (absorption and reduced scattering coefficients) of tissue, and thus the absolute concentrations of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin in brain tissue. This article reviews the measured values of such optical properties and hemoglobin concentrations reported in the literature for animal models and for the human brain in newborns, infants, children, and adults. We also review the application of FD-NIRS to functional brain studies that focused on slower hemodynamic responses to brain activity (time scale of seconds) and faster optical signals that have been linked to neuronal activation (time scale of 100 ms). Another example of the power of FD-NIRS data is related to the different regions of sensitivity featured by intensity and phase data. We report recent developments that take advantage of this feature to maximize the sensitivity of non-invasive optical signals to brain tissue relative to more superficial extracerebral tissue (scalp, skull, etc.). We contend that this latter capability is a highly appealing quality of FD-NIRS, which complements absolute optical measurements and may result in significant advances in the field of non-invasive optical sensing of the brain.</p>

<p>Speech production is a hierarchical mechanism involving the synchronization of the brain and the oral articulators, where the intention of linguistic concepts is transformed into meaningful sounds. Individuals with locked-in syndrome (fully paralyzed but aware) lose their motor ability completely including articulation and even eyeball movement. The neural pathway may be the only option to resume a certain level of communication for these patients. Current brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) use patients' visual and attentional correlates to build communication, resulting in a slow communication rate (a few words per minute). Direct decoding of imagined speech from the neural signals (and then driving a speech synthesizer) has the potential for a higher communication rate. In this study, we investigated the decoding of five imagined and spoken phrases from single-trial, non-invasive magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals collected from eight adult subjects. Two machine learning algorithms were used. One was an artificial neural network (ANN) with statistical features as the baseline approach. The other was convolutional neural networks (CNNs) applied on the spatial, spectral and temporal features extracted from the MEG signals. Experimental results indicated the possibility to decode imagined and spoken phrases directly from neuromagnetic signals. CNNs were found to be highly effective with an average decoding accuracy of up to 93% for the imagined and 96% for the spoken phrases.</p>

<p>The assessment and prediction of cognitive performance is a key issue for any discipline concerned with human operators in the context of safety-critical behavior. Most of the research has focused on the measurement of mental workload but this construct remains difficult to operationalize despite decades of research on the topic. Recent advances in Neuroergonomics have expanded our understanding of neurocognitive processes across different operational domains. We provide a framework to disentangle those neural mechanisms that underpin the relationship between task demand, arousal, mental workload and human performance. This approach advocates targeting those specific mental states that precede a reduction of performance efficacy. A number of undesirable neurocognitive states (mind wandering, effort withdrawal, perseveration, inattentional phenomena) are identified and mapped within a two-dimensional conceptual space encompassing task engagement and arousal. We argue that monitoring the prefrontal cortex and its deactivation can index a generic shift from a nominal operational state to an impaired one where performance is likely to degrade. Neurophysiological, physiological and behavioral markers that specifically account for these states are identified. We then propose a typology of neuroadaptive countermeasures to mitigate these undesirable mental states.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that is the most common cause of dementia. Symptoms of AD include memory loss, disorientation, mood and behavior changes, confusion, unfounded suspicions, and eventually, difficulty speaking, swallowing, and walking. These symptoms are caused by neuronal degeneration and cell loss that begins in the hippocampus, and later in disease progression spreading to the rest of the brain. While there are some medications that alleviate initial symptoms, there are currently no treatments that stop disease progression. Hippocampal deficits in amyloid-β-related rodent models of AD have revealed synaptic, behavioral and circuit-level defects. These changes in synaptic function, plasticity, neuronal excitability, brain connectivity, and excitation/inhibition imbalance all have profound effects on circuit function, which in turn could exacerbate disease progression. Despite, the wealth of studies on AD pathology we don’t yet have a complete understanding of hippocampal deficits in AD. With the increasing development of in vivo recording techniques in awake and freely moving animals, future studies will extend our current knowledge of the mechanisms underpinning how hippocampal function is altered in AD, and aid in progression of treatment strategies that prevent and/or delay AD symptoms.</p>

<p>Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are often behaviorally hyper-reactive to light touch, but it is unclear to what degree this arises from a fundamental sensory difference vs. higher order systems for attention or emotion processing. Thus far, experimental findings for light touch detection are mixed, and few previous studies have independently considered sensitivity (the ability to discriminate signal from noise) and decision criterion (the overall response bias or tendency to answer “yes” or “no” in a detection task). We tested a large sample of children, adolescents, and adults with ASD (n = 88) and with neurotypical (NT) development (n = 59) using von Frey filaments to derive light touch thresholds at the palm. We calculated signal detection metrics for sensitivity (A<sub>z</sub>) and response criterion (c) from hit and false alarm rates. Both metrics exhibited significant group differences, such that the ASD group was less sensitive, but had a much more conservative response criterion. We used a best subset model selection procedure in three separate ordinal regressions for the whole group, adults, and children/adolescents. In all selected models, c was by far the most significant predictor of threshold, supplanting effects of diagnostic group that were significant in the baseline models. In contrast, Az was not a significant predictor of threshold in any of the models. Mean values of c were similar for adults with and without autism and for children/adolescents with ASD, but lower (more liberal) in neurotypical children/adolescents. This suggests that children with ASD exhibit a conservatism in their perceptual decision-making that differs from their NT peers but resembles that of adults. Across the sample, the value of c was significantly and positively correlated with age and with autism symptoms (SRS-2 total score), in addition to thresholds. The results of this study suggest that, rather than a sensory difference in detection of light touch, there is a difference in response bias such that children with ASD are more conservative/likely to report “no” if unsure, than their young NT peers. Future work should consider the implications of conservative response criterion in ASD for commonly used forced-choice psychophysical paradigms.</p>

<p>Major neurocognitive changes occur during adolescence, making this phase one of the most critical developmental periods of life. Furthermore, this phase in life is also the time in which youth substance use begins. Several studies have demonstrated the differential associations of alcohol and cannabis use concerning the neurocognitive functioning of both males and females. Past and contemporary literature on gender-specific effects in neuroscience of addiction is predominantly based on cross-sectional datasets and data that is limited in terms of measurement variability. Given the importance of gender-specific effects in addiction studies, and in order to address the two above-mentioned gaps in the literature, the present study aimed to compare neurocognitive functioning of male and female adolescents in the context of cannabis and alcohol use, while employing a longitudinal design with multiple repeated measurements. Participants were 3,826 high school students (47% female; mean age, 12.7), who were recruited from 31 high schools in the greater Montreal area. Participants were requested to complete annual surveys for five consecutive years, from 7th to 11th grade, assessing their alcohol/cannabis use and neurocognitive functioning (working memory, delayed recall memory, perceptual reasoning, and inhibition control). The analytical strategy focused on the longitudinal association between each predictor (female, male) and each of the outcomes (domains of neurocognitive functioning). Multilevel linear models assessed the association of alcohol and cannabis consumption and the four domains of neurocognitive functioning. Results revealed a gender by within-subject interaction, suggesting a weaker effect of yearly fluctuation of cannabis use on working memory among males compared to females. Our findings suggest a different pattern of neurocognitive impairment of female and male working memory after using cannabis over the course of adolescence. Early initiation of cannabis use potentially results in more spatial working memory deficits in female adolescents. This may negatively influence young females’ capacity in academic settings and lead to significant impairment in adulthood, which critically decreases the individual’s quality of life.</p>

<p>Recent success stories in automated object or face recognition, partly fuelled by deep learning artificial neural network (ANN) architectures, have led to the advancement of biometric research platforms and, to some extent, the resurrection of Artificial Intelligence (AI). In line with this general trend, inter-disciplinary approaches have been taken to automate the recognition of emotions in adults or children for the benefit of various applications, such as identification of children's emotions prior to a clinical investigation. Within this context, it turns out that automating emotion recognition is far from being straightforward, with several challenges arising for both science (e.g., methodology underpinned by psychology) and technology (e.g., the iMotions biometric research platform). In this paper, we present a methodology and experiment and some interesting findings, which raise the following research questions for the recognition of emotions and attention in humans: (a) the adequacy of well-established techniques such as the International Affective Picture System (IAPS), (b) the adequacy of state-of-the-art biometric research platforms, (c) the extent to which emotional responses may be different in children and adults. Our findings and first attempts to answer some of these research questions are based on a mixed sample of adults and children who took part in the experiment, resulting in a statistical analysis of numerous variables. These are related to both automatically and interactively captured responses of participants to a sample of IAPS pictures.</p>

<p>Most stroke studies dealing with functional deficits and assessing stem cell therapy produce extensive hemispheric damage and can be seen as a model for severe clinical strokes. However, mild strokes have a better prospect for functional recovery. Recently, anatomic and behavioral changes have been reported for distal occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), generating a well-circumscribed and small cortical lesion, which can thus be proposed as mild to moderate cortical stroke. Using this cortical stroke model of moderate severity in the nude mouse, we have studied the functional networks with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for 12 weeks following stroke induction. Further, human neural stem cells (hNSCs) were implanted adjacent to the ischemic lesion, and the stable graft vitality was monitored with bioluminescence imaging (BLI). Differentiation of the grafted neural stem cells was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and by patch-clamp electrophysiology. Following stroke induction, we found a pronounced and continuously rising hypersynchronicity of the sensorimotor networks including both hemispheres, in contrast to the severe stroke filament model where profound reduction of the functional connectivity had been reported by us earlier. The vitality of grafted neural stem cells remained stable throughout the whole 12 weeks observation period. In the stem cell treated animals, functional connectivity did not show hypersynchronicity but was globally slightly reduced below baseline at 2 weeks post-stroke, normalizing thereafter completely. Our resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) studies on cortical stroke reveal for the first time a hypersynchronicity of the functional brain networks. This hypersynchronicity appears as a hallmark of mild cortical strokes, in contrast to severe strokes with striatal involvement where exclusively hyposynchronicity has been reported. The effect of the stem cell graft was an early and persistent normalization of the functional sensorimotor networks across the whole brain. These novel functional results may help interpret future outcome investigations after stroke and demonstrate the highly promising potential of stem cell treatment for functional outcome improvement after stroke.</p>

<p>Myelination is an essential process that consists of the ensheathment of axons by myelin. In the central nervous system (CNS), myelin is synthesized by oligodendrocytes. The proliferation, migration, and differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells constitute a prerequisite before mature oligodendrocytes extend their processes around the axons and progressively generate a multilamellar lipidic sheath. Although myelination is predominately driven by oligodendrocytes, the other glial cells including astrocytes and microglia, also contribute to this process. The present review is an update of the most recent emerging mechanisms involving astrocyte and microglia in myelin production. The contribution of these cells will be first described during developmental myelination that occurs in the early postnatal period and is critical for the proper development of cognition and behavior. Then, we will report the novel findings regarding the beneficial or deleterious effects of astroglia and microglia, which respectively promote or impair the endogenous capacity of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) to induce spontaneous remyelination after myelin loss. Acute delineation of astrocyte and microglia activities and cross-talk should uncover the way towards novel therapeutic perspectives aimed at recovering proper myelination during development or at breaking down the barriers impeding the regeneration of the damaged myelin that occurs in CNS demyelinating diseases.</p>

<p>Depression is a common affective disorder characterized by significant and persistent low mood. Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, is reported to have a rapid and durable antidepressant effect, but the mechanisms are unclear. Protein phosphorylation is a post-translational modification that plays a crucial role in cell signaling. Thus, we present a phosphoproteomics approach to investigate the mechanisms underlying stress-induced depression and the rapid antidepressant effect of ketamine in mice. We analyzed the phosphoprotein changes induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) and ketamine treatment in two known mood control centers, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the nucleus accumbens (NAc). We initially obtained &gt;8,000 phosphorylation sites. Quantitation revealed 3,988 sites from the mPFC and 3,196 sites from the NAc. Further analysis revealed that changes in synaptic transmission-related signaling are a common feature. Notably, CUMS-induced changes were reversed by ketamine treatment, as shown by the analysis of commonly altered sites. Ketamine also induced specific changes, such as alterations in synapse organization, synaptic transmission, and enzyme binding. Collectively, our findings establish a signaling framework for stress-induced depression and the rapid antidepressant effect of ketamine.</p>

<p>Despite the extensive use of hormonal methods as either contraception or menopausal hormone therapy (HT), there is very little known about the potential effects of these compounds on the cellular processes of the brain. Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (MPA) is a progestogen used globally in the hormonal contraceptive, Depo Provera, by women in their reproductive prime and is a major compound found in HT formulations used by menopausal women. MPA promotes changes in the circulating levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), such as MMP-9, in the endometrium, yet limited literature studying the effects of MPA on neurons and astroglia cells has been conducted. Additionally, the dysregulation of MMPs has been implicated in the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), where inhibiting the secretion of MMP-9 from astroglia reduces the proteolytic degradation of amyloid-beta. Thus, we hypothesize that exposure to MPA disrupts proteolytic degradation of amyloid-beta through the downregulation of MMP-9 expression and subsequent secretion. To assess the effect of progestins on MMP-9 and amyloid-beta, in vitro, C6 rat glial cells were exposed to MPA for 48 h and then the enzymatic, secretory, and amyloid-beta degrading capacity of MMP-9 was assessed from the conditioned culture medium. We found that MPA treatment inhibited transcription of MMP-9, which resulted in a subsequent decrease in the production and secretion of MMP-9 protein, in part through the glucocorticoid receptor. Additionally, we investigated the consequences of amyloid beta-degrading activity and found that MPA treatment decreased proteolytic degradation of amyloid-beta. Our results suggest MPA suppresses amyloid-beta degradation in an MMP-9-dependent manner, in vitro, and potentially compromises the clearance of amyloid-beta in vivo.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/56418">Post-translational regulation of retinal IMPDH1 in vivo to adjust GTP synthesis to illumination conditions</a></h4>

We report the in vivo regulation of Inosine-5´-monophosphate dehydrogenase 1 (IMPDH1) in the retina. IMPDH1 catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides, impacting the cellular pools of GMP, GDP and GTP. Guanine nucleotide homeostasis is central to photoreceptor cells, where cGMP is the signal transducing molecule in the light response. Mutations in IMPDH1 lead to inherited blindness. We unveil a light-dependent phosphorylation of retinal IMPDH1 at Thr<sup>159</sup>/Ser<sup>160</sup> in the Bateman domain that desensitizes the enzyme to allosteric inhibition by GDP/GTP. When exposed to bright light, living mice increase the rate of GTP and ATP synthesis in their retinas; concomitant with IMPDH1 aggregate formation at the outer segment layer. Inhibiting IMPDH activity in living mice delays rod mass recovery. We unveil a novel mechanism of regulation of IMPDH1 in vivo, important for understanding GTP homeostasis in the retina and the pathogenesis of adRP10 IMPDH1 mutations.

Synaptic positions underlie precise circuit connectivity. Synaptic positions can be established during embryogenesis and sustained during growth. The mechanisms that sustain synaptic specificity during allometric growth are largely unknown. We performed forward genetic screens in <i>C. elegans</i> for regulators of this process and identified <i>mig-17</i>, a conserved ADAMTS metalloprotease. Proteomic mass spectrometry, cell biological and genetic studies demonstrate that MIG-17 is secreted from cells like muscles to regulate basement membrane proteins. In the nematode brain, the basement membrane does not directly contact synapses. Instead, muscle-derived basement membrane coats one side of the glia, while glia contact synapses on their other side. MIG-17 modifies the muscle-derived basement membrane to modulate epidermal-glial crosstalk and sustain glia location and morphology during growth. Glia position in turn sustains the synaptic pattern established during embryogenesis. Our findings uncover a muscle-epidermis-glia signaling axis that sustains synaptic specificity during the organism’s allometric growth.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55435">Cell and molecular transitions during efficient dedifferentiation</a></h4>

Dedifferentiation is a critical response to tissue damage, yet is not well understood, even at a basic phenomenological level. Developing <i>Dictyostelium </i>cells undergo highly efficient dedifferentiation, completed by most cells within 24 hours. We use this rapid response to investigate the control features of dedifferentiation, combining single cell imaging with high temporal resolution transcriptomics. Gene expression during dedifferentiation was predominantly a simple reversal of developmental changes, with expression changes not following this pattern primarily associated with ribosome biogenesis. Mutation of genes induced early in dedifferentiation did not strongly perturb the reversal of development. This apparent robustness may arise from adaptability of cells: the relative temporal ordering of cell and molecular events was not absolute, suggesting cell programmes reach the same end using different mechanisms. In addition, although cells start from different fates, they rapidly converged on a single expression trajectory. These regulatory features may contribute to dedifferentiation responses during regeneration.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55207">A highly accurate platform for clone-specific mutation discovery enables the study of active mutational processes</a></h4>

Bulk whole genome sequencing (WGS) enables the analysis of tumor evolution but, because of depth limitations, can only identify old mutational events. The discovery of current mutational processes for predicting the tumor's evolutionary trajectory requires dense sequencing of individual clones or single cells. Such studies, however, are inherently problematic because of the discovery of excessive false positive mutations when sequencing picogram quantities of DNA. Data pooling to increase the confidence in the discovered mutations, moves the discovery back in the past to a common ancestor. Here we report a robust whole genome sequencing and analysis pipeline (DigiPico/MutLX) that virtually eliminates all false positive results while retaining an excellent proportion of true positives. Using our method, we identified, for the first time, a hyper-mutation (kataegis) event in a group of ∼30 cancer cells from a recurrent ovarian carcinoma. This was unidentifiable from the bulk WGS data. Overall, we propose DigiPico/MutLX method as a powerful framework for the identification of clone-specific variants at an unprecedented accuracy.

Condensin complexes are essential for mitotic chromosome assembly and segregation during cell divisions, however, little is known about their functions in post-mitotic cells. Here we report a role for the condensin I subunit Cap-G in Drosophila neurons. We show that, despite not requiring condensin for mitotic chromosome compaction, post-mitotic neurons express Cap-G. Knockdown of Cap-G specifically in neurons (from their birth onwards) results in developmental arrest, behavioural defects, and dramatic gene expression changes, including reduced expression of a subset of neuronal genes and aberrant expression of genes that are not normally expressed in the developing brain. Knockdown of Cap-G in mature neurons results in similar phenotypes but to a lesser degree. Furthermore, we see dynamic binding of Cap-G at distinct loci in progenitor cells and differentiated neurons. Therefore, Cap-G is essential for proper gene expression in neurons and plays an important role during the early stages of neuronal development.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/54877">Endogenous itaconate is not required for particulate matter-induced NRF2 expression or inflammatory response</a></h4>

Particulate matter (PM) air pollution causes cardiopulmonary mortality via macrophage-driven lung inflammation; however, the mechanisms are incompletely understood. RNA-sequencing demonstrated <i>Acod1 </i>(<i>Aconitate decarboxylase 1</i>) as one of the top genes induced by PM in macrophages. <i>Acod1</i> encodes a mitochondrial enzyme that produces itaconate, which was shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects via NRF2 after LPS. Here, we demonstrate that PM induces Acod1 and itaconate, which reduced mitochondrial respiration via complex II inhibition. Using <i>Acod1</i><sup>-/- </sup>mice, we found that Acod1/endogenous itaconate does not affect PM-induced inflammation or NRF2 activation in macrophages <i>in vitro</i> or <i>in vivo</i>. In contrast, exogenous cell permeable itaconate, 4-octyl itaconate (OI) attenuated PM-induced inflammation in macrophages. OI was sufficient to activate NRF2 in macrophages; however, NRF2 was not required for the anti-inflammatory effects of OI. We conclude that the effects of itaconate production on inflammation are stimulus-dependent, and that there are important differences between endogenous and exogenously-applied itaconate.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/54100">Evolution of multifunctionality through a pleiotropic substitution in the innate immune protein S100A9</a></h4>

Multifunctional proteins are evolutionary puzzles: how do proteins evolve to satisfy multiple functional constraints? S100A9 is one such multifunctional protein. It potently amplifies inflammation via Toll-like receptor 4 and is antimicrobial as part of a heterocomplex with S100A8. These two functions are seemingly regulated by proteolysis: S100A9 is readily degraded, while S100A8/S100A9 is resistant. We take an evolutionary biochemical approach to show that S100A9 evolved both functions and lost proteolytic resistance from a weakly proinflammatory, proteolytically resistant amniote ancestor. We identify a historical substitution that has pleiotropic effects on S100A9 proinflammatory activity and proteolytic resistance but has little effect on S100A8/S100A9 antimicrobial activity. We thus propose that mammals evolved S100A8/S100A9 antimicrobial and S100A9 proinflammatory activities concomitantly with a proteolytic 'timer' to selectively regulate S100A9. This highlights how the same mutation can have pleiotropic effects on one functional state of a protein but not another, thus facilitating the evolution of multifunctionality.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/53898">The skin microbiome facilitates adaptive tetrodotoxin production in poisonous newts</a></h4>

Rough-skinned newts (<i>Taricha granulosa</i>) use tetrodotoxin (TTX) to block voltage-gated sodium (Na<sub>v</sub>) channels as a chemical defense against predation. Interestingly, newts exhibit extreme population-level variation in toxicity attributed to a coevolutionary arms race with TTX-resistant predatory snakes, but the source of TTX in newts is unknown. Here, we investigated whether symbiotic bacteria isolated from toxic newts could produce TTX. We characterized the skin-associated microbiota from a toxic and non-toxic population of newts and established pure cultures of isolated bacterial symbionts from toxic newts. We then screened bacterial culture media for TTX using LC-MS/MS and identified TTX-producing bacterial strains from four genera, including <i>Aeromonas</i>, <i>Pseudomonas</i>, <i>Shewanella</i>, and <i>Sphingopyxis</i>. Additionally, we sequenced the Na<sub>v</sub> channel gene family in toxic newts and found that newts expressed Na<sub>v</sub> channels with modified TTX binding sites, conferring extreme physiological resistance to TTX. This study highlights the complex interactions among adaptive physiology, animal-bacterial symbiosis, and ecological context.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/53582">Lipid polarity gradient formed by ω-hydroxy lipids in tear film prevents dry eye disease</a></h4>

Meibum lipids form a lipid layer on the outermost side of the tear film and function to prevent water evaporation and reduce surface tension. (<i>O</i>-Acyl)-ω-hydroxy fatty acids (OAHFAs), a subclass of these lipids, are thought to be involved in connecting the lipid and aqueous layers in tears, although their actual function and synthesis pathway have to date remained unclear. Here, we reveal that the fatty acid ω-hydroxylase <i>Cyp4f39</i> is involved in OAHFA production. <i>Cyp4f39</i>-deficient mice exhibited damaged corneal epithelium and shortening of tear film break-up time, both indicative of dry eye disease. In addition, tears accumulated on the lower eyelid side, indicating increased tear surface tension. In <i>Cyp4f39</i>-deficient mice, the production of wax diesters (type 1ω and 2ω) and cholesteryl OAHFAs was also impaired. These OAHFA derivatives show intermediate polarity among meibum lipids, suggesting that OAHFAs and their derivatives contribute to lipid polarity gradient formation for tear film stabilization.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/53552">Separable gain control of ongoing and evoked activity in the visual cortex by serotonergic input</a></h4>

Controlling gain of cortical activity is essential to modulate weights between internal ongoing communication and external sensory drive. Here, we show that serotonergic input has separable suppressive effects on the gain of ongoing and evoked visual activity. We combined optogenetic stimulation of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) with wide-field calcium imaging, extracellular recordings, and iontophoresis of serotonin (5-HT) receptor antagonists in the mouse visual cortex. 5-HT1A receptors promote divisive suppression of spontaneous activity, while 5-HT2A receptors act divisively on visual response gain and largely account for normalization of population responses over a range of visual contrasts in awake and anesthetized states. Thus, 5-HT input provides balanced but distinct suppressive effects on ongoing and evoked activity components across neuronal populations. Imbalanced 5-HT1A/2A activation, either through receptor-specific drug intake, genetically predisposed irregular 5-HT receptor density, or change in sensory bombardment may enhance internal broadcasts and reduce sensory drive and vice versa.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/53518">Conservation and divergence of related neuronal lineages in the <i>Drosophila</i> central brain</a></h4>

Wiring a complex brain requires many neurons with intricate cell specificity, generated by a limited number of neural stem cells. <i>Drosophila</i> central brain lineages are a predetermined series of neurons, born in a specific order. To understand how lineage identity translates to neuron morphology, we mapped 18 <i>Drosophila</i> central brain lineages. While we found large aggregate differences between lineages, we also discovered shared patterns of morphological diversification. Lineage identity plus Notch-mediated sister fate govern primary neuron trajectories, whereas temporal fate diversifies terminal elaborations. Further, morphological neuron types may arise repeatedly, interspersed with other types. Despite the complexity, related lineages produce similar neuron types in comparable temporal patterns. Different stem cells even yield two identical series of dopaminergic neuron types, but with unrelated sister neurons. Together, these phenomena suggest that straightforward rules drive incredible neuronal complexity, and that large changes in morphology can result from relatively simple fating mechanisms.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/53449">Germline burden of rare damaging variants negatively affects human                    healthspan and lifespan</a></h4>

Heritability of human lifespan is 23-33% as evident from twin studies.                    Genome-wide association studies explored this question by linking particular                    alleles to lifespan traits. However, genetic variants identified so far can                    explain only a small fraction of lifespan heritability in humans. Here, we                    report that the burden of rarest protein-truncating variants (PTVs) in two large                    cohorts is negatively associated with human healthspan and lifespan, accounting                    for 0.4 and 1.3 years of their variability, respectively. In addition,                    longer-living individuals possess both fewer rarest PTVs and less damaging PTVs.                    We further find that somatic accumulation of PTVs accounts for only a small                    fraction of mortality and morbidity acceleration and hence is unlikely to be                    causal in aging. We conclude that rare damaging mutations, both inherited and                    accumulated throughout life, contribute to the aging process, and that burden of                    ultra-rare variants in combination with common alleles better explain apparent                    heritability of human lifespan.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/53191">Preparation for upcoming attentional states in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

Goal-directed attention is usually studied by providing individuals with explicit instructions on what they should attend to. But in daily life, we often use past experiences to guide our attentional states. Given the importance of memory for predicting upcoming events, we hypothesized that memory-guided attention is supported by neural preparation for anticipated attentional states. We examined preparatory coding in the human hippocampus and mPFC, two regions that are important for memory-guided behaviors, in two tasks: one where attention was guided by memory and another in which attention was explicitly instructed. Hippocampus and mPFC exhibited higher activity for memory-guided vs. explicitly instructed attention. Furthermore, representations in both regions contained information about upcoming attentional states. In the hippocampus, this preparation was stronger for memory-guided attention, and occurred alongside stronger coupling with visual cortex during attentional guidance. These results highlight the mechanisms by which memories are used to prepare for upcoming attentional goals.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/52187">Structural color in <i>Junonia</i> butterflies evolves by tuning scale lamina thickness</a></h4>

In diverse organisms, nanostructures that coherently scatter light create structural color, but how such structures are built remains mysterious. We investigate the evolution and genetic regulation of butterfly scale laminae, which are simple photonic nanostructures. In a lineage of buckeye butterflies artificially selected for blue wing color, we found that thickened laminae caused a color shift from brown to blue. Deletion of the <i>optix</i> patterning gene also altered color via lamina thickening, revealing shared regulation of pigments and lamina thickness. Finally, we show how lamina thickness variation contributes to the color diversity that distinguishes sexes and species throughout the genus <i>Junonia</i>. Thus, quantitatively tuning one dimension of scale architecture facilitates both the microevolution and macroevolution of a broad spectrum of hues. Because the lamina is an intrinsic component of typical butterfly scales, our findings suggest that tuning lamina thickness is an available mechanism to create structural color across the Lepidoptera.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/51712">Independent evolution of ancestral and novel defenses in a genus of toxic plants (<i>Erysimum</i>, Brassicaceae)</a></h4>

Phytochemical diversity is thought to result from coevolutionary cycles as specialization in herbivores imposes diversifying selection on plant chemical defenses. Plants in the speciose genus <i>Erysimum</i> (Brassicaceae) produce both ancestral glucosinolates and evolutionarily novel cardenolides as defenses. Here we test macroevolutionary hypotheses on co-expression, co-regulation, and diversification of these potentially redundant defenses across this genus. We sequenced and assembled the genome of <i>E. cheiranthoides</i> and foliar transcriptomes of 47 additional <i>Erysimum</i> species to construct a phylogeny from 9,869 orthologous genes, revealing several geographic clades but also high levels gene discordance. Concentrations, inducibility, and diversity of the two defenses varied independently among species, with no evidence for trade-offs. Closely related, geographically co-occurring species shared similar cardenolide traits, but not glucosinolate traits, likely as a result of specific selective pressures acting on each defense. Ancestral and novel chemical defenses in <i>Erysimum</i> thus appear to provide complementary rather than redundant functions.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/51593">Diminished responses to bodily threat and blunted interoception in suicide attempters</a></h4>

Psychological theories of suicide suggest that certain traits may reduce aversion to physical threat and increase the probability of transitioning from suicidal ideation to action. Here, we investigated whether blunted sensitivity to bodily signals is associated with suicidal action by comparing individuals with a history of attempted suicide to a matched psychiatric reference sample without suicide attempts. We examined interoceptive processing across a panel of tasks: breath-hold challenge, cold-pressor challenge, and heartbeat perception during and outside of functional magnetic resonance imaging. Suicide attempters tolerated the breath-hold and cold-pressor challenges for significantly longer and displayed lower heartbeat perception accuracy than non-attempters. These differences were mirrored by reduced activation of the mid/posterior insula during attention to heartbeat sensations. Our findings suggest that suicide attempters exhibit an ‘interoceptive numbing’ characterized by increased tolerance for aversive sensations and decreased awareness of non-aversive sensations. We conclude that blunted interoception may be implicated in suicidal behavior.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/44571">Stress-mediated exit to quiescence restricted by increasing persistence in CDK4/6 activation</a></h4>

Mammalian cells typically start the cell-cycle entry program by activating cyclin-dependent protein kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6). CDK4/6 activity is clinically relevant as mutations, deletions, and amplifications that increase CDK4/6 activity contribute to the progression of many cancers. However, when CDK4/6 is activated relative to CDK2 remained incompletely understood. Here we developed a reporter system to simultaneously monitor CDK4/6 and CDK2 activities in single cells and found that CDK4/6 activity increases rapidly before CDK2 activity gradually increases, and that CDK4/6 activity can be active after mitosis or inactive for variable time periods. Markedly, stress signals in G1 can rapidly inactivate CDK4/6 to return cells to quiescence but with reduced probability as cells approach S phase. Together, our study reveals a regulation of G1 length by temporary inactivation of CDK4/6 activity after mitosis, and a progressively increasing persistence in CDK4/6 activity that restricts cells from returning to quiescence as cells approach S phase.

Taneja et al. describe distinct roles for the two myosin-II paralogs in regulating actin cortex mechanics during cell division. Myosin-IIA generates cortex tension, while myosin-IIB maintains cortical stability. Optimal levels of the two paralogs within hetero-filaments at the cortex are required for shape stability and cytokinetic fidelity during cell division.

Mishra et al. demonstrate periostin-induced itch in mice, dogs, and monkeys and identify the integrin αVβ3 as the periostin neuronal receptor. They find that keratinocytes release periostin in response to TSLP, thus identifying a possible reciprocal vicious circle implicating the cytokine TSLP and periostin in chronic allergic itch.

Bortnick et al. demonstrate that plasma cell fate is associated with changes in chromatin folding, inter-chromosomal interactions, and nuclear localization involving plasma-cell-specific genes. Inter-chromosomal hubs in maturing B cells are enriched for the deposition of either H3K27Ac or H3K27me3. We propose that deposition of these marks facilitates inter-chromosomal interactions.

<p>by Avtar Roopra</p>

Transcriptomic profiling is an immensely powerful hypothesis generating tool. However, accurately predicting the transcription factors (TFs) and cofactors that drive transcriptomic differences between samples is challenging. A number of algorithms draw on ChIP-seq tracks to define TFs and cofactors behind gene changes. These approaches assign TFs and cofactors to genes via a binary designation of ‘target’, or ‘non-target’ followed by Fisher Exact Tests to assess enrichment of TFs and cofactors. ENCODE archives 2314 ChIP-seq tracks of 684 TFs and cofactors assayed across a 117 human cell lines under a multitude of growth and maintenance conditions. The algorithm presented herein, Mining Algorithm for GenetIc Controllers (MAGIC), uses ENCODE ChIP-seq data to look for statistical enrichment of TFs and cofactors in gene bodies and flanking regions in gene lists without an <i>a priori</i> binary classification of genes as targets or non-targets. When compared to other TF mining resources, MAGIC displayed favourable performance in predicting TFs and cofactors that drive gene changes in 4 settings: 1) A cell line expressing or lacking single TF, 2) Breast tumors divided along PAM50 designations 3) Whole brain samples from WT mice or mice lacking a single TF in a particular neuronal subtype 4) Single cell RNAseq analysis of neurons divided by Immediate Early Gene expression levels. In summary, MAGIC is a standalone application that produces meaningful predictions of TFs and cofactors in transcriptomic experiments.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HBHFwfm0YvY" width="1" />

<p>by David M. Richards, Jamie J. Walker, Joel Tabak</p>

Endocrine cells in the pituitary gland typically display either spiking or bursting electrical activity, which is related to the level of hormone secretion. Recent work, which combines mathematical modelling with dynamic clamp experiments, suggests the difference is due to the presence or absence of a few large-conductance potassium channels. Since endocrine cells only contain a handful of these channels, it is likely that stochastic effects play an important role in the pattern of electrical activity. Here, for the first time, we explicitly determine the effect of such noise by studying a mathematical model that includes the realistic noisy opening and closing of ion channels. This allows us to investigate how noise affects the electrical activity, examine the origin of spiking and bursting, and determine which channel types are responsible for the greatest noise. Further, for the first time, we address the role of cell size in endocrine cell electrical activity, finding that larger cells typically display more bursting, while the smallest cells almost always only exhibit spiking behaviour.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sMJc6idpiZU" width="1" />

Recent advances in electron microscopy have enabled the imaging of single cells in 3D at nanometer length scale resolutions. An uncharted frontier for <i>in silico</i> biology is the ability to simulate cellular processes using these observed geometries. Enabling such simulations requires watertight meshing of electron micrograph images into 3D volume meshes, which can then form the basis of computer simulations of such processes using numerical techniques such as the finite element method. In this paper, we describe the use of our recently rewritten mesh processing software, GAMer 2, to bridge the gap between poorly conditioned meshes generated from segmented micrographs and boundary marked tetrahedral meshes which are compatible with simulation. We demonstrate the application of a workflow using GAMer 2 to a series of electron micrographs of neuronal dendrite morphology explored at three different length scales and show that the resulting meshes are suitable for finite element simulations. This work is an important step towards making physical simulations of biological processes in realistic geometries routine. Innovations in algorithms to reconstruct and simulate cellular length scale phenomena based on emerging structural data will enable realistic physical models and advance discovery at the interface of geometry and cellular processes. We posit that a new frontier at the intersection of computational technologies and single cell biology is now open.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bMHqI_6inGU" width="1" />

In multicellular organisms, the timing and placement of gene expression in a developing tissue assigns the fate of each cell in the embryo in order for a uniform field of cells to differentiate into a reproducible pattern of organs and tissues. This positional information is often achieved through the action of spatial gradients of morphogens. Spatial patterns of gene expression are paradoxically robust to variations in morphogen dosage, given that, by definition, gene expression must be sensitive to morphogen concentration. In this work we investigate the robustness of the Dorsal/NF-κB signaling module with respect to perturbations to the dosage of maternally-expressed <i>dorsal</i> mRNA. The Dorsal morphogen gradient patterns the dorsal-ventral axis of the early <i>Drosophila</i> embryo, and we found that an empirical description of the Dorsal gradient is highly sensitive to maternal <i>dorsal</i> dosage. In contrast, we found experimentally that gene expression patterns are highly robust. Although the components of this signaling module have been characterized in detail, how their function is integrated to produce robust gene expression patterns to variations in the <i>dorsal</i> maternal dosage is still unclear. Therefore, we analyzed a mechanistic model of the Dorsal signaling module and found that Cactus, a cytoplasmic inhibitor for Dorsal, must be present in the nucleus for the system to be robust. Furthermore, active Toll, the receptor that dissociates Cactus from Dorsal, must be saturated. Finally, the vast majority of robust descriptions of the system require facilitated diffusion of Dorsal by Cactus. Each of these three recently-discovered mechanisms of the Dorsal module are critical for robustness. These mechanisms synergistically contribute to changing the amplitude and shape of the active Dorsal gradient, which is required for robust gene expression. Our work highlights the need for quantitative understanding of biophysical mechanisms of morphogen gradients in order to understand emergent phenotypes, such as robustness.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Xb4DsLMadIg" width="1" />

<p>by Noriki Fujimoto, Yuliang He, Marco D’Addio, Carlotta Tacconi, Michael Detmar, Lothar C. Dieterich</p>

Lymph nodes (LNs) are highly organized secondary lymphoid organs that mediate adaptive immune responses to antigens delivered via afferent lymphatic vessels. Lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) line intranodal lymphatic sinuses and organize lymph and antigen distribution. LECs also directly regulate T cells, mediating peripheral tolerance to self-antigens, and play a major role in many diseases, including cancer metastasis. However, little is known about the phenotypic and functional heterogeneity of LN LECs. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we comprehensively defined the transcriptome of LECs in murine skin-draining LNs and identified new markers and functions of distinct LEC subpopulations. We found that LECs residing in the subcapsular sinus (SCS) have an unanticipated function in scavenging of modified low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and also identified a specific cortical LEC subtype implicated in rapid lymphocyte egress from LNs. Our data provide new, to our knowledge, insights into the diversity of LECs in murine LNs and a rich resource for future studies into the regulation of immune responses by LN LECs.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Q_CXYqi-SUY" width="1" />

<p>The safety and efficacy of opioids are compromised as analgesic tolerance develops. Opioids are also ineffective against neuropathic pain. Recent reports have suggested that inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), may have analgesic effects in cancer patients suffering from neuropathic pain. It has been shown that the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (PDGFR-β), an RTK that has been shown to interact with the EGFR, mediates opioid tolerance but does not induce analgesia. Therefore, we sought to determine whether EGFR signaling was involved in opioid tolerance and whether EGFR and PDGFR signaling could induce pain in rats. We found that gefitinib, an EGFR antagonist, eliminated morphine tolerance. In addition, repeated EGF administration rendered animals unresponsive to subsequent analgesic doses of morphine, a phenomenon we call "pre-tolerance." Using a nerve injury model, we found that gefitinib alone was not analgesic. Rather, it reversed insensitivity to morphine analgesia (pre-tolerance) caused by the release of EGF by injured nerves. We also showed that repeated, but not acute EGF or PDGF-BB administration induced mechanical hypersensitivity in rats. EGFR and PDGFR-β signaling interacted to produce this sensitization. EGFR was widely expressed in primary sensory afferent cell bodies, demonstrating a neuroanatomical substrate for our findings. Taken together, our results suggest a direct mechanistic link between opioid tolerance and mechanical sensitization. EGFR antagonism could eventually play an important clinical role in the treatment of opioid tolerance and neuropathic pain that is refractory to opioid treatment.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A major challenge in medicine is developing potent pain therapies without the adverse effects of opiates. Neuroinflammation and in particular microglial activation have been shown to contribute to these effects. However, the implication of the microglial mu opioid receptor (MOR) is not known. We developed a novel conditional knockout (cKO) mouse line, wherein MOR is deleted in microglia. Morphine analgesic tolerance was delayed in both sexes in cKO mice in the hot plate assay. Opioid‐induced hyperalgesia (OIH) as measured in the tail immersion assay was abolished in male cKO mice, and physical dependence to morphine as assessed by naloxone‐induced withdrawal was attenuated in female cKO mice. Our results show a sex‐dependent contribution of microglial MOR in morphine analgesic tolerance, OIH, and physical dependence. In conclusion, our data suggest that blockade of microglial MOR could represent a therapeutic target for opiate analgesia without the opiate adverse effects.</p>

Fernandes et al. report causal connections between postingestive sucrose sensing and brain dopamine neuron activity in the ventral tegmental area that support food seeking. The authors further demonstrate that such behaviors and the associated neuron activity are mediated by the hepatic branch of the vagus nerve.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To characterize predictors of recovery and outcome following pediatric arterial ischemic stroke, hypothesizing that age influences recovery after stroke.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We studied children enrolled in the International Pediatric Stroke Study between January 1, 2003 and July 31, 2014 with 2‐year follow‐up after arterial ischemic stroke. Outcomes were defined at discharge by clinician grading and at 2 years by the Pediatric Stroke Outcome Measure. Demographic, clinical, and radiologic outcome predictors were examined. We defined changes in outcome from discharge to 2 years as recovery (improved outcome), emerging deficit (worse outcome), or no change.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Our population consisted of 587 patients, including 174 with neonatal stroke and 413 with childhood stroke, with recurrent stroke in 8.2% of childhood patients. Moderate to severe neurological impairment was present in 9.4% of neonates versus 48.8% of children at discharge compared to 8.0% versus 24.7% after 2 years. Predictors of poor outcome included age between 28 days and 1 year (compared to neonates, odds ratio [OR] = 3.58, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), underlying chronic disorder (OR = 2.23, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), and involvement of both small and large vascular territories (OR = 2.84, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Recovery patterns differed, with emerging deficits more common in children &lt;1 year of age (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Outcomes after pediatric stroke are generally favorable, but moderate to severe neurological impairments are still common. Age between 28 days and 1 year appears to be a particularly vulnerable period. Understanding the timing and predictors of recovery will allow us to better counsel families and target therapies to improve outcomes after pediatric stroke. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/57278">Potential harmful effects of discontinuing ACE-inhibitors and ARBs in COVID-19 patients</a></h4>

The discovery that SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) binds to the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-2, which is highly expressed in the lower airways, explained why SARS-CoV-2 causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure. After this, news spread that ACEis and ARBs would be harmful in SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects. To the contrary, compelling evidence exists that the ACE-1/angiotensin(Ang)II/ATR-1 pathway is involved in SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS, while the ACE-2/Ang(1-7)/ATR2/MasR pathway counteracts the harmful actions of AngII in the lung. A reduced ACE-1/ACE-2 ratio is, in fact, a feature of ARDS that can be rescued by human recombinant ACE-2 and Ang(1-7) administration, thus preventing SARS-CoV-2-induced damage to the lung. Based on the current clinical evidence treatment with ACE-inhibitors I (ACEis) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) continues to provide cardiovascular and renal protection in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Discontinuing these medications may therefore be potentially harmful in this patient population.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/55190">Zebrafish embryonic explants undergo genetically encoded self-assembly</a></h4>

Embryonic stem cell cultures are thought to self-organize into embryoid bodies, able to undergo symmetry-breaking, germ layer specification and even morphogenesis. Yet, it is unclear how to reconcile this remarkable self-organization capacity with classical experiments demonstrating key roles for extrinsic biases by maternal factors and/or extraembryonic tissues in embryogenesis. Here, we show that zebrafish embryonic tissue explants, prepared prior to germ layer induction and lacking extraembryonic tissues, can specify all germ layers and form a seemingly complete mesendoderm anlage. Importantly, explant organization requires polarized inheritance of maternal factors from dorsal-marginal regions of the blastoderm. Moreover, induction of endoderm and head-mesoderm, which require peak Nodal-signaling levels, is highly variable in explants, reminiscent of embryos with reduced Nodal signals from the extraembryonic tissues. Together, these data suggest that zebrafish explants do not undergo <i>bona-fide</i> self-organization, but rather display features of genetically encoded self-assembly, where intrinsic genetic programs control the emergence of order.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/53558">Chromosome organization by one-sided and two-sided loop extrusion</a></h4>

SMC complexes, such as condensin or cohesin, organize chromatin throughout the cell cycle by a process known as loop extrusion. SMC complexes reel in DNA, extruding and progressively growing DNA loops. Modeling assuming two-sided loop extrusion reproduces key features of chromatin organization across different organisms. <i>In vitro</i> single-molecule experiments confirmed that yeast condensins extrude loops, however, they remain anchored to their loading sites and extrude loops in a 'one-sided' manner. We therefore simulate one-sided loop extrusion to investigate whether 'one-sided' complexes can compact mitotic chromosomes, organize interphase domains, and juxtapose bacterial chromosomal arms, as can be done by 'two-sided' loop extruders. While one-sided loop extrusion cannot reproduce these phenomena, variants can recapitulate <i>in vivo</i> observations. We predict that SMC complexes <i>in vivo</i> constitute effectively two-sided motors or exhibit biased loading and propose relevant experiments. Our work suggests that loop extrusion is a viable general mechanism of chromatin organization.

<p>Cephalochordates (amphioxus or lancelets) are basal in the phylum Chiordata and can exemplify the relatively simple developmental and anatomical starting conditions likely to have evolved into more complex vertebrate features. Here we use serial blockface scanning electron microscopy to reconstruct the sensory peripheral nervous system in the tail of a lancelet. The nerves (glial cell/neurite complexes) branch within the dermis and then exit to the epidermis to associate with the perikarya of two kinds of ciliated sensory neurons. The results indicate that cephalochordate neuroglia have an intramedullary origin. Moreover, we suggest that the peripheral nerves in the dermis are, at least in part, comparable to Rohon‐Beard cells of vertebrates, whereas, in contrast, the placode‐ and neural crest‐derived peripheral neurons of vertebrates are evolutionary novelties that appear to have supplanted the epidermal sensory receptors of cephalochordates.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Serial blockface scanning electron microscopy (SBSEM) is used to describe the sensory peripheral nervous system (PNS) in the tail of a cephalochordate, <i>Asymmetron lucayanum</i>. The reconstructed region extends from the tail tip to the origin of the most posterior peripheral nerves from the dorsal nerve cord. As peripheral nerves ramify within the dermis, all the nuclei along their course belong to glial cells. Invaginations in the glial cell cytoplasm house the neurites, an association reminiscent of the non‐myelinated Schwann cells of vertebrates. Peripheral nerves pass from the dermis to the epidermis via small fenestrae in the sub‐epidermal collagen fibril layer; most nerves exit abruptly, but a few run obliquely within the collagen fibril layer for many micrometers before exiting. Within the epidermis, each nerve begins ramifying repeatedly, but the branches are too small to be followed to their tips with SBSEM at low magnification (previous studies on other cephalochordates indicate that the branches end freely or in association with epidermal sensory cells). In <i>Asymmetron</i>, two morphological kinds of sensory cells are scattered in the epidermis, usually singly, but sometimes in pairs, evidently the recent progeny of a single precursor cell. The discussion considers the evolution of the sensory PNS in the phylum Chordata. In cephalochordates, Retzius bipolar neurons with intramedullary perikarya likely correspond to the Rohon‐Beard cells of vertebrates. However, extramedullary neurons originating from ventral epidermis in cephalochordates (and presumably in ancestral chordates) contrast with vertebrate sensory neurons, which arise from placodes and neural crest.</p>

<p>Understanding force generation in nonequilibrium systems is a notable challenge in statistical physics. We uncover a fluctuation-induced force between two plates immersed in homogeneous isotropic turbulence using direct numerical simulations. The force is a nonmonotonic function of plate separation. The mechanism of force generation reveals an intriguing analogy with fluctuation-induced forces: In a fluid, energy and vorticity are localized in regions of defined length scales. When varying the distance between the plates, we exclude energy structures modifying the overall pressure on the plates. At intermediate plate distances, the intense vorticity structures (worms) are forced to interact in close vicinity between the plates. This interaction affects the pressure in the slit and the force between the plates. The combination of these two effects causes a nonmonotonic attractive force with a complex Reynolds number dependence. Our study sheds light on how length scale–dependent distributions of energy and high-intensity vortex structures determine Casimir forces.</p>

<p>Numerous plants and animals harbor selfish B chromosomes that "drive" or transmit themselves at super-Mendelian frequencies, despite long-term fitness costs to the organism. Currently, it is unknown how B chromosome drive is mediated, and whether B-gene expression plays a role. We used modern sequencing technologies to analyze the fine-scale sequence composition and expression of paternal sex ratio (PSR), a B chromosome in the jewel wasp <i>Nasonia vitripennis</i>. PSR causes female-to-male conversion by destroying the sperm’s hereditary material in young embryos to drive. Using RNA interference, we demonstrate that testis-specific expression of a PSR-linked gene, named <i>haploidizer</i>, facilitates this genome elimination–and–sex conversion effect. <i>haploidizer</i> encodes a putative protein with a DNA binding domain, suggesting a functional link with the sperm-derived chromatin.</p>

<p>Liquid emulsion droplet evaporation is of importance for various sensing and imaging applications. The liquid-to-gas phase transformation is typically triggered thermally or acoustically by low–boiling point liquids, or by inclusion of solid structures that pin the vapor/liquid contact line to facilitate heterogeneous nucleation. However, these approaches lack precise tunability in vaporization behavior. Here, we describe a previously unused approach to control vaporization behavior through an endoskeleton that can melt and blend into the liquid core to either enhance or disrupt cohesive intermolecular forces. This effect is demonstrated using perfluoropentane (C<sub>5</sub>F<sub>12</sub>) droplets encapsulating a fluorocarbon (FC) or hydrocarbon (HC) endoskeleton. FC skeletons inhibit vaporization, whereas HC skeletons trigger vaporization near the rotator melting transition. Our findings highlight the importance of skeletal interfacial mixing for initiating droplet vaporization. Tuning molecular interactions between the endoskeleton and droplet phase is generalizable for achieving emulsion or other secondary phase transitions, in emulsions.</p>

<p>Observations indicate a strong correlation between the occurrence of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. While increased volcanic activity has been observed following both local and distal earthquakes, some of the largest recorded earthquakes aren’t known to have triggered an eruption. Here we investigate whether an eruption and associated dike intrusion at Ambrym volcano was triggered by an <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 6.4 earthquake which occurred 30 hours earlier. Modeling suggests that stress changes induced by the earthquake were too small to account for the overpressure in the dike without additional bubble growth to pressurize the magma chamber. We find that the magma must be both H<sub>2</sub>O-saturated and at lower temperatures than those expected for newly intruded basalts. Too hot and the stress drop required to grow the bubbles is too large, too cold and the magma can no longer flow. These observations suggest that partially cooled and crystallized basaltic magmas are more susceptible to triggering from earthquakes.</p>

<p>Patterned cell divisions require a precisely oriented spindle that segregates chromosomes and determines the cytokinetic plane. In this study, we investigated how the meiotic spindle orients through an obligatory rotation during meiotic division in mouse oocytes. We show that spindle rotation occurs at the completion of chromosome segregation, whereby the separated chromosome clusters each define a cortical actomyosin domain that produces cytoplasmic streaming, resulting in hydrodynamic forces on the spindle. These forces are initially balanced but become unbalanced to drive spindle rotation. This force imbalance is associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking in the distribution of the Arp2/3 complex and myosin-II on the cortex, brought about by feedback loops comprising Ran guanosine triphosphatase signaling, Arp2/3 complex activity, and myosin-II contractility. The torque produced by the unbalanced hydrodynamic forces, coupled with a pivot point at the spindle midzone cortical contract, constitutes a unique mechanical system for meiotic spindle rotation.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://advances.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/6/14/eaaz4888?rss=1">Quantum biology revisited</a></h4>

<p>Photosynthesis is a highly optimized process from which valuable lessons can be learned about the operating principles in nature. Its primary steps involve energy transport operating near theoretical quantum limits in efficiency. Recently, extensive research was motivated by the hypothesis that nature used quantum coherences to direct energy transfer. This body of work, a cornerstone for the field of quantum biology, rests on the interpretation of small-amplitude oscillations in two-dimensional electronic spectra of photosynthetic complexes. This Review discusses recent work reexamining these claims and demonstrates that interexciton coherences are too short lived to have any functional significance in photosynthetic energy transfer. Instead, the observed long-lived coherences originate from impulsively excited vibrations, generally observed in femtosecond spectroscopy. These efforts, collectively, lead to a more detailed understanding of the quantum aspects of dissipation. Nature, rather than trying to avoid dissipation, exploits it via engineering of exciton-bath interaction to create efficient energy flow.</p>

<p>The lubrication properties of nanoconfined liquids underpin countless natural and industrial processes. However, our current understanding of lubricated friction is still limited, especially for nonideal interfaces exhibiting nanoscale chemical and topographical defects. Here, we use atomic force microscopy to explore the equilibrium and dynamical behavior of a model lubricant, squalane, confined between a diamond tip and graphite in the vicinity of an atomic step. We combine high-resolution imaging of the interface with highly localized shear measurements at different velocities and temperatures to derive a quantitative picture of the lubricated friction around surface defects. We show that defects tend to promote local molecular order and increase friction forces by reducing the number of stable molecular configurations in their immediate vicinity. The effect is general, can propagate over hundreds of nanometers, and can be quantitatively described by a semiempirical model that bridges the molecular details and mesoscale observations.</p>

<p>Oxygen activation is a critical step in ubiquitous heterogeneous oxidative processes, most prominently in catalysis, electrolysis, and pharmaceutical applications. We present here our findings on metal-free O<sub>2</sub> activation on covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) as an important class of N-rich materials. The O<sub>2</sub> activation process was studied for the formation of aldehydes, ketones and imines. A detailed mechanistic study of O<sub>2</sub> activation and the role of nitrogen heteroatoms were comprehensively investigated. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and control experiments provide strong evidence for the reaction mechanism proving the applicability of the CTFs to activate oxygen into superoxide species. This report highlights the importance of a self-templating procedure to introduce N functionalities for the development of metal-free catalytic materials. The presented findings reveal an important step toward the use of CTFs as inexpensive and high-performance alternatives to metal-based materials not only for catalysis but also for biorelated applications dealing with O<sub>2</sub> activation.</p>

<p>We study the effect of rotational state–dependent alignment in the scattering of molecules by optical fields. CS<sub>2</sub> molecules in their lowest few rotational states are adiabatically aligned and transversely accelerated by a nonresonant optical standing wave. The width of the measured transverse velocity distribution increases to 160 m/s with the field intensity, while its central peak position moves from 10 to –10 m/s. These changes are well reproduced by numerical simulations based on the rotational state–dependent alignment but cannot be modeled when ignoring these effects. Moreover, the molecular scattering by an off-resonant optical field amounts to manipulating the translational motion of molecules in a rotational state–specific way. Conversely, our results demonstrate that scattering from a nonresonant optical standing wave is a viable method for rotational state selection of nonpolar molecules.</p>

<p>Blue natural pigments are rare, especially among plants. However, flowering species that evolved to attract Hymenoptera pollinators are colored by blue anthocyanin-metal complexes. Plants lacking anthocyanins are pigmented by betalains but are unable to produce blue hues. By extending the -system of betalains, we designed a photostable and metal-free blue dye named BeetBlue that did not show toxicity to human hepatic and retinal pigment epithelial cells and does not affect zebrafish embryonal development. This chiral dye can be conveniently synthesized from betalamic acid obtained from hydrolyzed red beetroot juice or by enzymatic oxidation of l-dopa. BeetBlue is blue in the solid form and in solution of acidified polar molecular solvents, including water. Its capacity to dye natural matrices makes BeetBlue the prototype of a new class of low-cost bioinspired chromophores suitable for a myriad of applications requiring a blue hue.</p>

<p>Nanobubbles (NBs) are nanoscopic gaseous domains than can exist on solid surfaces or in bulk liquids. They have attracted substantial attention due to their long-time (meta)stability and a high potential for real-world applications. Using an approach not previously investigated, we exploit surface-electrostatic NB formation and stabilization via application of external electric fields in gas-liquid systems, with the marked result of massively increased gas uptake into the liquid in NB form. The de facto gas solubility enhancement (over many months) ranges from 2.5-fold for oxygen to 30-fold for methane vis-à-vis respective Henry’s law values for gas solubility; the more hydrophobic the gas, the more spectacular the increase. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the origin of NBs’ movement lies in dielectrophoresis, while substantial NB stabilization arises from a surface-polarization interaction.</p>

<p>Personal moisture management fabrics that facilitate sweat transport away from the skin are highly desirable for wearer’s comfort and performance. Here, we demonstrate a "skin-like" directional liquid transport fabric, which enables continuous one-way liquid flow through spatially distributed channels acting like "sweating glands" yet repels external liquid contaminants. The water transmission rate can be 15 times greater than that of best commercial breathable fabrics. This exceptional property is achieved by creating gradient wettability channels across a predominantly superhydrophobic substrate. The flow directionality is explained by the Gibbs pinning criterion. The permeability, mechanical property, and abrasion resistance (up to 10,000 cycles) of the fabric were not affected by the treatment. In addition to functional clothing, this concept can be extended for developing materials for oil-water separation, wound dressing, geotechnical engineering, flexible microfluidics, and fuel cell membranes.</p>

<p>Here, we describe a tripartite circular single-stranded (ss) DNA mycovirus, named Fusarium graminearum gemytripvirus 1 (FgGMTV1). The genome of FgGMTV1 comprises three circular ssDNA segments (DNA-A, DNA-B, and DNA-C). Sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses showed that FgGMTV1 is nested within the family Genomoviridae. We also constructed the first infectious DNA clones of a DNA mycovirus. Our results show that DNA-A and DNA-B are mutually interdependent for their replication and are associated with severely reduced colony growth and hypovirulence. DNA-C relies on DNA-A and DNA-B for replication and is necessary for the recovery of abnormal fungal phenotypes. DNA-C also enhances the accumulation of viral DNA in infected fungi and permits stable colonization and easy transmission via conidia. This is the first multipartite DNA virus isolated from a fungus. Our phylogenetic analyses also suggest that the multipartite genome of FgGMTV1 may have evolved from a monopartite genome of an ancient genomovirus.</p>

<p>Deep-sea cold seeps are dynamic sources of methane release and unique habitats supporting ocean biodiversity and productivity. Here, we describe newly discovered animal-bacterial symbioses fueled by methane, between two species of annelid (a serpulid <i>Laminatubus</i> and sabellid <i>Bispira</i>) and distinct aerobic methane-oxidizing bacteria belonging to the Methylococcales, localized to the host respiratory crown. Worm tissue <sup>13</sup>C of –44 to –58 are consistent with methane-fueled nutrition for both species, and shipboard stable isotope labeling experiments revealed active assimilation of <sup>13</sup>C-labeled methane into animal biomass, which occurs via the engulfment of methanotrophic bacteria across the crown epidermal surface. These worms represent a new addition to the few animals known to intimately associate with methane-oxidizing bacteria and may further explain their enigmatic mass occurrence at 150–million year–old fossil seeps. High-resolution seafloor surveys document significant coverage by these symbioses, beyond typical obligate seep fauna. These findings uncover novel consumers of methane in the deep sea and, by expanding the known spatial extent of methane seeps, may have important implications for deep-sea conservation.</p>

<p>Transient tunnels that assemble and disassemble to facilitate passage of unstable intermediates in enzymes containing multiple reaction centers are controlled by allosteric cues. Using the 140-kDa purine biosynthetic enzyme PurL as a model system and a combination of biochemical and x-ray crystallographic studies, we show that long-distance communication between ~25-Å distal active sites is initiated by an allosteric switch, residing in a conserved catalytic loop, adjacent to the synthetase active site. Further, combinatory experiments seeded from molecular dynamics simulations help to delineate transient states that bring out the central role of nonfunctional adaptor domains. We show that carefully orchestrated conformational changes, facilitated by interplay of dynamic interactions at the allosteric switch and adaptor-domain interface, control reactivity and concomitant formation of the ammonia tunnel. This study asserts that substrate channeling is modulated by allosteric hotspots that alter protein energy landscape, thereby allowing the protein to adopt transient conformations paramount to function.</p>

<p>Metal oxide semiconductor junctions are central to most electronic and optoelectronic devices, but ultrafast measurements of carrier transport have been limited to device-average measurements. Here, charge transport and recombination kinetics in each layer of a Ni-TiO<sub>2</sub>-Si junction is measured using the element specificity of broadband extreme ultraviolet (XUV) ultrafast pulses. After silicon photoexcitation, holes are inferred to transport from Si to Ni ballistically in ~100 fs, resulting in characteristic spectral shifts in the XUV edges. Meanwhile, the electrons remain on Si. After picoseconds, the transient hole population on Ni is observed to back-diffuse through the TiO<sub>2</sub>, shifting the Ti spectrum to a higher oxidation state, followed by electron-hole recombination at the Si-TiO<sub>2</sub> interface and in the Si bulk. Electrical properties, such as the hole diffusion constant in TiO<sub>2</sub> and the initial hole mobility in Si, are fit from these transient spectra and match well with values reported previously.</p>

Recent optical measurements of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterobilayers have revealed the presence of hybridized interlayer electron-hole pair excitations at energies defined by the superlattice potential. The corresponding quasiparticle band structures, so-called minibands, have remained elusive, and no such features have been reported for heterobilayers composed of a TMD and another type of 2D material. We introduce a new x-ray capillary technology for performing microfocused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with a spatial resolution of ~1 μm, and directly observe minibands at certain twist angles in mini Brillouin zones (mBZs). We discuss their origin in terms of initial and final state effects by analyzing their dispersion in distinct mBZs.</p>

<p>The high-lying vibrational states of the magnesium dimer (Mg<sub>2</sub>), which has been recognized as an important system in studies of ultracold and collisional phenomena, have eluded experimental characterization for half a century. Until now, only the first 14 vibrational states of Mg<sub>2</sub> have been experimentally resolved, although it has been suggested that the ground-state potential may support five additional levels. Here, we present highly accurate ab initio potential energy curves based on state-of-the-art coupled-cluster and full configuration interaction computations for the ground and excited electronic states involved in the experimental investigations of Mg<sub>2</sub>. Our ground-state potential unambiguously confirms the existence of 19 vibrational levels, with ~1 cm<sup>–1</sup> root mean square deviation between the calculated rovibrational term values and the available experimental and experimentally derived data. Our computations reproduce the latest laser-induced fluorescence spectrum and provide guidance for the experimental detection of the previously unresolved vibrational levels.</p>

<p>"Fake news," broadly defined as false or misleading information masquerading as legitimate news, is frequently asserted to be pervasive online with serious consequences for democracy. Using a unique multimode dataset that comprises a nationally representative sample of mobile, desktop, and television consumption, we refute this conventional wisdom on three levels. First, news consumption of any sort is heavily outweighed by other forms of media consumption, comprising at most 14.2% of Americans’ daily media diets. Second, to the extent that Americans do consume news, it is overwhelmingly from television, which accounts for roughly five times as much as news consumption as online. Third, fake news comprises only 0.15% of Americans’ daily media diet. Our results suggest that the origins of public misinformedness and polarization are more likely to lie in the content of ordinary news or the avoidance of news altogether as they are in overt fakery.</p>

<p>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) mutations in β-cardiac myosin and myosin binding protein-C (MyBP-C) lead to hypercontractility of the heart, an early hallmark of HCM. We show that hypercontractility caused by the HCM-causing mutation R663H cannot be explained by changes in fundamental myosin contractile parameters, much like the HCM-causing mutation R403Q. Using enzymatic assays with purified human β-cardiac myosin, we provide evidence that both mutations cause hypercontractility by increasing the number of functionally accessible myosin heads. We also demonstrate that the myosin mutation R403Q, but not R663H, ablates the binding of myosin with the C0-C7 fragment of MyBP-C. Furthermore, addition of C0-C7 decreases the wild-type myosin basal ATPase single turnover rate, while the mutants do not show a similar reduction. These data suggest that a primary mechanism of action for these mutations is to increase the number of myosin heads functionally available for interaction with actin, which could contribute to hypercontractility.</p>

Have you ever sought to use metagenomic DNA sequences reported in scientific publications? Were you successful? Here, we reveal that metagenomes from no fewer than 20% of the papers found in our literature search, published between 2016 and 2019, were not deposited in a repository or were simply inaccessible. The proportion of inaccessible data within the literature has been increasing year-on-year. Noncompliance with Open Data is best predicted by the scientific discipline of the journal. The number of citations, journal type (e.g., Open Access or subscription journals), and publisher are not good predictors of data accessibility. However, many publications in high–impact factor journals do display a higher likelihood of accessible metagenomic data sets. Twenty-first century science demands compliance with the ethical standard of data sharing of metagenomes and DNA sequence data more broadly. Data accessibility must become one of the routine and mandatory components of manuscript submissions—a requirement that should be applicable across the increasing number of disciplines using metagenomics. Compliance must be ensured and reinforced by funders, publishers, editors, reviewers, and, ultimately, the authors.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/J64iz9TnOSQ" width="1" />

Histological atlases of the cerebral cortex, such as those made famous by Brodmann and von Economo, are invaluable for understanding human brain microstructure and its relationship with functional organization in the brain. However, these existing atlases are limited to small numbers of manually annotated samples from a single cerebral hemisphere, measured from 2D histological sections. We present the first whole-brain quantitative 3D laminar atlas of the human cerebral cortex. It was derived from a 3D histological atlas of the human brain at 20-micrometer isotropic resolution (BigBrain), using a convolutional neural network to segment, automatically, the cortical layers in both hemispheres. Our approach overcomes many of the historical challenges with measurement of histological thickness in 2D, and the resultant laminar atlas provides an unprecedented level of precision and detail. We utilized this BigBrain cortical atlas to test whether previously reported thickness gradients, as measured by MRI in sensory and motor processing cortices, were present in a histological atlas of cortical thickness and which cortical layers were contributing to these gradients. Cortical thickness increased across sensory processing hierarchies, primarily driven by layers III, V, and VI. In contrast, motor-frontal cortices showed the opposite pattern, with decreases in total and pyramidal layer thickness from motor to frontal association cortices. These findings illustrate how this laminar atlas will provide a link between single-neuron morphology, mesoscale cortical layering, macroscopic cortical thickness, and, ultimately, functional neuroanatomy.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/HwoRD4mJykw" width="1" />

<p>by Angélique Volfart, Jacques Jonas, Louis Maillard, Sophie Colnat-Coulbois, Bruno Rossion</p>

Putting a name to a face is a highly common activity in our daily life that greatly enriches social interactions. Although this specific person–identity association becomes automatic with learning, it remains difficult and can easily be disrupted in normal circumstances or neurological conditions. To shed light on the neural basis of this important and yet poorly understood association between different input modalities in the human brain, we designed a crossmodal frequency-tagging paradigm coupled to brain activity recording via scalp and intracerebral electroencephalography. In Experiment 1, 12 participants were presented with variable pictures of faces and written names of a single famous identity at a 4-Hz frequency rate while performing an orthogonal task. Every 7 items, another famous identity appeared, either as a face or a name. Robust electrophysiological responses were found exactly at the frequency of identity change (i.e., 4 Hz / 7 = 0.571 Hz), suggesting a crossmodal neural response to person identity. In Experiment 2 with twenty participants, two control conditions with periodic changes of identity for faces or names only were added to estimate the contribution of unimodal neural activity to the putative crossmodal face-name responses. About 30% of the response occurring at the frequency of crossmodal identity change over the left occipito-temporal cortex could not be accounted for by the linear sum of unimodal responses. Finally, intracerebral recordings in the left ventral anterior temporal lobe (ATL) in 7 epileptic patients tested with this paradigm revealed a small number of “pure” crossmodal responses, i.e., with no response to changes of identity for faces or names only. Altogether, these observations provide evidence for integration of verbal and nonverbal person identity-specific information in the human brain, highlighting the contribution of the left ventral ATL in the automatic retrieval of face-name identity associations.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/cTYTWtgKEDA" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Excitatory amino acid transporter 5 (EAAT5) is a protein that is known to be alternately spliced and to be abundantly expressed in the retina by populations of neurons including photoreceptors and bipolar cells. EAAT5 acts as a slow glutamate transporter and also as glutamate‐gated chloride channel, the chloride conductance being large enough for EAAT5 to serve functionally as an “inhibitory” glutamate receptor. However, there has been a long‐standing view that the classically spliced form of EAAT5 is not abundant or widespread in the brain and so it has not been extensively investigated in the literature. We recently identified a human‐specific splicing form of EAAT5 that was not expressed by rodents but was shown to be a functional glutamate transporter. We have examined the expression of this form of EAAT5, hEAAT5v at the mRNA, and protein level in human brain, and show that populations of human cortical pyramidal neurons and cerebellar Purkinje cells show significant expression of hEAAT5v. Accordingly, we infer that EAAT5 may well be a player in modulating neuronal function in the human brain and propose that its localization in both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons could be compatible with a role in influencing intracellular chloride and thereby neuronal parameters such as membrane potential rather than acting as a presynaptic glutamate transporter.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are composed of five subunits arranged around a central chloride channel. Their subunits originate from different genes or gene families. The majority of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in the mammalian brain consist of two α‐, two β‐ and one γ‐ or δ‐subunit. This subunit organization crucially determines the physiological and pharmacological properties of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. Using immunohistochemistry, we investigated the distribution of 10 GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunits (α1, α2, α3, α4, α5, β1, β2, β3, γ2, and δ) in the fore brain of three female rhesus monkeys (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>). Within the cerebral cortex, subunits α1, α5, β2, β3, and γ2 were found in all layers, α2, α3, and β1 were more concentrated in the inner and outer layers. The caudate/putamen was rich in α1, α2, α5, all three β‐subunits, γ2, and δ. Subunits α3 and α5 were more concentrated in the caudate than in the putamen. In contrast, α1, α2, β1, β2, γ2, and δ were highest in the pallidum. Most dorsal thalamic nuclei contained subunits α1, α2, α4, β2, β3, and γ2, whereas α1, α3, β1, and γ2 were most abundant in the reticular nucleus. Within the amygdala, subunits α1, α2, α5, β1, β3, γ2, and δ were concentrated in the cortical nucleus, whereas in the lateral and basolateral amygdala α1, α2, α5, β1, β3, and δ, and in the central amygdala α1, α2, β3, and γ2 were most abundant. Interestingly, subunit α3‐IR outlined the intercalated nuclei of the amygdala. In the hippocampus, subunits α1, α2, α5, β2, β3, γ2, and δ were highly expressed in the dentate molecular layer, whereas α1, α2, α3, α5, β1, β2, β3, and γ2 were concentrated in sector CA1 and the subiculum. The distribution of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunits in the rhesus monkey was highly heterogeneous indicating a high number of differently assembled receptors. In most areas investigated, notably in the striatum/pallidum, amygdaloid nuclei and in the hippocampus it was more diverse than in the rat and mouse indicating a more heterogeneous and less defined receptor assembly in the monkey than in rodent brain.</p>

<p>To make full use of optogenetic and molecular techniques in the study of motor control, rich behavioral paradigms for rodents must rise to the same level of sophistication and applicability. We describe the layout, construction, use and analysis of data from joystick-based reaching in a head-fixed mouse. The step-by-step guide is designed for both experienced rodent motor labs and new groups looking to enter into this research space. Using this platform, mice learn to consistently perform large, easily-quantified reaches, including during a two-armed bandit probabilistic learning task. The metrics of performance (reach trajectory, amplitude, speed, duration, and inter-reach interval) can be used to quantify behavior or administer stimulation in closed loop with behavior. We provide a highly customizable, low cost and reproducible open-source behavior training platform for studying motor control, decision-making, and reaching reaction time. The development of this software and hardware platform enables behavioral work to complement recent advances in rodents, while remaining accessible to smaller institutions and labs, thus providing a high-throughput method to study unexplored features of action selection, motivation, and value-based decisions.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP) after successful revascularization (SR) via endovascular therapy (EVT) is a known predictor of poor outcome. However, the optimal SBP goal following EVT is still unknown. Our objective was to compare functional and safety outcomes between different SBP goals after EVT with SR.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This international multicenter study included 8 comprehensive stroke centers and patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion who were treated with EVT and achieved SR. SR was defined as modified thrombolysis in cerebral ischemia 2b to 3. Patients were divided into 3 groups based on SBP goal in the first 24 hours after EVT. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) propensity analysis was used to assess the effect of different SBP goals on clinical outcomes.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 1,019 patients were included. On IPTW analysis, the SBP goal of &lt;140mmHg was associated with a higher likelihood of good functional outcome and lower odds of hemicraniectomy compared to SBP goal of &lt;180mmHg. Similarly, SBP goal of &lt;160mmHg was associated with lower odds of mortality compared to SBP goal of &lt;180mmHg. In subgroup analysis including only patients with pre‐EVT SBP of ≥140mmHg, an SBP of &lt;140mmHg was associated with a higher likelihood of good functional outcome, lower odds of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and lower odds of requirement for hemicraniectomy compared to SBP goal of &lt;180mmHg.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>SBP goals of &lt;140 and &lt; 160mmHg following SR with EVT appear to be associated with better clinical outcomes than SBP of &lt;180mmHg. ANN NEUROL 2020</p>

<p>Nystatin is a pharmacological agent commonly used for the treatment of oral, mucosal and cutaneous fungal infections. Nystatin has also been extensively applied to study the cellular function of cholesterol-enriched structures because of its ability to bind and extract cholesterol from mammalian membranes. In neurons, cholesterol level is tightly regulated, being essential for synapse and dendrite formation, and axonal guidance. However, the action of Nystatin on axon regeneration has been poorly evaluated. Here, we examine the effect of Nystatin on primary cultures of hippocampal neurons, showing how acute dose (minutes) of Nystatin increases the area of growth cones, and chronic treatment (days) enhances axon length, axon branching, and axon regeneration post-axotomy. We describe two alternative signaling pathways responsible for the observed effects and activated at different concentrations of Nystatin. At elevated concentrations, Nystatin promotes growth cone expansion through phosphorylation of Akt; whereas, at low concentrations, Nystatin enhances axon length and regrowth by increasing nitric oxide levels. Together, our findings indicate new signaling pathways of Nystatin and propose this compound as a novel regulator of axon regeneration.</p>

<p>Cognitive deficits and positive symptoms in schizophrenia have both been linked to hippocampal dysfunction. Recently, subregion-specific aberrant and maladaptive hippocampal synaptic plasticity has been suggested as one of the mechanistic underpinnings. The subiculum is the final output hub of the hippocampus and orchestrates hippocampal information transfer to other brain regions. While most CA1 pyramidal neurons show regular-spiking behavior, subicular output neurons comprise bursting and regular-firing pyramidal cells. These two cell types target different brain regions and express unique forms of synaptic plasticity. Here, we used a single systemic application of the noncompetitive glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist MK-801 to model first-episode psychosis in rats and studied long-term potentiation (LTP) in subicular regular-firing cells in acute hippocampal slices. Previously, we have reported a facilitation of a presynaptic, late-onset LTP in subicular bursting pyramidal cells after systemic NMDAR antagonism. Here, we show that single systemic NMDAR antagonist application also facilitates the induction of a noncanonical, but postsynaptic NMDAR-independent LTP in ventral subicular but not in CA1 regular-firing pyramidal cells. This form of LTP was dependent on D1/D5 dopamine receptor activation. Activation of D1/D5 dopamine receptors by a specific agonist mimicked and occluded LTP induced by electrical high-frequency stimulation (HFS). Furthermore, our results indicate that this form of LTP relies on postsynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and requires the activation of protein kinase A. Considering the pivotal role of the subiculum as information gatekeeper between the hippocampus and other brain regions, this aberrant LTP in ventral subicular regular-firing neurons is expected to interfere with physiological hippocampal output processing and might thereby contribute to hippocampal dysfunction in psychotic events.</p>

<p>Nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) across thenuclear envelope (NE) is tightly regulated in eukaryotic cells and iscritical for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Its dysregulationleads to aging and neurodegeneration. Because they maintainaging-associated hallmarks, directly reprogrammed neurons from human fibroblasts are invaluable in understanding NCT. However, it is not clear whether NCT activity is influenced by neuronal maturation and sample sex [a key biological variable emphasized by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) policy]. We examined here NCT activity at the single-cell level by measuring mRNA subcellular distribution and protein transport in directly induced motor neurons (diMNs) from adult human fibroblasts. The results show that mRNA subcellular distribution but not protein transport is affected by neuronal maturation stages, whereas both transport processes are not influenced by the sample sex. This study also provides quantitative methods and optimized conditions for measuring NCTs of mRNAs or protein cargoes, establishing a robust way for future functional examinations of NCT activity in directly induced neurons from diseased human patients.</p>

Background<p>Some individuals who suffer from obsessive–compulsive (OC) disorder (OCD), report disturbing sensory preoccupations. The inability to stop obsessing over stimuli resonates with a difficulty in sensory habituation. Impaired sensory habituation, to a degree that clearly dysregulates response to sensory stimuli, and impairs participation in everyday activities, can be part of a disorder known as sensory over-responsivity (SOR). Although previous studies indicated a correlation between OCD and SOR, physiological experiments show that individuals with OCD are not more sensitive to sensory stimuli than controls. In the current study, we (1) validated a sensory habituation psycho-physiological protocol and (2) tested whether a “slow to habituate” mechanism can explain the occurrence of elevated SOR and OC symptoms.</p>Methods<p>We designed a protocol to test auditory sensory habituation through electrodermal activity (EDA) recording. The protocol included two randomly ordered aversive and neutral sound conditions; each set of six everyday life sounds was presented as a continuous stimulus. During the presentation of sounds, EDA was measured and participants could press a button to shorten the stimuli. Participants also completed sensory and OC symptom questionnaires. Participants included 100 typically developing adults that were divided into high versus low OC symptom groups. Mixed models analysis was used throughout to meet the need for capturing the temporal nature of habituation.</p>Results<p>Distinct physiological indices were computed to measure sensitivity versus habituation. Habituation was slower in the aversive versus neutral condition. Sensitivity was higher for the aversive stimuli. Self-report of sensory habituation and sensitivity partially correlated with the physiological habituation indices. A comparison of the physiological pattern between those with high versus low OC symptoms revealed significant differences in the habituation and sensitivity indices, across conditions.</p>Conclusion<p>The interplay between SOR and OC symptoms can be explained by a “slow to habituate” mechanism. Identifying behavioral and physiological markers of sensory problems in OCD is important for assessment, intervention and the discovery of underlying mechanisms.</p>

<p>Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) express the photopigment melanopsin and project to central targets, allowing them to contribute to both image-forming and non-image forming vision. Recent studies have highlighted chemical and electrical synapses between ipRGCs and neurons of the inner retina, suggesting a potential influence from the melanopsin-born signal to affect visual processing at an early stage of the visual pathway. We investigated melanopsin responses in ganglion cell layer (GCL) neurons of both intact and dystrophic mouse retinas using 256 channel multi-electrode array (MEA) recordings. A wide 200 μm inter-electrode spacing enabled a pan-retinal visualization of melanopsin’s influence upon GCL activity. Upon initial stimulation of dystrophic retinas with a long, bright light pulse, over 37% of units responded with an increase in firing (a far greater fraction than can be expected from the anatomically characterized number of ipRGCs). This relatively widespread response dissipated with repeated stimulation even at a quite long inter-stimulus interval (ISI; 120 s), to leave a smaller fraction of responsive units (&lt;10%; more in tune with the predicted number of ipRGCs). Visually intact retinas appeared to lack such widespread melanopsin responses indicating that it is a feature of dystrophy. Taken together, our data reveal the potential for anomalously widespread melanopsin responses in advanced retinal degeneration. These could be used to probe the functional reorganization of retinal circuits in degeneration and should be taken into account when using retinally degenerate mice as a model of disease.</p>

<p>Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the neural substrates and mechanisms that generate memory deficits, seizures and neuropsychiatric abnormalities in encephalitis with LGI1 antibodies using a data-driven, multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) approach.</p><p>Methods: Functional MRI data were acquired from 14 anti-LGI1 encephalitis patients and 14 age and gender matched normal controls. Independent component analysis with hierarchical partner matching (HPM-ICA) was used to assess the whole-brain intrinsic functional connectivity. Granger causality (GC) was applied to investigate the effective connectivity among the brain regions that identified by HPM-ICA. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was utilized to investigate white matter microstructural changes of the patients.</p><p>Results: Participants with LGI1 antibodies encephalitis presented reduced functional connectivity in the brain areas associated with memory, cognition and motion circuits, while increased functional connectivity in putamen and caudate in comparison to the normal controls. Moreover, the effective connectivity in patients was decreased from the frontal cortex to supplementary motor area. Finally, patients had significant reductions in fractional anisotropy (FA) for the corpus callosum, internal capsule, corona radiata and superior longitudinal fasciculus, accompanied by increases in mean diffusivity (MD) for these regions as compared to controls.</p><p>Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the neural disorder and behavioral deficits of anti-LGI1 encephalitis may be associated with extensive changes in brain connectivity and microstructure.

<p>Huntington’s disease (HD) is a hereditary neurodegenerative disease caused by a polyglutamine expansion in the huntingtin protein, Striatum atrophy in HD leads to a progressive disturbance of psychiatric, motor, and cognitive function. Recent studies of HD patients revealed that the degeneration of cerebellum is also observed independently from the striatal atrophy during early HD stage and may contribute to the motor impairment and ataxia observed in HD. Cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) are responsible for the proper cerebellar pathways functioning and motor control. Recent studies on mouse models of HD have shown that the abnormality of the biochemical functions of PCs are observed in HD, suggesting the contribution of PC dysfunction and death to the impaired movement coordination observed in HD. To investigate ataxic symptoms in HD we performed a series of experiments with the yeast artificial chromosome transgenic mouse model of HD (YAC128). Using extracellular single-unit recording method we found that the portion of the cerebellar PCs with bursting and irregular patterns of spontaneous activity drastically rises in aged YAC128 HD mice when compared with wild type littermates. Previous studies demonstrated that SK channels are responsible for the cerebellar PC pacemaker activity and that positive modulation of SK channel activity exerted beneficial effects in different ataxic mouse models. Here we studied effects of the SK channels modulator chlorzoxazone (CHZ) on the motor behavior of YAC128 HD mice and also on the electrophysiological activity and neuroanatomy of the cerebellar PCs from these mice. We determined that the long-term intraperitoneal injections of CHZ alleviated the progressive impairment in the firing pattern of YAC128 PCs. We also demonstrated that treatment with CHZ rescued age-dependent motor incoordination and improved the cerebellar morphology in YAC128 mice. We propose that abnormal changes in the PC firing patterns might be a one of the possible causes of ataxic symptoms in HD and in other polyglutamine disorders and that the pharmacological activation of SK channels may serve as a potential way to improve the activity of cerebellar PCs and relieve the ataxic phenotype in HD patients.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00278">Whole Brain and Cranial Size Adjustments in Volumetric Brain Analyses of Sex- and Age-Related Trends</a></h4>

<p>Our goal was to determine the influence of sex, age and the head/brain size on the compartmental brain volumes in the radiologically verified healthy population (96 subjects; 54 women and 42 men) from the Upper Silesia region in Poland. The MRI examinations were done using 3T Philips Achieva with the same T1-weighted and T2-weighted protocols. The image segmentation procedures were performed with SPM (Statistical Parameter Mapping) and FSL-FIRST software. The volumes of 14 subcortical structures for the left and right hemispheres and 4 overall volumes were calculated. The General Linear Models (GLM) analysis was used with and without the Total Brain Volume (TBV) and Intracranial Volume (ICV) parameters as the covariates to study the regional vs. global brain atrophy. After the ICV/TBV adjustments, the majority of sex differences in the specific volumes of interest (VOIs) revealed to be linked to the difference in the head/brain size parameters. The analysis also confirmed the significant effect of the aging process on the brain loss. After the TBV adjustment, the age- and sex-related volumetric trends for the gray and white matter volumes were observed: the negative age dependence of the gray matter volume is more pronounced in the males, while in case of the white matter the positive age-related trend in the female group is weaker. The local losses of the left caudate nucleus and the right thalamus are more advanced than the global brain atrophy. Different head-size correction strategies are not interchangeable and may yield various volumetric results, but when used together, facilitate studies on the regional dependencies inherent to a healthy, but aging, brain.</p>

<p>Computer simulation of the human brain at an individual neuron resolution is an ultimate goal of computational neuroscience. The Japanese flagship supercomputer, K, provides unprecedented computational capability toward this goal. The cerebellum contains 80% of the neurons in the whole brain. Therefore, computer simulation of the human-scale cerebellum will be a challenge for modern supercomputers. In this study, we built a human-scale spiking network model of the cerebellum, composed of 68 billion spiking neurons, on the K computer. As a benchmark, we performed a computer simulation of a cerebellum-dependent eye movement task known as the optokinetic response. We succeeded in reproducing plausible neuronal activity patterns that are observed experimentally in animals. The model was built on dedicated neural network simulation software called MONET (Millefeuille-like Organization NEural neTwork), which calculates layered sheet types of neural networks with parallelization by tile partitioning. To examine the scalability of the MONET simulator, we repeatedly performed simulations while changing the number of compute nodes from 1,024 to 82,944 and measured the computational time. We observed a good weak-scaling property for our cerebellar network model. Using all 82,944 nodes, we succeeded in simulating a human-scale cerebellum for the first time, although the simulation was 578 times slower than the wall clock time. These results suggest that the K computer is already capable of creating a simulation of a human-scale cerebellar model with the aid of the MONET simulator.</p>

<p>Patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease (PD) often receive deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatment, in which conductive leads are surgically implanted in the brain. While DBS treats tremor and rigidity, patients often continue to suffer from speech and swallowing impairments. There is preliminary evidence that transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the cortex may be beneficial for these symptoms. However, the potential electromagnetic interactions of the strong magnetic fields from TMS on the conductive leads is unknown, and the combination therapy has not been approved for use. In this article, we report an experimental study of the safety of combining DBS and TMS. We fabricated an anatomically accurate head and brain phantom with electrical conductivities matching cerebrospinal fluid and averaged conductivity of gray and white matter. Induced current on an implanted DBS probe in the brain phantom was measured. Our results show that TMS will induce current values in the range or higher than typical DBS stimulation current. Thus, the combination of TMS/DBS treatment might cause over-stimulation in the brain when stimulated directly over the DBS lead with 100% TMS current intensity.</p>

<p>Objective: The adult brain’s potential for plastic reorganization is an important mechanism for the preservation and restoration of function in patients with primary glial neoplasm. Patients with recurrent brain tumors requiring multiple interventions over time present an opportunity to examine brain reorganization. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a noninvasive imaging modality that can be used for motor cortical network mapping which, when performed at regular intervals, offers insight into this process of reorganization. Utilizing MEG-based motor mapping, we sought to characterize the reorganization of motor cortical networks over time in a cohort of 78 patients with recurrent glioma.</p><p>Methods: MEG-based motor cortical maps were obtained by measuring event-related desynchronization (ERD) in ß-band frequency during unilateral index finger flexion. Each patient presented at our Department at least on two occasions for tumor resection due to tumor recurrence, and MEG-based motor mapping was performed as part of preoperative assessment before each surgical resection. Whole-brain activation patterns from first to second MEG scan (obtained before first and second surgery) were compared. Additionally, we calculated distances of activation peaks, which represent the location of the primary motor cortex (MC), to determine the magnitude of movement in motor eloquent areas between the first and second MEG scan. We also explored which demographic, anatomic, and pathological factors influence these shifts.</p><p>Results: The whole-brain activation motor maps showed a subtle movement of the primary MC from first to second timepoint, as was confirmed by the determination of motor activation peaks. The shift of ipsilesional MC was directly correlated with a frontal-parietal tumor location (p &lt; 0.001), presence of motor deficits (p = 0.021), and with a longer period between MEG scans (p = 0.048). Also, a disengagement of wide areas in the contralesional (ipsilateral to finger movement) hemisphere at the second time point was observed.</p><p>Conclusions: MEG imaging is a sensitive method for depicting the plasticity of the motor cortical network. Although the location of the primary MC undergoes only subtle changes, appreciable shifts can occur in the setting of a stronger and longer impairment of the tumor on the MC. The ipsilateral hemisphere may serve as a reservoir for functional recovery.</p>

Background<p>Cortical entrainment to speech correlates with speech intelligibility and attention to a speech stream in noisy environments. However, there is a lack of data on whether cortical entrainment can help in evaluating hearing aid fittings for subjects with mild to moderate hearing loss. One particular problem that may arise is that hearing aids may alter the speech stimulus during (pre-)processing steps, which might alter cortical entrainment to the speech. Here, the effect of hearing aid processing on cortical entrainment to running speech in hearing impaired subjects was investigated.</p>Methodology<p>Seventeen native English-speaking subjects with mild-to-moderate hearing loss participated in the study. Hearing function and hearing aid fitting were evaluated using standard clinical procedures. Participants then listened to a 25-min audiobook under aided and unaided conditions at 70 dBA sound pressure level (SPL) in quiet conditions. EEG data were collected using a 32-channel system. Cortical entrainment to speech was evaluated using decoders reconstructing the speech envelope from the EEG data. Null decoders, obtained from EEG and the time-reversed speech envelope, were used to assess the chance level reconstructions. Entrainment in the delta- (1–4 Hz) and theta- (4–8 Hz) band, as well as wideband (1–20 Hz) EEG data was investigated.</p>Results<p>Significant cortical responses could be detected for all but one subject in all three frequency bands under both aided and unaided conditions. However, no significant differences could be found between the two conditions in the number of responses detected, nor in the strength of cortical entrainment. The results show that the relatively small change in speech input provided by the hearing aid was not sufficient to elicit a detectable change in cortical entrainment.</p>Conclusion<p>For subjects with mild to moderate hearing loss, cortical entrainment to speech in quiet at an audible level is not affected by hearing aids. These results clear the pathway for exploring the potential to use cortical entrainment to running speech for evaluating hearing aid fitting at lower speech intensities (which could be inaudible when unaided), or using speech in noise conditions.</p>

Objective<p>Sensory processing is the ability to capture, elaborate, and integrate information through the five senses and is impaired in over 90% of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The ASD population shows hyper–hypo sensitiveness to sensory stimuli that can generate alteration in information processing, affecting cognitive and social responses to daily life situations. Structured and semi-structured interviews are generally used for ASD assessment, and the evaluation relies on the examiner’s subjectivity and expertise, which can lead to misleading outcomes. Recently, there has been a growing need for more objective, reliable, and valid diagnostic measures, such as biomarkers, to distinguish typical from atypical functioning and to reliably track the progression of the illness, helping to diagnose ASD. Implicit measures and ecological valid settings have been showing high accuracy on predicting outcomes and correctly classifying populations in categories.</p>Methods<p>Two experiments investigated whether sensory processing can discriminate between ASD and typical development (TD) populations using electrodermal activity (EDA) in two multimodal virtual environments (VE): forest VE and city VE. In the first experiment, 24 children with ASD diagnosis and 30 TDs participated in both virtual experiences, and changes in EDA have been recorded before and during the presentation of visual, auditive, and olfactive stimuli. In the second experiment, 40 children have been added to test the model of experiment 1.</p>Results<p>The first exploratory results on EDA comparison models showed that the integration of visual, auditive, and olfactive stimuli in the forest environment provided higher accuracy (90.3%) on sensory dysfunction discrimination than specific stimuli. In the second experiment, 92 subjects experienced the forest VE, and results on 72 subjects showed that stimuli integration achieved an accuracy of 83.33%. The final confirmatory test set (n = 20) achieved 85% accuracy, simulating a real application of the models. Further relevant result concerns the visual stimuli condition in the first experiment, which achieved 84.6% of accuracy in recognizing ASD sensory dysfunction.</p>Conclusion<p>According to our studies’ results, implicit measures, such as EDA, and ecological valid settings can represent valid quantitative methods, along with traditional assessment measures, to classify ASD population, enhancing knowledge on the development of relevant specific treatments.</p>

<p>Recovery from spinal cord injury (SCI) remains an unsolved problem. As a major component of the SCI lesion, the glial scar is primarily composed of scar-forming astrocytes and plays a crucial role in spinal cord regeneration. In recent years, it has become increasingly accepted that the glial scar plays a dual role in SCI recovery. However, the underlying mechanisms of this dual role are complex and need further clarification. This dual role also makes it difficult to manipulate the glial scar for therapeutic purposes. Here, we briefly discuss glial scar formation and some representative components associated with scar-forming astrocytes. Then, we analyze the dual role of the glial scar in a dynamic perspective with special attention to scar-forming astrocytes to explore the underlying mechanisms of this dual role. Finally, taking the dual role of the glial scar into account, we provide several pieces of advice on novel therapeutic strategies targeting the glial scar and scar-forming astrocytes.</p>

<p>Post-stroke inflammation is almost involved in the whole process of stroke pathogenesis, which serves as a prime target for developing new stroke therapies. Despite known sex differences in the incidence and outcome of stroke, few preclinical or clinical studies take into account sex bias in treatment. Recent evidence suggests that poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1 inhibitor exerts sex-specific neuroprotection in the ischemic stroke. This study was aimed to investigate the effects of delayed PARP-1 inhibition on post-stroke inflammation and possible sexual dimorphism, and explore the possible relevant mediators. In male and female C57BL/6 mice subjected to transit middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), we found that delayed treatment of PARP-1 inhibitor at 48 h following reperfusion could comparably alleviate neuro-inflammation at 72 h after stroke. Whereas, more remarkable reduction of iNOS and MMP9 induced by PARP-1 inhibition were found in male MCAO mice, and the improvement of behavioral outcomes was more prominent in male MCAO mice. In addition, we further identified that PARP-1 inhibitor might equivalently suppress microglial activation in males and females in vivo and in vitro. With proteomic analysis and western blotting assay, it was found that stroke-induced peroxiredoxin-1 (Prx1) expression was significantly affected by PARP-1 inhibition. Interestingly, injection of recombinant Prx1 into the ischemic core could block the anti-inflammatory effects of PARP-1 inhibitor in the experimental stroke. These findings suggest that PARP-1 inhibitor has effects on regulating microglial activation and post-stroke inflammation in males and females, and holds promise as a novel therapeutic agent for stroke with extended therapeutic time window. Efforts need to be made to delineate the actions of PARP-1 inhibition in stroke, and here we propose that Prx1 might be a critical mediator.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00068">Programmed Cell Deaths and Potential Crosstalk With Blood–Brain Barrier Dysfunction After Hemorrhagic Stroke</a></h4>

<p>Hemorrhagic stroke is a life-threatening neurological disease characterized by high mortality and morbidity. Various pathophysiological responses are initiated after blood enters the interstitial space of the brain, compressing the brain tissue and thus causing cell death. Recently, three new programmed cell deaths (PCDs), necroptosis, pyroptosis, and ferroptosis, were also found to be important contributors in the pathophysiology of hemorrhagic stroke. Additionally, blood–brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of hemorrhagic stroke. The primary insult following BBB dysfunction may disrupt the tight junctions (TJs), transporters, transcytosis, and leukocyte adhesion molecule expression, which may lead to brain edema, ionic homeostasis disruption, altered signaling, and immune infiltration, consequently causing neuronal cell death. This review article summarizes recent advances in our knowledge of the mechanisms regarding these new PCDs and reviews their contributions in hemorrhagic stroke and potential crosstalk in BBB dysfunction. Numerous studies revealed that necroptosis, pyroptosis, and ferroptosis participate in cell death after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Endothelial dysfunction caused by these three PCDs may be the critical factor during BBB damage. Also, several signaling pathways were involved in PCDs and BBB dysfunction. These new PCDs (necroptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis), as well as BBB dysfunction, each play a critical role after hemorrhagic stroke. A better understanding of the interrelationship among them might provide us with better therapeutic targets for the treatment of hemorrhagic stroke.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00058">Advantages and Recent Developments of Autologous Cell Therapy for Parkinson’s Disease Patients</a></h4>

<p>Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a progressive degenerative disease characterized by tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity and postural instability. There are approximately 7–10 million PD patients worldwide. Currently, there are no biomarkers available or pharmaceuticals that can halt the dopaminergic neuron degeneration. At the time of diagnosis about 60% of the midbrain dopamine (mDA) neurons have already degenerated, resulting in a depletion of roughly 70% of striatal dopamine (DA) levels and synapses. Symptomatic treatment (e.g., with L-dopa) can initially restore DA levels and motor function, but with time often lead to side-effects like dyskinesia. Deep-brain-stimulation can alleviate these side-effects and some of the motor symptoms but requires repeat procedures and adds limitations for the patients. Restoration of dopaminergic synapses using neuronal cell replacement therapy has shown benefit in clinical studies using cells from fetal ventral midbrain. This approach, if done correctly, increases DA levels and restores synapses, allowing biofeedback regulation between the grafted cells and the host brain. Drawbacks are that it is not scalable for a large patient population and the patients require immunosuppression. Stem cells differentiated in vitro to mDA neurons or progenitors have shown promise in animal studies and is a scalable approach that allows for cryopreservation of transplantable cells and rigorous quality control prior to transplantation. However, all allogeneic grafts require immunosuppression. HLA-donor-matching, reduces, but does not completely eliminate, the need for immunosuppression, and is currently investigated in a clinical trial for PD in Japan. Since immune compatibility is very important in all areas of transplantation, these approaches may ultimately be of less benefit to the patients than an autologous approach. By using the patient’s own somatic cells, reprogrammed to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and differentiated to mDA neurons immunosuppression is not required, and may also present with several biological and functional advantages in the patients, as described in this article. The proof-of-principle of autologous iPSC mDA restoration of function has been shown in parkinsonian non-human primates (NHPs), and this can now be investigated in clinical trials in addition to the allogeneic and HLA-matched approaches. In this review, we focus on the autologous approach of cell therapy for PD.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00089">Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Parkinson’s Disease—Near-Infrared Photobiomodulation as a Potential Therapeutic Strategy</a></h4>

<p>As the main driver of energy production in eukaryotes, mitochondria are invariably implicated in disorders of cellular bioenergetics. Given that dopaminergic neurons affected in Parkinson’s disease (PD) are particularly susceptible to energy fluctuations by their high basal energy demand, it is not surprising to note that mitochondrial dysfunction has emerged as a compelling candidate underlying PD. A recent approach towards forestalling dopaminergic neurodegeneration in PD involves near-infrared (NIR) photobiomodulation (PBM), which is thought to enhance mitochondrial function of stimulated cells through augmenting the activity of cytochrome C oxidase. Notwithstanding this, our understanding of the neuroprotective mechanism of PBM remains far from complete. For example, studies focusing on the effects of PBM on gene transcription are limited, and the mechanism through which PBM exerts its effects on distant sites (i.e., its “abscopal effect”) remains unclear. Also, the clinical application of NIR in PD proves to be challenging. Efficacious delivery of NIR light to the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), the primary site of disease pathology in PD, is fraught with technical challenges. Concerted efforts focused on understanding the biological effects of PBM and improving the efficiency of intracranial NIR delivery are therefore essential for its successful clinical translation. Nonetheless, PBM represents a potential novel therapy for PD. In this review, we provide an update on the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in PD and how PBM may help mitigate the neurodegenerative process. We also discussed clinical translation aspects of this treatment modality using intracranially implanted NIR delivery devices.</p>

<p>Background: An increasing lifespan and the resulting change in our expectations of later life stages are dependent on a good health state. This emphasizes the importance of the development of strategies to further strengthen healthy aging. One important aspect of good health in later life stages is sustained skilled motor function.</p><p>Objective: Here, we tested the effectiveness of robotic upper limb motor training in a game-like scenario assessing game-based learning and its transfer potential.</p><p>Methods: Thirty-six healthy participants (n = 18 elderly participants, n = 18 young controls) trained with a Pacman-like game using a hand-held Cellulo robot on 2 consecutive days. The game-related movements were conducted on a printed map displaying a maze and targets that had to be collected. Gradually, the task difficulty was adjusted between games by modifying or adding different game elements (e.g., speed and number of chasing ghosts, additional rules, and haptic feedback). Transfer was assessed by scoring simple robot manipulation on two different trajectories.</p><p>Results: Elderly participants were able to improve their game performance over time [t<sub>(874)</sub> = 2.97, p &lt; 0.01]. The applied game elements had similar effects on both age groups. Importantly, the game-based learning was transferable to simple robot manipulation that resembles activities of daily life. Only minor age-related differences were present (smaller overall learning gain and different effects of the wall-crash penalty rule in the elderly group).</p><p>Conclusions: Gamified motor training with the Cellulo system has the potential to translate into an efficient and relatively low-cost robotic motor training tool for promoting upper limb function to promote healthy aging.</p>

The peripheral somatosensory system bestows mammals with a diverse repertoire of sensory modalities: gentle touch, mechanical pain, itch, thermosensation, and proprioception. The cells and molecules that transduce many of these stimuli have already been characterized. But how somatosensory neurons transduce acutely painful mechanical forces is largely unknown and remains one of the ‘final frontiers’ of sensory neurobiology. In an effort to fill this gap in knowledge, recent studies have identified subpopulations of mechanical pain neurons and uncovered novel modulators of mechanical pain.

Recent advances in animal tracking technology have ushered in a new era in biologging. However, the considerable size of many sophisticated biologging devices restricts their application to larger animals, whereas older techniques often still represent the state-of-the-art for studying small vertebrates. In industrial applications, low-power wireless sensor networks (WSNs) fulfill requirements similar to those needed to monitor animal behavior at high resolution and at low tag mass. We developed a wireless biologging network (WBN), which enables simultaneous direct proximity sensing, high-resolution tracking, and long-range remote data download at tag masses of 1 to 2 g. Deployments to study wild bats created social networks and flight trajectories of unprecedented quality. Our developments highlight the vast capabilities of WBNs and their potential to close an important gap in biologging: fully automated tracking and proximity sensing of small animals, even in closed habitats, at high spatial and temporal resolution.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/GWh2vVW6nuE" width="1" />

<p>As primary producers, plants rely on a large aboveground surface area to collect carbon dioxide and sunlight and a large underground surface area to collect the water and mineral nutrients needed to support their growth and development. Accessibility of the essential nutrients nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in the soil is affected by many factors that create a variable spatiotemporal landscape of their availability both at the local and global scale. Plants optimize uptake of the N and P available through modifications to their growth and development and engagement with microorganisms that facilitate their capture. The sensing of these nutrients, as well as the perception of overall nutrient status, shapes the plant’s response to its nutrient environment, coordinating its development with microbial engagement to optimize N and P capture and regulate overall plant growth.</p>

<p>The success of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase–1 (PARP-1) inhibitors (PARPi) to treat cancer relates to their ability to trap PARP-1 at the site of a DNA break. Although different forms of PARPi all target the catalytic center of the enzyme, they have variable abilities to trap PARP-1. We found that several structurally distinct PARPi drive PARP-1 allostery to promote release from a DNA break. Other inhibitors drive allostery to retain PARP-1 on a DNA break. Further, we generated a new PARPi compound, converting an allosteric pro-release compound to a pro-retention compound and increasing its ability to kill cancer cells. These developments are pertinent to clinical applications where PARP-1 trapping is either desirable or undesirable.</p>

<p>Understanding the extinction of <i>Australopithecus</i> and origins of <i>Paranthropus</i> and <i>Homo</i> in South Africa has been hampered by the perceived complex geological context of hominin fossils, poor chronological resolution, and a lack of well-preserved early <i>Homo</i> specimens. We describe, date, and contextualize the discovery of two hominin crania from Drimolen Main Quarry in South Africa. At ~2.04 million to 1.95 million years old, DNH 152 represents the earliest definitive occurrence of <i>Paranthropus robustus</i>, and DNH 134 represents the earliest occurrence of a cranium with clear affinities to <i>Homo erectus</i>. These crania also show that <i>Homo</i>, <i>Paranthropus</i>, and <i>Australopithecus</i> were contemporaneous at ~2 million years ago. This high taxonomic diversity is also reflected in non-hominin species and provides evidence of endemic evolution and dispersal during a period of climatic variability.</p>

<p>Understanding the neurobiological underpinnings of emotion relies on objective readouts of the emotional state of an individual, which remains a major challenge especially in animal models. We found that mice exhibit stereotyped facial expressions in response to emotionally salient events, as well as upon targeted manipulations in emotion-relevant neuronal circuits. Facial expressions were classified into distinct categories using machine learning and reflected the changing intrinsic value of the same sensory stimulus encountered under different homeostatic or affective conditions. Facial expressions revealed emotion features such as intensity, valence, and persistence. Two-photon imaging uncovered insular cortical neuron activity that correlated with specific facial expressions and may encode distinct emotions. Facial expressions thus provide a means to infer emotion states and their neuronal correlates in mice.</p>

<p>Ferroptosis is a form of cell death that results from the catastrophic accumulation of lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS). Oncogenic signaling elevates lipid ROS production in many tumor types and is counteracted by metabolites that are derived from the amino acid cysteine. In this work, we show that the import of oxidized cysteine (cystine) via system x<sub>C</sub><sup>–</sup> is a critical dependency of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which is a leading cause of cancer mortality. PDAC cells used cysteine to synthesize glutathione and coenzyme A, which, together, down-regulated ferroptosis. Studying genetically engineered mice, we found that the deletion of a system x<sub>C</sub><sup>–</sup> subunit, <i>Slc7a11</i>, induced tumor-selective ferroptosis and inhibited PDAC growth. This was replicated through the administration of cyst(e)inase, a drug that depletes cysteine and cystine, demonstrating a translatable means to induce ferroptosis in PDAC.</p>

<p>The design of modular protein logic for regulating protein function at the posttranscriptional level is a challenge for synthetic biology. Here, we describe the design of two-input AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XNOR, and NOT gates built from de novo–designed proteins. These gates regulate the association of arbitrary protein units ranging from split enzymes to transcriptional machinery in vitro, in yeast and in primary human T cells, where they control the expression of the <i>TIM3</i> gene related to T cell exhaustion. Designed binding interaction cooperativity, confirmed by native mass spectrometry, makes the gates largely insensitive to stoichiometric imbalances in the inputs, and the modularity of the approach enables ready extension to three-input OR, AND, and disjunctive normal form gates. The modularity and cooperativity of the control elements, coupled with the ability to de novo design an essentially unlimited number of protein components, should enable the design of sophisticated posttranslational control logic over a wide range of biological functions.</p>

<p>Slip of marine-terminating ice streams over beds of deformable till is responsible for most of the contribution of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet to sea level rise. Flow models of the ice sheet and till-bedded glaciers elsewhere require a law that relates slip resistance, slip velocity, and water pressure at the bed. We present results of experiments in which pressurized ice at its melting temperature is slid over a water-saturated till bed. Steady-state slip resistance increases with slip velocity owing to sliding of ice across the bed, but above a threshold velocity, till shears at its rate-independent Coulomb strength. These results motivate a generalized slip law for glacier-flow models that combines processes of hard-bedded sliding and bed deformation.</p>

<p>A defining feature of emergent phenomena in complex oxides is the competition and cooperation between ground states. In manganites, the balance between metallic and insulating phases can be tuned by the lattice; extending the range of lattice control would enhance the ability to access other phases. We stabilized uniform extreme tensile strain in nanoscale La<sub>0.7</sub>Ca<sub>0.3</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub> membranes, exceeding 8% uniaxially and 5% biaxially. Uniaxial and biaxial strain suppresses the ferromagnetic metal at distinctly different strain values, inducing an insulator that can be extinguished by a magnetic field. Electronic structure calculations indicate that the insulator consists of charge-ordered Mn<sup>4+</sup> and Mn<sup>3+</sup> with staggered strain-enhanced Jahn-Teller distortions within the plane. This highly tunable strained membrane approach provides a broad opportunity to design and manipulate correlated electron states.</p>

The impact produced an artificial crater with a diameter &gt;10 meters, which has a semicircular shape, an elevated rim, and a central pit. Images of the impact and resulting ejecta were recorded by the Deployable CAMera 3 for &gt;8 minutes, showing the growth of an ejecta curtain (the outer edge of the ejecta) and deposition of ejecta onto the surface. The ejecta curtain was asymmetric and heterogeneous and it never fully detached from the surface. The crater formed in the gravity-dominated regime; in other words, crater growth was limited by gravity not surface strength. We discuss implications for Ryugu’s surface age.</p>

<p>Precise three-dimensional (3D) atomic structure determination of individual nanocrystals is a prerequisite for understanding and predicting their physical properties. Nanocrystals from the same synthesis batch display what are often presumed to be small but possibly important differences in size, lattice distortions, and defects, which can only be understood by structural characterization with high spatial 3D resolution. We solved the structures of individual colloidal platinum nanocrystals by developing atomic-resolution 3D liquid-cell electron microscopy to reveal critical intrinsic heterogeneity of ligand-protected platinum nanocrystals in solution, including structural degeneracies, lattice parameter deviations, internal defects, and strain. These differences in structure lead to substantial contributions to free energies, consequential enough that they must be considered in any discussion of fundamental nanocrystal properties or applications.</p>

<p>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) engages mitochondria at specialized ER domains known as mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs). Here, we used three-dimensional high-resolution imaging to investigate the formation of pleomorphic "megamitochondria" with altered MAMs in brown adipocytes lacking the Sel1L-Hrd1 protein complex of ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD). Mice with ERAD deficiency in brown adipocytes were cold sensitive and exhibited mitochondrial dysfunction. ERAD deficiency affected ER-mitochondria contacts and mitochondrial dynamics, at least in part, by regulating the turnover of the MAM protein, sigma receptor 1 (SigmaR1). Thus, our study provides molecular insights into ER-mitochondrial cross-talk and expands our understanding of the physiological importance of Sel1L-Hrd1 ERAD.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/368/6486/48?rss=1">Maintenance of neural stem cell positional identity by mixed-lineage leukemia 1</a></h4>

<p>Neural stem cells (NSCs) in the developing and postnatal brain have distinct positional identities that dictate the types of neurons they generate. Although morphogens initially establish NSC positional identity in the neural tube, it is unclear how such regional differences are maintained as the forebrain grows much larger and more anatomically complex. We found that the maintenance of NSC positional identity in the murine brain requires a <i>mixed-lineage leukemia 1</i> (<i>Mll1</i>)–dependent epigenetic memory system. After establishment by sonic hedgehog, ventral NSC identity became independent of this morphogen. Even transient MLL1 inhibition caused a durable loss of ventral identity, resulting in the generation of neurons with the characteristics of dorsal NSCs in vivo. Thus, spatial information provided by morphogens can be transitioned to epigenetic mechanisms that maintain regionally distinct developmental programs in the forebrain.</p>

Abstract
<p>Axonal demyelination injury and neuronal degeneration are the primary causes of visual disability in multiple sclerosis (MS)-linked optic neuritis patients. Immunomodulatory therapies targeting inflammation have failed to avert the disease progression and no therapies exist to prevent the neuronal deficits seen in MS to date. Neuroprotective strategies targeting oligodendrocytes and astroglia have shown limited success due to a lack of axonal regeneration from injured neurons. In this study, we used the chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS to investigate the axonal regenerative approach to improve the neuronal function. Our approach focused on targeted knock-out (KO) of the developmentally regulated axon growth inhibitory Krüppel-like factor 4 (<i>Klf4</i>) gene in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) of <i>Klf4<sup>fl/fl</sup> </i>mice by intravitreal delivery of AAV2-Cre-ires-EGFP recombinant virus (1) at the time of EAE sensitization and (2) after the onset of optic neuritis-mediated visual defects in the mice. <i>Klf4</i> gene KO performed simultaneous with EAE sensitization prevented the visual loss as assessed by pattern electroretinograms (PERGs) in the mice and protected the RGCs from EAE-mediated death. More importantly, however, <i>Klf4</i> gene KO after the onset of optic neuritis also resulted in RGC neuroprotection with additional restoration of their function, thereby improving the visual function outcomes in the EAE model. This study establishes the efficacy of <i>Klf4</i> targeted knock-down in EAE even after the onset of disease symptoms, and thus should be further explored as a potential treatment strategy for MS/optic neuritis patients.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The effect of surgical treatment for supratentorial spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage and whether it is modified by key baseline characteristics and timing remains uncertain.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a systematic review and meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials of surgical treatment of supratentorial spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage aimed at clot removal. We searched MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane databases up to February 21<sup>st</sup>, 2019. Primary outcome was good functional outcome at follow‐up; secondary outcomes were death and serious adverse events. We analyzed all types of surgery combined and minimally invasive approaches separately. We pooled risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals and assessed the modifying effect of age, Glasgow Coma Scale, hematoma volume and timing of surgery with meta‐regression analysis.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 21 studies with 4145 patients; four (19%) were of the highest quality. Risk ratio of good functional outcome after any type of surgery was 1.40 (95% confidence interval 1.22–1.60; I<sup>2</sup> 46%; 20 studies) and after minimally invasive surgery 1.47 (1.26–1.72; I<sup>2</sup> 47%; 12 studies). For death the risk ratio for any type of surgery was 0.77 (0.68–0.85; I<sup>2</sup> 23%; 21 studies), and for minimally invasive surgery 0.68 (0.56–0.83; I<sup>2</sup> 14%; 13 studies). Serious adverse events were reported infrequently. Surgery seemed more effective when performed sooner after symptom onset (p = 0.04; 12 studies). Age, Glasgow Coma Scale and hematoma volume did not modify the effect of surgery.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Surgical treatment of supratentorial spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage may be beneficial, in particular with minimally invasive procedures and when performed sooner after symptom onset. Further well‐designed randomized trials are needed to demonstrate whether (minimally‐invasive) surgery improves functional outcome after ICH and to determine the optimal time‐window of the treatment after symptom onset.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24616?af=R">Dysregulation of synaptic pruning as a possible link between intestinal microbiota dysbiosis and neuropsychiatric disorders</a></h4>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The prenatal and early postnatal stages represent a critical time window for human brain development. Interestingly, this window partly overlaps with the maturation of the intestinal flora (microbiota) that play a critical role in the bidirectional communication between the central and the enteric nervous systems (microbiota‐gut‐brain axis). The microbial composition has important influences on general health and the development of several organ systems, such as the gastrointestinal tract, the immune system, and also the brain. Clinical studies have shown that microbiota alterations are associated with a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. In this review, we dissect the link between these neuropsychiatric disorders and the intestinal microbiota by focusing on their effect on synaptic pruning, a vital process in the maturation and establishing efficient functioning of the brain. We discuss in detail how synaptic pruning is dysregulated differently in the aforementioned neuropsychiatric disorders and how it can be influenced by dysbiosis and/or changes in the intestinal microbiota composition. We also review that the improvement in the intestinal microbiota composition by a change in diet, probiotics, prebiotics, or fecal microbiota transplantation may play a role in improving neuropsychiatric functioning, which can be at least partly explained <i>via</i> the optimization of synaptic pruning and neuronal connections. Altogether, the demonstration of the microbiota's influence on brain function <i>via</i> microglial‐induced synaptic pruning addresses the possibility that the manipulation of microbiota‐immune crosstalk represents a promising strategy for treating neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25734?af=R">Left prefrontal impact links subthalamic stimulation with depressive symptoms</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN‐DBS) in Parkinson's Disease (PD) not only stimulates focal target structures but also affects distributed brain networks. The impact this network modulation has on <i>non‐motor</i> DBS effects is not well characterized. By focusing on the affective domain, we systematically investigate the impact of electrode placement and associated structural connectivity on changes in depressive symptoms following STN‐DBS which have been reported to improve, worsen or remain unchanged.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Depressive symptoms before and after STN‐DBS surgery were documented in 116 PD patients from three DBS centers (Berlin, Queensland, Cologne). Based on individual electrode reconstructions, the volumes of tissue activated (VTA) were estimated and combined with normative connectome data to identify structural connections passing through VTAs. Berlin and Queensland cohorts formed a training and cross‐validation dataset used to identify structural connectivity explaining change in depressive symptoms. The Cologne data served as test‐set for which depressive symptom change was predicted.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Structural connectivity was linked to depressive symptom change under STN‐DBS. An optimal connectivity map trained on the Berlin cohort could predict changes in depressive symptoms in Queensland patients and vice versa. Furthermore, the joint training‐set map predicted changes in depressive symptoms in the independent test‐set. Worsening of depressive symptoms was associated with left prefrontal connectivity.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Fibers linking the STN electrode with left prefrontal areas predicted worsening of depressive symptoms. Our results suggest that for the left STN‐DBS lead, placement impacting fibers to left prefrontal areas should be avoided to maximize improvement of depressive symptoms.</p>

<p>Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) affect the cerebellum and its afferent and efferent systems that degenerate during disease progression. In the cerebellum, Purkinje cells (PCs) are the most vulnerable and their prominent loss in the late phase of the pathology is the main characteristic of these neurodegenerative diseases. Despite the constant advancement in the discovery of affected molecules and cellular pathways, a comprehensive description of the events leading to the development of motor impairment and degeneration is still lacking. However, in the last years the possible causal role for altered cerebellar development and neuronal circuit wiring in SCAs has been emerging. Not only wiring and synaptic transmission deficits are a common trait of SCAs, but also preventing the expression of the mutant protein during cerebellar development seems to exert a protective role. By discussing this tight relationship between cerebellar development and SCAs, in this review, we aim to highlight the importance of cerebellar circuitry for the investigation of SCAs.</p>

<p>With increasing distribution of endovascular stroke therapies, transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) in mice now more than ever depicts a relevant patient population with recanalized M1 occlusion. In this case, the desired therapeutic effect of blood flow restauration is accompanied by breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and secondary reperfusion injury. The aim of this study was to elucidate short and intermediate-term transcriptional patterns and the involved pathways covering the different cellular players at the neurovascular unit after transient large vessel occlusion. To achieve this, male C57Bl/6J mice were treated according to an intensive post-stroke care protocol after 60 min occlusion of the middle cerebral artery or sham surgery to allow a high survival rate. After 24 h or 7 days, RNA from microvessel fragments from the ipsilateral and the contralateral hemispheres was isolated and used for mRNA sequencing. Bioinformatic analyses allowed us to depict gene expression changes at two timepoints of neurovascular post-stroke injury and regeneration. We validated our dataset by quantitative real time PCR of BBB-associated targets with well-characterized post-stroke dynamics. Hence, this study provides a well-controlled transcriptome dataset of a translationally relevant mouse model 24 h and 7 days after stroke which might help to discover future therapeutic targets in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury.</p>

<p>Stimulation of the pineal gland via its sympathetic innervation pathway results in the production of N-acetylserotonin and melatonin. Melatonin has many therapeutic roles and is heavily implicated in the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle. In addition, N-acetylserotonin has recently been reported to promote neurogenesis in the brain. Upregulation of these indoleamines is possible via neuromodulation of the pineal gland. This is achieved by electrical stimulation of structures or fibres in the pineal gland sympathetic innervation pathway. Many studies have performed such pineal neuromodulation using both invasive and non-invasive methods. However, the effects of various experimental variables and stimulation paradigms has not yet been reviewed and evaluated. This review summarises these studies and presents the optimal experimental protocols and stimulation parameters necessary for maximal upregulation of melatonin metabolic output.</p>

<p>Excitatory synapses in the mammalian cortex are highly diverse, both in terms of their structure and function. However, relationships between synaptic features indicate they are highly coordinated entities. Imaging techniques, that enable physiology at the resolution of individual synapses to be investigated, have allowed the presynaptic activity level of the synapse to be related to postsynaptic function. This approach has revealed that neuronal activity induces the pre- and post-synapse to be functionally correlated and that subsets of synapses are more susceptible to certain forms of synaptic plasticity. As presynaptic function is often examined in isolation from postsynaptic properties, the effect it has on the post-synapse is not fully understood. However, since postsynaptic receptors at excitatory synapses respond to release of glutamate, it follows that they may be differentially regulated depending on the frequency of its release. Therefore, examining postsynaptic properties in the context of presynaptic function may be a useful way to approach a broad range of questions on synaptic physiology. In this review, we focus on how optophysiology tools have been utilized to study relationships between the pre- and the post-synapse. Multiple imaging techniques have revealed correlations in synaptic properties from the submicron to the dendritic level. Optical tools together with advanced imaging techniques are ideally suited to illuminate this area further, due to the spatial resolution and control they allow.</p>

<p>Glial activation characterizes most neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases, often anticipating clinical manifestations and macroscopical brain alterations. Although imaging techniques have improved diagnostic accuracy in many neurological conditions, often supporting diagnosis, prognosis prediction and treatment outcome, very few molecular imaging probes, specifically focused on microglial and astrocytic activation, have been translated to a clinical setting. In this context, hybrid positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance (MR) scanners represent the most advanced tool for molecular imaging, combining the functional specificity of PET radiotracers (e.g., targeting metabolism, hypoxia, and inflammation) to both high-resolution and multiparametric information derived by MR in a single imaging acquisition session. This simultaneity of findings achievable by PET/MR, if useful for reciprocal technical adjustments regarding temporal and spatial cross-modal alignment/synchronization, opens still debated issues about its clinical value in neurological patients, possibly incompliant and highly variable from a clinical point of view. While several preclinical and clinical studies have investigated the sensitivity of PET tracers to track microglial (mainly TSPO ligands) and astrocytic (mainly MAOB ligands) activation, less studies have focused on MR specificity to this topic (e.g., through the assessment of diffusion properties and T2 relaxometry), and only few exploiting the integration of simultaneous hybrid acquisition. This review aims at summarizing and critically review the current state about PET and MR imaging for glial targets, as well as the potential added value of hybrid scanners for characterizing microglial and astrocytic activation.</p>

<p>Astrocytes have been implicated in regulating oligodendrocyte development and myelination in vitro, although their functions in vivo remain less well defined. Using a novel approach to locally ablate GFAP+ astrocytes, we demonstrate that astrocytes are required for normal CNS myelin compaction during development, and for maintaining myelin integrity in the adult. Transient ablation of GFAP+ astrocytes in the mouse spinal cord during the first postnatal week reduced the numbers of mature oligodendrocytes and inhibited myelin formation, while prolonged ablation resulted in myelin that lacked compaction and structural integrity. Ablation of GFAP+ astrocytes in the adult spinal cord resulted in the rapid, local loss of myelin integrity and regional demyelination. The loss of myelin integrity induced by astrocyte ablation was greatly reduced by NMDA receptor antagonists, both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that myelin stability was affected by elevation of local glutamate levels following astrocyte ablation. Furthermore, targeted delivery of glutamate into adult spinal cord white matter resulted in reduction of myelin basic protein expression and localized disruption of myelin compaction which was also reduced by NMDA receptor blockade. The pathology induced by localized astrocyte loss and elevated exogenous glutamate, supports the concept that astrocytes are critical for maintenance of myelin integrity in the adult CNS and may be primary targets in the initiation of demyelinating diseases of the CNS, such as Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO).</p>

Brain glucose metabolism was assessed by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). Linear mixed model was fitted to examine the association between the HTN × APOE4 interaction and longitudinal changes in brain glucose metabolism after controlling for several covariates.</p>Results<p>In the present study, we found that the association between HTN status and longitudinal changes in brain glucose metabolism varied as a function of the APOE4 status, such that the HTN/APOE4+ group showed a steeper decline in FDG SUVR than all other groups (No HTN/APOE4-, HTN/APOE4-, and No HTN/APOE4+). Nevertheless, there was no significant difference in the rate of decline in FDG SUVR among other groups (No HTN/APOE4-, HTN/APOE4-, and No HTN/APOE4+).</p>Conclusion<p>The APOE4 genotype interacted with hypertension status to affect longitudinal changes in brain glucose metabolism among older individual with normal cognition, such that the HTN/APOE4+ group showed a steeper decline in FDG SUVR than other groups.</p>
