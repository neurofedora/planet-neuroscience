              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12352">Deep Generative Model-Based Generation of Synthetic Individual-Specific Brain MRI Segmentations</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.12352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To the best of our knowledge, all existing methods that can generate synthetic brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans for a specific individual require detailed structural or volumetric information about the individual's brain. However, such brain information is often scarce, expensive, and difficult to obtain. In this paper, we propose the first approach capable of generating synthetic brain MRI segmentations -- specifically, 3D white matter (WM), gray matter (GM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) segmentations -- for individuals using their easily obtainable and often readily available demographic, interview, and cognitive test information. Our approach features a novel deep generative model, CSegSynth, which outperforms existing prominent generative models, including conditional variational autoencoder (C-VAE), conditional generative adversarial network (C-GAN), and conditional latent diffusion model (C-LDM). We demonstrate the high quality of our synthetic segmentations through extensive evaluations. Also, in assessing the effectiveness of the individual-specific generation, we achieve superior volume prediction, with Pearson correlation coefficients reaching 0.80, 0.82, and 0.70 between the ground-truth WM, GM, and CSF volumes of test individuals and those volumes predicted based on generated individual-specific segmentations, respectively.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12429">Optimal packing of attractor states in neural representations</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.12429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Animals' internal states reflect variables like their position in space, orientation, decisions, and motor actions -- but how should these internal states be arranged? Internal states which frequently transition between one another should be close enough that transitions can happen quickly, but not so close that neural noise significantly impacts the stability of those states, and how reliably they can be encoded and decoded. In this paper, we study the problem of striking a balance between these two concerns, which we call an `optimal packing' problem since it resembles mathematical problems like sphere packing. While this problem is generally extremely difficult, we show that symmetries in environmental transition statistics imply certain symmetries of the optimal neural representations, which allows us in some cases to exactly solve for the optimal state arrangement. We focus on two toy cases: uniform transition statistics, and cyclic transition statistics. Code is available at https://github.com/john-vastola/optimal-packing-neurreps23 .

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12310">Reflective Empiricism: Bias Reflection and Introspection as a Scientific Method</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.12310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Reflective Empiricism, an extension of empirical science that incorporates subjective perception and consciousness processes as equally valid sources of knowledge. It views reality as an interplay of subjective experience and objective laws, comprehensible only through systematic introspection, bias reflection, and premise-based logical-explorative modeling. This approach overcomes paradigmatic blindness arising from unreflected subjective filters in established paradigms, promoting an adaptable science. Innovations include a method for bias recognition, premise-based models grounded in observed phenomena to unlock new conceptual spaces, and Heureka moments - intuitive insights - as starting points for hypotheses, subsequently tested empirically. The author's self-observation, such as analyzing belief formation, demonstrates its application and transformative power. Rooted in philosophical and scientific-historical references (e.g., Archimedes' intuition, quantum observer effect), Reflective Empiricism connects physics, psychology, and philosophy, enhancing interdisciplinary synthesis and accelerating knowledge creation by leveraging anomalies and subjective depth. It does not seek to replace empirical research but to enrich it, enabling a more holistic understanding of complex phenomena like consciousness and advancing 21st-century science.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00238">Understanding the Limits of Vision Language Models Through the Lens of the Binding Problem</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.00238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work has documented striking heterogeneity in the performance of state-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs), including both multimodal language models and text-to-image models. These models are able to describe and generate a diverse array of complex, naturalistic images, yet they exhibit surprising failures on basic multi-object reasoning tasks -- such as counting, localization, and simple forms of visual analogy -- that humans perform with near perfect accuracy. To better understand this puzzling pattern of successes and failures, we turn to theoretical accounts of the binding problem in cognitive science and neuroscience, a fundamental problem that arises when a shared set of representational resources must be used to represent distinct entities (e.g., to represent multiple objects in an image), necessitating the use of serial processing to avoid interference. We find that many of the puzzling failures of state-of-the-art VLMs can be explained as arising due to the binding problem, and that these failure modes are strikingly similar to the limitations exhibited by rapid, feedforward processing in the human brain.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12480">Boosting Reservoir Computing with Brain-inspired Adaptive Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.12480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reservoir computers (RCs) provide a computationally efficient alternative to deep learning while also offering a framework for incorporating brain-inspired computational principles. By using an internal neural network with random, fixed connections$-$the 'reservoir'$-$and training only the output weights, RCs simplify the training process but remain sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters that govern activation functions and network architecture. Moreover, typical RC implementations overlook a critical aspect of neuronal dynamics: the balance between excitatory and inhibitory (E-I) signals, which is essential for robust brain function. We show that RCs characteristically perform best in balanced or slightly over-inhibited regimes, outperforming excitation-dominated ones. To reduce the need for precise hyperparameter tuning, we introduce a self-adapting mechanism that locally adjusts E/I balance to achieve target neuronal firing rates, improving performance by up to 130% in tasks like memory capacity and time series prediction compared with globally tuned RCs. Incorporating brain-inspired heterogeneity in target neuronal firing rates further reduces the need for fine-tuning hyperparameters and enables RCs to excel across linear and non-linear tasks. These results support a shift from static optimization to dynamic adaptation in reservoir design, demonstrating how brain-inspired mechanisms improve RC performance and robustness while deepening our understanding of neural computation.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.10605">Learning spatial hearing via innate mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2001.10605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The acoustic cues used by humans and other animals to localise sounds are subtle, and change during and after development. This means that we need to constantly relearn or recalibrate the auditory spatial map throughout our lifetimes. This is often thought of as a "supervised" learning process where a "teacher" (for example, a parent, or your visual system) tells you whether or not you guessed the location correctly, and you use this information to update your map. However, there is not always an obvious teacher (for example in babies or blind people). Using computational models, we showed that approximate feedback from a simple innate circuit, such as that can distinguish left from right (e.g. the auditory orienting response), is sufficient to learn an accurate full-range spatial auditory map. Moreover, using this mechanism in addition to supervised learning can more robustly maintain the adaptive neural representation. We find several possible neural mechanisms that could underlie this type of learning, and hypothesise that multiple mechanisms may be present and interact with each other. We conclude that when studying spatial hearing, we should not assume that the only source of learning is from the visual system or other supervisory signal. Further study of the proposed mechanisms could allow us to design better rehabilitation programmes to accelerate relearning/recalibration of spatial maps.

Abstract: Hebbian learning limits Hopfield network capacity. While kernel methods like Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR) improve performance via iterative learning, we propose Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) as an alternative. KRR learns dual variables non-iteratively via a closed-form solution, offering significant learning speed advantages. We show KRR achieves comparably high storage capacity (reaching ratio 1.5 shown) and noise robustness (recalling from around 80% corrupted patterns) as KLR, while drastically reducing training time, establishing KRR as an efficient method for building high-performance associative memories.

                arXiv:2504.12568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) is managing the exploration-exploitation trade-off without sacrificing sample efficiency. Policy gradient (PG) methods excel in exploitation through fine-grained, gradient-based optimization but often struggle with exploration due to their focus on local search. In contrast, evolutionary computation (EC) methods excel in global exploration, but lack mechanisms for exploitation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Evolutionary Policy Optimization (EPO), a hybrid algorithm that integrates neuroevolution with policy gradient methods for policy optimization. EPO leverages the exploration capabilities of EC and the exploitation strengths of PG, offering an efficient solution to the exploration-exploitation dilemma in RL. EPO is evaluated on the Atari Pong and Breakout benchmarks. Experimental results show that EPO improves both policy quality and sample efficiency compared to standard PG and EC methods, making it effective for tasks that require both exploration and local optimization.

                arXiv:2504.12651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feature selection is essential for efficient data mining and sometimes encounters the positive-unlabeled (PU) learning scenario, where only a few positive labels are available, while most data remains unlabeled. In certain real-world PU learning tasks, data subjected to adequate feature selection often form clusters with concentrated positive labels. Conventional feature selection methods that treat unlabeled data as negative may fail to capture the statistical characteristics of positive data in such scenarios, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a novel feature selection method based on the cluster assumption in PU learning, called FSCPU. FSCPU formulates the feature selection problem as a binary optimization task, with an objective function explicitly designed to incorporate the cluster assumption in the PU learning setting. Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of FSCPU across various data conditions. Moreover, comparisons with 10 conventional algorithms on three open datasets show that FSCPU achieves competitive performance in downstream classification tasks, even when the cluster assumption does not strictly hold.

Abstract: Reservoir computing can embed attractors into random neural networks (RNNs), generating a ``mirror'' of a target attractor because of its inherent symmetrical constraints. In these RNNs, we report that an attractor-merging crisis accompanied by intermittency emerges simply by adjusting the global parameter. We further reveal its underlying mechanism through a detailed analysis of the phase-space structure and demonstrate that this bifurcation scenario is intrinsic to a general class of RNNs, independent of training data.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12702">Embodied Neuromorphic Control Applied on a 7-DOF Robotic Manipulator</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.12702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of artificial intelligence towards real-time interaction with the environment is a key aspect of embodied intelligence and robotics. Inverse dynamics is a fundamental robotics problem, which maps from joint space to torque space of robotic systems. Traditional methods for solving it rely on direct physical modeling of robots which is difficult or even impossible due to nonlinearity and external disturbance. Recently, data-based model-learning algorithms are adopted to address this issue. However, they often require manual parameter tuning and high computational costs. Neuromorphic computing is inherently suitable to process spatiotemporal features in robot motion control at extremely low costs. However, current research is still in its infancy: existing works control only low-degree-of-freedom systems and lack performance quantification and comparison. In this paper, we propose a neuromorphic control framework to control 7 degree-of-freedom robotic manipulators. We use Spiking Neural Network to leverage the spatiotemporal continuity of the motion data to improve control accuracy, and eliminate manual parameters tuning. We validated the algorithm on two robotic platforms, which reduces torque prediction error by at least 60% and performs a target position tracking task successfully. This work advances embodied neuromorphic control by one step forward from proof of concept to applications in complex real-world tasks.

                arXiv:2405.06691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While numerous frameworks have been developed to enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), there is a scarcity of methods that effectively balance the trade-off between cost and quality. In this paper, we introduce Fleet of Agents (FoA), a novel and intuitive yet principled framework utilizing LLMs as agents to navigate through dynamic tree searches, employing a genetic-type particle filtering approach. FoA spawns a multitude of agents, each exploring the search space autonomously, followed by a selection phase where resampling based on a heuristic value function optimizes the balance between exploration and exploitation. This mechanism enables dynamic branching, adapting the exploration strategy based on discovered solutions. We conduct extensive experiments on three benchmark tasks, ``Game of 24'', ``Mini-Crosswords'', and ``WebShop'', utilizing four different LLMs, ``GPT-3.5'', ``GPT-4'', ``LLaMA3.2-11B'', and ``LLaMA3.2-90B''. On average across all tasks and LLMs, FoA obtains a quality improvement of ~5% while requiring only ~40% of the cost of previous SOTA methods. Notably, our analyses reveal that (1) FoA achieves the best cost-quality trade-off among all benchmarked methods and (2) FoA + LLaMA3.2-11B surpasses the Llama3.2-90B model. FoA is publicly available at https://github.com/au-clan/FoA.

                <p>One pending question in social neuroscience is whether interpersonal interactions are processed differently by the brain depending on the bodily characteristics of the interactor, i.e., their physical appearance. To address this issue, we engaged participants in a minimally interactive task with an avatar either showing bodily features or not while recording their brain activity using electroencephalography (EEG) in order to investigate indices of action observation and action monitoring processing. Multivariate results showed that bodily compared with nonbodily appearance modulated parieto-occipital neural patterns throughout the entire duration of the observed movement and that, importantly, such patterns differ from the ones related to initial shape processing. Furthermore, among the electrocortical indices of action monitoring, only the early observational positivity (oPe) was responsive to the bodily appearance of the observed agent under the specific task requirement to predict the partner movement. Taken together, these findings broaden the understanding of how bodily appearance shapes the spatiotemporal processing of an interactor's movements. This holds particular relevance in our modern society, where human&ndash;artificial (virtual or robotic) agent interactions are rapidly becoming ubiquitous.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-448/v1?src=rss">Parents’ Sharenting Behaviours: A Systematic Review of Motivations, Attitudes, Perceptions, and Impression Management Perspectives [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Sharenting involves parents sharing photos, videos, or other information about their children on their social media profiles via online platforms. Research indicated the rising prevalence of parental sharenting behaviour among various countries. Objective The main aim of this article was to explore the role of motivations, perceptions, attitudes, and impression management on parental sharenting behaviours. Methods A systematic review examined empirical studies published from 2019 to 2024 regarding parental motivations, attitudes, perceptions, and impression management associated with sharenting. Relevant studies were identified via Scopus and manual reference searches, with data extraction concentrating on study characteristics, demographics, objectives, design, and principal findings. Findings Parental sharenting is motivated by intrinsic desires, social validation, and impression management, as parents curate content to improve their social image. While children value favourable representations, many object to sharing without consent. Notwithstanding privacy concerns, parents frequently prioritise advantages, raising ethical enquiries regarding children’s autonomy, privacy, and digital identity in digital self-representation. Conclusion Parental sharenting, motivated by emotional satisfaction, social validation, and impression management, frequently neglects privacy risks and ethical considerations. Such practices may compromise children’s autonomy, privacy, and digital identity, resulting in conflicts with their rights. Children’s varied responses underscore these dilemmas, highlighting the necessity of reconciling parental intentions with safeguarding children’s digital futures and overall well-being. Recommendation Parents should engage in mindful sharenting, policymakers must safeguard children’s digital rights, professionals should enhance awareness, and researchers should investigate methods to reconcile parental desires with children’s welfare.

                Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) is a serious and life-threatening complication defined by excessive immune activation. While it’s commonly associated with rheumatic diseases, infections can also trigger MAS, with tuberculosis being a rare but significant cause. This case report discusses a rare occurrence of Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) caused by multifocal tuberculosis in an immunocompromised patient with Crohn’s disease receiving immunosuppressive treatment. The patient is a 26-year-old woman with Crohn’s disease who is being treated with azathioprine. She arrived at the hospital battling persistent abdominal pain, overwhelming fatigue, and fever. Upon examination, splenomegaly and ascites were noted. A chest X-ray revealed bilateral pleural effusion consistent with tuberculosis. A CT scan confirmed the presence of pleural, pericardial, and intraperitoneal fluid. Blood tests indicated pancytopenia, hyperferritinemia, and hypofibrinogenemia. The analysis of ascitic fluid suggested an exudate. The PCR test of the bone marrow aspirate was positive for tuberculosis without rifampicin resistance, and the smear showed hemophagocytosis images. The patient was diagnosed with Macrophage Activation Syndrome secondary to multifocal tuberculosis. This report delves into the complex relationship between MAS and tuberculosis, emphasizing the challenges in diagnosing MAS in such cases and the potential link to tuberculosis. The complex diagnostic landscape of multifocal tuberculosis, which can often mimic malignancies, underscores the importance of promptly detecting and starting anti-tuberculosis interventions for improved clinical outcomes and the prevention of associated complications.

                Life support robots that can be fully autonomous clothing wear-support robotic identification control systems are challenging. Robotic-assisted dressing solutions have the potential to provide tremendous support to the elderly, patients with mobility impairments, and their caregivers. In this study, we propose an IoT control system that automatically identifies clothing wearing position boundaries and recognizes actual spatial height information using a stereo camera with computer vision. The location information of the clothes boundary was recognized use the semantic segmentation model and machine learning method. Then, using the depth measurement of the stereo camera, the spatial height position of the actual clothing boundary was calculated using the depth information. Finally, the auxiliary position movement control of the clothes-wearing support robot was carried out using the IoT method. We experimentally verified that the recognition control system can successfully achieve the recognition and control of the auxiliary position movement of the device. We performed practical experiments for the evaluation. The recognition accuracy and control accuracy in multiple situations and environmental conditions were 77.35% and 97.21%.

                Background Bioremediation faces several compounds to recover oil spilled ecosystem. The BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene) are toxic hydrocarbons requiring efficient microbial degradation for bioremediation. Pseudomonas aeruginosa can degrade hydrocarbons through emulsification (rhl genes) and tolerance (mla genes). However, genomic organization of these systems in environmental P. aeruginosa strains remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the rhl and mla systems in six strains isolated from hydrocarbon-contaminated sites in Peru. Methods Six Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were evaluated in this study. Each strain were able to degrade hydrocarbon and tolerate heavy metals. DNA extraction, sequencing, and quality-controlled assembly, functional genome annotation was performed using BAKTA. Comparative analysis included high-quality Pseudomonas genomes from RefSeq, with ANI metrics. A phylogenetic tree was built from core gene alignment, revealed evolutionary connections and was visualized with iTOL. Results The assembled genomes ranged from 5.6 to 6.0 Mbp with ~66% GC content. All the strains were confirmed as P. aeruginosa by ANI; placing them within Clade 1 alongside environmental and clinical strains. Pangenome analysis identified 3,544 core genes and a diverse accessory genome. All strains had rhlABRI genes in a conserved 3′-5′ orientation. Most of them contained duplicated rhlB gene, except C1BHIC5 strain. However, rhlG varied in position and orientation, it was often near rhlC, with C1BHIC5 also displaying an exception in rhlG orientation.100% of strains presented mla system, associated with toluene tolerance, with two copies of mlaA, mlaFEDC, and mlaEFD genes arranged with high synteny but variable orientations. In comparison to Pseudomonas putida, where mla genes are positioned between murA and ppcD with an additional toluene tolerance gene (ttg2D). Conclusions In conclusion, the presence of the rhlABC genes and the BTEX tolerance genes in all of the analyzed strains allowed us to understand the great ability of P. aeruginosa to survive in polluted environments.

                <p>by Laetitia Grabot, Garance Merholz, Jonathan Winawer, David J. Heeger, Laura Dugué</p>

Brain oscillations might be traveling waves propagating in cortex. Studying their propagation within single cortical areas has mostly been restricted to invasive measurements. Their investigation in healthy humans, however, requires non-invasive recordings, such as MEG or EEG. Identifying traveling waves with these techniques is challenging because source summation, volume conduction, and low signal-to-noise ratios make it difficult to localize cortical activity from sensor responses. The difficulty is compounded by the lack of a known ground truth in traveling wave experiments. Rather than source-localizing cortical responses from sensor activity, we developed a two-part model-based neuroimaging approach: (1) The putative neural sources of a propagating oscillation were modeled within primary visual cortex (V1) via retinotopic mapping from functional MRI recordings (encoding model); and (2) the modeled sources were projected onto MEG and EEG sensors to predict the resulting signal using a biophysical head model. We tested our model by comparing its predictions against the MEG-EEG signal obtained when participants viewed visual stimuli designed to elicit either fovea-to-periphery or periphery-to-fovea traveling waves or standing waves in V1, in which ground truth cortical waves could be reasonably assumed. Correlations on within-sensor phase and amplitude relations between predicted and measured data revealed good model performance. Crucially, the model predicted sensor data more accurately when the input to the model was a traveling wave going in the stimulus direction compared to when the input was a standing wave, or a traveling wave in a different direction. Furthermore, model accuracy peaked at the spatial and temporal frequency parameters of the visual stimulation. Together, our model successfully recovers traveling wave properties in cortex when they are induced by traveling waves in stimuli. This provides a sound basis for using MEG-EEG to study endogenous traveling waves in cortex and test hypotheses related with their role in cognition.

                <p>by Wasim Abbas, Sieun Lee, Sangil Kim</p>
Background <p>In Korea, Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) is a recurring illness that presents significant public health challenges, primarily because of its unpredictable epidemic patterns. The accurate prediction of the spread of HFMD plays a vital role in the effective management of the disease.</p> Methods <p>We have devised a dynamic model that accurately represents the transmission dynamics of HFMD. The model includes compartments for susceptible, exposed, inpatients, outpatients, recovered, and deceased individuals. By utilizing monthly inpatient and outpatient data, the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) method was employed to perform a joint estimation of model parameters and state variables. The calibration of model parameters involved using data from the months of January to May, while generating forecasts for the timeframe spanning from June to December.</p> Results <p>The findings reveal a significant alignment between the model and the observed data, as evidenced by root-mean-square error (RMSE) values below 1000 for inpatients and below 10000 for outpatients starting in June. The correlation coefficients surpassed 0.9, except for the year 2015. The implications of our findings suggest a notable shift in transmission and recovery rates, starting in 2015.</p> Discussion <p>The model successfully predicted the peak and magnitude of HFMD outbreaks occurring between June and December, closely matching the observed epidemic patterns. The model’s efficacy in predicting epidemic trends and informing preventive strategies is reinforced by the insights gained from monthly variations in parameter estimates of HFMD transmission dynamics.</p>

                <p>by Jiaxin Hu, Jesse N. Weber, Lauren E. Fuess, Natalie C. Steinel, Daniel I. Bolnick, Miaoyan Wang</p>

Studying the mechanisms underlying the genotype-phenotype association is crucial in genetics. Gene expression studies have deepened our understanding of the genotype  →  expression  →  phenotype mechanisms. However, traditional expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) methods often overlook the critical role of gene co-expression networks in translating genotype into phenotype. This gap highlights the need for more powerful statistical methods to analyze genotype  →  network  →  phenotype mechanism. Here, we develop a network-based method, called spectral network quantitative trait loci analysis (snQTL), to map quantitative trait loci affecting gene co-expression networks. Our approach tests the association between genotypes and joint differential networks of gene co-expression via a tensor-based spectral statistics, thereby overcoming the ubiquitous multiple testing challenges in existing methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of snQTL in the analysis of three-spined stickleback (<i>Gasterosteus aculeatus</i>) data. Compared to conventional methods, our method snQTL uncovers chromosomal regions affecting gene co-expression networks, including one strong candidate gene that would have been missed by traditional eQTL analyses. Our framework suggests the limitation of current approaches and offers a powerful network-based tool for functional loci discoveries.

Drug-resistant tuberculosis is a pressing global health issue that requires the development of new drugs or the identification of new therapeutic targets. The ESX-3 secretion system is essential for the <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> growth and plays a role in iron/zinc homeostasis and virulence. The aim of this study was to evaluate the quaternary interface of EccD3, a component of the ESX-3 secretion system, and to evaluate the association of an <i>eccD3</i> mutant with drug resistance. The molecular structures of EccD3 protein and other ESX-3 secretion system proteins of the <i>M. tuberculosis</i> were predicted based in homology with the <i>Mycolicibacterium smegmatis</i> tertiary protein structures. According to the <i>in silico</i> results, selamectin, avermectin, ivermectin, and moxidectin were selected as prospective drugs. Selamectin and moxidectin had favorable ΔG values for the EccB3 and EccD3 dimer interfaces, whereas the ESX-3 Protomer 1 interface had the best ΔG + with avermectin, ivermectin, and moxidectin. Furthermore, ivermectin susceptibility increased when the <i>eccD3</i> gene was inhibited using CRISPRi in <i>M. smegmatis</i>. Blockage of EccD3 increased the ivermectin action, but the modest changes observed may be explained by the compensatory mechanisms or other ivermectin targets in absence of this Esx3 component. Further <i>in vitro</i> and preclinical studies are required to validate our findings.

During fertilization, mammalian sperm undergo a winnowing selection process that reduces the candidate pool of potential fertilizers from ~10<sup>6</sup>-10<sup>11</sup> cells to 10<sup>1</sup>-10<sup>2</sup> cells (depending on the species). Classical sperm competition theory addresses the positive or ‘stabilizing’ selection acting on sperm phenotypes within populations of organisms but does not strictly address the developmental consequences of sperm traits among individual organisms that are under purifying selection during fertilization. It is the latter that is of utmost concern for improving assisted reproductive technologies (ART) because low-fitness sperm may be inadvertently used for fertilization during interventions that rely heavily on artificial sperm selection, such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Importantly, some form of sperm selection is used in nearly all forms of ART (e.g., differential centrifugation, swim-up, or hyaluronan binding assays, etc.). To date, there is no unifying quantitative framework (i.e., theory of sperm selection) that synthesizes causal mechanisms of selection with observed natural variation in individual sperm traits. In this report, we reframe the physiological function of sperm as a collective diffusive search process and develop multi-scale computational models to explore the causal dynamics that constrain sperm fitness during fertilization. Several experimentally useful concepts are developed, including a probabilistic measure of sperm fitness as well as an information theoretic measure of the magnitude of sperm selection, each of which are assessed under systematic increases in microenvironmental selective pressure acting on sperm motility patterns.

Norovirus, the leading cause of gastroenteritis worldwide, is a non-enveloped virus whose tropism is determined in part by the expression patterns of entry receptors. However, the contribution of cellular lipids to viral entry is not well understood. Here, we determined that the asymmetrical distribution of lipids within membrane bilayers is required for murine norovirus (MNV) replication. Specifically, TMEM30a, an essential subunit of lipid flippases, is required for MNV replication in vitro. Disruption of TMEM30a in mouse intestinal epithelial cells prevents persistent, enteric infection by MNV in vivo. Mechanistically, TMEM30a facilitates MNV binding and entry. Surprisingly, exoplasmic phosphatidylserine (PS), a typical marker of dying cells, does not inhibit MNV infection. Rather, TMEM30a maintains a lipid-ordered state that impacts membrane fluidity that is necessary for the low affinity, high avidity binding of MNV to cells. Our data provides a new role for lipid asymmetry in promoting non-enveloped virus infection in vitro and norovirus persistence in vivo.

Stem cells have lower facultative heterochromatin as defined by trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) compared to differentiated cells. However, the mechanisms underlying these differential H3K27me3 levels remain elusive. Because H3K27me3 levels are diluted 2-fold in every round of replication and then restored through the rest of the cell cycle, we reasoned that the cell cycle length could be a key regulator of total H3K27me3 levels. Here, we propose that a short G1 phase restricts H3K27me3 levels in stem cells. To test this model, we determined changes to H3K27me3 levels in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) globally and at specific loci upon G1 phase lengthening – accomplished by thymidine block or growth in the absence of serum (with the “2i medium”). H3K27me3 levels in mESCs increase with G1 arrest when grown in serum and in 2i medium. Additionally, we observed via CUT&RUN and ChIP-seq that regions that gain H3K27me3 in G1 arrest and 2i media overlap, supporting our model of G1 length as a critical regulator of the stem cell epigenome. Furthermore, we demonstrate the inverse effect – that G1 shortening in differentiated human HEK293 cells results in a loss of H3K27me3 levels. Finally, in human tumor cells with extreme H3K27me3 loss, lengthening of the G1 phase leads to H3K27me3 recovery despite the presence of the dominant negative, sub-stoichiometric H3.K27M mutation. Our results indicate that G1 length is an essential determinant of H3K27me3 landscapes across diverse cell types.

Self-initiated behavior is accompanied by the experience of intending our actions. Here, we leverage the unique opportunity to examine the full intentional chain—from intention to action to environmental effects—in a tetraplegic person outfitted with a primary motor cortex (M1) brain–machine interface (BMI) generating real hand movements via neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES). This combined BMI-NMES approach allowed us to selectively manipulate each element of the intentional chain (intention, action, effect) while probing subjective experience and performing extra-cellular recordings in human M1. Behaviorally, we reveal a novel form of intentional binding: motor intentions are reflected in a perceived temporal attraction between the onset of intentions and that of actions. Neurally, we demonstrate that evoked spiking activity in M1 largely coincides in time with the onset of the experience of intention and that M1 spike counts and the onset of subjective intention may co-vary on a trial-by-trial basis. Further, population-level dynamics, as indexed by a decoder instantiating movement, reflect intention-action temporal binding. The results fill a significant knowledge gap by relating human spiking activity in M1 with the onset of subjective intention and complement prior human intracranial work examining pre-motor and parietal areas.

                <p>by Khang Ho, Rasika M. Harshey</p>

Chromosomal organization in <i>Escherichia coli</i> as examined by Hi-C methodology indicates that long-range interactions are sparse. Yet, spatial co-localization or “clustering” of 6/7 ribosomal RNA (<i>rrn</i>) operons distributed over half the 4.6 Mbp genome has been captured by two other methodologies—fluorescence microscopy and Mu transposition. Our current understanding of the mechanism of clustering is limited to mapping essential <i>cis</i> elements. To identify <i>trans</i> elements, we resorted to perturbing the system by chemical and physical means and observed that heat shock disrupts clustering. Levels of σ<sup>H</sup> are known to rise as a cellular response to the shock. We show that elevated expression of σ<sup>H</sup> alone is sufficient to disrupt clustering, independent of heat stress. The anti-clustering activity of σ<sup>H</sup> does not depend on its transcriptional activity but requires core-RNAP interaction and DNA-binding activities. This activity of σ<sup>H</sup> is suppressed by ectopic expression of σ<sup>D</sup> suggesting a competition for core-RNAP. A query of the other five known σ factors of <i>E. coli</i> found that elevated expression of FecI, the ECF σ factor that controls iron citrate transport, also perturbs clustering and is also suppressed by σ<sup>D</sup>. We discuss a possible scenario for how these membrane-associated σ factors participate in clustering of distant <i>rrn</i> loci.

                <p>by Hao Xiao, Wenyuan Chen, Hao Pang, Jing Zheng, Li Wang, Hao Feng, Jingdong Song, Lingpeng Cheng, Hongrong Liu</p>

In the assembly pathway of tailed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) bacteriophages and herpesviruses, a procapsid with a dodecameric portal for DNA delivery at a unique vertex is initially formed. Appropriate procapsid assembly requires the transient presence of multiple copies of a scaffolding protein (SP), which is absent in the mature virion. However, how the SP contributes to dodecameric portal formation, facilitates portal and coat protein incorporation, and is subsequently released remains unclear because of a lack of structural information. Here, we present the structure of the SP–portal complex within the procapsid of bacteriophage P22 at 3–9 Å resolutions. The AlphaFold2-predicted SP model fits well with the density map of the complex. The SP forms trimers and tetramers that interact to yield a dome-like complex on the portal. Two SP domains mediate multimerization. Each trimer interacts with two neighboring portal subunits. The SP has a loop-hook-like structure that aids in coat protein recruitment during viral assembly. The loops of those SP subunits on the portal are positioned in clefts between adjacent portal subunits. Conformational changes in the portal during phage maturation may trigger the disassembly and release of the SP complex. Our findings provide insights into SP-assisted procapsid assembly in bacteriophage P22 and suggest that this strategy is also implemented by other dsDNA viruses, including herpesviruses.

                <p>by Ziwen Huang, Zhenxi Cai, Xin Tao, Xinli Wang, Xiaoxue Tian, Fan Chen, Zhen Li, Anlong Xu, Shaochun Yuan</p>

The discovery of the <i>ProtoRAG</i> transposon in lancelets revealed that V(D)J recombination originates from the <i>Recombination activating gene-like</i> (<i>RAGL</i>) transposon. Analogous to the vertebrate RAG complex, the RAGL transposase nicks host flanking DNA and leads to the formation of hairpin ends. Here, we showed that the Artemis nuclease, which is capable of resolving DNA hairpin ends generated during V(D)J recombination, is also responsible for unraveling <i>ProtoRAG</i>-mediated DNA hairpin ends. Notably, like the <i>RAGL</i> transposon, Artemis originated from the eukaryotic common ancestor. By tracing the evolving function of Artemis from cephalochordates to vertebrates, we revealed the lineage specific allele polymorphism of lancelet <i>Artemis</i> and uncovered an increased activity on hairpin DNA opening in vertebrate Artemis. Additionally, the evolutionarily conserved LYCS motif in Artemis β6, which may be associated with disease, is demonstrated to be crucial for its function. Overall, this study highlights the evolving function of Artemis, identifies novel critical residues, and provides new insights into the evolution of RAG-mediated recombination and the clinical therapy of <i>Artemis</i> deficient disease.

                Background The discoveries of Mulatu’s numbers, better known as Mulatu’s sequence, represent revolutionary contributions to the mathematical world. His best-known work is Mulatu’s sequence, in which each new number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. When various operations and manipulations are performed on the numbers in this sequence, remarkable and intricate patterns begin to emerge. This study aimed to identify novel characterizations of Mulatu’s numbers. Methods This study employed a multi-faceted approach to investigate characterizations of Mulatu’s numbers. Mathematical proof techniques such as principle of mathematical induction, proof by contradiction and direct proof were utilized to substantiate findings. Results In this study, we provided several characterizations of Mulatu’s numbers. We also investigated the properties and patterns of these numbers. Moreover, we have also shown that, similar to Fibonacci’s numbers, Mulatu’s numbers give the so-called golden ratio, which is most applicable in numerical optimization. Furthermore, we formulated a relation among Mulatu’s numbers, Fibonacci numbers, and Lucas numbers. Finally, we provided a generating function for the Mulatu numbers. Conclusions In this study, we uncovered novel characterizations of Mulatu’s numbers and introduced a generating function for them. We investigated relationship between Mulatu’s numbers and the golden ratio. The results discussed offer valuable insights and enhance our understanding of their properties.

                The study aimed at identifying the prevalence of preterm labor and the associated risk factors. Methods A quantitative approach using a retrospective case-control study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Udupi district, Karnataka. The sample consisted of women who delivered in the hospital. Among them, cases (250) were records of women who had delivered before 37 weeks of gestation, and controls (500) were records of women who delivered after 37 weeks 1 of gestation without any complications. Results The study revealed that the prevalence of preterm labor was 356 (14.86%) out of 2402 deliveries. Among these, only 250 were assessed. Preterm labor was significantly correlated with age, place of residence, degree of education, occupation, marital status, gravida, number of deliveries, type of deliveries, gap between births, blood type, and religion. Pregnant women exposed or at risk for preterm labor included those diagnosed with pregnancy-induced hypertension, those who took medication during pregnancy, those with a history of abortion, those engaged in intense physical labor, and those who conceived after the age of 30. Conclusion The prevalence of preterm labor can be minimized if modifiable risk factors are controlled, while non-modifiable risk factors require keen supervision. Health professionals must be alert to all modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors.

                Background Since 1900, the Mediterranean coast has experienced a notable increase in average annual temperatures, rising from 20°C to 24°C.This upward trend in outdoor climate plays a significant role in determining indoor environmental quality (IEQ) particularly in educational buildings. With growing concerns about energy consumption and urban climate change, This paper examines the potential of movable green walls on building facades to improve urban ecosystems. Unlike traditional passive green walls, active green walls offer dynamic aesthetics and provide various benefits, including shading, passive cooling, and opportunities for personal expression in urban environments. The primary aim of this research is to evaluate the shading effectiveness and energy performance of DVGS in hot climates, specifically within educational settings, to enhance their design as an architectural feature. 1 , 2 Methods A comprehensive approach is employed, specifically designed for the local climate of Egypt, utilizing DVGS to achieve comfort in temperatures and natural sunlight while reducing power consumption to enhance energy efficiency & thermal comfort for the occupants. The novelty of this paper lies in its comparative methodology, enhanced by software simulations (DesignBuilder7.0.2.006-Energy Plus plugin),(hyperlink: https://www.openstudio.net) to address design challenges in the existing educational building. Results The paper highlights the benefits of dynamic vertical green systems (DVGS) in educational institutions, revealing a significant reduction in energy efficiency and air quality. Louvers reduced chilling energy usage by 10.95% and heating energy usage by4.8%, while green walls reduced chilling energy and heating energy usage by 19.14% and 12.94% respectively. Louvers also reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 13%, while green walls reduced emissions by 28.43%. The vegetation layer’s thermal properties improved relative humidity by4% and 8%, respectively, in hot arid environments. DVGS installations also reduced electricity costs by 35% and 41.5% during August peak months. Conclusions The implementation of DVGS significantly improves indoor environmental quality by enhancing energy efficiency, thermal comfort and natural daylight.

                Hippocampal place fields emerge during exploration to support navigational learning and memory. The subcellular mechanisms supporting place field formation remain unclear. O’Hare et al. report that distal tuft dendrites are variably recruited during place field formation. The timing and magnitude of their recruitment predict the properties of new hippocampal place fields.

                Fu et al. find that low-dose prexasertib, a CHK1 inhibitor, enhances tumor sensitivity while mitigating on-target toxicity during immunotherapy through mtDNA-mediated STING pathway activation. Mechanistically, prexasertib at therapeutic doses blocks Nek1-mediated phosphorylation of VDAC1 at the threonine 107 residue, showing a phosphorylation-dependent regulatory mechanism of mitochondrial-nuclear crosstalk.

                Chen et al. demonstrate that HAF2 is a histone acetyltransferase that interacts with EIN2-C to regulate H3K14ac and H3K23ac in response to ethylene. HAF2 functions with the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, establishing its role in ethylene-induced chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation.

                Oka et al. show that basal cell carcinoma (BCC) has low immunogenicity due to low HLA-I expression from its inception. Foxc1, a transcription factor associated with BCC cell of origin, inhibits HLA-I expression in BCC cells, which can be reversed by a histone deacetylase inhibitor to enable BCC immunotherapy.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100581">Targeting IRE1α improves insulin sensitivity and thermogenesis and suppresses metabolically active adipose tissue macrophages in male obese mice</a></h4>

              
                Overnutrition engenders the expansion of adipose tissue and the accumulation of immune cells, in particular, macrophages, in the adipose tissue, leading to chronic low-grade inflammation and insulin resistance. In obesity, several proinflammatory subpopulations of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) identified hitherto include the conventional ‘M1-like’ CD11C-expressing ATM and the newly discovered metabolically activated CD9-expressing ATM; however, the relationship among ATM subpopulations is unclear. The ER stress sensor inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) is activated in the adipocytes and immune cells under obesity. It is unknown whether targeting IRE1α is capable of reversing insulin resistance and obesity and modulating the metabolically activated ATMs. We report that pharmacological inhibition of IRE1α RNase significantly ameliorates insulin resistance and glucose intolerance in male mice with diet-induced obesity. IRE1α inhibition also increases thermogenesis and energy expenditure, and hence protects against high fat diet-induced obesity. Our study shows that the ‘M1-like’ CD11c<sup>+</sup> ATMs are largely overlapping with but yet non-identical to CD9<sup>+</sup> ATMs in obese white adipose tissue. Notably, IRE1α inhibition diminishes the accumulation of obesity-induced metabolically activated ATMs and ‘M1-like’ ATMs, resulting in the curtailment of adipose inflammation and ensuing reactivation of thermogenesis, without augmentation of the alternatively activated M2 macrophage population. Our findings suggest the potential of targeting IRE1α for the therapeutic treatment of insulin resistance and obesity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106256">Cholesterol taste avoidance in Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                The question as to whether animals taste cholesterol taste is not resolved. This study investigates whether the fruit fly, <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, is capable of detecting cholesterol through their gustatory system. We found that flies are indifferent to low levels of cholesterol and avoid higher levels. The avoidance is mediated by gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs), demonstrating that flies can taste cholesterol. The cholesterol-responsive GRNs comprise a subset that also responds to bitter substances. Cholesterol detection depends on five ionotropic receptor (IR) family members, and disrupting any of these genes impairs the flies' ability to avoid cholesterol. Ectopic expressions of these IRs in GRNs reveals two classes of cholesterol receptors, each with three shared IRs and one unique subunit. Additionally, expressing cholesterol receptors in sugar-responsive GRNs confers attraction to cholesterol. This study reveals that flies can taste cholesterol, and that the detection depends on IRs in GRNs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106228">Kinetic regulation of kinesin’s two motor domains coordinates its stepping along microtubules</a></h4>

              
                The two identical motor domains (heads) of dimeric kinesin-1 move in a hand-over-hand process along a microtubule, coordinating their ATPase cycles such that each ATP hydrolysis is tightly coupled to a step and enabling the motor to take many steps without dissociating. The neck linker, a structural element that connects the two heads, has been shown to be essential for head–head coordination; however, which kinetic step(s) in the chemomechanical cycle is ‘gated’ by the neck linker remains unresolved. Here, we employed pre-steady-state kinetics and single-molecule assays to investigate how the neck-linker conformation affects kinesin’s motility cycle. We show that the backward-pointing configuration of the neck linker in the front kinesin head confers higher affinity for microtubule, but does not change ATP binding and dissociation rates. In contrast, the forward-pointing configuration of the neck linker in the rear kinesin head decreases the ATP dissociation rate but has little effect on microtubule dissociation. In combination, these conformation-specific effects of the neck linker favor ATP hydrolysis and dissociation of the rear head prior to microtubule detachment of the front head, thereby providing a kinetic explanation for the coordinated walking mechanism of dimeric kinesin.

                Apical constriction is a basic mechanism for epithelial morphogenesis, making columnar cells into wedge shape and bending a flat cell sheet. It has long been thought that an apically localized myosin generates a contractile force and drives the cell deformation. However, when we tested the increased apical surface contractility in a cellular Potts model simulation, the constriction increased pressure inside the cell and pushed its lateral surface outward, making the cells adopt a drop shape instead of the expected wedge shape. To keep the lateral surface straight, we considered an alternative model in which the cell shape was determined by cell membrane elasticity and endocytosis, and the increased pressure is balanced among the cells. The cellular Potts model simulation succeeded in reproducing the apical constriction, and it also suggested that a too strong apical surface tension might prevent the tissue invagination.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101780">A general framework for characterizing optimal communication in brain networks</a></h4>

              
                Efficient communication in brain networks is foundational for cognitive function and behavior. However, how communication efficiency is defined depends on the assumed model of signaling dynamics, e.g., shortest path signaling, random walker navigation, broadcasting, and diffusive processes. Thus, a general and model-agnostic framework for characterizing optimal neural communication is needed. We address this challenge by assigning communication efficiency through a virtual multi-site lesioning regime combined with game theory, applied to large-scale models of human brain dynamics. Our framework quantifies the exact influence each node exerts over every other, generating optimal influence maps given the underlying model of neural dynamics. These descriptions reveal how communication patterns unfold if regions are set to maximize their influence over one another. Comparing these maps with a variety of brain communication models showed that optimal communication closely resembles a broadcasting regime in which regions leverage multiple parallel channels for information dissemination. Moreover, we found that the brain’s most influential regions are its rich-club, exploiting their topological vantage point by broadcasting across numerous pathways that enhance their reach even if the underlying connections are weak. Altogether, our work provides a rigorous and versatile framework for characterizing optimal brain communication, and uncovers the most influential brain regions, and the topological features underlying their influence.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/83865">Modulation of brain signal variability in visual cortex reflects aging, GABA, and behavior</a></h4>

              
                Moment-to-moment neural variability has been shown to scale positively with the complexity of stimulus input. However, the mechanisms underlying the ability to align variability to input complexity are unknown. Using a combination of behavioral methods, computational modeling, fMRI, MR spectroscopy, and pharmacological intervention, we investigated the role of aging and GABA in neural variability during visual processing. We replicated previous findings that participants expressed higher variability when viewing more complex visual stimuli. Additionally, we found that such variability modulation was associated with higher baseline visual GABA levels and was reduced in older adults. When pharmacologically increasing GABA activity, we found that participants with lower baseline GABA levels showed a drug-related increase in variability modulation while participants with higher baseline GABA showed no change or even a reduction, consistent with an inverted-U account. Finally, higher baseline GABA and variability modulation were jointly associated with better visual-discrimination performance. These results suggest that GABA plays an important role in how humans utilize neural variability to adapt to the complexity of the visual world.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94578">Shaping the physical world to our ends through the left PF technical-cognition area</a></h4>

              
                Our propensity to materiality, which consists in using, making, creating, and passing on technologies, has enabled us to shape the physical world according to our ends. To explain this proclivity, scientists have calibrated their lens to either low-level skills such as motor cognition or high-level skills such as language or social cognition. Yet, little has been said about the intermediate-level cognitive processes that are directly involved in mastering this materiality, that is, technical cognition. We aim to focus on this intermediate level for providing new insights into the neurocognitive bases of human materiality. Here, we show that a technical-reasoning process might be specifically at work in physical problem-solving situations. We found via two distinct neuroimaging studies that the area PF (parietal F) within the left parietal lobe is central for this reasoning process in both tool-use and non-tool-use physical problem-solving and can work along with social-cognitive skills to resolve day-to-day interactions that combine social and physical constraints. Our results demonstrate the existence of a specific cognitive module in the human brain dedicated to materiality, which might be the supporting pillar allowing the accumulation of technical knowledge over generations. Intensifying research on technical cognition could nurture a comprehensive framework that has been missing in fields interested in how early and modern humans have been interacting with the physical world through technology, and how this interaction has shaped our history and culture.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93921">Combinatorial CRISPR screen reveals FYN and KDM4 as targets for synergistic drug combination for treating triple negative breast cancer</a></h4>

              
                Tyrosine kinases play a crucial role in cell proliferation and survival and are extensively investigated as targets for cancer treatment. However, the efficacy of most tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in cancer therapy is limited due to resistance. In this study, we identify a synergistic combination therapy involving TKIs for the treatment of triple negative breast cancer. By employing pairwise tyrosine kinase knockout CRISPR screens, we identify <i>FYN</i> and <i>KDM4</i> as critical targets whose inhibition enhances the effectiveness of TKIs, such as NVP-ADW742 (IGF-1R inhibitor), gefitinib (EGFR inhibitor), and imatinib (ABL inhibitor) both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, treatment with TKIs upregulates the transcription of <i>KDM4</i>, which in turn demethylates H3K9me3 at <i>FYN</i> enhancer for <i>FYN</i> transcription. This compensatory activation of <i>FYN</i> and <i>KDM4</i> contributes to the resistance against TKIs. <i>FYN</i> expression is associated with therapy resistance and persistence by demonstrating its upregulation in various experimental models of drug-tolerant persisters and residual disease following targeted therapy, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Collectively, our study provides novel targets and mechanistic insights that can guide the development of effective combinatorial targeted therapies, thus maximizing the therapeutic benefits of TKIs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99258">TRPγ regulates lipid metabolism through Dh44 neuroendocrine cells</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how the brain controls nutrient storage is pivotal. Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are conserved from insects to humans. They serve in detecting environmental shifts and in acting as internal sensors. Previously, we demonstrated the role of TRPγ in nutrient-sensing behavior (Dhakal et al., 2022). Here, we found that a TRPγ mutant exhibited in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> is required for maintaining normal lipid and protein levels. In animals, lipogenesis and lipolysis control lipid levels in response to food availability. Lipids are mostly stored as triacylglycerol in the fat bodies (FBs) of <i>D. melanogaster</i>. Interestingly, <i>trpγ</i> deficient mutants exhibited elevated TAG levels and our genetic data indicated that <i>Dh44</i> neurons are indispensable for normal lipid storage but not protein storage. The <i>trpγ</i> mutants also exhibited reduced starvation resistance, which was attributed to insufficient lipolysis in the FBs. This could be mitigated by administering lipase or metformin orally, indicating a potential treatment pathway. Gene expression analysis indicated that <i>trpγ</i> knockout downregulated <i>brummer</i>, a key lipolytic gene, resulting in chronic lipolytic deficits in the gut and other fat tissues. The study also highlighted the role of specific proteins, including neuropeptide DH44 and its receptor DH44R2 in lipid regulation. Our findings provide insight into the broader question of how the brain and gut regulate nutrient storage.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102166">Social and environmental predictors of gut microbiome age in wild baboons</a></h4>

              
                Mammalian gut microbiomes are highly dynamic communities that shape and are shaped by host aging, including age-related changes to host immunity, metabolism, and behavior. As such, gut microbial composition may provide valuable information on host biological age. Here, we test this idea by creating a microbiome-based age predictor using 13,563 gut microbial profiles from 479 wild baboons collected over 14 years. The resulting ‘microbiome clock’ predicts host chronological age. Deviations from the clock’s predictions are linked to some demographic and socio-environmental factors that predict baboon health and survival: animals who appear old-for-age tend to be male, sampled in the dry season (for females), and have high social status (both sexes). However, an individual’s ‘microbiome age’ does not predict the attainment of developmental milestones or lifespan. Hence, in our host population, gut microbiome age largely reflects current, as opposed to past, social and environmental conditions, and does not predict the pace of host development or host mortality risk. We add to a growing understanding of how age is reflected in different host phenotypes and what forces modify biological age in primates.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102542">Still waters run deep in large-scale genome rearrangements of morphologically conservative Polyplacophora</a></h4>

              
                A major question in animal evolution is how genotypic and phenotypic changes are related, and another is when and whether ancient gene order is conserved in living clades. Chitons, the molluscan class Polyplacophora, retain a body plan and general morphology apparently little changed since the Palaeozoic. We present a comparative analysis of five reference quality genomes, including four de novo assemblies, covering all major chiton clades, and an updated phylogeny for the phylum. We constructed 20 ancient molluscan linkage groups (MLGs) and show that these are relatively conserved in bivalve karyotypes, but in chitons they are subject to re-ordering, rearrangement, fusion, or partial duplication and vary even between congeneric species. The largest number of novel fusions is in the most plesiomorphic clade Lepidopleurida, and the chitonid <i>Liolophura japonica</i> has a partial genome duplication, extending the occurrence of large-scale gene duplication within Mollusca. The extreme and dynamic genome rearrangements in this class stands in contrast to most other animals, demonstrating that chitons have overcome evolutionary constraints acting on other animal groups. The apparently conservative phenome of chitons belies rapid and extensive changes in genome.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104764">Cell type-specific driver lines targeting the Drosophila central complex and their use to investigate neuropeptide expression and sleep regulation</a></h4>

              
                The central complex (CX) plays a key role in many higher-order functions of the insect brain including navigation and activity regulation. Genetic tools for manipulating individual cell types, and knowledge of what neurotransmitters and neuromodulators they express, will be required to gain mechanistic understanding of how these functions are implemented. We generated and characterized split-GAL4 driver lines that express in individual or small subsets of about half of CX cell types. We surveyed neuropeptide and neuropeptide receptor expression in the central brain using fluorescent in situ hybridization. About half of the neuropeptides we examined were expressed in only a few cells, while the rest were expressed in dozens to hundreds of cells. Neuropeptide receptors were expressed more broadly and at lower levels. Using our GAL4 drivers to mark individual cell types, we found that 51 of the 85 CX cell types we examined expressed at least one neuropeptide and 21 expressed multiple neuropeptides. Surprisingly, all co-expressed a small molecule neurotransmitter. Finally, we used our driver lines to identify CX cell types whose activation affects sleep, and identified other central brain cell types that link the circadian clock to the CX. The well-characterized genetic tools and information on neuropeptide and neurotransmitter expression we provide should enhance studies of the CX.

">Loss of MeCP2 leads to sleep deficits that are time-of-day dependent and worsen with sleep deprivation</a></h4>

              
                Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe, progressive neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the X-linked gene encoding methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2). Sleep problems are frequently reported in Rett Syndrome, but the exact nature remains relatively unexplored. Currently there is limited understanding the role of MECP2 in sleep architecture and regulation. In this study, we employed longitudinal electroencephalographic (EEG) and electromyographic (EMG) recordings to investigate sleep architecture during baseline conditions as well as the homeostatic response to sleep deprivation (SD) in Mecp2-/y male mice. At baseline, Mecp2-/y mice have more non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep and less rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep than their wildtype littermates during the light period. However, Mecp2-/y mice display altered sleep timing during the dark period, spending more time in both NREM and REM during the first half and less time during the second half. We also observe differences in REM sleep and wake quality based on spectral properties of the EEG. In response to SD, Mecp2-/y mice can accumulate and discharge sleep pressure normally and show a sleep rebound. However, baseline differences in sleep architecture are heightened after SD. Overall, our findings show that RTT mice exhibit distinct sleep patterns compared to wildtype mice, with time-of-day-dependent variations in NREM and REM sleep, as well as altered EEG spectral properties, that become more pronounced following SD. Future research should explore the molecular mechanisms through which MECP2 regulates circadian sleep architecture to develop targeted therapeutics for sleep disturbances in RTT patients.

">Transcriptional and neuroprotective effects of hexokinase-2 inhibitors administered afterstroke</a></h4>

              
                The inflammatory response induced by stroke can exacerbate injury to peri-infarct tissue. Microglia and other immune cells that mediate this response require increased glycolytic flux during pro-inflammatory activation. These cells, unlike neurons and most other cell types, utilize hexokinase-2 (HK2) rather than hexokinase-1 for glycolysis, such that HK2 inhibitors may selectively target them to suppress post-ischemic inflammation. Here we compared the effects of the non-selective hexokinase inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose to the HK2-selective inhibitors lonidamine and 3-bromopyruvate on secondary injury after stroke. A spatial transcriptomic assessment was performed in parallel to compare effects of the inhibitors on microglial gene expression and microglia - neuron interactions and to screen for off-target effects. Each of the inhibitors suppressed pro-inflammatory gene upregulation in peri-infarct microglia and attenuated the upregulation of cell stress functional pathways in the neighboring neurons, but had minimal effect on neuronal gene expression in uninjured cortex. The HK2-selective inhibitors were more effective than 2-deoxyglucose in suppressing morphological microglial changes, neuronal oxidative stress, and neurite loss. 3-bromopyruvate administered after stroke produced long-term improvements in functional outcome. Selective HK2 inhibitors may thus provide a clinically applicable means to suppress microglial activation and thereby improve outcomes after stroke without endangering neuronal energy metabolism.

">Initial signs of learning: Decoding newly-learned vocabulary from neural patterns in novice sign language learners</a></h4>

              
                Learning a new language requires the brain to map new perceptual cues onto real-world semantic concepts. Studies of semantic processing suggest that these representations are at least partially language-independent: despite differing low-level perceptual features, homologous words can evoke overlapping neural patterns associated with a shared underlying meaning. A few studies have leveraged this relationship to examine the emergence of knowledge in the brains of novice learners, but so far all have focused on learners of spoken languages. Evidence from bimodal (sign and speech) bilinguals suggests that neural representations of signs and spoken words may be language-dependent on the individual item level but share representations of broad semantic features. However this remains to be tested in novice signers, who may rely more on their established spoken language representations. We present two experiments in which hearing English speakers underwent brief training in American Sign Language (ASL). In Study 1, participants were all trained to ceiling on a set of signs, while in Study 2 the task difficulty was increased to produce individual differences in performance. Using representational similarity analysis (RSA) with fMRI, we identify brain regions where neural patterns reflect semantic relationships between nouns in both languages. Moreover, in Study 2 participants, we show that multivariate neural measures of semantic representation of ASL in several frontal, temporal, and occipital regions reflect individual differences in comprehension. These results suggest that in contrast to prior work in bilinguals, novice signers show semantic representation at the item level in partially overlapping regions, and the degree of multivariate correlation can track individual-level shifts in understanding in the earliest stages of sign language learning.

">Protective effects of central leptin on whole-body energy homeostasis upon acute olanzapine exposure</a></h4>

              
                Second-generation antipsychotic use is associated with severe metabolic side effects such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Leptin is a hormone that is secreted by adipose tissue, and it acts on the brain to decrease body weight by reducing food intake and stimulating energy expenditure. Leptin also improves glucose and lipid metabolism. We examined the short-term impact of olanzapine, a commonly used second-generation antipsychotic, on the central leptin-mediated regulation of energy balance, lipid metabolism, and hypothalamic kinase activity. Male Sprague Dawley rats were given an acute intracerebroventricular (ICV, 3rd ventricle) injection of either leptin or vehicle, combined with subcutaneous olanzapine or vehicle. As expected, ICV leptin decreased food intake and, importantly, olanzapine did not block this effect. Administration of leptin, olanzapine, or their combination reduced the average respiratory exchange ratio (RER) during the light cycle, which indicates that fat oxidation was increased. In the dark cycle, leptin decreased the average RER regardless of olanzapine administration, and in the presence of leptin, olanzapine did not affect the average RER. Leptin did not alter the olanzapine-induced increase in serum triglyceride concentrations. Olanzapine and central leptin treatment differentially activated hypothalamic kinases. In conclusion, regulation of food intake and fuel preference by central leptin is intact following acute olanzapine administration.

">Targeted gene transfer into developmentally defined cell populations of the primate brain</a></h4>

              
                The primate brain possesses unique physiological and developmental features whose systematic investigation is hampered by a paucity of transgenic germline models and tools. Here, we present a minimally invasive method to introduce transgenes widely across the primate cerebral cortex using ultrasound-guided fetal intracerebroventricular viral injections (FIVI). This technique enables rapid-onset and long-lasting transgene expression following the delivery of recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs). By adjusting the gestational timing of injections, viral serotypes, and transcriptional regulatory elements, rAAV FIVI allows for systematic targeting of specific cell populations. We demonstrate the versatility of this method through restricted laminar expression in the cortex, Cre-dependent targeting of neurons, CRISPR-based gene editing, and labeling of peripheral somatosensory and retinal pathways. By mimicking key desirable features of germline transgenic models, this efficient and targeted method for gene transfer into the fetal primate brain opens new avenues for experimental and translational neuroscience across the lifespan.

">A test of long-term and dose-dependent effects of fluoxetine exposure on the velocity of the invasive crayfish Procambarus clarkii</a></h4>

              
                Fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), is one of the most detected antidepressants in wastewater, managing to enter watersheds where it is taken up by freshwater fauna. Here we asked if the serotonergic system affects the dispersal capabilities of Procambarus clarkii, a prolific worldwide invasive freshwater crayfish species, thanks in part due to its dispersal rates. For this, we exposed adult crayfish to fluoxetine (serotonin facilitator) and para-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA, serotonin inhibitor) at two concentrations, and measured their velocity after 8 and 16 days, on a two-meter-long metal gutter. Overall, our treatment effects revealed to be non-significant, however the lowest dosage of fluoxetine seem to decrease crayfish mean velocity between the 8th and 16th day of exposure, thus shedding some light on the putative importance of the long-term exposure to environment dosage-dependent fluoxetine in modulating the dispersal capabilities of P. clarkii. Though further research is needed, these results can help us better understand the impact of ambient fluoxetine to this invasive species.

">Validation and pre-analytical considerations for processing cerebrospinal fluid samples on a high-throughput proximity extension assay platform</a></h4>

              
                Background: Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) facilitates the understanding of brain-specific molecular changes that may associate with disease progression. Proximity extension assays (PEA) have been deployed in several CSF studies, however the validation of the assay and impact of freeze-thaw cycles on the protein signal has not been documented. We sought to (1) validate the assay on the PEA platform and (2) evaluate the effect of freeze-thaw cycles on the detectability of analytes on the PEA platform. Results: We have validated the PEA with Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) readout assay and report on the detectability and coefficient of variation observed in CSF samples. We have also evaluated proteomic signals with a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 9 freeze thaw cycles and detected very minimal change in signal with increasing cycle number. Conclusion: Our study is the first to validate PEA using NGS readout platform with CSF samples. We report lower protein detection rates and higher variability in the expansion panels compared to the original 4 panels, with acceptable variation above detectability threshold. In addition, our work demonstrates that the proteomic signal is robust and continues to be stable across multiple freeze thaw cycles. This is highly impactful to the processing and analysis of clinical samples and facilitates the investigation of samples with variable pre-analytical conditions.

">Intrinsic and circuit mechanisms of predictive coding in a grid cell network model</a></h4>

              
                Grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) fire when an animal is located at the vertices of a hexagonal grid that extends across the environment. The population activity of grid cells serves as an allocentric representation of the current location of the animal. Recent studies have identified a class of grid cells that represent locations ahead of the animal. How do these predictive representations emerge from the wetware of the MEC? To address this question, we developed a detailed conductance- based model of the MEC network, constrained by existing data on the biophysical properties of stellate cells and the topology of the MEC network. Our model revealed two mechanisms underlying the emergence of a predictive code in the MEC. The first relied on a time scale associated with the HCN conductance. The other depended on the degree of asymmetry in the topology of the MEC network. The former mechanism was sufficient to explain predictive coding in layer II grid cells that represented locations shifted ahead of the current location. The shift was equivalent to [~]5% of the diameter of a grid field. The latter mechanism was required to model predictive representations in layer III grid cells that were shifted forward by a distance of [~]25% of the diameter of a grid field. A corollary of our model, that the extent of the predictive code changes monotonically along the dorsoventral axis of the MEC following observed changes in the properties of the HCN conductance, is borne out by recent experiments.

">Weakened prefrontal activation dynamics associated with slowed information processing speed in multiple sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                Information processing speed (IPS) is a core cognitive deficit in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). Previous efforts have associated IPS performance to frontal regions, but were constrained by limited temporal resolution. In this work, we employed a data-driven method, the time delay embedded-hidden Markov model (TDE-HMM), to identify task-specific states that are spectrally defined with distinct temporal and spatial profiles. We used magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data recorded while healthy controls and PwMS performed a cognitive task designed to capture IPS, the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT). The TDE-HMM identified five task-relevant states, supporting a tri-factor contribution to IPS: sensory speed (occipital visual detection and processing), cognitive speed (prefrontal executive and frontoparietal attention shift), and motor speed (sensorimotor). We observed reduced prefrontal and increased frontoparietal activation in PwMS, which correlated with offline SDMT performance. This work can drive future research for MS treatments targeting IPS improvements.

">Impairment of the blood brain barrier accelerates a negative ultraslow potential in the locust CNS</a></h4>

              
                Insects provide useful models for investigating evolutionarily conserved mechanisms underlying electrical events associated with brain injury and death. Spreading depolarizations (SD) are transient events that propagate through neuropil whereas the negative ultraslow potential (NUP) is sustained and reflects accumulating damage in the tissue. We used the locust, Locusta migratoria, to investigate ion homeostasis at the blood brain barrier (BBB) during SD and NUP induced by treatment with the Na+/K+-ATPase inhibitor, ouabain. We found that sustained SD caused by the metabolic inhibitor, sodium azide, was associated with a large reduction of K+ efflux through the BBB at ganglia (= grey matter) but not at connectives (= white matter). This was accompanied by a large increase in tissue resistivity but no conductance changes of identified motoneuron dendrites in the neuropil. Males recovered more slowly from ouabain-induced SD, as previously described for anoxic SD. Impairment of barrier functions of the BBB pharmacologically with cyclosporin A or DIDS, or by cutting nerve roots, accelerated the NUP, thus promoting earlier and more frequent SD, but had no effect on the temporal parameters of SD. We conclude that the mechanisms underlying onset and recovery of SD are minimally affected by the damage associated with the NUP. We suggest that future research using tissue-specific genetic approaches in Drosophila to target identified molecular structures of the BBB are likely to be fruitful.

">Alzheimer's disease and its co-pathologies: implications for hippocampal degeneration, cognitive decline, and the role of APOE ϵ4</a></h4>

              
                INTRODUCTION: In neurodegenerative dementias, the co-occurrence and interaction of A{beta}, tau, and other pathological lesions confound their individual contributions to neurodegeneration and their modulation by risk factors. METHODS: We analyzed 480 post-mortem human brains (ages 50-99) using regression and structural equation models to assess the relationships among A{beta}, tau, LATE-NC, -synuclein, other age-related lesions, and APOE {epsilon}4, as well as their effects on CA1 neuronal density, brain weight, and cognitive status. RESULTS: A{beta}, tau, LATE-NC, and amygdala-predominant -synuclein pathology were highly interconnected. Tau was the strongest predictor of global neurodegeneration, while LATE-NC primarily, but not exclusively, affected hippocampal neuron loss. Small vessel disease correlated with both LATE-NC and -synuclein, while APOE {epsilon}4 was mainly associated with extracellular and capillary A{beta}. DISCUSSION: Although Alzheimer's pathology plays a central role in brain degeneration, coexisting pathologies can both exacerbate and independently contribute to it. These factors should be considered in patient stratification.

">Brain precapillary sphincters modulate myogenic tone in adult and aged mice</a></h4>

              
                Brain precapillary sphincters, which are surrounded by contractile pericytes and are located at the junction of penetrating arterioles and first-order capillaries, can increase their diameter by ~30% in a few seconds during sensory stimulation, allowing for rapid control of capillary blood flow over a wide dynamic range. We hypothesized that these properties could help precapillary sphincters maintain the capillary blood flow and shield the downstream capillaries during surges in blood pressure. To test this, we visualized microvessels in adult and old anaesthetized mice using in vivo two-photon microscopy. We showed that a blood pressure surge disrupts both microvascular myogenic response and neurovascular coupling in both adult and old mice, with old mice exhibiting a more diminished myogenic response. Similarly, laser ablation of contractile pericytes encircling precapillary sphincters disrupted neurovascular coupling and myogenic response. The resistance provided by precapillary sphincters may be increasingly important in old mice, where we found changes in the topology of microvessels, potentially affecting microvascular blood flow. Old mice displayed more tortuous penetrating arterioles, reduced pial collateral arteriolar density and altered capillary densities: reduced in the arterial end and increased in the venous end. Our results illustrate how blood pressure surges affect brain microvascular function, underscore the protective role of precapillary sphincters during cerebrovascular autoregulation in response to blood pressure surges and compare vascular topology in adult and old mice in vivo.

">Anti-Aβ immunotherapy-mediated amyloid clearance attenuates microglial activation without inducing exhaustion at residual plaques</a></h4>

              
                Anti-amyloid {beta}-peptide (A{beta}) immunotherapy was developed to reduce amyloid plaque pathology and slow cognitive decline during progression of Alzheimer's disease. Efficient amyloid plaque clearance has been proven in clinical trials testing anti-A{beta} antibodies, with the impact on cognitive endpoints correlating with the extent of plaque removal. However, treatment is associated with adverse side-effects, such as oedema and haemorrhages, which are potentially linked to the induced immune response. To improve the safety profile of these molecules, it is imperative to understand the consequences of anti-A{beta} antibody treatment on immune cell function. Here, we investigated the effects of long-term chronic anti-A{beta} treatment on amyloid plaque pathology and microglial response in the APP-SAA triple knock-in mouse model. Mice were treated weekly with anti-A{beta} antibody from 4-8 months of age. Long-term treatment with anti-A{beta} results in a robust and dose-dependent removal of amyloid plaque pathology, with a higher efficiency for removing diffuse over dense-core plaques. Analysis of the CSF proteome indicates a reduction of markers for neurodegeneration including Tau and -Synuclein, as well as immune cell related proteins. Bulk RNA-seq revealed a dose-dependent decrease in brain-wide disease-associated microglial (DAM) and glycolytic gene expression, which is supported by a parallel decrease of glucose uptake and protein levels of Triggering receptor of myeloid cells 2 (Trem2) protein, a major immune receptor involved in DAM activation of microglia. In contrast, DAM activation around remaining plaques remains high regardless of treatment dose. In addition, microglia surrounding remaining plaques display a dose-dependent increase in microglial clustering and a selective increase in antigen presenting and immune signalling proteins. These findings demonstrate that long-term chronic anti-A{beta}-mediated removal of A{beta} leads to a dose dependent decrease in brain-wide microglial DAM activation and neurodegeneration, while microglia at residual plaques display a combined DAM and antigen presenting phenotype that suggests a continued treatment response.

">Optimal inter-electrode distances for maximizing single unit yield per electrode in neural recordings</a></h4>

              
                State-of-the-art high-density multielectrode arrays enable the recording of simultaneous spiking activity from hundreds of neurons. Although significant efforts have been dedicated to enhancing neural recording devices and developing more efficient sorting algorithms, there has been relatively less focus on the allocation of microelectrodes - a factor that undeniably affects spike sorting effectiveness and ultimately the total number of detected neurons. Here, we systematically examined the relationship between optimal electrode spacing and spike sorting efficiency by creating virtual sparser layouts from high-density recordings through spatial downsampling. We assessed spike sorting performance by comparing the quantity of well-isolated single units per electrode in sparse configurations across various brain regions (neocortex and thalamus) and species (rat, mouse, and human). Enabling the theoretical estimation of optimal electrode arrangements, we complement experimental results with a geometrical modeling framework. Contrary to the general assumption that higher electrode density inherently leads to more efficient sorting, both our theoretical and experimental results reveal a clear optimum for electrode spacing specific to species and regions. We demonstrate that carefully choosing optimal electrode distances could yield a total of 1.7 to 3 times increase in spike sorting efficiency. These findings emphasize the necessity of species- and region-specific microelectrode design optimization.

">Abnormal Tau Protein Influences Intercellular Mitochondrial Transfer Between Astrocytic and Neuronal Cells</a></h4>

              
                Tauopathies are a group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the pathological accumulation of abnormal tau protein. A consequence of tau pathologies is mitochondrial dysfunctions, which affect essential processes such as mitochondrial transport, bioenergetics, and dynamics. Given the high energy demands of neurons, tau-induced mitochondrial impairment significantly contributes to neuronal vulnerability and degeneration. Recent studies have revealed that cells can transfer mitochondria between them to help energy-deficient cells. This process, known as intercellular mitochondrial transfer, occurs through two different pathways: an indirect transfer via extracellular vesicles and a direct transfer via tunneling nanotubes and gap junctions. Given the known impact of abnormal tau protein on mitochondrial transport and actin filament dynamics, we hypothesized that intercellular mitochondrial transfer could be altered in the context of tauopathies. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate mitochondrial transfer between astrocytic and neuronal cells and assess how abnormal tau protein may influence this process. Our results showed that abnormal tau protein enhances mitochondrial transfer from astrocytic to neuronal cells. Notably, this transfer occurs mainly via contact-dependent mechanisms. In both pathological and healthy conditions, the transferred astrocytic mitochondria either fused with the mitochondrial network of recipient cells or were degraded in the lysosomes or remained isolated in the cytosol. Our data highlight a novel pathway by which abnormal tau protein impacts mitochondrial function, namely the transfer of astrocytic mitochondria to neuronal cells.

                <p>Memory retrieval activates regions across the brain, including not only the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe (MTL), but also frontal, parietal, and lateral temporal cortical regions. What remains unclear, however, is how these regions communicate to organize retrieval-specific processing. Here, we elucidate the role of theta (3&ndash;8 Hz) synchronization, broadly implicated in memory function, during the spontaneous retrieval of episodic memories. Analyzing a dataset of 382 neurosurgical patients (213 males, 168 females, and 1 unknown) implanted with intracranial electrodes who completed a free-recall task, we find that synchronous networks of theta phase synchrony span the brain in the moments before spontaneous recall, in comparison to periods of deliberation and incorrect recalls. Hubs of the retrieval network, which systematically synchronize with other regions, appear throughout the prefrontal cortex and lateral and medial temporal lobes, as well as other areas. Theta synchrony increases appear more prominently for slow (3 Hz) theta than for fast (8 Hz) theta in the recall&ndash;deliberation contrast, but not in the encoding or recall&ndash;intrusion contrasts, and theta power and synchrony correlate positively throughout the theta band. These results implicate diffuse brain-wide synchronization of theta rhythms, especially slow theta, in episodic memory retrieval.</p>

                <p>Dopaminergic subpopulations of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) differentially degenerate in Parkinson's disease and are characterized by unique electrophysiological properties. The vulnerable population expresses a T-type calcium channel-mediated afterdepolarization (ADP) and shows rebound activity upon release from inhibition, whereas the resilient population does not have an ADP and is slower to fire after hyperpolarization. This rebound activity can trigger dopamine release in the striatum, an important component of basal ganglia function. Using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology on ex vivo slices from adult mice of both sexes, we find that muscarinic activation with the nonselective muscarinic agonist oxotremorine inhibits rebound activity more strongly in vulnerable versus resilient SNc neurons. Here, we show that this effect depends on the direct activation of muscarinic receptors on the SNc dopaminergic neurons. Through a series of pharmacological and transgenic knock-out experiments, we tested whether the muscarinic inhibition of rebound was mediated through the canonical rebound-related ion channels: T-type calcium channels, hyperpolarization-activated cation channels (HCN), and A-type potassium channels. We find that muscarinic receptor activation inhibits HCN-mediated current (<I>I</I><SUB>h</SUB>) in vulnerable SNc neurons but that <I>I</I><SUB>h</SUB> activity is not necessary for the muscarinic inhibition of rebound activity. Similarly, we find that oxotremorine inhibits rebound activity independently of T-type calcium channels and A-type potassium channels. Together these findings reveal new principles governing acetylcholine and dopamine interactions, showing that muscarinic receptors directly affect SNc rebound activity in the midbrain at the somatodendritic level and differentially modify information processing in distinct SNc subpopulations.</p>

                <p>Genetic disorders such as neurofibromatosis type 1 (Nf1) increase vulnerability to cognitive and behavioral disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Nf1 results from mutations in the neurofibromin gene that can reduce levels of the neurofibromin protein. While the mechanisms have yet to be fully elucidated, loss of Nf1 may alter neuronal circuit activity leading to changes in behavior and susceptibility to cognitive and behavioral comorbidities. Here we show that mutations decreasing Nf1 expression alter motor behaviors, impacting the patterning, prioritization, and behavioral state dependence in a <I>Drosophila</I> model of Nf1. Loss of Nf1 increased spontaneous grooming in male and female flies. This followed a nonlinear spatial pattern, with Nf1 deficiency increasing grooming of certain body parts differentially, including the abdomen, head, and wings. The increase in grooming could be overridden by hunger in foraging animals, demonstrating that the Nf1 effect is plastic and internal state dependent. Stimulus-evoked grooming patterns were altered as well, suggesting that hierarchical recruitment of grooming command circuits was altered. Yet loss of Nf1 in sensory neurons and/or grooming command neurons did not alter grooming frequency, suggesting that Nf1 affects grooming via higher-order circuit alterations. Changes in grooming coincided with alterations in walking. Flies lacking Nf1 walked with increased forward velocity on a spherical treadmill, yet there was no detectable change in leg kinematics or gait. These results demonstrate that loss of Nf1 alters the patterning and prioritization of repetitive behaviors, in a state-dependent manner, without affecting low-level motor functions.</p>

                <p>It is recently shown that objects with long-term reward associations can be efficiently located during visual search. The neural mechanism for valuable object pop-out is unknown. In this work, we recorded neuronal responses in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) with known roles in visual search and reward processing in macaques while monkeys engaged in efficient versus inefficient visual search for high-value fractal objects (targets). Behavioral results and modeling using multialternative attention-modulated drift&ndash;diffusion indicated that efficient search was concurrent with enhanced processing for peripheral objects. Notably, neural results showed response amplification and receptive field widening to peripherally presented targets in vlPFC during visual search. Both neural effects predict higher target detection and were found to be correlated with it. Our results suggest that value-driven efficient search independent of low-level visual features arises from reward-induced spatial processing enhancement of peripheral valuable objects.</p>

Here, we demonstrate how exosomes can also shield against TauO toxicity in adult mice synapses, potentially benefiting primary and secondary tauopathies. Exosomes from hippocampal NSCs (NSCexo) or mature neurons (MNexo) were delivered intracerebroventricularly to adult wild-type male mice (C57Bl6/J). After 24&nbsp;h, TauO were administered to suppress long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory, measured by electrophysiology and contextual memory deficits measured using novel object recognition test. We also assessed TauO binding to synapses using isolated synaptosomes and cultured hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, mimics of select miRNAs present in NSCexo were delivered intracerebroventricularly to mice prior to assessment of TauO-induced suppression of hippocampal LTP. Our results showed that NSC-, not MN-, derived exosomes, prevented TauO-induced memory impairment, LTP suppression, and reduced Tau accumulation and TauO internalization in synaptosomes. These findings suggest that NSC-derived exosomes can protect against synaptic dysfunction and memory deficits induced by both A&beta;O and TauO, offering a novel therapeutic strategy for multiple neurodegenerative states.</p>

                <p>Effective stress management is crucial for optimal competition performance in athletes. Sleep deprivation (SD) can elevate physiological and psychological stress, and the SD-changed cognitive and emotion may reflect stress management capability and hold the predictive possibility for athletes&rsquo; performance in official competitions over some time; however, it lacks evidence. Here, we aim to increase stress level for athletes by 24&nbsp;h SD and identify the predictive effects of cognitive and emotional changes after 24&nbsp;h SD on sports performance in official competitions over ~1.5 months. Sixty-five winter sports athletes (35 males) were recruited from college (test set) and professional athletes (validation set) separately. The anxiety and cortisol levels were assessed at baseline, after 24&nbsp;h SD, and official competition. Athletes underwent cognitive tasks (Stroop, Go/No-Go, Competitive Reaction Time Task, and Iowa Gambling Task) and the event-related potential recording at baseline and after SD. Competition performance levels (supernormal, normal, and abnormal) were categorized based on a consensus of subjective and objective evaluations. We found anxiety and cortisol levels following 24&nbsp;h SD were equaled with those observed in official competition. Notably, only the decreased incongruent Stroop response after 24&nbsp;h SD was negatively associated with performance in official competition. The corresponding P3 component, particularly the delta frequency at the central lobe, largely mediated this effect. These findings highlight that athletes who effectively employ cognitive skills to manage stress under acute SD tend to exhibit superior performance.</p>

                <p>Previous work has implicated the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in the regulation of effort, defined as the amount of work an animal is willing to perform for a given reward, but little is known about the specific contributions of neuronal populations within the NAc to effort regulation. In this study, using male and female mice, we examined the contributions of direct pathway and indirect pathway neurons in the NAc core using an operant effort regulation task, in which the effort requirement is the number of lever presses needed for earning a food reward. Using optogenetics, we manipulated the activity of direct pathway spiny projection neurons (SPNs; dopamine D1-like, D1+) and indirect pathway SPNs (iSPNs; adenosine 2A receptor, A2A+). Activating dSPNs reduced lever pressing regardless of the effort requirement, as it elicited gnawing, a competing consummatory behavior. On the other hand, activating iSPNs in the NAc core (but not in the shell) reduced lever pressing in an effort-dependent manner: stimulation-induced reduction in performance was greater at higher press-to-reward ratio requirements. In contrast, optogenetically inhibiting NAc core iSPN output resulted in increased levels of effort exertion. Our results show that the indirect pathway output from the NAc core can bidirectionally regulate effort exertion.</p>

                <p>There is a high rate of comorbidity between binge eating (BE) and binge drinking (BD) behaviors, suggesting a common neuropathology. Recently, <I>phosphodiesterase 4B</I> (<I>PDE4B</I>) was identified as a pleiotropic gene associated with comorbid alcohol use disorder (AUD) and anorexia nervosa with BE in a genome-wide association study, implicating <I>PDE4B</I> as a potential contributor to shared genetic risk between these disorders. Here, we developed a novel mouse model of comorbid BE and BD in C57BL/6NJ mice in which mice underwent 10&nbsp;d of BE, followed by 10&nbsp;d of BD. Females exhibited cross-sensitization from BE to BD, which was apparent on the first day of ethanol access, whereas cross-sensitization emerged in males over multiple trials of BD. Accordingly immunoblotting of the nucleus accumbens tissue indicated a female-selective increase in PDE4B protein expression that was apparent on both the first and last day of BD in mice with a prior BE history. Acute pretreatment with the selective PDE4B inhibitor A33 (1.0&nbsp;mg/kg) reduced the expression of cross-sensitization to BD in females on Day 1, and this effect was maintained during a 5&nbsp;d A33 treatment regimen. The 5&nbsp;d A33 treatment regimen also reduced expression of cross-sensitization to BD that had emerged in males over repeated sessions. These results provide preclinical, functional validation of PDE4B as a driver of food&ndash;ethanol cross-sensitization in a novel model for BE and BD comorbidity and support PDE4B in the shared genetic risk for these behavioral pathologies and as a target for pharmacotherapeutic intervention in comorbid AUD and BE behaviors.</p>

                <p>Visual information can have different meanings across species, and the same visual stimulus can drive appetitive or aversive behavior. The superior colliculus (SC), a visual center located in the midbrain has been involved in driving such behaviors. Within this structure, the wide-field vertical cells (WFV) are a conserved morphological cell type that is present in species ranging from reptiles to cats (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B2">Basso et al., 2021</cross-ref>). Here, we report our investigation of the connectivity of the WFV, their visual responses, and how these responses are modulated by locomotion in male and female laboratory mice. We also address the molecular definition of these cells and attempt to reconcile recent findings acquired by RNA sequencing of single cells in the SC with the Ntsr1-Cre GN209 transgenic mouse line which was previously used to investigate WFV. We use viral strategies to reveal WFV inputs and outputs and confirm their unique response properties using in vivo two-photon imaging. Among the stimuli tested, WFV prefer looming stimuli, a small moving spot, and upward-moving visual stimuli. We find that only visual responses driven by a looming stimulus show a significant modulation by locomotion. We identify several inputs to the WFV as potential candidates for this modulation. These results suggest that WFV integrate information across multiple brain regions and are subject to behavioral modulation. Taken together, our results pave the way to elucidate the role of these neurons in visual behavior and allow us to interrogate the definition of cell types in the light of new molecular definitions.</p>

                <p>The ability to wait before responding is crucial for many cognitive functions, including reaction time (RT) tasks, where one must resist premature actions before the stimulus and respond quickly once it is presented. However, the brain regions governing waiting remain unclear. Using localized excitotoxic lesions, we investigated the roles of the motor cortex (MO) and sensorimotor dorsolateral striatum (DLS) in male rats performing a conditioned lever-release task with variable delays. Neural activity in both MO and DLS showed similar firing patterns during waiting and responding periods. However, only bilateral DLS lesions caused a sustained increase in premature (anticipatory) responses, whereas bilateral MO lesions primarily prolonged RTs. In a self-timing version of the task, where rats held a lever for a fixed delay before releasing it, DLS lesions caused a leftward shift in response timing, leading to persistently greater premature responses. These waiting deficits were accompanied by reduced motor vigor, such as slower reward-orienting locomotion. Our findings underscore the critical role of the sensorimotor striatum in regulating waiting behavior in timing-related tasks.</p>

                <p>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the largest intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> store, serving as the source and sink of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> store is continuous yet organized into distinct subcompartments with spatial and functional heterogeneity. In cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs), glutamatergic inputs trigger Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from specific ER domains via inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP<SUB>3</SUB>Rs) or ryanodine receptors (RyRs). Upon ER store depletion, refilling occurs through store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry mediated by stromal interaction molecule-1 (STIM1). Although the significance of STIM1-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation within PCs is established, STIM1 localization in ER subcompartments in PCs for Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and refilling remains elusive. Using validated antibodies, we demonstrated that STIM1 was predominantly localized as intense puncta along dendritic shafts in male and female mice, colocalizing with IP<SUB>3</SUB>R1 but not with RyR1. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that STIM1 was accumulated in the subsurface ER in the dendritic shaft but excluded from those in the dendritic spine, the primary site of metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1)&ndash;IP<SUB>3</SUB>R-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging from control and STIM1-knockdown (STIM1-KD) PCs demonstrated that mGluR1-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release is more critically dependent on STIM1 than RyR-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. These findings reveal a spatially organized ER network in PCs, where specialized ER subcompartments differentially regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and refilling. These findings suggest that STIM1 preferentially regulates Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics associated with mGluR1&ndash;IP<SUB>3</SUB>R signaling, supporting specialized ER subcompartments for Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and refilling. These findings highlight the intricate molecular&ndash;anatomical organization of dendritic ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in PCs, crucial for synaptic plasticity and motor learning.</p>

                <p>Temporal dynamics play a central role in models of emotion: "fear" is widely conceptualized as a phasic response to certain-and-imminent danger, whereas "anxiety" is a sustained response to uncertain-or-distal harm. Yet the underlying neurobiology remains contentious. Leveraging a translationally relevant fMRI paradigm and theory-driven modeling approach in 220 adult humans, we demonstrate that certain- and uncertain-threat anticipation recruit a shared circuit that encompasses the central extended amygdala (EAc), periaqueductal gray, midcingulate, and anterior insula. This circuit exhibits persistently elevated activation when threat is uncertain and distal and transient bursts of activation just before certain encounters with threat. Although there is agreement that the EAc plays a critical role in orchestrating responses to threat, confusion persists about the respective contributions of its major subdivisions, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) and central nucleus of the amygdala (Ce). Here we used anatomical regions of interest to demonstrate that the BST and Ce exhibit statistically indistinguishable threat dynamics. Both regions exhibited activation dynamics that run counter to popular models, with the Ce (and BST) showing sustained responses to uncertain-and-distal threat and the BST (and Ce) showing phasic responses to certain-and-imminent threat. For many scientists, feelings are the hallmark of fear and anxiety. Here we used an independently validated multivoxel brain "signature" to covertly probe the moment-by-moment dynamics of anticipatory distress for the first time. Results mirrored the dynamics of neural activation. These observations provide fresh insights into the neurobiology of threat-elicited emotions and set the stage for more ambitious clinical and mechanistic research.</p>

                <p>In most mammals, conspecific chemical cues that drive innate social and sexual behavior are detected by the vomeronasal organ (VNO) and processed in the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB). Chemosensory stimulation of vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs) at their microvillous dendritic knobs triggers, first, a local signal transduction and amplification cascade and, second, transformation of that signal into action potential (AP) discharge at the soma. Both processes&mdash;signal transduction and AP generation&mdash;involve local Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations in the knob and soma, respectively. Here, we revisit the somewhat still controversial functions of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated ion channels in both VSN compartments. In acute mouse VNO slices (of either sex), focal photorelease of Ca<sup>2+</sup> reveals that VSN knob and soma both act as independent Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling compartments, in which Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations exert opposite effects. While Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in the knob drive an excitatory inward current, Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations in the soma primarily activate hyperpolarizing outward currents that silence VSNs. A substantial fraction of the latter current is mediated by SK and/or BK channels. Notably, SK channel activity strongly affects VSN firing. Together, our study reveals a diverse composition of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated currents in VSN somata and uncovers an unexpected role of SK channels in dampening excitability and, thus, in controlling VSN-to-AOB information transfer.</p>

                <p>The medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) has been implicated in shaping decisions involving reward uncertainty, in part by using memories to infer future outcomes. This region is interconnected with other key systems that mediated these decisions, including the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and prelimbic (PL) region of the medial prefrontal cortex, yet the functional importance of these circuits remains unclear. The present study used chemogenetic silencing to examine the contribution of different input and output pathways of the mOFC to risk/reward decision-making. Male rats were well-trained on a probabilistic discounting task where they chose between a small/certain (one pellet) and a large/uncertain (four pellets) option, the odds for which changed systematically across a session. Suppressing activity of descending mOFC terminals in the BLA impaired adjustment in choice biases as reward probabilities change, suggesting this circuit tracks changes in relative value to support flexible reward-seeking. Inhibiting bottom-up BLA -&gt; mOFC circuits had no effect on choice. With respect to corticocortical circuits, inhibiting mOFC inputs to PL led to more random choice patterns, indicating this circuit promotes advantageous choice by processing context-dependent information regarding wins and losses. In comparison, PL inputs to mOFC attenuate the allure of larger yet uncertain rewards and reduce loss sensitivity, particularly early in the choice sequence. The present findings provide novel insight into the functional contribution that mOFC&ndash;BLA and PL interactions make to distinct processes that shape decision-making in situations of reward uncertainty.</p>

                <p>Biological neural networks translate sensory information into neural code that is held in memory over long timescales. Theories for how this occurs often posit a functional role of neural oscillations. However, recent advances show that neural oscillations are often confounded with non-oscillatory, aperiodic neural activity. Here we analyze a dataset of intracranial human EEG recordings (<I>N</I> = 13; 10 female) to test the hypothesis that aperiodic activity plays a role in visual memory, independent and distinct from oscillations. By leveraging a new approach to time-resolved parameterization of neural spectral activity, we find event-related changes in both oscillations and aperiodic activity during memory encoding. During memory encoding, aperiodic-adjusted alpha oscillatory power significantly decreases while, simultaneously, aperiodic neural activity "flattens out". These results provide novel evidence for task-related dynamics of both aperiodic and oscillatory activity in human memory, paving the way for future investigations into the unique functional roles of these two neural processes in human cognition.</p>

                <p>The importance of animal models to an understanding of the development and plasticity of visual functions was evident from the outset of the long experimental collaboration of David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel in the early 1960s. Their initial work on kittens had massive impact in part because of the recognition that kittens share with primates substantial similarities of visual system organization and plasticity (e.g., eye-specific lamination of the thalamus and columnar organization of the visual cortex), as well as comparable visual abilities (including stereoscopic vision). In addition the plasticity demonstrated in response to early periods of selected visual exposure provided a glimpse into the origins of amblyopia. Five decades ago my laboratory developed a method for the fast measurement of visual thresholds in kittens in order to capture the consequences for spatial vision of the rapid physiological changes that occurred in the visual cortex during both typical development and those that follow various forms of early selected visual exposure. This paper describes the further evolution of the method with an emphasis on the testing procedures that enable fast capture of spatial visual thresholds such as visual acuity on every animal and occasion. In these respects, the method emulated features of basic tests of human spatial vision as applied in clinical settings. As with clinical tests for humans, the method includes benchmarks of low vision necessary to document the profound immediate consequences of early selected visual deprivation and the speed and extent of the subsequent recovery.</p>

                Background In computer vision and image processing, face recognition is increasingly popular field of research that identifies similar faces in a picture and assigns a suitable label. It is one of the desired detection techniques employed in forensics for criminal identification. Methods This study explores face recognition system for monozygotic twins utilizing three widely recognized feature descriptor algorithms: Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF), and Oriented Fast and Rotated BRIEF (ORB)—with region-specific facial landmarks. These landmarks were extracted from 468 points detected through the Mediapipe frame-work, which enables simultaneous recognition of multiple faces. Quantitative similarity metrics t served as inputs for four classification methods: Support Vector Machine (SVM), eXtreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost), Light Gradient Boost Machine (LGBM), and Nearest Centroid (NC). The effectiveness of these algorithms was tested and validated using challenging ND Twins and 3D TEC datasets, the most difficult data sets for 2D and 3D face recognition research at Notre Dame University. Results Testing with Notre Dame University’s challenging ND Twins and 3D TEC datasets re- vealed significant performance differences. Results demonstrated that 2D facial images achieved notably higher recognition accuracy than 3D images. The 2D images produced accuracy of 88% (SVM), 83% (LGBM), 83% (XGBoost), and 79% (NC). In contrast, the 3D TEC dataset yielded a lower accuracy r of 74%, 72%, 72%, and 70%, with the same classifiers. Conclusion The hybrid feature extraction approach proved most effective, with maximum accuracy rates reaching 88% for 2D facial images and 74% for 3D facial images. This work contributes significantly to forensic science by enhancing the reliability of facial recognition systems when confronted with indistinguishable facial characteristics of monozygotic twins.

                Background This study investigates the connection between aggregate markups and income inequality, exploring how market power affects inequality in developed, emerging, and developing economies. The analysis aims to reveal how institutional differences and economic systems shape this relationship. Method The study examines data from 12 countries from 1997 to 2016 using a panel data approach. The analysis focuses on key variables such as the Gini index (measuring inequality), lagged markups, trade openness, GDP per capita, tax revenue, poverty, and R&D expenditure. A two-way fixed-effects model is applied to account for country and year-specific differences, while robust standard errors ensure reliability. Results The results show that higher markups are closely linked to greater income inequality, with the impact being particularly pronounced in emerging and developing economies. Integrating tax policies, trade openness, and GDP growth into the analysis indicates the limitations of relying solely on economic growth to achieve equity. The research highlights taxation and trade as effective levers for mitigating inequality and raises important questions about the role of innovation in this dynamic. Conclusion This study shows the interaction between market power and inequality across diverse economic systems. We examine how factors like market concentration and institutional quality drive inequality provides practical insights and policy recommendations for effectively addressing income disparities.

                Background Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1 (MEN 1) is a rare hereditary disorder characterized by tumors in the parathyroid, pancreatic islet cells, and anterior pituitary. This study discusses two distinct clinical cases to illustrate the diverse manifestations, diagnostic challenges, and management strategies for MEN 1. Methods A case-based approach was employed to examine the clinical presentation, biochemical findings, imaging results, and therapeutic interventions in two patients with MEN 1. Relevant literature was reviewed to contextualize the findings. Results Case 1 involved a 47-year-old female presenting with hyperparathyroidism and a gastrinoma, managed conservatively due to comorbid chronic kidney disease. Case 2 featured a 26-year-old female with aggressive manifestations, including severe osteoporosis, hypercalcemia, and a pancreatic tail lesion, necessitating prompt surgical intervention. Both cases highlighted the utility of advanced imaging (Tc99 MIBI scans, MRI) and biochemical markers (serum calcium, iPTH, chromogranin A) in diagnosis and management. Genetic testing was emphasized as a key component of family screening and long-term surveillance. Discussion MEN 1 requires a multidisciplinary approach due to its multisystemic nature. Early diagnosis and tailored interventions, including parathyroidectomy and medical therapies like cinacalcet and somatostatin analogs, are critical to optimizing outcomes. The variability in clinical presentations underscores the need for personalized management plans. Conclusion The diverse spectrum of MEN 1 demands vigilant surveillance and a collaborative healthcare approach. Advances in diagnostics and targeted treatments continue to improve patient outcomes, but long-term management and genetic counseling remain pivotal.

                Background We conducted an overview of systematic reviews about the effects of teaching strategies that can be used to teach primary and secondary school students to think critically. Our objective was to inform decisions about what teaching strategies to use in resources that we developed to teach critical thinking about health in secondary schools. Methods We mapped characteristics of systematic reviews of teaching strategies and summarised findings from the most relevant reviews to teaching students to think critically about health. We included reviews that assessed the effects of teaching strategies that could potentially be used in primary or secondary schools to teach students to think critically, had a Methods section with explicit selection criteria, reported at least one outcome measure of the ability to undertake one of four basic types of cognitive tasks (memory, procedural, comprehension, or opinion), and were published after 1999. Results We included 326 systematic reviews. The reviews evaluated a wide range of teaching strategies for a variety of purposes. Important limitations of the reviews included not considering adverse effects (99% of the reviews), not assessing the risk of bias for included studies (93% of the reviews), and not assessing the credibility of subgroup effects (100% of the reviews). We summarised the findings for 37 teaching strategies that we considered most relevant. The certainty of the evidence of the effects varied from very low to moderate. We used 12 of the strategies in resources that we developed to teach secondary students to think critically about health. Conclusions A tremendous amount of work has gone into evaluating the effects of a wide range of teaching strategies. The results of this research can inform decisions about how to teach critical thinking and future research. However, well-designed, up-to-date systematic reviews are still needed for many teaching strategies.

RMPJ is an image-processing tool that facilitates the effective enhancement of low-contrast analysis objects and enables preprocessing to quantify the morphological features of the objects under analysis. This ImageJ plugin implements seven image-processing algorithms based on rotational morphological processing (RMP), a variation of traditional morphological operations. RMPJ enables the enhancement and extraction of intricate and nuanced features in biomedical images. Furthermore, it facilitates the separation and extraction of multiple aggregated structures. This software aims to expand the scope of research in life sciences by providing an image-processing method that quantitatively analyzes the morphological information of objects.

Mosser</p>

In many settings, ongoing measles transmission is maintained due to pockets of un- or under-vaccinated individuals even if the critical vaccination threshold is reached nationwide. Therefore, assessing the underlying gaps in measles susceptibility within a population is essential for vaccination programs and measles control efforts. Recently, there have been increased efforts to use geospatial and small area methods to estimate subnational measles vaccination coverage in high-burden settings, such as in Ethiopia. However, the distribution of remaining susceptible individuals, either unvaccinated or having never previously been infected, across age groups and subnational geographies is unknown. In this study, we developed a dynamic transmission model that incorporates geospatial estimates of routine measles vaccination coverage, available data on supplemental immunization activities, and reported cases to estimate measles incidence and susceptibility across time, age, and space. We use gridded population estimates and subnational estimates of routine and supplemental measles vaccination coverage. To account for mixing between age-groups, we used a synthetic contact matrix, and travel times via a friction surface were used in a modified gravity model to account for spatial movement. We explored model fitting using Ethiopia as a case study. To address data-related and statistical challenges, we investigated a range of model parameterization and possible fitting algorithms. The approach with the best performance was a model fitted to case notifications adjusted for case ascertainment by using maximum likelihood estimation with block coordinate descent. This strategy was chosen because many data observations (and likely presence of unquantified uncertainty) yielded a steep likelihood surface, which was challenging to fit using Bayesian approaches. We ran sensitivity analyses to explore variations in vaccine effectiveness and compared patterns of susceptibility across space, time, and age. Substantial heterogeneity in reported measles cases as well as susceptibility persists across ages and second-administrative units. These methods and estimates could contribute towards tailored subnational and local planning to reduce preventable measles burden. However, computational and data challenges would need to be addressed for these methods to be applied on a large scale.

The tumor microenvironment aids cancer progression by promoting several cancer hallmarks, independent of cancer-related mutations. Biophysical properties of this environment, such as the stiffness of the matrix cells adhere to and local cell density, impact proliferation, apoptosis, and the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). The latter is a rate-limiting step for invasion and metastasis, enhanced in hypoxic tumor environments but hindered by soft matrices and/or high cell densities. As these influences are often studied in isolation, the crosstalk between hypoxia, biomechanical signals, and the classic EMT driver TGF-β is not well mapped, limiting our ability to predict and anticipate cancer cell behaviors in changing tumor environments. To address this, we built a Boolean regulatory network model that integrates hypoxic signaling with a mechanosensitive model of EMT, which includes the EMT-promoting crosstalk of mitogens and biomechanical signals, cell cycle control, and apoptosis. Our model reproduces the requirement of Hif-1α for proliferation, the anti-proliferative effects of strong Hif-1α stabilization during hypoxia, hypoxic protection from anoikis, and hypoxia-driven mechanosensitive EMT. We offer experimentally testable predictions about the effect of VHL loss on cancer hallmarks, with or without secondary oncogene activation. Taken together, our model serves as a predictive framework to synthesize the signaling responses associated with tumor progression and metastasis in healthy vs. mutant cells. Our single-cell model is a key step towards more extensive regulatory network models that cover damage-response and senescence, integrating most cell-autonomous cancer hallmarks into a single model that can, in turn, control the behavior of in silico cells within a tissue model of epithelial homeostasis and carcinoma.

Primary mitral regurgitation (MR) is a pathology that alters mechanical loading on the left ventricle, triggers an array of compensatory neurohormonal responses, and induces a distinctive ventricular remodeling response known as eccentric hypertrophy. Drug therapies may alleviate symptoms, but only mitral valve repair or replacement can provide significant recovery of cardiac function and dimensions. Questions remain about the optimal timing of surgery, with 20% of patients developing systolic dysfunction post-operatively despite being treated according to the current guidelines. Thus, better understanding of the hypertrophic process in the setting of ventricular volume overload (VO) is needed to improve and better personalize the management of MR. To address this knowledge gap, we employ a Bayesian approach to combine data from 70 studies on experimental volume overload in dogs and rats and use it to calibrate a logic-based network model of hypertrophic signaling in myocytes. The calibrated model predicts that growth in experimental VO is mostly driven by the neurohormonal response, with an initial increase in myocardial tissue stretch being compensated by subsequent remodeling fairly early in the time course of VO. This observation contrasts with a common perception that volume-overload hypertrophy is driven primarily by increased myocyte strain. The model reproduces many aspects of 43 studies not used in its calibration, including infusion of individual hypertrophic agonists alone or in combination with various drugs commonly employed to treat heart failure, as well as administration of some of those drugs in the setting of experimental volume overload. We believe this represents a promising approach to using the known structure of an intracellular signaling network to integrate information from multiple studies into quantitative predictions of the range of expected responses to potential interventions in the complex setting of cardiac hypertrophy driven by a combination of hormonal and mechanical factors.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The phenotype of patients with Parkinson's disease carrying <i>GBA</i>1 variants (GBA-PD) suggest similarities to symptomatology associated with early cholinergic system degeneration. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the clinical features and the cholinergic innervation pattern in patients with early GBA-PD versus those without the <i>GBA1</i> mutation (non-GBA-PD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A total of 46 GBA-PD and 104 non-GBA-PD subjects were included. Clinical assessments included motor and non-motor evaluation, as well as a comprehensive neuropsychological examination. Cholinergic system integrity was assessed using <sup>1</sup>
<sup>8</sup>F-Fluoroethoxybenzovesamicol (<sup>18</sup>F-FEOBV) positron emission tomography (PET) to investigate the differences between GBA-PD and non-GBA-PD. Given the higher prevalence of females in GBA-PD, analyses were repeated when stratified by sex. Additionally, we examined the association between cognitive domains and whole-brain cholinergic binding in both groups. Exploratory analyses examined clinical and <sup>18</sup>F-FEOBV binding differences among <i>GBA1</i> variants.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>GBA-PD patients exhibited a higher burden of non-motor symptoms and lower cognitive performance on executive functions and attention. We observed a more pronounced cholinergic denervation in GBA-PD, compared to non-GBA-PD, primarily in the anterior, central, and limbic regions. However, the distribution of cholinergic loss and its association with attention and executive dysfunction was comparable between GBA-PD and non-GBA-PD. In addition, the clinical presentation and cholinergic binding differed significantly between sexes.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results suggest an important role of early cholinergic denervation in GBA-PD patients, which is related to more severe cognitive dysfunction. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Ethiopia encounters significant socio-cultural barriers to contraceptive use, affecting maternal health, poverty reduction, and women's empowerment. With a fertility rate of 4.6 children per woman and only 25.9% of women of reproductive age intending to use contraceptives, significant challenges remain. This policy brief analyzes data from the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) and 2019 Mini-EDHS, revealing key barriers such as fatalistic beliefs, religious prohibitions, postpartum amenorrhea, and spousal opposition. Socioeconomic factors, including wealth, literacy, and urban residency, greatly influence contraceptive use. Multivariable and structural equation modeling underscore the complex interplay of cultural norms, economic status, and individual autonomy in shaping contraceptive behavior. The brief recommends culturally tailored education programs, male engagement strategies, targeted interventions for underserved regions, and enhanced healthcare systems to improve contraceptive uptake. Implementing these evidence-based policies is essential for improving reproductive health and empowering women in Ethiopia.
