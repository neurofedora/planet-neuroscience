              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17721">Automatic EEG Independent Component Classification Using ICLabel in Python</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.17721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ICLabel is an important plug-in function in EEGLAB, the most widely used software for EEG data processing. A powerful approach to automated processing of EEG data involves decomposing the data by Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and then classifying the resulting independent components (ICs) using ICLabel. While EEGLAB pipelines support high-performance computing (HPC) platforms running the open-source Octave interpreter, the ICLabel plug-in is incompatible with Octave because of its specialized neural network architecture. To enhance cross-platform compatibility, we developed a Python version of ICLabel that uses standard EEGLAB data structures. We compared ICLabel MATLAB and Python implementations to data from 14 subjects. ICLabel returns the likelihood of classification in 7 classes of components for each ICA component. The returned IC classifications were virtually identical between Python and MATLAB, with differences in classification percentage below 0.001%.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18498">Collective decision making by embodied neural agents</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.18498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective decision making using simple social interactions has been studied in many types of multi-agent systems, including robot swarms and human social networks. However, existing multi-agent studies have rarely modeled the neural dynamics that underlie sensorimotor coordination in embodied biological agents. In this study, we investigated collective decisions that resulted from sensorimotor coordination among agents with simple neural dynamics. We equipped our agents with a model of minimal neural dynamics based on the coordination dynamics framework, and embedded them in an environment with a stimulus gradient. In our single-agent setup, the decision between two stimulus sources depends solely on the coordination of the agent's neural dynamics with its environment. In our multi-agent setup, that same decision also depends on the sensorimotor coordination between agents, via their simple social interactions. Our results show that the success of collective decisions depended on a balance of intra-agent, inter-agent, and agent-environment coupling, and we use these results to identify the influences of environmental factors on decision difficulty. More generally, our results demonstrate the impact of intra- and inter-brain coordination dynamics on collective behavior, can contribute to existing knowledge on the functional role of inter-agent synchrony, and are relevant to ongoing developments in neuro-AI and self-organized multi-agent systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18587">EEG-Based Analysis of Brain Responses in Multi-Modal Human-Robot Interaction: Modulating Engagement</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.18587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: User engagement, cognitive participation, and motivation during task execution in physical human-robot interaction are crucial for motor learning. These factors are especially important in contexts like robotic rehabilitation, where neuroplasticity is targeted. However, traditional robotic rehabilitation systems often face challenges in maintaining user engagement, leading to unpredictable therapeutic outcomes. To address this issue, various techniques, such as assist-as-needed controllers, have been developed to prevent user slacking and encourage active participation. In this paper, we introduce a new direction through a novel multi-modal robotic interaction designed to enhance user engagement by synergistically integrating visual, motor, cognitive, and auditory (speech recognition) tasks into a single, comprehensive activity. To assess engagement quantitatively, we compared multiple electroencephalography (EEG) biomarkers between this multi-modal protocol and a traditional motor-only protocol. Fifteen healthy adult participants completed 100 trials of each task type. Our findings revealed that EEG biomarkers, particularly relative alpha power, showed statistically significant improvements in engagement during the multi-modal task compared to the motor-only task. Moreover, while engagement decreased over time in the motor-only task, the multi-modal protocol maintained consistent engagement, suggesting that users could remain engaged for longer therapy sessions. Our observations on neural responses during interaction indicate that the proposed multi-modal approach can effectively enhance user engagement, which is critical for improving outcomes. This is the first time that objective neural response highlights the benefit of a comprehensive robotic intervention combining motor, cognitive, and auditory functions in healthy subjects.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17687">Assessing the similarity of real matrices with arbitrary shape</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2403.17687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assessing the similarity of matrices is valuable for analyzing the extent to which data sets exhibit common features in tasks such as data clustering, dimensionality reduction, pattern recognition, group comparison, and graph analysis. Methods proposed for comparing vectors, such as cosine similarity, can be readily generalized to matrices. However, this approach usually neglects the inherent two-dimensional structure of matrices. Here, we propose singular angle similarity (SAS), a measure for evaluating the structural similarity between two arbitrary, real matrices of the same shape based on singular value decomposition. After introducing the measure, we compare SAS with standard measures for matrix comparison and show that only SAS captures the two-dimensional structure of matrices. Further, we characterize the behavior of SAS in the presence of noise and as a function of matrix dimensionality. Finally, we apply SAS to two use cases: square non-symmetric matrices of probabilistic network connectivity, and non-square matrices representing neural brain activity. For synthetic data of network connectivity, SAS matches intuitive expectations and allows for a robust assessment of similarities and differences. For experimental data of brain activity, SAS captures differences in the structure of high-dimensional responses to different stimuli. We conclude that SAS is a suitable measure for quantifying the shared structure of matrices with arbitrary shape.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19147">Functional Brain Network Identification in Opioid Use Disorder Using Machine Learning Analysis of Resting-State fMRI BOLD Signals</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.19147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the neurobiology of opioid use disorder (OUD) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) may help inform treatment strategies to improve patient outcomes. Recent literature suggests temporal characteristics of rs-fMRI blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals may offer complementary information to functional connectivity analysis. However, existing studies of OUD analyze BOLD signals using measures computed across all time points. This study, for the first time in the literature, employs data-driven machine learning (ML) modeling of rs-fMRI BOLD features representing multiple time points to identify region(s) of interest that differentiate OUD subjects from healthy controls (HC). Following the triple network model, we obtain rs-fMRI BOLD features from the default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and executive control network (ECN) for 31 OUD and 45 HC subjects. Then, we use the Boruta ML algorithm to identify statistically significant BOLD features that differentiate OUD from HC, identifying the DMN as the most salient functional network for OUD. Furthermore, we conduct brain activity mapping, showing heightened neural activity within the DMN for OUD. We perform 5-fold cross-validation classification (OUD vs. HC) experiments to study the discriminative power of functional network features with and without fusing demographic features. The DMN shows the most discriminative power, achieving mean AUC and F1 scores of 80.91% and 73.97%, respectively, when fusing BOLD and demographic features. Follow-up Boruta analysis using BOLD features extracted from the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and left and right temporoparietal junctions reveals significant features for all four functional hubs within the DMN.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06802">Identifying the impact of local connectivity patterns on dynamics in excitatory-inhibitory networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.06802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Networks of excitatory and inhibitory (EI) neurons form a canonical circuit in the brain. Seminal theoretical results on dynamics of such networks are based on the assumption that synaptic strengths depend on the type of neurons they connect, but are otherwise statistically independent. Recent synaptic physiology datasets however highlight the prominence of specific connectivity patterns that go well beyond what is expected from independent connections. While decades of influential research have demonstrated the strong role of the basic EI cell type structure, to which extent additional connectivity features influence dynamics remains to be fully determined. Here we examine the effects of pairwise connectivity motifs on the linear dynamics in EI networks using an analytical framework that approximates the connectivity in terms of low-rank structures. This low-rank approximation is based on a mathematical derivation of the dominant eigenvalues of the connectivity matrix and predicts the impact on responses to external inputs of connectivity motifs and their interactions with cell-type structure. Our results reveal that a particular pattern of connectivity, chain motifs, have a much stronger impact on dominant eigenmodes than other pairwise motifs. An overrepresentation of chain motifs induces a strong positive eigenvalue in inhibition-dominated networks and generates a potential instability that requires revisiting the classical excitation-inhibition balance criteria. Examining effects of external inputs, we show that chain motifs can on their own induce paradoxical responses where an increased input to inhibitory neurons leads to a decrease in their activity due to the recurrent feedback. These findings have direct implications for the interpretation of experiments in which responses to optogenetic perturbations are measured and used to infer the dynamical regime of cortical circuits.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18410">Preserving Information: How does Topological Data Analysis improve Neural Network performance?</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.18410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) require significant amounts of data and computational resources to achieve high effectiveness in performing the tasks for which they are trained. To reduce resource demands, various techniques, such as Neuron Pruning, are applied. Due to the complex structure of ANNs, interpreting the behavior of hidden layers and the features they recognize in the data is challenging. A lack of comprehensive understanding of which information is utilized during inference can lead to inefficient use of available data, thereby lowering the overall performance of the models. In this paper, we introduce a method for integrating Topological Data Analysis (TDA) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in the context of image recognition. This method significantly enhances the performance of neural networks by leveraging a broader range of information present in the data, enabling the model to make more informed and accurate predictions. Our approach, further referred to as Vector Stitching, involves combining raw image data with additional topological information derived through TDA methods. This approach enables the neural network to train on an enriched dataset, incorporating topological features that might otherwise remain unexploited or not captured by the network's inherent mechanisms. The results of our experiments highlight the potential of incorporating results of additional data analysis into the network's inference process, resulting in enhanced performance in pattern recognition tasks in digital images, particularly when using limited datasets. This work contributes to the development of methods for integrating TDA with deep learning and explores how concepts from Information Theory can explain the performance of such hybrid methods in practical implementation environments.

                arXiv:2411.17726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the maturation of quantum computing technology, research has gradually shifted towards exploring its applications. Alongside the rise of artificial intelligence, various machine learning methods have been developed into quantum circuits and algorithms. Among them, Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) can map inputs to quantum circuits through Feature Maps (FMs) and adjust parameter values via variational models, making them applicable in regression and classification tasks. However, designing a FM that is suitable for a given application problem is a significant challenge. In light of this, this study proposes an Enhanced Quantum Neural Network (EQNN), which includes an Enhanced Feature Map (EFM) designed in this research. This EFM effectively maps input variables to a value range more suitable for quantum computing, serving as the input to the variational model to improve accuracy. In the experimental environment, this study uses mobile data usage prediction as a case study, recommending appropriate rate plans based on users' mobile data usage. The proposed EQNN is compared with current mainstream QNNs, and experimental results show that the EQNN achieves higher accuracy with fewer quantum logic gates and converges to the optimal solution faster under different optimization algorithms.

Abstract: To improve the convergence speed and optimization accuracy of the Dung Beetle Optimizer (DBO), this paper proposes an improved algorithm based on circle mapping and longitudinal-horizontal crossover strategy (CICRDBO). First, the Circle method is used to map the initial population to increase diversity. Second, the longitudinal-horizontal crossover strategy is applied to enhance the global search ability by ensuring the position updates of the dung beetle. Simulations were conducted on 10 benchmark test functions, and the results demonstrate that the improved algorithm performs well in both convergence speed and optimization accuracy. The improved algorithm is further applied to the hyperparameter selection of the Random Forest classification algorithm for binary classification prediction in the retail industry. Various combination comparisons prove the practicality of the improved algorithm, followed by SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis.

                arXiv:2411.17800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Iterative improvement of model architectures is fundamental to deep learning: Transformers first enabled scaling, and recent advances in model hybridization have pushed the quality-efficiency frontier. However, optimizing architectures remains challenging and expensive. Current automated or manual approaches fall short, largely due to limited progress in the design of search spaces and due to the simplicity of resulting patterns and heuristics. In this work, we propose a new approach for the synthesis of tailored architectures (STAR). Our approach combines a novel search space based on the theory of linear input-varying systems, supporting a hierarchical numerical encoding into architecture genomes. STAR genomes are automatically refined and recombined with gradient-free, evolutionary algorithms to optimize for multiple model quality and efficiency metrics. Using STAR, we optimize large populations of new architectures, leveraging diverse computational units and interconnection patterns, improving over highly-optimized Transformers and striped hybrid models on the frontier of quality, parameter size, and inference cache for autoregressive language modeling.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17999">A Novel Pareto-optimal Ranking Method for Comparing Multi-objective Optimization Algorithms</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.17999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the interest in multi- and many-objective optimization algorithms grows, the performance comparison of these algorithms becomes increasingly important. A large number of performance indicators for multi-objective optimization algorithms have been introduced, each of which evaluates these algorithms based on a certain aspect. Therefore, assessing the quality of multi-objective results using multiple indicators is essential to guarantee that the evaluation considers all quality perspectives. This paper proposes a novel multi-metric comparison method to rank the performance of multi-/ many-objective optimization algorithms based on a set of performance indicators. We utilize the Pareto optimality concept (i.e., non-dominated sorting algorithm) to create the rank levels of algorithms by simultaneously considering multiple performance indicators as criteria/objectives. As a result, four different techniques are proposed to rank algorithms based on their contribution at each Pareto level. This method allows researchers to utilize a set of existing/newly developed performance metrics to adequately assess/rank multi-/many-objective algorithms. The proposed methods are scalable and can accommodate in its comprehensive scheme any newly introduced metric. The method was applied to rank 10 competing algorithms in the 2018 CEC competition solving 15 many-objective test problems. The Pareto-optimal ranking was conducted based on 10 well-known multi-objective performance indicators and the results were compared to the final ranks reported by the competition, which were based on the inverted generational distance (IGD) and hypervolume indicator (HV) measures. The techniques suggested in this paper have broad applications in science and engineering, particularly in areas where multiple metrics are used for comparisons. Examples include machine learning and data mining.

                arXiv:2411.18272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuromorphic systems that employ advanced synaptic learning rules, such as the three-factor learning rule, require synaptic devices of increased complexity. Herein, a novel neoHebbian artificial synapse utilizing ReRAM devices has been proposed and experimentally validated to meet this demand. This synapse features two distinct state variables: a neuron coupling weight and an "eligibility trace" that dictates synaptic weight updates. The coupling weight is encoded in the ReRAM conductance, while the "eligibility trace" is encoded in the local temperature of the ReRAM and is modulated by applying voltage pulses to a physically co-located resistive heating element. The utility of the proposed synapse has been investigated using two representative tasks: first, temporal signal classification using Recurrent Spiking Neural Networks (RSNNs) employing the e-prop algorithm, and second, Reinforcement Learning (RL) for path planning tasks in feedforward networks using a modified version of the same learning rule. System-level simulations, accounting for various device and system-level non-idealities, confirm that these synapses offer a robust solution for the fast, compact, and energy-efficient implementation of advanced learning rules in neuromorphic hardware.

Abstract: The prevailing of artificial intelligence-of-things calls for higher energy-efficient edge computing paradigms, such as neuromorphic agents leveraging brain-inspired spiking neural network (SNN) models based on spatiotemporally sparse binary spikes. However, the lack of efficient and high-accuracy deep SNN learning algorithms prevents them from practical edge deployments at a strictly bounded cost. In this paper, we propose the spatiotemporal orthogonal propagation (STOP) algorithm to tackle this challenge. Our algorithm enables fully synergistic learning of synaptic weights as well as firing thresholds and leakage factors in spiking neurons to improve SNN accuracy, in a unified temporally-forward trace-based framework to mitigate the huge memory requirement for storing neural states across all time-steps in the forward pass. Characteristically, the spatially-backward neuronal errors and temporally-forward traces propagate orthogonally to and independently of each other, substantially reducing computational complexity. Our STOP algorithm obtained high recognition accuracies of 94.84%, 74.92%, 98.26% and 77.10% on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, DVS-Gesture and DVS-CIFAR10 datasets with adequate deep convolutional SNNs of VGG-11 or ResNet-18 structures. Compared with other deep SNN training algorithms, our method is more plausible for edge intelligent scenarios where resources are limited but high-accuracy in-situ learning is desired.

                arXiv:2410.09804v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities across various tasks, they encounter potential security risks such as jailbreak attacks, which exploit vulnerabilities to bypass security measures and generate harmful outputs. Existing jailbreak strategies mainly focus on maximizing attack success rate (ASR), frequently neglecting other critical factors, including the relevance of the jailbreak response to the query and the level of stealthiness. This narrow focus on single objectives can result in ineffective attacks that either lack contextual relevance or are easily recognizable. In this work, we introduce BlackDAN, an innovative black-box attack framework with multi-objective optimization, aiming to generate high-quality prompts that effectively facilitate jailbreaking while maintaining contextual relevance and minimizing detectability. BlackDAN leverages Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs), specifically the NSGA-II algorithm, to optimize jailbreaks across multiple objectives including ASR, stealthiness, and semantic relevance. By integrating mechanisms like mutation, crossover, and Pareto-dominance, BlackDAN provides a transparent and interpretable process for generating jailbreaks. Furthermore, the framework allows customization based on user preferences, enabling the selection of prompts that balance harmfulness, relevance, and other factors. Experimental results demonstrate that BlackDAN outperforms traditional single-objective methods, yielding higher success rates and improved robustness across various LLMs and multimodal LLMs, while ensuring jailbreak responses are both relevant and less detectable.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14735">Agent Skill Acquisition for Large Language Models via CycleQD</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.14735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training large language models to acquire specific skills remains a challenging endeavor. Conventional training approaches often struggle with data distribution imbalances and inadequacies in objective functions that do not align well with task-specific performance. To address these challenges, we introduce CycleQD, a novel approach that leverages the Quality Diversity framework through a cyclic adaptation of the algorithm, along with a model merging based crossover and an SVD-based mutation. In CycleQD, each task's performance metric is alternated as the quality measure while the others serve as the behavioral characteristics. This cyclic focus on individual tasks allows for concentrated effort on one task at a time, eliminating the need for data ratio tuning and simplifying the design of the objective function. Empirical results from AgentBench indicate that applying CycleQD to LLAMA3-8B-INSTRUCT based models not only enables them to surpass traditional fine-tuning methods in coding, operating systems, and database tasks, but also achieves performance on par with GPT-3.5-TURBO, which potentially contains much more parameters, across these domains. Crucially, this enhanced performance is achieved while retaining robust language capabilities, as evidenced by its performance on widely adopted language benchmark tasks. We highlight the key design choices in CycleQD, detailing how these contribute to its effectiveness. Furthermore, our method is general and can be applied to image segmentation models, highlighting its applicability across different domains.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Bradykinesia is considered one of the most disabling motor symptoms in individuals with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD). Speed-based interventions are promising for reducing bradykinesia in this population. This systematic review aims to describe speed-based interventions that have been employed for reducing bradykinesia in individuals with PD and verify their effects. Methods: This systematic review protocol was carried out in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P). Electronic searches were performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PEDro, LILACS and SciELO databases and gray literature sources. Experimental studies that investigated the effects of speed-based interventions on bradykinesia in individuals with PD will be considered. Two independent reviewers will screen the studies, extract data and assess risk of bias using Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2) and ROBINS-I (&amp;amp;ldquo;Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies&amp;amp;mdash;of Interventions&amp;amp;rdquo;). Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) will be used to assed the quality of evidence. Conclusions: This systematic review will offer information regarding which types of speed-based interventions have been investigated for reducing bradykinesia in individuals with PD. This information may be important for clinical decision making and will help identify gaps in the literature that may be useful for the definition of future research objectives and the planning of new trials. Ethical permission is not required for this study. Systematic review registration: this systematic review was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; registration number: CRD42024543673).</p>

	<p>Purpose: Persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) experience changes in balance, such as poor and reactive stepping, as well as altered fall-related psychological factors, such as increased concern about falling and feared consequences about falling. Such concerns and fear may relate to and influence mobility. However, these relations are poorly understood in people with MS. This study aimed to investigate the relation between reactive stepping performance and fall-related psychological factors, as well as to assess how these relations differ between individuals who have and have not fallen. Methods: In a single session, participants completed measures regarding fall-related psychological factors (balance confidence, concern about falling, and feared consequences of falling) and completed reactive stepping tasks. Following the visit, participants completed weekly surveys for 3 months to report their falls. Spearman rho correlations were computed to examine associations between participants&amp;amp;rsquo; reactive stepping performance and their fall-related concerns, confidence, and consequences, with a stratified analysis to compare these associations between fallers and non-fallers. Results: 44 individuals with MS participated in our study, with 27 individuals experiencing 0 falls (non-fallers) and 17 individuals experiencing at least 1 fall (fallers) in the 3-month follow-up period. Better reactive stepping performance was correlated with fewer concerns, greater confidence, and lower feared consequences related to falling. The stratified analysis revealed a greater number of significant associations for non-fallers than fallers, although the small sample of fallers reduced our ability to detect a relationship in this group. Conclusions: Reactive stepping was associated with fall-related psychological factors. Interventions targeting reactive stepping may be beneficial in enhancing fall-related psychological well-being in the MS community.</p>

                <p>Like all domains of cognition, language processing is affected by top&ndash;down knowledge. Classic evidence for this is missing blatant errors in the signal. In sentence comprehension, one instance is failing to notice word order errors, such as transposed words in the middle of a sentence: "you that read wrong" (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B25">Mirault et al., 2018</cross-ref>). Our brains seem to fix such errors, since they are incompatible with our grammatical knowledge, but how do our brains do this? Following behavioral work on inner transpositions, we flashed four-word sentences for 300&nbsp;ms using rapid parallel visual presentation (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B37">Snell and Grainger, 2017</cross-ref>). We compared magnetoencephalography responses to fully grammatical and reversed sentences (24 human participants: 21 females, 4 males). The left lateral language cortex robustly distinguished grammatical and reversed sentences starting at 213&nbsp;ms. Thus, the influence of grammatical knowledge begun rapidly after visual word form recognition (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B40">Tarkiainen et al., 1999</cross-ref>). At the earliest stage of this neural "sentence superiority effect," inner transpositions patterned between grammatical and reversed sentences, showing evidence that the brain initially "noticed" the error. However, 100&nbsp;ms later, inner transpositions became indistinguishable from grammatical sentences, suggesting at this point, the brain had "fixed" the error. These results show that after a single glance at a sentence, syntax impacts our neural activity almost as quickly as higher-level object recognition is assumed to take place (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B5">Cichy et al., 2014</cross-ref>). The earliest stage involves detailed comparisons between the bottom&ndash;up input and grammatical knowledge, while shortly afterward, top&ndash;down knowledge can override an error in the stimulus.</p>

                <p>Crowding, the phenomenon of impaired visual discrimination due to nearby objects, has been extensively studied and linked to cortical mechanisms. Traditionally, crowding has been studied extrafoveally; its underlying mechanisms in the central fovea, where acuity is highest, remain debated. While low-level oculomotor factors are not thought to play a role in crowding, this study shows that they are key factors in defining foveal crowding. Here, we investigate the influence of fixational behavior on foveal crowding and provide a comprehensive assessment of the magnitude and extent of this phenomenon (<I>N</I> = 13 human participants, four males). Leveraging on a unique blend of tools for high-precision eyetracking and retinal stabilization, we show that removing the retinal motion introduced by oculomotor behavior with retinal stabilization, diminishes the negative effects of crowding. Ultimately, these results indicate that ocular drift contributes to foveal crowding resulting in the same pooling region being stimulated both by the target and nearby objects over the course of time, not just in space. The temporal aspect of this phenomenon is peculiar to crowding at this scale and indicates that the mechanisms contributing to foveal and extrafoveal crowding differ.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/48/e0794242024?rss=1">How Distributed Subcortical Integration of Reward and Threat May Inform Subsequent Approach-Avoidance Decisions</a></h4>

              
                <p>Healthy and successful living involves carefully navigating rewarding and threatening situations by balancing approach and avoidance behaviors. Excessive avoidance to evade potential threats often leads to forfeiting potential rewards. However, little is known about how reward and threat information is integrated neurally to inform approach or avoidance. In this preregistered study, participants (<I>N</I><SUB>behavior </SUB>= 31, 17F; <I>N</I><SUB>MRI </SUB>= 28, 15F) made approach&ndash;avoidance decisions under varying reward (monetary gains) and threat (electrical stimulations) prospects during functional MRI scanning. In contrast to theorized parallel subcortical processing of reward and threat information before cortical integration, Bayesian multivariate multilevel analyses revealed subcortical reward and threat integration prior to indicating approach&ndash;avoidance decisions. This integration occurred in the ventral striatum, thalamus, and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). When reward was low, risk-diminishing avoidance decisions dominated, which was linked to more positive tracking of threat magnitude prior to indicating avoidance than approach decisions. In contrast, the amygdala exhibited dual sensitivity to reward and threat. While anticipating outcomes of risky approach decisions, we observed positive tracking of threat magnitude within the salience network (dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, thalamus, periaqueductal gray, BNST). Conversely, after risk-diminishing avoidance, characterized by reduced reward prospects, we observed more negative tracking of reward magnitude in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum. These findings shed light on the temporal dynamics of approach&ndash;avoidance decision-making. Importantly, they demonstrate the role of subcortical integration of reward and threat information in balancing approach and avoidance, challenging theories positing predominantly separate subcortical processing prior to cortical integration.</p>

                <p>Spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is a learning rule important for synaptic refinement and for learning and memory during development. While different forms of presynaptic t-LTD have been deeply investigated, little is known about the mechanisms of somatosensory cortex postsynaptic t-LTD. In the present work, we investigated the requirements and mechanisms for induction of developmental spike timing-dependent long-term depression (t-LTD) at L2/3-L2/3 synapses in the juvenile mouse somatosensory cortex. We found that postnatal day (P) 13&ndash;21 mice of either sex show t-LTD at L2/3-L2/3 synapses induced by pairing single presynaptic activity with single postsynaptic action potentials at low stimulation frequency (0.2&nbsp;Hz) that is expressed postsynaptically and requires the activation of ionotropic postsynaptic NMDA-type glutamate receptors containing GluN2B subunits. In addition, it requires postsynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from internal stores, calcineurin, postsynaptic endocannabinoid synthesis, activation of CB<SUB>1</SUB> receptors, and astrocytic signaling to release the gliotransmitter <scp>d</scp>-serine to activate postsynaptic NMDARs to induce t-LTD. These results show direct evidence of the mechanism involved in developmental postsynaptic t-LTD at L2/3-L2/3 synapses, revealing a central role of astrocytes and their release of <scp>d</scp>-serine in its induction.</p>

                <p>"Trying too hard" can interfere with skilled movement, such as sports and music playing. Postural control can similarly suffer when conscious attention is directed toward it ("conscious movement processing"; CMP). However, the neural mechanisms through which CMP influences balance remain poorly understood. We explored the effects of CMP on electroencephalographic (EEG) perturbation-evoked cortical responses and subsequent balance performance. Twenty healthy young adults (age&nbsp;=&nbsp;25.1 &plusmn; 5&nbsp;years; 10 males and 10 females) stood on a force plate-embedded moveable platform while mobile EEG was recorded. Participants completed two blocks of 50 discrete perturbations, containing an even mix of slower (186&nbsp;mm/s peak velocity) and faster (225&nbsp;mm/s peak velocity) perturbations. One block was performed under conditions of CMP (i.e., instructions to consciously control balance), while the other was performed under "Control" conditions with no additional instructions. For both slow and fast perturbations, CMP resulted in significantly smaller cortical N1 signals (a perturbation-evoked potential localized to the supplementary motor area) and lower sensorimotor beta EEG activity 200&ndash;400&nbsp;ms postperturbation. Significantly greater peak velocities of the center of pressure (i.e., greater postural instability) were also observed during the CMP condition. Our findings provide the first evidence that disruptions to postural control during CMP may be a consequence of insufficient cortical activation relevant for balance (i.e., insufficient cortical N1 responses followed by enhanced beta suppression). We propose that conscious attempts to minimize postural instability through CMP acts as a cognitive dual-task that dampens the sensitivity of the sensorimotor system for future losses of balance.</p>

                <p>The transmission of tau pathology has been proposed as one of the major mechanisms for the spatiotemporal spreading of tau pathology in neurodegenerative diseases. Over the last decade, studies have demonstrated that targeting total or pathological tau using tau antibodies can mitigate the development of tau pathology in tauopathy or Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse models, and multiple tau immunotherapy agents have progressed to clinical trials. Tau antibodies are believed to inhibit the internalization of pathologic seeds and/or block seed elongation after seed internalization. To further address the mechanism of tau antibody inhibition of pathological spread, we conducted immunotherapy studies in mouse primary neurons and wild-type mice (females) seeded with AD patient-derived tau to induce the formation and spreading of tau pathology. Notably, we evaluated the effect of a mouse tau-specific antibody (mTau8) which does not interact with AD&ndash;tau seeds in these models. Our results show that mTau8 crosses the blood&ndash;brain barrier at levels similar to other antibodies and effectively decreases AD&ndash;tau-seeded tau pathology in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, our data suggest that mTau8 binds to endogenous intraneuronal mouse tau, thereby inhibiting the elongation of internalized tau seeds. These findings provide valuable insights into the possible mechanism underlying antibody-based therapies for treating tauopathies.</p>

                <p>Visual information is initially represented in retinotopic coordinates and later in craniotopic coordinates. Psychophysical evidence suggests that visual information is further represented in more general coordinates related to the external world; however, the neural basis of nonegocentric coordinates remains elusive. This study investigates the automatic transformation from egocentric to nonegocentric coordinates in the macaque precuneus (two males, one female), identified by a functional imaging study as a key area for nonegocentric representation. We found that 6.2% of neurons in the precuneus have receptive fields (RFs) anchored to the background rather than to the retina or the head, while 16% had traditional retinotopic RFs. Notably, these two types were not exclusive: many background-centric neurons initially encode a stimulus' position in retinotopic coordinates (up to ~90&nbsp;ms from the stimulus onset) but later shift to background coordinates, peaking at ~150&nbsp;ms. Regarding retinotopic information, the stimulus dominated the initial period, whereas the background dominated the later period. In the absence of a background, there is a dramatic surge in retinotopic information about the stimulus during the later phase, clearly delineating two distinct periods of retinotopic encoding: one focusing on the figure to be attended and another on the background. These findings suggest that the initial retinotopic information of the stimulus is combined with the background retinotopic information in a subsequent stage, yielding a more stable representation of the stimulus relative to the background through time-division multiplexing.</p>

                <p>The sexual receptivity of female mice, shown as lordosis response, is mainly regulated by estradiol action on estrogen receptor alpha (ER&alpha;) and beta (ER&beta;), depending on the day of the estrous cycle. Previous studies revealed that ER&alpha; in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH) plays an essential role in the induction of lordosis on the day of estrus (Day 1). However, the mechanisms of the transition to nonreceptive states on the day after estrus (Day 2) are not completely understood. In the present study, we investigated the possible role of ER&beta;, which is highly expressed in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), in lordosis expression. We found that ER&beta;-Cre female mice, which were ovariectomized and primed with estradiol and progesterone to mimic the estrous cycle, showed high levels of lordosis on Day 2 when ER&beta;-expressing DRN (DRN-ER&beta;<sup>+</sup>) neuronal activity was chemogenetically suppressed. This finding suggests that excitation of DRN-ER&beta;<sup>+</sup> neurons is necessary for the decline of lordosis on Day 2. Fiber photometry recordings during female&ndash;male behavioral interactions revealed that DRN-ER&beta;<sup>+</sup> neuronal activation in response to male intromission was significantly more prolonged on Day 2 compared with Day 1. Chemogenetic overstimulation of DRN-ER&beta;<sup>+</sup> neurons induced c-Fos expression in brain areas known to be inhibitory for lordosis expression, even though they did not express anterogradely labeled fibers of DRN-ER&beta;<sup>+</sup> cells. These findings collectively suggest that DRN-ER&beta;<sup>+</sup> neuronal excitation serves as an inhibitory modulator and is responsible for the decline in receptivity during nonestrus phases.</p>

                <p><I>SYNGAP1</I> is a high-confidence autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk gene, and mutations in <I>SYNGAP1</I> lead to a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) that presents with epilepsy, ASD, motor developmental delay, and intellectual disability. <I>SYNGAP1</I> codes for Ras/Rap GTP-ase activating protein SynGAP (SynGAP). SynGAP is located in the postsynaptic density of glutamatergic synapses and regulates glutamate receptor trafficking in an activity-dependent manner. In addition to forebrain glutamatergic neurons, <I>Syngap1</I> is highly expressed in the striatum, although the functions of SynGAP in the striatum have not been extensively studied. Here we show that <I>Syngap1</I> is expressed in both direct and indirect pathway striatal projection neurons (dSPNs and iSPNs) in mice of both sexes. In a mouse model of <I>Syngap1</I> haploinsufficiency, dendritic spine density, morphology, and intrinsic excitability are altered primarily in iSPNs, but not dSPNs. At the behavioral level, SynGAP reduction alters striatal-dependent motor learning and goal-directed behavior. Several behavioral phenotypes are reproduced by iSPN-specific <I>Syngap1</I> reduction and, in turn, prevented by iSPN-specific <I>Syngap1</I> rescue. These results establish the importance of SynGAP to striatal neuron function and pinpoint the indirect pathway as a key circuit in the neurobiology of <I>SYNGAP1</I>-related NDD.</p>

                <p>The nervous system contains complex circuits comprising thousands of cell types and trillions of connections. Here, we discuss how the field of "developmental systems neuroscience" combines the molecular and genetic perspectives of developmental neuroscience with the (typically adult-focused) functional perspective of systems neuroscience. This combination of approaches is critical to understanding how a handful of cells eventually produce the wide range of behaviors necessary for survival. Functional circuit development typically lags behind neural connectivity, leading to intermediate stages of neural activity that are either not seen in adults or, if present, are considered pathophysiological. Developmental systems neuroscience examines these intermediate stages of neural activity, mapping out the critical phases and inflection points of neural circuit function to understand how neural activity and behavior emerge across development. Beyond understanding typical development, this approach provides invaluable insight into the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders by identifying when and how functional development diverges between health and disease. We argue that developmental systems neuroscience will identify important periods of neural development, reveal novel therapeutic windows for treatment, and set the stage to answer fundamental questions about the brain in health and disease.</p>

                <p>CD2-associated protein (CD2AP) was identified as a genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). However, it is unclear how CD2AP contributes to LOAD synaptic dysfunction underlying AD memory deficits. We have shown that loss of CD2AP function increases &beta;-amyloid (A&beta;) endocytic production, but it is unknown whether it contributes to synapse dysfunction. As CD2AP is an actin-binding protein, it may also function in F-actin-rich dendritic spines, which are the excitatory postsynaptic compartments. Here, we demonstrate that CD2AP colocalizes with F-actin in dendritic spines of primary mouse cortical neurons of both sexes. Cell-autonomous depletion of CD2AP specifically reduces spine density and volume, resulting in a functional decrease in synapse formation and neuronal network activity. Postsynaptic reexpression of CD2AP, but not blocking A&beta; production, is sufficient to rescue spine density. CD2AP overexpression increases spine density, volume, and synapse formation, while a rare LOAD CD2AP mutation induces aberrant F-actin spine-like protrusions without functional synapses. CD2AP controls postsynaptic actin turnover, with the LOAD mutation in CD2AP decreasing F-actin dynamicity. Our data support that CD2AP risk variants could contribute to LOAD synapse dysfunction by disrupting spine formation and growth by deregulating actin dynamics.</p>

                Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) is a serious and life-threatening complication defined by excessive immune activation. While it’s commonly associated with rheumatic diseases, infections can also trigger MAS, with tuberculosis being a rare but significant cause. This case report discusses a rare occurrence of Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) caused by multifocal tuberculosis in an immunocompromised patient with Crohn’s disease receiving immunosuppressive treatment. The patient is a 26-year-old woman with Crohn’s disease who is being treated with azathioprine. She arrived at the hospital battling persistent abdominal pain, overwhelming fatigue, and fever. Upon examination, splenomegaly and ascites were noted. A chest X-ray revealed bilateral pleural effusion consistent with tuberculosis. A CT scan confirmed the presence of pleural, pericardial, and intraperitoneal fluid. Blood tests indicated pancytopenia, hyperferritinemia, and hypofibrinogenemia. The analysis of ascitic fluid suggested an exudate. The PCR test of the bone marrow aspirate was positive for tuberculosis without rifampicin resistance, and the smear showed hemophagocytosis images. The patient was diagnosed with Macrophage Activation Syndrome secondary to multifocal tuberculosis. This report delves into the complex relationship between MAS and tuberculosis, emphasizing the challenges in diagnosing MAS in such cases and the potential link to tuberculosis. The complex diagnostic landscape of multifocal tuberculosis, which can often mimic malignancies, underscores the importance of promptly detecting and starting anti-tuberculosis interventions for improved clinical outcomes and the prevention of associated complications.

                This case report presents a complex case of a 65-year-old female with a history of hypertension and a family history of polycystic kidney disease and Fabry disease presented with acute pancreatitis and subsequent renal insufficiency. Despite initial corticosteroid therapy for immuno-allergic nephropathy, the patient’s condition deteriorated with the development of a skin rash, uremic syndrome, and neurological symptoms. A renal biopsy revealed cellular crescents and cytoplasmic vacuolization in podocytes and tubular cells. Genetic testing confirmed a GLA gene mutation, consistent with Fabry disease. While undergoing treatment with cyclophosphamide, the patient experienced severe allergic reactions, ultimately leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome and fatal outcome. Despite the Fabry disease variant being primarily associated with cardiac involvement, renal involvement was evident. This case highlights the rarity of this co-occurrence, the diagnostic challenges, the importance of genetic factors in autoimmune kidney diseases, and the impact of drug allergies on patient management.

                Electrocardiograms (ECGs) can be affected by various factors and technical problems. It is rare for an artefact to be the cause of ST-segment elevation, especially in asymptomatic patients. An important distinction between true ST segment elevation caused by myocardial infarction and an artefact is that the baseline elevation in an artefact may begin before or after the appearance of the QRS complex. When confronted with an abnormal ECG with suspicious waveform contours and possibly only one completely normal limb leads, the diagnosis of arterial pulse artefact should be considered. It is important to exclude subjective assessments unless they are clearly labelled as such.

                Background At the international level, the survival of exporting companies represents a critical issue in a context of heightened uncertainty and intensified competition within the framework of the country’s commercial opening. This is a context in which different companies are born and die as a result of the interaction between the market and other factors. The objective of this research was to analysis of the survival of exporting agricultural companies in Peru, 2009-2019. To this end, data from the Commission for the Promotion of Peru for Exports and Tourism (Promperu) was utilised. Methods The methodological contribution of the research is based on the quantitative approach, of basic type with a descriptive elk; being the population that involves a total of data of the agricultural exporting companies of Peru in the period 2009-2019 and the sample is census and the non-parametric statistical technique used was the Kaplan Meier estimate for the estimation of the survival rate. Results Exports of Peru’s non-traditional agricultural sector in FOB value have had an average annual growth of 12% in terms of FOB value and 9% in terms of volume exported; the entry rate of new agro-exporting agricultural companies reached an average growth of 2.3% and the exit rate reached an average of 2.2% in the period 2009-2019. Conclusions The survival of exporting companies in the non-traditional agricultural sector is critical, where 89% of them survive only one year, while in the second year only 75% survive and in the sixth year only 33% survive.

                Background Cerebral palsy (CP) is a neurological disorder that can affect motor skills and psychophysiological well-being. Virtual Reality Exercise (VRE) improves cognitive and physical outcomes in patients with CP. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of VRE on attention, vigor, and decision-making abilities in adolescents with CP. Methods A randomized controlled trial was conducted. The intervention consisted of a single 40-minute session of VRE compared to TE conducted in a controlled laboratory environment. Results Fourteen participants (42.9 % female) were included in this analysis. The results indicated that VRE had a statistically significant positive effect on attention and vigor compared to TE. While participants in the VRE group exhibited enhanced attention levels and reported elevated levels of vigor subsequent to the exercise sessions, the memory results did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions The findings suggest that VRE is an effective intervention for improving attention and vigor in adolescents with CP. Registration Pan African Clinical Trial Registry (PACTR202308598603482; 31/08/2023). The trial was reported in accordance with the CONSORT reporting guidelines.

                Background Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of death worldwide with over 90% of reported cases occurring in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Pre-treatment loss to follow-up (PTLFU) is a key contributor to TB mortality and infection transmission. Objectives We performed a scoping review to map available evidence on interventions to reduce PTLFU in adults with pulmonary TB, identify gaps in existing knowledge, and develop a conceptual framework to guide intervention implementation. Methods We searched eight electronic databases up to February 6 2024, medRxiv for pre-prints, and reference lists of included studies. Two review authors independently selected studies and extracted data using a predesigned form. We analysed data descriptively, presented findings in a narrative summary and developed a conceptual framework based on the Practical, Robust Implementation, and Sustainability Model to map the factors for effective intervention implementation. Results We reviewed 1262 records and included 17 studies. Most studies were randomized controlled trials (8/17, 47%). Intervention barriers included stigma and inadequate resources; enablers included mobile phones and TB testing and results on the same day. We identified eight interventions that reduced PTLFU: treatment support groups; mobile notifications; community health workers; integrated HIV/TB services; Xpert MTB/RIF as the initial diagnostic test; computer-aided detection with chest radiography screening; active linkage to care; and multi-component strategies. Conclusion Given the variation of healthcare settings, TB programs should consider contextual factors such as user acceptability, political commitment, resources, and infrastructure before adopting an intervention. Future research should utilize qualitative study designs, be people-centred, and include social and economic factors affecting PTLFU.

                This work is an application of experimental temperature data previously collected in a residential building in Douala, Cameroon, in order to analyze thermal discomfort. The data was collected according to three occupancy scenarios over 12 month period using thermohygrometer sensors. The temperature data are analysed in comparison with the comfortable temperature range from 24°C to 28°C. The degree hour (DH) method was used to assess the severity of thermal discomfort in a hot and humid climate. The results reveal that the open C1, closed C2 and inhabited C3 rooms corresponding to scenarios C1, C2 and C3 respectively, have 7270.6°H, 9063.9°H and 10023°H. The inhabited room C3 has the largest DH and although the room C1 has the smallest DH, the latter largely exceeded the tolerable limit value of 1250°H set by the RE2020 Environmental Regulations. Results from this work can serve in building modelling for researchers and architects to act for the alleviation of thermal discomfort in regions with hot and humid climate.

A study to evaluate the practicality of using plants in reducing formaldehyde levels [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Formaldehyde a commonly used embalming fluid for the preservation of cadavers, produces numerous short and long-term side effects on the students and staff working with it. Indoor plants have been shown to reduce atmospheric formaldehyde levels. The purpose of the study was to compare the efficacy of indoor plants in reducing formaldehyde levels in ambient air to levels deemed safe by WHO standards Methods The study was conducted in the storage room of the Anatomical dissection hall. 7 potted plants of one variety were kept in the storage room for 14 days and the Formaldehyde reading was measured using a VOC (Volatile Organic Compound) monitor. Then the same was done with no plant. This cycle was repeated 2 more times, with two different plant species. The three spieces of plants used for this study were as follows: Dracaena trifasciata, Epipremnum aureum, Spathiphyllum. Results The results were analysed and compared and it was determined that the effect of having a plant present versus having no plant present on the Formaldehyde concentration in the air was inconclusive as Dracaena trifasciata failed to reject the null hypothesis altogether (p-value>0.05), while Epipremnum aureum and Spathiphyllum rejected the null hypothesis (p-value<0.05), however they both had a weak positive correlation with formaldehyde concentration. Conclusion The efficacy of indoor plants in reducing formaldehyde levels in ambient air needs to be further explored and validated since all the prior studies conducted were in controlled environment and should be done in a real time scenario for its practical and beneficial uses.

The prevalent itching condition associated with aging, historically referred to as senile pruritus, diminishes quality of life. Despite its impact, effective treatments remain elusive, largely due to an incomplete understanding of its pathological cause. In this study, we reveal a subset of dorsal root ganglion neurons enriched with Zn<sup>2+</sup> that express the vesicular Zn<sup>2+</sup> transporter TMEM163. These neurons form direct synapses with and modulate the activity of spinal NPY<sup>+</sup> inhibitory interneurons. In aged mice, both the expression of TMEM163 and the concentration of vesicular Zn<sup>2+</sup> within the central terminals of TMEM163<sup>+</sup> primary afferents show marked elevation. Importantly, the excessive release of vesicular Zn<sup>2+</sup> significantly dampens the activity of NPY<sup>+</sup> neurons, triggering the disinhibition of itch-transmitting neural circuits and resulting in chronic itch. Intriguingly, chelating Zn<sup>2+</sup> within the spinal dorsal horn effectively relieves itch in aged mice. Our study thus unveils a novel molecular mechanism underlying senile pruritus.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1435/v1?src=rss">Evaluating the Efficacy of Targeted Muscle Reinnervation (TMR) in Extremities Amputations of Pedis Squamous Cell Carcinoma: A Comprehensive Systematic Review, Meta-Analysis, and Meta-regression of Functional and Pain Outcomes [version 1; peer review: awai</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Targeted Muscle Reinnervation (TMR) is an innovative surgical procedure initially designed for upper-limb amputations, which has shown growing potential for improving functional outcomes in below-knee amputees. TMR involves redirecting severed nerves from the amputated limb to nearby residual muscles, allowing these muscles to act as amplifiers for nerve signals, thereby improving prosthetic control. Recent advancements in TMR for below-knee amputations have highlighted its ability to reduce post-amputation complications, such as neuroma pain and phantom limb pain, while offering enhanced control over prosthetic limbs, thus improving mobility and quality of life. Methods Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic review was conducted, sourcing studies up to May 2024 from PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Springer, and Epistemonikos. The analysis included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and clinical trials. A meta-analysis was performed to assess phantom limb pain reduction, while study quality was evaluated using RoB 2.0, ROBINS-I, and ROBINS-E. Meta-regression examined the influence of variables such as age and sex on pain outcomes. Results Seven studies, including 363 patients, were analyzed. The meta-analysis showed that TMR significantly reduced phantom limb pain (MD: -1.74; 95% CI: -2.46 to -1.02; P<0.00001; I2=0%). However, the pooled risk ratio for phantom pain incidence (RR: 1.58; 95% CI: 0.61 to 4.11; P=0.35; I2=93%) indicated variable outcomes. Conclusion TMR significantly reduces phantom limb pain and improves prosthetic control, particularly for patients with SCC of the foot, ultimately enhancing their quality of life.

                A recent study by Kaneko and colleagues provides evidence that developing cranial motor neurons in larval zebrafish refine their input specificity over time, using an activity-dependent mechanism that may depend, in part, on adaptive dendrite extension. These findings illuminate the mechanism by which spatially overlapping motor pools are recruited into distinct motor circuits.

                Naderi and Kwak et al. developed IPAA, an integrated cellular/bioinformatics platform. IPAA derisks drug discovery by integrating Alzheimer’s brain gene expression with cellular model functional readouts. By identifying and drugging the p38 MAPK-MK2 axis as a therapeutic target, and so reducing human neuronal pathology, IPAA is validated for drug discovery.

                Thirst and salt appetite are critical for maintaining fluid balance. In this review, Grove and Knight discuss how fluid imbalances are sensed at a molecular level and how these signals converge on brain circuits to drive water and salt consumption.

                Lu et al. explore the mechanism of sorafenib resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma, showing that carbonic anhydrase 2 facilitates sorafenib resistance by counteracting MCT4-mediated pHi dysregulation under sorafenib treatment. These findings show a relationship between pHi homeostasis and sorafenib therapy, offering a potential strategy to overcome sorafenib resistance.

                Basal ganglia dysfunction potentially causes behavioral alterations in ASD. Carbonell-Roig et al. show that the eIF4E Tg mouse model of ASD exhibits behavioral inflexibility and impaired striatal dopamine release, linked to disrupted β2-nAChR function on DA axons. Thus, altered striatal ACh-DA interactions constitute a cellular basis for ASD-like behavioral inflexibility.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96357">Circadian regulation of endoplasmic reticulum calcium response in cultured mouse astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                The circadian clock, an internal time-keeping system orchestrates 24 hr rhythms in physiology and behavior by regulating rhythmic transcription in cells. Astrocytes, the most abundant glial cells, play crucial roles in CNS functions, but the impact of the circadian clock on astrocyte functions remains largely unexplored. In this study, we identified 412 circadian rhythmic transcripts in cultured mouse cortical astrocytes through RNA sequencing. Gene Ontology analysis indicated that genes involved in Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis are under circadian control. Notably, <i>Herpud1</i> (<i>Herp</i>) exhibited robust circadian rhythmicity at both mRNA and protein levels, a rhythm disrupted in astrocytes lacking the circadian transcription factor, BMAL1. HERP regulated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca<sup>2+</sup> release by modulating the degradation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (ITPRs). ATP-stimulated ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release varied with the circadian phase, being more pronounced at subjective night phase, likely due to the rhythmic expression of ITPR2. Correspondingly, ATP-stimulated cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases were heightened at the subjective night phase. This rhythmic ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> response led to circadian phase-dependent variations in the phosphorylation of Connexin 43 (Ser368) and gap junctional communication. Given the role of gap junction channel (GJC) in propagating Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, we suggest that this circadian regulation of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses could affect astrocytic modulation of synaptic activity according to the time of day. Overall, our study enhances the understanding of how the circadian clock influences astrocyte function in the CNS, shedding light on their potential role in daily variations of brain activity and health.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94000">The BRAIN Initiative data-sharing ecosystem: Characteristics, challenges, benefits, and opportunities</a></h4>

              
                In this paper, we provide an overview and analysis of the BRAIN Initiative data-sharing ecosystem. First, we compare and contrast the characteristics of the seven BRAIN Initiative data archives germane to data sharing and reuse, namely data submission and access procedures and aspects of interoperability. Second, we discuss challenges, benefits, and future opportunities, focusing on issues largely specific to sharing human data and drawing on <i>N</i> = 34 interviews with diverse stakeholders. The BRAIN Initiative-funded archive ecosystem faces interoperability and data stewardship challenges, such as achieving and maintaining interoperability of data and archives and harmonizing research participants’ informed consents for tiers of access for human data across multiple archives. Yet, a benefit of this distributed archive ecosystem is the ability of more specialized archives to adapt to the needs of particular research communities. Finally, the multiple archives offer ample raw material for network evolution in response to the needs of neuroscientists over time. Our first objective in this paper is to provide a guide to the BRAIN Initiative data-sharing ecosystem for readers interested in sharing and reusing neuroscience data. Second, our analysis supports the development of empirically informed policy and practice aimed at making neuroscience data more findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96665">Implicit motor adaptation patterns in a redundant motor task manipulating a stick with both hands</a></h4>

              
                The remarkable ability of the motor system to adapt to novel environments has traditionally been investigated using kinematically non-redundant tasks, such as planar reaching movements. This limitation prevents the study of how the motor system achieves adaptation by altering the movement patterns of our redundant body. To address this issue, we developed a redundant motor task in which participants reached for targets with the tip of a virtual stick held with both hands. Despite the redundancy of the task, participants consistently employed a stereotypical strategy of flexibly changing the tilt angle of the stick depending on the direction of tip movement. Thus, this baseline relationship between tip-movement direction and stick-tilt angle constrained both the physical and visual movement patterns of the redundant system. Our task allowed us to systematically investigate how the motor system implicitly changed both the tip-movement direction and the stick-tilt angle in response to imposed visual perturbations. Both types of perturbations, whether directly affecting the task (tip-movement direction) or not (stick-tilt angle around the tip), drove adaptation, and the patterns of implicit adaptation were guided by the baseline relationship. Consequently, tip-movement adaptation was associated with changes in stick-tilt angle, and intriguingly, even seemingly ignorable stick-tilt perturbations significantly influenced tip-movement adaptation, leading to tip-movement direction errors. These findings provide a new understanding that the baseline relationship plays a crucial role not only in how the motor system controls movement of the redundant system, but also in how it implicitly adapts to modify movement patterns.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93060">Aligned and oblique dynamics in recurrent neural networks</a></h4>

              
                The relation between neural activity and behaviorally relevant variables is at the heart of neuroscience research. When strong, this relation is termed a neural representation. There is increasing evidence, however, for partial dissociations between activity in an area and relevant external variables. While many explanations have been proposed, a theoretical framework for the relationship between external and internal variables is lacking. Here, we utilize recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to explore the question of when and how neural dynamics and the network’s output are related from a geometrical point of view. We find that training RNNs can lead to two dynamical regimes: dynamics can either be aligned with the directions that generate output variables, or oblique to them. We show that the choice of readout weight magnitude before training can serve as a control knob between the regimes, similar to recent findings in feedforward networks. These regimes are functionally distinct. Oblique networks are more heterogeneous and suppress noise in their output directions. They are furthermore more robust to perturbations along the output directions. Crucially, the oblique regime is specific to recurrent (but not feedforward) networks, arising from dynamical stability considerations. Finally, we show that tendencies toward the aligned or the oblique regime can be dissociated in neural recordings. Altogether, our results open a new perspective for interpreting neural activity by relating network dynamics and their output.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97188">Attentional modulation of secondary somatosensory and visual thalamus of mice</a></h4>

              
                Each sensory modality has its own primary and secondary thalamic nuclei. While the primary thalamic nuclei are well understood to relay sensory information from the periphery to the cortex, the role of secondary sensory nuclei is elusive. We trained head-fixed mice to attend to one sensory modality while ignoring a second modality, namely to attend to touch and ignore vision, or vice versa. Arrays were used to record simultaneously from the secondary somatosensory thalamus (POm) and secondary visual thalamus (LP). In mice trained to respond to tactile stimuli and ignore visual stimuli, POm was robustly activated by touch and largely unresponsive to visual stimuli. A different pattern was observed when mice were trained to respond to visual stimuli and ignore touch, with POm now more robustly activated during visual trials. This POm activity was not explained by differences in movements (i.e. whisking, licking, pupil dilation) resulting from the two tasks. Post hoc histological reconstruction of array tracks through POm revealed that subregions varied in their degree of plasticity. LP exhibited similar phenomena. We conclude that behavioral training reshapes activity in secondary thalamic nuclei. Secondary nuclei respond to the same behaviorally relevant, reward-predicting stimuli regardless of stimulus modality.

">Disordered Hippocampal Reactivations Predict Spatial Memory Deficits in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterised by progressive memory decline associated with hippocampal degeneration. However, the specific physiological mechanisms underlying hippocampal dysfunction in AD remain poorly understood and improved knowledge may aid both diagnosis and help identify new avenues for therapeutic intervention. We investigated how disruptions in hippocampal reactivations relate to place cell stability and spatial memory deficits in an AD mouse model. Using the APP knock-in mouse model 'NL-G-F', we conducted simultaneous behavioural and electrophysiological recordings in a radial arm maze. NL-G-F mice exhibited significant impairments in memory performance, demonstrated by an increased propensity to revisit arms, compared to wild-type controls. These memory deficits were associated with a reduction in the stability of hippocampal place cells, which occurred over short timescales and was accentuated across rest. While the rate of hippocampal reactivation events during rest was unchanged, the structure of these events was significantly degraded in NL-G-F mice. The decreased structure of reactivations was predictive of decreased stability in place cell firing. These findings suggest that disrupted reactivation sequences may act as a mechanism of memory disorder in AD.

">Distinguishing the activity of adjacent somatosensory nuclei within the brainstem using 3T fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Experimental evidence in animal models indicates that the brainstem plays a major role in sensory modulation. However, mapping functional activity within the human brainstem presents many methodological challenges. These constraints have deterred essential research into human sensory brainstem processing. Here, using a 3T fMRI sequence optimised for the brainstem, combined with uni- and multivariate analysis approaches, we investigated the extent to which functional activity of neighbouring somatosensory nuclei can be delineated in the brainstem, thalamus and primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Whilst traditional univariate approaches offered limited differentiation between adjacent hand and face activation in the brainstem, multivariate classification enabled above-chance decoding of these activity patterns across S1, the thalamus, and the brainstem. Our findings establish a robust methodological approach to explore signal processing within the brainstem and across the entire somatosensory stream. This is a fundamental step towards broadening our understanding of somatosensory processing within humans and determining what changes in sensory integration may occur in clinical populations following sensory deprivation.

">Ciliopathy interacts with neonatal anesthesia to cause non-apoptotic caspase-mediated motor deficits</a></h4>

              
                Increasing evidence suggests that anesthesia may induce developmental neurotoxicity, yet the influence of genetic predispositions associated with congenital anomalies on this toxicity remains largely unknown. Children with congenital heart disease often exhibit mutations in cilia-related genes and ciliary dysfunction, requiring sedation for their catheter or surgical interventions during the neonatal period. Here we demonstrate that briefly exposing ciliopathic neonatal mice to ketamine causes motor skill impairments, which are associated with a baseline deficit in neocortical layer V neuron apical spine density and their altered dynamics during motor learning.. These neuromorphological changes were linked to augmented non-apoptotic neuronal caspase activation. Neonatal caspase suppression rescued the spine density and motor deficits, confirming the requirement for sublethal caspase signaling in appropriate spine formation and motor learning. Our findings suggest that ciliopathy interacts with ketamine to induce motor impairments, which is reversible through caspase inhibition. Furthermore, they underscore the potential for ketamine-induced sublethal caspase responses in shaping neurodevelopmental outcomes.

">Pubertal hormones and the early adolescent female brain: a multimodality brain MRI study</a></h4>

              
                Puberty is a critical developmental process that is associated with changes in steroid hormone levels, which are believed to influence adolescent behaviour via their effects on the developing brain. So far, there are limited and inconsistent findings regarding the relationship between steroid hormones and brain structure and function in adolescent females, with many existing studies employing small sample sizes. Thus, in this study, we explored the association between oestradiol (E2), testosterone (Tes) and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and brain structure (gray matter volume, sulcal depth, cortical thickness and white matter microstructure) and function (resting-state connectivity, emotional n-back task-related function) in 3024 adolescent females (age 8.92 - 13.33 years, mean age (SD) = 10.37 (0.94) years) from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. We used elastic-net regression with cross-validation to investigate associations between hormones and brain phenotypes derived from multiple imaging modalities. We found that structural brain features, including cortical thickness, sulcal depth, and white matter microstructure, were among the most important features associated with hormones. E2 was most strongly associated with prefrontal and premotor regions involved in working memory and emotion processing, while Tes and DHEA were most strongly associated with parietal and occipital regions involved in visuospatial functioning. All three hormones were also associated with prefrontal, temporoparietal junction and insula cortices. Thus, using an advanced methodological approach, this study suggests both unique and overlapping neural correlates of pubertal hormones in adolescent females and sheds light on the mechanisms by which puberty influences adolescent development and behaviour.

">Visuo-Vestibular Integration for Self-Motion: Human Cortical Area V6 Prefers Forward and Congruent Stimuli</a></h4>

              
                BACKGROUND: The integration of visual and vestibular input is crucial for self-motion. Information from both sensory systems merges early in the central nervous system. Among the numerous cortical areas involved in processing this information, some (V6 and VIP) respond specifically to vestibular anteroposterior information. OBJECTIVE: To further understand the involvement of these and other areas in self-motion processing when vestibular and visual information are combined with varying congruence and direction parameters. METHODS: Fifteen subjects underwent an MRI session while receiving visual (optic flow patterns) and galvanic vestibular stimuli mimicking six conditions: (1) visual forward, (2) visual backward, visual forward with (3) congruent or (4) incongruent vestibular information, visual backward with (5) congruent or (6) incongruent vestibular information. RESULTS: The combination of concurrent vestibular stimulation and fully consistant optic flow patterns activated several bilateral cortical areas found predominantly in the insula. Among these vestibular areas and those previously defined in our initial study, the large majority do not show any specifity for the forward/backward direction or for the visuo-vestibular congruency. A notable exception was the parieto-occipital area V6, which showed a marked preference for congruent visuo-vestibular signals and for cues signaling forward motion. CONCLUSIONS: By showing that V6 is more active when visuo-vestibular signals are more ecological (i.e. when both signals specify the most common self-motion direction), our results support the view that this area plays a crucial role in visuo-vestibular integration during self-motion.

">Systemic exposure to COVID-19 virus-like particles modulates firing patterns of cortical neurons in the living mouse brain</a></h4>

              
                Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes a systemic infection that affects the central nervous system. We used virus-like particles (VLPs) to explore how exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 proteins affects brain activity patterns in wild-type (WT) mice and in mice that express the wild-type human tau protein (htau mice). VLP exposure elicited dose-dependent changes in corticosterone and distinct chemokine levels. Longitudinal two-photon microscopy recordings of primary somatosensory and motor cortex neurons that express the jGCaMP7s calcium sensor tracked modifications of neuronal activity patterns following exposure to VLPs. There was a substantial short-term increase in stimulus-evoked activity metrics in both WT and htau VLP-injected mice, while htau mice showed also increased spontaneous activity metrics and increase activity in the vehicle-injected group. Over the following weeks, activity metrics in WT mice subsided, but remained above baseline levels. For htau mice, activity metrics either remain elevated or decreased to lower levels than baseline. Overall, our data suggest that exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 VLPs leads to strong short-term disruption of cortical activity patterns in mice with long-term residual effects. The htau mice, which have a more vulnerable genetic background, exhibited more severe pathobiology that may lead to more adverse outcomes.

">UniSPAC: A Unified Segmentation Framework for Proofreading and Annotation in Connectomics</a></h4>

              
                Reconstructing dense neuronal connections from volume electron microscopy (vEM) images is a critical challenge in neuroscience, driving the development of various automatic neuron segmentation methods. Although current state-of-the-art automated segmentation methods can achieve high segmentation accuracy, they still require substantial manual proofreading and rely heavily on labeled datasets, which are often scarce, particularly for non-model organisms. Here, we introduce a Unified Segmentation framework for Proofreading and Annotation in Connectomics (UniSPAC) by providing the interactive segmentation model in 2D-level and the neuron tracing model in 3D-level. UniSPAC-2D allows users to correct its segmentation errors through point-based prompts, combining segmentation and proofreading in a single framework. UniSPAC-3D automatically traces neurons segmented by UniSPAC-2D across image slices, significantly reducing human involvement. Furthermore, UniSPAC-2D and UniSPAC-3D models can facilitate the semi-automatic generation of labeled data for new species, eliminating the need for external annotation tools. The fresh annotated data generated during proofreading in turn optimizes the interactive model through an online learning strategy, reducing the labeling effort for novel species over time. UniSPAC outperforms the start-of-the-art Segment Anything Model (SAM) in Drosophila segmentation, achieving 47x higher efficiency, and surpasses ACRLSD in cross-species segmentation on zebra finch data.

">Physioxia-modulated mesenchymal stem cells secretome has higher capacity to preserve neuronal network and translation processes in hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in vitro model</a></h4>

              
                Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is one of the leading causes of child death worldwide. Most of the survivors develop various neurological diseases, such as cerebral palsy, seizures, and/or motor and behavioral problems. HIE is caused by an episode of perinatal asphyxia, which interrupts the blood supply to the brain. Due to its high energy demands, this interruption initiates glutamate excitotoxic pathways, leading to cell death. Umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC MSCs) are gaining attention as a promising complement to the current clinical approach, based on therapeutic hypothermia, which has shown limited efficacy. Previous data have shown that priming MSCs under physiological culture conditions, namely soft platforms (3kPa), mechanomodulated, or physiological oxygen levels (5% O2), physioxia, leads to changes in the cellular proteome and their secretome. To evaluate how exposing MSCs to these culture conditions could impact their therapeutic potential, physiologically primed UC MSCs or their secretome were added to an in vitro HIE model using cortical neurons primary cultures subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) insult. By comparing the neuronal proteome of sham, OGD insulted, and OGD-treated neurons, it was possible to identify proteins whose levels were restored in the presence of UC-MSCs or their secretome. Despite the different approaches that differentially altered UC-MSCs proteome and secretome, the effects converged on the re-establishment of the levels of proteins involved in translation mechanisms (such as the 40S and 60s ribosomal subunits), possibly stabilizing proteostasis, which is known to be essential for neuronal recovery. Interestingly, treatment with the secretome of UC-MSC modulated under physioxic conditions sustained part of the neuronal network integrity and modulated several mitochondrial proteins, including those proteins involved in ATP production. This suggests that the unique composition of the physioxia-modulated secretome may offer a therapeutical advantage in restoring essential cellular processes that help neurons maintain their function, compared to traditionally expanded UC-MSCs. These findings suggest that both the presence of UC-MSCs and their secretome alone can influence multiple targets and signaling pathways, collectively promoting neuronal survival following an OGD insult.

                Objective: Cross-sectional data from a sample of older adults with obesity was used to determine how peripheral and neuronal insulin resistance (IR) relate to executive function and functional brain network topology. Methods: Older adults (n=71) with obesity but without type 2 diabetes were included in analyses. Peripheral IR was quantified by HOMA2-IR. Neuronal IR was quantified according to a proposed neuron-derived exosome-based method (NDE-IR). An executive function composite score, summed scores to the Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) trials 1-5, and functional brain networks generated from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging were outcomes in analyses. We used general linear models and a novel regression framework for brain network analysis to identify relationships between IR measures and brain-related outcomes. Results: HOMA2-IR, but not NDE-IR, was negatively associated with executive function. Neither IR measure was associated with AVLT score. Peripheral IR was also related to hippocampal network topology in participants who had undergone functional neuroimaging. Neither peripheral nor neuronal IR were significantly related to network topology of the central executive network. Conclusions: Cognitive and functional imaging effects were observed from HOMA2-IR, but not NDE-IR. The hippocampus may be particularly vulnerable to effects of peripheral IR.

">The Lifespan Evolution of Individualized Neurophysiological Traits</a></h4>

              
                How do neurophysiological traits that characterize individuals evolve across the lifespan? To address this question, we analyzed brief, task-free magnetoencephalographic recordings from over 1,000 individuals aged 4-89. We found that neurophysiological activity is significantly more similar between individuals in childhood than in adulthood, though periodic patterns of brain activity remain reliable markers of individuality across all ages. The cortical regions most critical for determining individuality shift across neurodevelopment and aging, with sensorimotor cortices becoming increasingly prominent in adulthood. These developmental changes in neurophysiology align closely with the expression of cortical genetic systems related to ion transport and neurotransmission, suggesting a growing influence of genetic factors on neurophysiological traits across the lifespan. Notably, this alignment peaks in late adolescence, a critical period when genetic factors significantly shape brain individuality. Overall, our findings highlight the role of sensorimotor regions in defining individual brain traits and reveal how genetic influences on these traits intensify with age. This study advances our understanding of the evolving biological foundations of inter-individual differences.

">A humanized neuronal model system reveals key roles for manganese in neuronal endocytosis, calcium flux and mitochondrial bioenergetics</a></h4>

              
                Manganese (Mn) is an essential trace metal that is necessary for life. Its duality as both a crucial micronutrient and potential neurotoxicant necessitates tight control of intracellular and extracellular Mn levels. Dysregulation of Mn is implicated in a broad range of human diseases, from neurodevelopmental sequelae related to Mn levels in drinking water, to acquired forms of manganism, rare inherited Mn transportopathies and more common disorders such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. Despite the clear association between Mn dysregulation and neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative diseases, the underlying cellular mechanisms that govern neuropathology remain poorly understood. We established an induced pluripotent stem cells-derived midbrain neuronal system from SLC39A14, SLC39A8, and SLC30A10 patients to better understand the neuronal sequelae of Mn dysregulation. By integrating transcriptomic and functional approaches, we show that Mn dyshomeostasis leads to dysregulation of key cellular pathways that are crucial to normal neuronal function, including defects in mitochondrial bioenergetics, calcium signalling, endocytosis, and glycosylation, as well as cellular stress and early neurodegeneration. Our humanized model has enhanced understanding of the role of Mn in the human brain, and the consequences of both acquired and genetic disorders associated with Mn dysregulation. Better understanding of these underlying pathophysiological processes will identify potential targets for future therapeutic intervention.

">White matter microstructure links with brain, bodily and genetic attributes in adolescence, mid- and late life</a></h4>

              
                Advanced diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) allows one to probe and assess brain white matter (WM) organization and microstructure in vivo. Various dMRI models with different theoretical and practical assumptions have been developed, representing partly overlapping characteristics of the underlying brain biology with potentially complementary value in the cognitive and clinical neurosciences. To which degree the different dMRI metrics relate to clinically relevant geno- and phenotypes is still debated. Hence, we investigate how tract-based and whole WM skeleton parameters from different single- and multi-compartment dMRI approaches associate with clinically relevant and white matter-related phenotypes (sex, age, pulse pressure (PP), body-mass-index (BMI), brain asymmetry) and genetic markers in the UK Biobank (UKB, n=52,140) and the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (n=5,844). Multi-compartment dMRI approaches provided the strongest WM associations with age, and unique insights into brain asymmetry. Kurtosis was most indicative of PP and BMI. WM-based sex classifications and polygenic score associations for common psychiatric disorders and Alzheimer's disease were similar across diffusion approaches. We conclude that WM microstructure is differentially associated with clinically relevant pheno- and genotypes at different points in life. Multi-compartment dMRI approaches, and particularly the examined Bayesian approach, provide additional information to conventional approaches in such examinations.

Result: PyrGC/MS detected large amounts of plastics and we deterined their cellular locations with a novel optical imaging approach in regions with small vessel disease and Abeta plaques. Impact: Microplastics in the brains of people with cognitive impairment may be due to pre-existing vascular injury or contribute to it.

">Exploring Neural Dynamics in the Auditory Telencephalon of Crows using Functional Ultrasound Imaging</a></h4>

              
                Crows, known for advanced cognitive abilities and vocal communication, rely on intricate auditory systems. While the neuroanatomy of corvid auditory pathways is partially explored, the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms are largely unknown. This study used functional ultrasound imaging (fUSi) to investigate sound-induced cerebral blood volume (CBV) changes in the field L complex of the crow's auditory telencephalon, a functional analogue to the mammalian auditory cortex. FUSi revealed frequency-specific CBV responses, showing a tonotopic organization within the field L complex, with low frequencies in the posterior-dorsal region and high frequencies in the anterior-ventral region, similar to neuronal patterns reported in other songbirds. The responses were more robust when the crows were awake compared to when they were anesthetized. Machine learning analyses showed fUSi signals could be used to classify sound types accurately. Shorter stimuli reliably triggered transient CBV increases, while longer sounds resulted in variable responses, including negative deflections. This variability in CBV responses suggests a delineation of subregions within the field L complex with the central region (L2) as the primary processing hub and outer regions (L1, L3) integrating auditory information. These findings highlight the potential of fUSi for providing high-resolution insights into functional systems in corvids, enabling future exploration of task-related cognitive dynamics.

">Dynamic consensus-building between neocortical areas via long-range connections</a></h4>

              
                The neocortex is organized into functionally specialized areas. While the functions and underlying neural circuitry of individual neocortical areas are well studied, it is unclear how these regions operate collectively to form percepts and implement cognitive processes. In particular, it remains unknown how distributed, potentially conflicting computations can be reconciled. Here we show that the reciprocal excitatory connections between cortical areas orchestrate neural dynamics to facilitate the gradual emergence of a 'consensus' across areas. We investigated the joint neural dynamics of primary (V1) and higher-order lateromedial (LM) visual areas in mice, using simultaneous multi-area electrophysiological recordings along with focal optogenetic perturbations to causally manipulate neural activity. We combined mechanistic circuit modeling with state-of-the-art data-driven nonlinear system identification, to construct biologically-constrained latent circuit models of the data that we could further interrogate. This approach revealed that long-range, reciprocal excitatory connections between V1 and LM implement an approximate line attractor in their joint dynamics, which promotes activity patterns encoding the presence of the stimulus consistently across the two areas. Further theoretical analyses revealed that the emergence of line attractor dynamics is a signature of a more general principle governing multi-area network dynamics: reciprocal inter-area excitatory connections reshape the dynamical landscape of the network, specifically slowing down the decay of activity patterns that encode stimulus features congruently across areas, while accelerating the decay of inconsistent patterns. This selective dynamic amplification leads to the emergence of multi-dimensional consensus between cortical areas about various stimulus features. Our analytical framework further predicted the timescales of specific activity patterns across areas, which we directly verified in our data. Therefore, by linking the anatomical organization of inter-area connections to the features they reconcile across areas, our work introduces a general theory of multi-area computation.

">Differential effects of statins on the anti-dyskinetic activity of sub-anesthetic ketamine</a></h4>

              
                Sub-anesthetic ketamine has been demonstrated to reduce abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) in preclinical models of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) and retrospective Parkinson's disease case reports. In this study, we examined the effects on L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia of two statins alone and in combination with ketamine in unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned male rats, the standard preclinical LID model. Sub-anesthetic ketamine attenuated the development of AIMs, while lovastatin only showed anti-dyskinetic activity at the beginning of the priming but did not prevent the development of LID. The polar pravastatin blocked the long-term anti-dyskinetic effects of ketamine, while the non-polar lovastatin did not. This study shows different classes of statins affect LID differentially, points to an important drug interaction and further supports ongoing clinical testing of sub-anesthetic ketamine to treat LID in individuals with Parkinson's disease.

">Chemotagging: a chemogenetic approach for identifying cell types with in vivo calcium imaging</a></h4>

              
                The ability to monitor the activity of specific cell types in vivo is critical for understanding the complex interplay between various neuronal populations driving freely moving behavior. Existing methods, such as optogenetic tagging (i.e., Optotagging), have proven useful for identifying cell types in in vivo electrophysiological recordings during freely moving behavior. However, electrophysiological recordings are limited in their capacity to track the same neuronal populations across long periods of time (days to weeks). Single-photon miniscope imaging offers the advantage of tracking the same cells across weeks to months; however, it is difficult to distinguish different cell types within the recorded population. Here, we present "chemotagging," a technique that allows for the identification of specific cell types in in vivo calcium imaging recordings. This protocol offers a method for tagging cell types with chemogenetic tools like Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs), while simultaneously recording calcium activity from a pan-neuronal population with calcium indicators. We highlight the key advantages and limitations of chemotagging and its potential implications for neuroscience research.

">Individual differences in the effects of musical familiarity and musical features on brain activity during relaxation</a></h4>

              
                Finding a way to relax is increasingly difficult in our overstimulating modern society and chronic stress can have severe psychological and physiological consequences. Music is a promising tool to promote relaxation by lowering heart rate, modulating mood and thoughts, and providing a sense of safety. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate how music influence brain activity during relaxation with a particular focus on the participants' experience of different types of music. In a 2x2 design, 57 participants were scanned while rating how relaxed they felt after listening to 28-second excerpts of either familiar or unfamiliar relaxation music with calm or energetic features. Behaviourally, calm music was the strongest predictor of relaxation, followed by familiar music. fMRI results revealed activations of auditory, motor, emotion, and memory areas, for listening to familiar compared to unfamiliar music. This suggests increased audio-motor synchronization and participant engagement of known music. Listening to unfamiliar music was correlated with attention-related brain activity, suggesting increased attentional load for this music. Behaviourally, we identified four clusters of participants based on their relaxation response to the different types of music. These groups also displayed distinct auditory and motor activity patterns, suggesting that the behavioural responses are linked to changes in music processing. Interestingly, some individuals found energetic music to be relaxing if it is familiar, whereas others only found calm music to be relaxing. Such individual behavioural and neurological differences in relaxation responses to music emphasise the importance of developing personalised music-based interventions.

">Rac1 inhibition prevents axonal cytoskeleton dysfunction in Transthyretin Amyloid Polyneuropathy</a></h4>

              
                Transthyretin Amyloid Polyneuropathy (ATTR-PN) is characterized by the deposition of amyloidogenic TTR, particularly in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and peripheral nerve axons, resulting in sensory axonopathy. Here, we investigated the role of cytoskeleton alterations in peripheral axons from an ATTR-PN mouse model and searched for genetic modifiers in human patient samples. We employed the hTTRA97S knock-in mouse model for ATTR-PN to examine cellular and molecular changes in peripheral axons. Our approach combined proteomic analysis of the sural nerve, live imaging techniques, and pharmacological intervention targeting Rac1. Additionally, DNA samples from individuals diagnosed with early- and late-onset ATTR-PN were analyzed to identify genetic variants in Rac1 and specific regulators potentially associated with the disease-onset. Guided by proteomics of the sural nerve of hTTRA97S mice, which revealed dysregulation of actin-related proteins, we investigated actin organization in mutant neurons. We found a defective actin distribution in growth cones from hTTRA97S DRG neurons, along with a reduction in axonal actin trails, and an associated impairment in the pool of pre-synaptic vesicles. Additionally, microtubule dynamics and axonal transport abnormalities were observed in mutant axons. Importantly, cytoskeletal defects in hTTRA97S neurons preceded axonal degeneration and were mediated by Rac1. Hyperactivation of Rac1 was observed in both hTTRA97S DRG neurites and sciatic nerves of pre-symptomatic mice, and its inhibition rescued cytoskeleton alterations, preventing subsequent degeneration. Remarkably, in ATTR-PN patients with late-onset disease, we identified a variant in the RACGAP1 gene, which encodes for a specific Rac1 inactivator, further supporting the neuroprotective role of Rac1 inhibition. Our findings demonstrate that cytoskeletal defects precede axonal degeneration in ATTR-PN and highlight Rac1 as a promising therapeutic target. The identification of a protective genetic variant in patients corroborates this potential, suggesting a new avenue for therapeutic intervention in ATTR-PN.

">Pupil size variations reveal Bayesian inference in cognitive arithmetic</a></h4>

              
                The assumption that the brain relies on Bayesian inference has been successful in accounting for many behavioural and neurophysiological observations, but to date, dependence on such mechanism has not been assessed in the context of arithmetic. Bayesian inference implies the representation of uncertainty and reliance on prior beliefs. In arithmetic problem solving, it would consist in refining prior knowledge about the response range as the system progressively integrates the numerical information conveyed by the operands. Within this framework, the amount of information needed to progress from a prior to a posterior probability distribution over responses can be quantified by the information gain, which would relate to the cognitive workload of the task. To test this hypothesis, we designed three experiments in which participants computed the sum of two numbers presented one after another through headphones. In each experiment, the information about response predictability conveyed by the first operand was manipulated. The first operand was either highly informative and contributed to narrow down the response range, or poorly informative and conveyed little information about a plausible response. Throughout all experiments, we found that pupil-related arousal signalled the information gain associated with the first operand, indicating that participants already updated the probability distribution of possible responses upon hearing that first stimulus. This finding shows that Bayesian inference is central to arithmetic problem solving and that information gains consecutive to the integration of the operands can be tracked over time through pupillometry.

">Sensory Entrained TMS (seTMS) enhances motor cortex excitability</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied to the motor cortex has revolutionized the study of motor physiology in humans. Despite this, TMS-evoked electrophysiological responses show significant variability, due in part to inconsistencies between TMS pulse timing and ongoing brain oscillations. Variable responses to TMS limit mechanistic insights and clinical efficacy, necessitating the development of methods to precisely coordinate the timing of TMS pulses to the phase of relevant oscillatory activity. We introduce Sensory Entrained TMS (seTMS), a novel approach that uses musical rhythms to synchronize brain oscillations and time TMS pulses to enhance cortical excitability. Focusing on the sensorimotor alpha rhythm, a neural oscillation associated with motor cortical inhibition, we examine whether rhythm-evoked sensorimotor alpha phase alignment affects primary motor cortical (M1) excitability in healthy young adults (n=33). We first confirmed using electroencephalography (EEG) that passive listening to musical rhythms desynchronizes inhibitory sensorimotor brain rhythms (mu oscillations) around 200 ms before auditory rhythmic events (27 participants). We then targeted this optimal time window by delivering single TMS pulses over M1 200 ms before rhythmic auditory events while recording motor-evoked potentials (MEPs; 19 participants), which resulted in significantly larger MEPs compared to standard single pulse TMS and an auditory control condition. Neither EEG measures during passive listening nor seTMS-induced MEP enhancement showed dependence on musical experience or training. These findings demonstrate that seTMS effectively enhances corticomotor excitability and establishes a practical, cost-effective method for optimizing non-invasive brain stimulation outcomes.

">Rapid Semantic Processing: An MEG Study of Narrative Text Reading</a></h4>

              
                Research has shown that semantic analysis occurs at early stages of word processing (less than 200 ms). While traditional studies have focused on isolated words/sentences, our research explores rapid semantic processing during reading stories using event-related potentials and magnetoencephalography. We employed the rapid serial visual presentation paradigm to present texts word by word. Each word presentation lasted 150 ms, enhancing rapid semantic processing. We computed semantic dissimilarity (SD) values for each word and categorized them into quartiles to investigate their effect on brain responses. Our analysis revealed significant ERP differences within early time windows (120-132 ms). Two distinct clusters were identified: positive in the right occipital region and negative in the left temporal region. In both clusters less pronounced responses were registered for words with lowest SD which corresponds to theories of predictive coding. These findings broaden our understanding of rapid semantic processing and suggest new methodology.

">Born Connected: Do Infants Already Have Adult-Like Multi-Scale Connectivity Networks?</a></h4>

              
                The human brain undergoes remarkable development with the first six postnatal months witnessing the most dramatic structural and functional changes, making this period critical for in-depth research. rsfMRI studies have identified intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs), including the default mode network, in infants. Although early formation of these networks has been suggested, the specific identification and number of ICNs reported in infants vary widely, leading to inconclusive findings. In adults, ICNs have provided valuable insights into brain function, spanning various mental states and disorders. A recent study analyzed data from over 100,000 subjects and generated a template of 105 multi-scale ICNs enhancing replicability and generalizability across studies. Yet, the presence of these ICNs in infants has not been investigated. This study addresses this significant gap by evaluating the presence of these multi-scale ICNs in infants, offering critical insight into the early stages of brain development and establishing a baseline for longitudinal studies. To accomplish this goal, we employ two sets of analyses. First, we employ a fully data-driven approach to investigate the presence of these ICNs from infant data itself. Towards this aim, we also introduce burst independent component analysis (bICA), which provides reliable and unbiased network identification. The results reveal the presence of these multi-scale ICNs in infants, showing a high correlation with the template (rho > 0.5), highlighting the potential for longitudinal continuity in such studies. We next demonstrate that reference-informed ICA-based techniques can reliably estimate these ICNs in infants, highlighting the feasibility of leveraging the NeuroMark framework for robust brain network extraction. This approach not only enhances cross-study comparisons across lifespans but also facilitates the study of brain changes across different age ranges. In summary, our study highlights the novel discovery that the infant brain already possesses ICNs that are widely observed in older cohorts.

">Changes in interlimb coordination induced by within-stride changes in treadmill speed</a></h4>

              
                During walking, interlimb coordination involves the right and left legs working together to achieve a desired movement. Previously, dynamic treadmill walking has been shown to drive asymmetric gait changes in healthy young adults through selectively changing the speed of the whole treadmill. Currently, the coordination demands of this novel walking environment are unknown and must be understood prior to assessing dynamic treadmill walking in clinical populations. We investigated the interlimb coordination requirements of dynamic treadmill walking in ten healthy young adults. We quantified interlimb coordination changes as phase shift (the time for a maximum cross-correlation between limb angle trajectories of the left and right legs), center of oscillation (limb angle at midstance), and center of oscillation difference (oscillation angle difference between legs). We found that phase shift in the Fast trial (i.e., 1.0m/s treadmill speed in first 50% of gait cycle, 0.5m/s in latter 50%) was significantly more positive (i.e., the right leg oscillates ahead of the left leg in time) than in the Slow, Accelerate, and Decelerate conditions (all p<0.01). The Fast trial produced significantly positive center of oscillation values on the right leg, indicating that the right leg is oscillating about a more flexed axis than the left. Center of oscillation difference was similarly more positive during the Fast trial than in the Decelerate (p<0.01) and Slow (p<0.01) trials. These results exemplify that some forms of dynamic treadmill walking change interlimb coordination to a greater extent than others. After several minutes of dynamic treadmill walking, interlimb coordination is changed relative to baseline walking in the spatial domain (Fast and Decelerate conditions) and the temporal domain (Fast and Slow). Therefore, dynamic treadmill walking is tunable in both biomechanical and interlimb coordination parameters, creating a variety of options for restoring gait symmetry in asymmetric populations.

However, existing commercial systems have limitations in flexibility and extensibility for research applications. We present new open-source software for neuronavigated non-invasive brain stimulation (NaviNIBS) that provides comprehensive functionality for TMS experiments. NaviNIBS supports imaging data import, target planning, head registration, real-time tool tracking, and integration with robotic positioning and electrophysiology systems. Key features include flexible target specification, support for multiple tracking hardware options, refined head registration techniques, and an extensible addon system. We describe the software architecture, core functionality, characterization of tracking performance, and example applications of NaviNIBS. This software aims to facilitate methodological improvements and novel experimental paradigms in noninvasive brain stimulation research.

                Recent technological developments in molecular biology led to large data sets providing new insights into the molecular organisation of cells. To fully exploit their potential, these developments have to be complemented by computer simulations that allow to gain in-depth understanding on molecular principles. We developed the Python-based, reaction-diffusion simulator PyRID, integrating many features for the efficient simulation of molecular biological systems. Amongst others, PyRID is capable of simulating unimolecular and bimolecular reactions as well as pairinteractions to assess the dynamics resulting from individual interacting proteins to polydisperse substrates consisting of many different molecules. Furthermore, PyRID supports mesh-based compartments and surface diffusion of particles, enabling analyses of the interaction between (trans-)membrane proteins with intra- and extracellular proteins. PyRID is written entirely in Python, which is a programming language being known for its readability and easy accessibility, such that the scientific community can easily extend PyRID to its current and future needs.

However, its efficacy and mechanisms in enhancing cognitive function in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment compared with traditional repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation paradigms remain unclear. This study recruited 48 amnestic mild cognitive impairment patients, assigning them to intermittent theta burst stimulation, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, and sham groups (5 times/wk for 4 wk). Neuropsychological assessments and functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected pre- and post-treatment. Regarding efficacy, both angular gyrus intermittent theta burst stimulation and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation significantly improved general cognitive function and memory compared to the sham group, with no significant difference between the 2 treatment groups. Mechanistically, significant changes in brain activity within the temporoparietal network were observed in both the intermittent theta burst stimulation and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation groups, and these changes correlated with improvements in general cognitive and memory functions. Additionally, intermittent theta burst stimulation showed stronger modulation of functional connectivity between the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and temporal regions compared to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. The intermittent theta burst stimulation and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation can improve cognitive function in amnestic mild cognitive impairment patients, but intermittent theta burst stimulation may offer higher efficiency. Intermittent theta burst stimulation and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation likely enhance cognitive function, especially memory function, by modulating the temporoparietal network.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Language production in bilinguals relies on the collaborative interaction between two neural systems: the language control system (e.g. the right inferior frontal gyrus) and the language processing system (e.g. the left superior temporal gyrus). However, the causal mapping between these brain systems and their cognitive functions, as well as the temporal dynamics between these two systems during bilingual language production, remain unclear. To investigate this, our study applied online transcranial magnetic stimulation to the right inferior frontal gyrus and left superior temporal gyrus in Chinese–English bilinguals performing a language-switching task. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was administered within seven 100 ms time windows (TW1 to TW7) following the picture onset. We observed time window–specific enhancements of language control, as shown by a significant reduction in switching costs upon the stimulations on both sites relative to the sham stimulation: specifically, the right inferior frontal gyrus at TW1, TW2, TW4, and TW5 and the left superior temporal gyrus at TW2 and TW5. These findings indicate a double-strike top–down control mechanism underpinned by the pathway from the right inferior frontal gyrus to the right inferior frontal gyrus, potentially during both stages during production: the language task schema and the lemma selection. Our study provides the first evidence of the dynamic interactions between language control and processing systems causally underpinning bilingual language production.</span>

	<p>Schizophrenia, a highly complex psychiatric disorder, presents significant challenges in diagnosis and treatment due to its multifaceted neurobiological underpinnings. Recent advancements in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and artificial intelligence (AI) have revolutionized the understanding and management of this condition. This manuscript explores how the integration of these technologies has unveiled key insights into schizophrenia&amp;amp;rsquo;s structural and functional neural anomalies. fMRI research highlights disruptions in crucial brain regions like the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, alongside impaired connectivity within networks such as the default mode network (DMN). These alterations correlate with the cognitive deficits and emotional dysregulation characteristic of schizophrenia. AI techniques, including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), have enhanced the detection and analysis of these complex patterns, surpassing traditional methods in precision. Algorithms such as support vector machines (SVMs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) have proven particularly effective in identifying biomarkers and aiding early diagnosis. Despite these advancements, challenges such as variability in methodologies and the disorder&amp;amp;rsquo;s heterogeneity persist, necessitating large-scale, collaborative studies for clinical translation. Moreover, ethical considerations surrounding data integrity, algorithmic transparency, and patient individuality must guide AI&amp;amp;rsquo;s integration into psychiatry. Looking ahead, AI-augmented fMRI holds promise for tailoring personalized interventions, addressing unique neural dysfunctions, and improving therapeutic outcomes for individuals with schizophrenia. This convergence of neuroimaging and computational innovation heralds a transformative era in precision psychiatry.</p>

	<p>Background: The aim of this study is to use an eye tracker to compare the understanding of three forms of implicitness (i.e., presupposition, conversational implicatures, and irony) in 139 pupils from the first to the fifth year of elementary school. Methods: The child was invited to read short texts composed of a context about some characters and a target sentence conveying one of the three kinds of implicitness. After that, there was a comprehension yes/no question to check whether the child had understood the implicit content of the target sentence. At the same time eye, movements were recorded by a remote system (Pro Fusion by Tobii). The number of correct answers, the duration, and the number of fixations on the texts were measured. Results: We showed that children&amp;amp;rsquo;s reading time is positively correlated with the accurate comprehension of implicitness, and that children similarly understand the three types of implicitness. Furthermore, the number and the duration of fixations depend both on the age of the children and on their good or poor understanding of the implicit contents. This fact is particularly noticeable for children in the first-grade class, for whom fixations are significantly longer and more frequent when they correctly understand sentences containing implicitness. Conclusion: These results argue in favor of the possibility of teaching the comprehension of some types of implicitness (presupposition, implicature, and irony) from an early age.</p>

	<p>Background: Electroencephalogram (EEG) biomarkers with adequate sensitivity and specificity to reflect the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s health status can become indispensable for health monitoring during prolonged missions in space. The objective of our study was to assess whether the basic features of the posterior dominant rhythm (PDR) change under microgravity conditions compared to earth-based scalp EEG recordings. Methods: Three crew members during the 16-day AXIOM-1 mission to the International Space Station (ISS), underwent scalp EEG recordings before, during, and after the mission by means of a dry-electrode self-donning headgear designed to support long-term EEG recordings in space. Resting-state recordings were performed with eyes open and closed during relaxed wakefulness. The electrodes representative of EEG activity in each occipital lobe were used, and consecutive PDR oscillations were identified during periods of eye closure. In turn, cursor-based markers were placed at the negative peak of each sinusoidal wave of the PDR. Waveform averaging and time-frequency analysis were performed for all PDR samples for the respective pre-mission, mission, and post-mission EEGs. Results: No significant differences were found in the mean frequency of the PDR in any of the crew subjects between their EEG on the ISS and their pre- or post-mission EEG on ground level. The PDR oscillations varied over a &amp;amp;plusmn;1Hz standard deviation range. Similarly, no significant differences were found in PDR&amp;amp;rsquo;s power spectral density. Conclusions: Our study shows that the spectral features of the PDR remain within normal limits in a short exposure to the microgravity environment, with its frequency manifesting within an acceptable &amp;amp;plusmn;1 Hz variation from the pre-mission mean. Further investigations for EEG features and markers reflecting the human brain neurophysiology during space missions are required.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine if performing ultrasound-guided, bilateral, two-level cervical sympathetic chain blocks (2LCSBs) (performed on subsequent days) improves symptoms associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI) that do not overlap with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted between August 2022 and February 2023. We identified twenty patients who received bilateral 2LCSBs for PTSD and anxiety symptoms and who also had a history of TBI. Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (NSI) scores were collected at baseline, one week, and one month post treatment in 13 males and 7 females. A sub-analysis of the first ten questions of the NSI, which we identified as not overlapping with PTSD or anxiety symptoms, generated an NSI sub-score. Results: Out of 20 patients, all showed improvement in their NSI scores and NSI sub-scores. The NSI sub-scores had a baseline average of 15.45 (on a 40-point scale); the average score at one week post treatment was 8.30; and that at one month post treatment was 7.80. This represents a 49.51% improvement in TBI symptoms which did not overlap with PTSD or anxiety symptoms between baseline and one month. Conclusions: The use of bilateral 2LCSBs may be helpful in treating patients with TBI, regardless of the presence of comorbid PTSD symptoms.</p>

                <p>The growing field of social neuroscience is reliant on the development of robust, ecologically valid paradigms for simulating social interaction and measuring social cognition in highly controlled laboratory settings. Perspective taking is a key component of social cognition, and accordingly several paradigms aimed at measuring perspective taking exist. A relatively novel paradigm is the ball detection task, in which participants and a virtual agent form independent beliefs about the presence of a target stimulus behind an occluder. Previous studies have shown that incongruent trials (in which the participant's and the agent's beliefs differ) affect participant reaction times and elicit increased neural activity in the so-called mentalizing network. This paradigm has important advantages over previous ones, in that experimental conditions can be fully randomized, and ceiling effects are not found even for adult populations. Here, we combined this paradigm with a stress induction and a nonstressful control task. In an online study, we found no evidence of perspective taking at the behavioral level. Combining the task with functional magnetic resonance imaging, we found no evidence of perspective taking at the behavioral or neural level, even for the control condition. While this paradigm is reliable on its own, implementing it in the context of a task-switching paradigm appears to reduce participants&rsquo; focus on task-irrelevant perspective taking elements. Our findings highlight the fragility of existing social cognition paradigms and the need for reliable, simple, and ecologically valid measures of perspective taking.</p>

                <p>Fear generalization is a hallmark of anxiety disorders. Experimentally, fear generalization can be difficult to dissociate from its counterpart, fear discrimination. Here, we use minimal threat learning procedures to reveal such a dissociation. We show that in Long&ndash;Evans rats, an auditory threat cue predicting footshock on 10% of trials produces a discriminated fear response that does not generalize to a neutral auditory cue. In contrast, even slightly higher footshock probabilities (30 and 20%) produce fear generalization. AAV-mediated, caspase-3 deletion of ventral pallidum neurons abolishes fear generalization and reduces threat cue responding during extinction. The ventral pallidum's contribution to fear generalization and extinction threat responding does not depend on inputs from the nucleus accumbens. The results demonstrate a minimal threat learning approach to dissociate fear discrimination from fear generalization and a novel role for the ventral pallidum in generalizing and expressing fear.</p>

                <p>The cortico-basal ganglia loop has traditionally been conceptualized as consisting of three distinct information networks: motor, limbic, and associative. However, this three-loop concept is insufficient to comprehensively explain the diverse functions of the cortico-basal ganglia system, as emerging evidence suggests its involvement in sensory processing, including the auditory systems. In the present study, we demonstrate the auditory cortico-basal ganglia loop by using transgenic mice and viral-assisted labelings. The caudal part of the external globus pallidus (GPe) emerged as a major output nucleus of the auditory cortico-basal ganglia loop with the cortico-striato-pallidal projections as its input pathway and pallido-cortical and pallido&ndash;thalamo&ndash;cortical projections as its output pathway. GABAergic neurons in the caudal GPe dominantly innervated the nonlemniscal auditory pathway. They also projected to various regions, including the substantia nigra pars lateralis, cuneiform nucleus, and periaqueductal gray. Considering the functions associated with these GPe-projecting regions, auditory cortico-basal ganglia circuits may play a pivotal role in eliciting defensive behaviors against acoustic stimuli.</p>

                <p>Aggression and mating of male mice are strongly associated with Esr1-expressing neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTpr) and hypothalamus in the vomeronasal pathway. By projecting to the downstream hypothalamus, the upstream BNSTpr<sup>Esr1</sup> gates mating and aggression of male mice and maternal behavior of female mice. The medial preoptic area (MPOA) and ventrolateral subdivision of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvl) are two subdivisions of the hypothalamus downstream. In addition to receiving projections from upstream BNSTpr, there is also a mutual projection between MPOA and VMHvl. In the process of transforming sex information into mating and aggression, Esr1-expressing neurons in BNSTpr, MPOA, and VMHvl act as messengers of information, finally producing inhibitory or excitatory projection. These projections are different in direction, but they all work together to control the behavior selection that is most conducive to defense and reproduction when male mice encounter female or male mice. Here, we summarized the property and the function of connections between these Esr1-expressing neurons in BNSTpr, MPOA, and VMHvl that encode mating and aggression and highlight the importance and benefits of inhibitory projection of Esr1-expressing cells in mating and aggression.</p>

                <p>Brain-derived estrogen (17&beta;-estradiol, E2) is a neuromodulator that plays important roles in neural plasticity and network excitability. Chronic inhibition of estrogen synthesis is used in adjuvant breast cancer therapy for estrogen receptor-positive tumors and may have been associated with cognitive and affective side effects. Here, we have developed a model of adjuvant therapy in female ovariectomized mice in which the E2 biosynthetic enzyme aromatase is inhibited by letrozole (1&nbsp;mg/kg/day, i.p., for up to 3&nbsp;weeks), Using two-photon longitudinal in vivo imaging in Thy1-GFP-M mice, we found that spine density in the apical dendrites of neocortical layer 5 pyramidal cells was unaffected by letrozole treatment but spine turnover was reduced. LTP in layer 4 to layer 2/3 synapses in the somatosensory cortex was also reduced in slices from letrozole-treated mice, showing deficits in structural and functional plasticity resulting from aromatase inhibition. Ovariectomized mice performed worse than intact control mice in the novel object recognition test but, surprisingly, letrozole treatment rescued this deficit.</p>

                <p>Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is marked by enlarged cerebral ventricles with normal intracranial pressure, plus three stereotypical symptoms: gait impairment, cognitive dysfunction, and urinary frequency with urge incontinence. The neural circuit dysfunction responsible for each of these symptoms remains unknown, and an adult mouse model would expand opportunities to explore these mechanisms in preclinical experiments. Here, we describe the first mouse model of chronic, communicating hydrocephalus with normal intracranial pressure. Hydrocephalic male and female mice had unsteady gait and reduced maximum velocity. Despite performing well on a variety of behavioral tests, they exhibited subtle learning impairments. Hydrocephalic mice also developed urinary frequency, and many became incontinent. This mouse model, with symptoms resembling human NPH, can be combined with molecular-genetic tools in any mouse strain to explore the neural circuit mechanisms of these symptoms. Preclinical work using this hydrocephalus model will lead to the development of new treatments for NPH symptoms.</p>

                <p>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation method that modulates brain activity by inducing electric fields in the brain. Real-time, state-dependent stimulation with TMS has shown that neural oscillation phase modulates corticospinal excitability. However, such motor evoked potentials (MEPs) only indirectly reflect motor cortex activation and are unavailable at other brain regions of interest. The direct and secondary cortical effects of phase-dependent brain stimulation remain an open question. In this study, we recorded the cortical responses during single-pulse TMS using electroencephalography (EEG) concurrently with the MEP measurements in 20 healthy human volunteers (11 female). TMS was delivered at peak, rising, trough, and falling phases of mu (8&ndash;13&nbsp;Hz) and beta (14&ndash;30&nbsp;Hz) oscillations in the motor cortex. The cortical responses were quantified through TMS evoked potential components N15, P50, and N100 as peak-to-peak amplitudes (P50-N15 and P50-N100). We further analyzed whether the prestimulus frequency band power was predictive of the cortical responses. We demonstrated that phase-specific targeting modulates cortical responses. The phase relationship between cortical responses was different for early and late responses. In addition, pre-TMS mu oscillatory power and phase significantly predicted both early and late cortical EEG responses in mu-specific targeting, indicating the independent causal effects of phase and power. However, only pre-TMS beta power significantly predicted the early and late TEP components during beta-specific targeting. Further analyses indicated distinct roles of mu and beta power on cortical responses. These findings provide insight to mechanistic understanding of neural oscillation states in cortical and corticospinal activation in humans.</p>

                Abstract Background Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a significant global health challenge particularly in developing countries and regions. Gezira State, Sudan where prevalence and disease burden are high is an example of such regions. This study aimed to quantify HBV viral load among patients in Gezira State and assess the distribution of viral loads across demographic groups, including gender and age. Method A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted between January 2022 and January 2023. Randomly selected 100 chronic HBV patients were enrolled from major healthcare facilities in Wad Medani, Gezira’s capital. Viral loads were measured using real-time PCR, and statistical analyses were performed to identify predictors of high viral load. Results The results revealed that the mean HBV viral load was 886,363 IU/ml (SD± 421,295), with a significantly higher mean in males (1,122,899 IU/ml) compared to females (531,559 IU/ml) (p< 0.0001). Viral loads ranged from 15 IU/ml to 35,474,488 IU/ml, with 37% of patients exceeding the WHO-recommended treatment threshold of 2,000 IU/ml. However, no significant association was found between viral load and age (p=0.939). Conclusion The study highlighted the need for gender-specific management strategies and the importance of HBV viral load quantification for effective public health intervention in Gezira State. Further research is recommended to explore HBV epidemiology in Sudan more comprehensively.

                Background Removal of the microbial deposits (plaque and calculus) by performing effective scaling and root planing (SRP) is the fundamental step for managing periodontal disease (gingivitis and periodontitis). Various adjuncts in the form of mouthwash, gels, and toothpaste are also being used as adjuncts to SRP for managing periodontitis. Recently, Lycium barbarum (L. barbarum), commonly known as goji berry or wolfberry, has gained popularity for managing chronic inflammatory and infectious diseases. However, its efficacy in managing periodontitis has never been explored. Hence the present study aims to evaluate the efficacy of goji berry mouthwash compared to chlorhexidine mouthwash for managing periodontitis. Methods 60 adult participants were divided randomly using computer-generated random sequences into two groups (case group: L. barbarum mouthwash (Males: 16; Female: 14); control group: 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash (Males: 14; Females: 16)). The changes in the gingival index (Gi), plaque index (Pi), bleeding on probing (BOP), clinical attachment loss (CAL), probing pocket depth (PPD), microbial load, and antioxidant levels (protein thiol) in saliva were noted at the baseline, at 15 days and one month. Results A significant reduction in the mean PPD, Pi, BOP, and Gi was seen from baseline to one month in both the control (P-value=0.006, 0.027, 0.000, and 0.036 respectively) and test groups (P-value=0.035, 0.000, 0.034, and 0.000 respectively). However, the antioxidant levels (protein thiol) in saliva were significantly increased only in the test group. Conclusion Goji berry mouthwash along with SRP reduced the Gi, Pi, BOP, and PPD in patients with periodontitis. However, no statistically significant difference was noted between the use of goji berry and chlorhexidine mouthwash. Goji berry mouthwash was more effective than chlorhexidine in increasing the antioxidant levels in saliva.

                Background The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the prevalence of heavy metal contamination in fish, fruits, and vegetables in Southwest Nigeria. The review focused on studies published over a ten-year period, between 2014 and 2024. Methods Articles used for the study were obtained by conducting a comprehensive literature search using several databases, including ResearchGate, Scopus, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, and PubMed using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). To identify relevant studies, a plethora of keywords were utilized to search for articles in the selected databases, including. Articles reporting heavy metal contamination in specified food products within the last decade were included. Results Of the 10,212 initially identified articles, 64 met the inclusion criteria after thorough screening. The selected studies were predominantly conducted in Lagos (30), Ondo (8), and Ogun (7) states, with few studies in Oyo, Ekiti, and Osun states. The majority of the research focused on fish (40 studies), followed by vegetables (20) and fruits (4). The commonly studied fish species were observed to be Tilapia zilli, Chrysichthys nigrodigitatus, Clarias gariepinus, and Oreochromis niloticus, with heavy metal concentrations frequently exceeded WHO limits. Conclusions Therefore, this review highlights the significant risks posed by the presence of heavy metals in food products and underscores the importance of stringent environmental monitoring and the adoption of appropriate regulatory mechanisms for health and environmental risk mitigation. This could help in the formulation of appropriate policy implementation strategies geared towards mitigating heavy metal contamination in the region’s food supply.

                The term Research Software Engineer, or RSE, emerged a little over 10 years ago as a way to represent individuals working in the research community but focusing on software development. The term has been widely adopted and there are a number of high-level definitions of what an RSE is. However, the roles of RSEs vary depending on the institutional context they work in. At one end of the spectrum, RSE roles may look similar to a traditional research role. At the other extreme, they resemble that of a software engineer in industry. Most RSE roles inhabit the space between these two extremes. Therefore, providing a straightforward, comprehensive definition of what an RSE does and what experience, skills and competencies are required to become one is challenging. In this community paper we define the broad notion of what an RSE is, explore the different types of work they undertake, and define a list of foundational competencies as well as values that outline the general profile of an RSE. Further research and training can build upon this foundation of skills and focus on various aspects in greater detail. We expect that graduates and practitioners will have a larger and more diverse set of skills than outlined here. On this basis, we elaborate on the progression of these skills along different dimensions. We look at specific types of RSE roles, propose recommendations for organisations, give examples of future specialisations, and detail how existing curricula fit into this framework.

                This study aims to evaluate the impact of big data analytics (BDA) on the performance of healthcare supply chain management (HCSCMP) by examining both overall efficiency improvements and identifying critical success factors for effective implementation. Through a systematic literature review, the research investigates how BDA enhances real-time decision-making within healthcare supply chains (HCSCs) and identifies the key enablers required for successful BDA adoption. A comprehensive search strategy was employed to analyze 65 papers, resulting in the inclusion of 39 studies published between 2016 and 2023. The review revealed a preference for literature reviews and questionnaires as the primary research methods. The findings indicate that BDA significantly improves HCSCs’ efficiency, particularly in real-time decision-making and operational management. However, successful BDA implementation depends on addressing critical enablers and overcoming associated challenges.

                Abstract Introduction Preoperative carbohydrate loading (PCL), part of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols, involves giving carbohydrate-rich liquids before surgery instead of traditional fasting. It improves glucose control, reduces insulin resistance, and enhances patient comfort. Methods A comprehensive scoping review was conducted using databases such as PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science, focusing on studies from 2017 to 2024. Primary, English-language clinical trial involving pediatric patients were included without restrictions on surgical procedure, or outcomes. Data extraction was focused on sample sizes, PCL types, and perioperative outcomes. Results The scoping review examined 10 studies on PCL in pediatric surgery, covering various procedures with sample sizes ranging from 18 to 1200 participants. Most studies indicated metabolic benefits, with 7 out of 11 showing stabilized blood glucose and reduced hypoglycemia risk. Additionally, 5 studies associated PCL with reduced preoperative anxiety, agitation, and discomfort, including thirst and hunger. For stomach content, 5 studies showed PCL reduced gastric residual volume and improved pH. Postoperative findings were mixed: 4 studies found no significant difference in nausea and vomiting, while 2 suggested benefits. Length of hospital stay from 3 studies showed no clinical difference results. Conclusions PCL in pediatric surgery shows potential to stabilize blood glucose, reduce metabolic risks, and improve recovery. However, the evidence regarding outcomes such as length of hospital stay and postoperative complications remains inconsistent, indicating the need for further investigation.

Despite improvements, nearly 12% of Algerian children under five years of age suffered from stunting in 2022. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of three indicators of undernutrition (stunting, wasting, and underweight) and their associated variables in children aged 0–23 months in Algeria between 2013 and 2019. Methods Pooled data from Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) (2012-13 and 2018-19) covering 14,498 children were used. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to test the associations. Results Stunting decreased significantly, but wasting and being underweight showed no significant reductions from 2013 to 2019. Stunting, wasting, and underweight decreased by 2.2%, 1.3%, and 0.3%, respectively, with an overall prevalence of 10.1%, 5.4%, and 3.6%, respectively. Factors associated with undernutrition included child age and small size at birth, whereas stunting was linked to the poorest households, male children, higher maternal body mass index (BMI), and low antenatal care (ANC) visits. Wasting was associated with younger age and paternal age, fewer maternal ANC visits, underweight male sex, low maternal education, high maternal BMI, and delayed breastfeeding initiation. Conclusion Public health experts and stakeholders must adopt a comprehensive community-centered approach to achieve long-term improvements in child nutrition in Algeria. This strategy should focus on key factors including high maternal BMI, low maternal education, male children, and infrequent ANC visits. This action can help Algeria progress towards achieving the UN’s goal of eradicating malnutrition.

Plant-associated microbiota affect pant growth and development by regulating plant hormones homeostasis. Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), a well-known plant hormone, can be produced by various plant-associated bacteria. However, the prevalence of bacteria with the capacity to degrade IAA in the rhizosphere has not been systematically studied. In this study, we analyzed the IAA degradation capabilities of bacterial isolates from the roots of <i>Arabidopsis</i> and rice. Using genomics analysis and in vitro assays, we found that 21 out of 183 taxonomically diverse bacterial isolates possess the ability to degrade IAA. Through comparative genomics and transcriptomic assays, we identified iac-like or iad-like operon in the genomes of these IAA degraders. Additionally, the putative regulator of the operon was found to be highly conserved among these strains through protein structure similarity analysis. Some of the IAA degraders could utilize IAA as their carbon and energy source. In planta, most of the IAA degrading strains mitigated <i>Arabidopsis</i> and rice seedling root growth inhibition (RGI) triggered by exogenous IAA. Moreover, RGI caused by complex synthetic bacterial community can be alleviated by introducing IAA degraders. Importantly, we observed increased colonization preference of IAA degraders from soil to root according to the frequency of the biomarker genes in metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) collected from different habitats, suggesting that there is a close association between IAA degraders and IAA producers. In summary, our findings further the understanding of the functional diversity and potential biological roles of plant-associated bacteria in host plant root morphogenesis.

                <p>by Alison Philbrook, Michael P. O’Donnell, Laura Grunenkovaite, Piali Sengupta</p>

Sensory neurons contain morphologically diverse primary cilia that are built by intraflagellar transport (IFT) and house sensory signaling molecules. Since both ciliary structural and signaling proteins are trafficked via IFT, it has been challenging to decouple the contributions of IFT and cilia structure to neuronal responses. By acutely inhibiting IFT without altering cilia structure and vice versa, here we describe the differential roles of ciliary trafficking and sensory ending morphology in shaping chemosensory responses in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. We show that a minimum cilium length but not continuous IFT is necessary for a subset of responses in the ASH nociceptive neurons. In contrast, neither cilia nor continuous IFT are necessary for odorant responses in the AWA olfactory neurons. Instead, continuous IFT differentially modulates response dynamics in AWA. Upon acute inhibition of IFT, cilia-destined odorant receptors are shunted to ectopic branches emanating from the AWA cilia base. Spatial segregation of receptors in these branches from a cilia-restricted regulatory kinase results in odorant desensitization defects, highlighting the importance of precise organization of signaling molecules at sensory endings in regulating response dynamics. We also find that adaptation of AWA responses upon repeated exposure to an odorant is mediated by IFT-driven removal of its cognate receptor, whereas adaptation to a second odorant is regulated via IFT-independent mechanisms. Our results reveal unexpected complexity in the contribution of IFT and cilia organization to the regulation of responses even within a single chemosensory neuron type and establish a critical role for these processes in the precise modulation of olfactory behaviors.

Excessive cytokine signaling resulting from dysregulation of a cytokine or its receptor can be a main driver of cancer, autoimmune, or hematopoietic disorders. Here, we leverage protein design to create tailored cytokine receptor blockers with idealized properties. Specifically, we aimed to tackle the granulocyte-colony stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFR), a mediator of different types of leukemia and autoinflammatory diseases. By modifying designed G-CSFR binders, we engineered hyper-stable proteins that function as nanomolar signaling antagonists. X-ray crystallography showed atomic-level agreement with the experimental structure of an exemplary design. Furthermore, the most potent design blocks G-CSFR in acute myeloid leukemia cells and primary human hematopoietic stem cells. Thus, the resulting designs can be used for inhibiting or homing to G-CSFR-expressing cells. Our results also demonstrate that similarly designed cytokine mimics can be used to derive antagonists to tackle other type I cytokine receptors.

Human language relies on a rich cognitive machinery, partially shared with other animals. One key mechanism, however, decomposing events into causally linked agent–patient roles, has remained elusive with no known animal equivalent. In humans, agent–patient relations in event cognition drive how languages are processed neurally and expressions structured syntactically. We compared visual event tracking between humans and great apes, using stimuli that would elicit causal processing in humans. After accounting for attention to background information, we found similar gaze patterns to agent–patient relations in all species, mostly alternating attention to agents and patients, presumably in order to learn the nature of the event, and occasionally privileging agents under specific conditions. Six-month-old infants, in contrast, did not follow agent–patient relations and attended mostly to background information. These findings raise the possibility that event role tracking, a cognitive foundation of syntax, has evolved long before language but requires time and experience to become ontogenetically available.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We examined the impact of the rs10191329 genetic risk variant on neuroaxonal damage as measured by serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) levels, and disability progression in people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In a cohort of pwMS (n = 740), 658 participants were prospectively monitored every 2 years for less than a decade while 82 of 740 pwMS were monitored retrospectively for up to 40 years. We investigated associations between rs10191329 variants and clinical outcome, including Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), disability accrual (defined by EDSS-increase of at least 1.5 for patients starting at EDSS 0, at least 1.0 EDSS-points for patients with an initial EDSS between 1 and 4.5 and at least 0.5 points for patients starting with an EDSS equal or greater than 5) and progression to secondary progressive MS (SPMS). Clinical outcomes were analyzed using Kaplan–Meier and Cox proportional hazards analyses. Disability accumulation over time was depicted using a generalized mixed-effect model. Single-molecule array was used to assess sNfL levels.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Homozygous, heterozygous, and non-carriers of the rs10191329 risk variant displayed comparable sNfL levels indicating similar neuroaxonal damage at the time of diagnosis. Importantly, in homozygous carriers we found highest sNfL levels in follow-up visits preceding elevated disease progression later in the disease course, a steeper increase in overall disability measures and higher probability of SPMS development.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings highlight how genetic variants may serve as new biomarkers for disease progression and can be used for personalized medicine and risk assessment in MS. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Background Corruption, a multifaceted governance issue, impacts public well-being globally. The recent trends reveal a rise in suicide rates across the Americas, while all other regions show declines over twenty years of time. This study investigates corruption’s effect on suicide in 26 American countries, considering moderating factors of unemployment, inflation, and economic growth. Methods This study analysed latest two decades of available data, using stepwise panel regression method to investigate the effects of corruption and economic variables on suicide across income levels. Data were sourced from Transparency International, World Bank and the World Health Organization. Initially, unit root tests and CUSUM plots were used to ensure the stability and stationarity of the dataset, and model specification were validated through F test, LM test and Hausman test to select the ideal econometric model - POLS, REM, or FEM for the study. Results A strong suicide rate persistence revealed, particularly in high-income countries, where the lagged suicide variable showed a coefficient of 0.8063 (p < 0.001). Corruption significantly impacted suicide rates in upper-middle-income countries (coefficient = -0.0268, p < 0.05), with higher corruption perceptions scores correlating with lower suicide rates. Additionally, unemployment acted as a significant moderator, intensifying the corruption’s adverse impact on suicide with a coefficient of 0.0022 (p < 0.001) in upper-middle income nations. Economic growth demonstrated a minor protective effect, particularly in high-income regions, with an interaction coefficient of -0.0005 (p < 0.1), suggesting slight suicide reduction linked to economic stability. Conclusion This study found that corruption, unemployment, and economic growth significantly influence suicide rates across the Americas. Corruption exacerbates suicide risks in upper-middle-income countries, while unemployment amplifies this effect. Economic growth offers a slight protective effect, particularly in high-income regions, suggesting that economic stability may help mitigate suicide rates.

                Background We conducted an overview of systematic reviews about the effects of teaching strategies that can be used to teach primary and secondary school students to think critically. Our objective was to inform decisions about what teaching strategies to use in resources that we developed to teach critical thinking about health in secondary schools. Methods We mapped characteristics of systematic reviews of teaching strategies and summarised findings from the most relevant reviews to teaching students to think critically about health. We included reviews that assessed the effects of teaching strategies that could potentially be used in primary or secondary schools to teach students to think critically, had a Methods section with explicit selection criteria, reported at least one outcome measure of the ability to undertake one of four basic types of cognitive tasks (memory, procedural, comprehension, or opinion), and were published after 1999. Results We included 326 systematic reviews. The reviews evaluated a wide range of teaching strategies for a variety of purposes. Important limitations of the reviews included not considering adverse effects (99% of the reviews), not assessing the risk of bias for included studies (93% of the reviews), and not assessing the credibility of subgroup effects (100% of the reviews). We summarised the findings for 37 teaching strategies that we considered most relevant. The certainty of the evidence of the effects varied from very low to moderate. We used 12 of the strategies in resources that we developed to teach secondary students to think critically about health. Conclusions A tremendous amount of work has gone into evaluating the effects of a wide range of teaching strategies. The results of this research can inform decisions about how to teach critical thinking and future research. However, well-designed, up-to-date systematic reviews are still needed for many teaching strategies.

                Wang et al. report that nucleo-cytosolic acetyl-CoA drives tumor immune evasion by regulating PD-L1 in melanoma. Acetyl-CoA promotes PD-L1 transcription via P300-mediated histone acetylation to suppress anti-tumor immunity. Targeting the acetyl-CoA-producing enzyme ACLY enhances the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors.

                Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is associated with endothelial, osteoblastic, and B cell tumors. Schmidt et al. demonstrate that autophagy restricts KSHV during entry. Interaction of the KSHV glycoprotein gH with its entry receptor EphA2 seems to cause endosomal damage that then recruits autophagy via galectin-8 to limit infection.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88024">ARID1A governs the silencing of sex-linked transcription during male meiosis in the mouse</a></h4>

              
                We present evidence implicating the BAF (BRG1/BRM Associated Factor) chromatin remodeler in meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI). By immunofluorescence (IF), the putative BAF DNA binding subunit, ARID1A (AT-rich Interaction Domain 1 a), appeared enriched on the male sex chromosomes during diplonema of meiosis I. Germ cells showing a Cre-induced loss of ARID1A arrested in pachynema and failed to repress sex-linked genes, indicating a defective MSCI. Mutant sex chromosomes displayed an abnormal presence of elongating RNA polymerase II coupled with an overall increase in chromatin accessibility detectable by ATAC-seq. We identified a role for ARID1A in promoting the preferential enrichment of the histone variant, H3.3, on the sex chromosomes, a known hallmark of MSCI. Without ARID1A, the sex chromosomes appeared depleted of H3.3 at levels resembling autosomes. Higher resolution analyses by CUT&RUN revealed shifts in sex-linked H3.3 associations from discrete intergenic sites and broader gene-body domains to promoters in response to the loss of ARID1A. Several sex-linked sites displayed ectopic H3.3 occupancy that did not co-localize with DMC1 (DNA meiotic recombinase 1). This observation suggests a requirement for ARID1A in DMC1 localization to the asynapsed sex chromatids. We conclude that ARID1A-directed H3.3 localization influences meiotic sex chromosome gene regulation and DNA repair.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94587">Heterozygote advantage can explain the extraordinary diversity of immune genes</a></h4>

              
                The majority of highly polymorphic genes are related to immune functions and with over 100 alleles within a population, genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are the most polymorphic loci in vertebrates. How such extraordinary polymorphism arose and is maintained is controversial. One possibility is heterozygote advantage (HA), which can in principle maintain any number of alleles, but biologically explicit models based on this mechanism have so far failed to reliably predict the coexistence of significantly more than ten alleles. We here present an eco-evolutionary model showing that evolution can result in the emergence and maintenance of more than 100 alleles under HA if the following two assumptions are fulfilled: first, pathogens are lethal in the absence of an appropriate immune defence; second, the effect of pathogens depends on host condition, with hosts in poorer condition being affected more strongly. Thus, our results show that HA can be a more potent force in explaining the extraordinary polymorphism found at MHC loci than currently recognized.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/72177">Estimating dispersal rates and locating genetic ancestors with genome-wide genealogies</a></h4>

              
                Spatial patterns in genetic diversity are shaped by individuals dispersing from their parents and larger-scale population movements. It has long been appreciated that these patterns of movement shape the underlying genealogies along the genome leading to geographic patterns of isolation by distance in contemporary population genetic data. However, extracting the enormous amount of information contained in genealogies along recombining sequences has, until recently, not been computationally feasible. Here we capitalize on important recent advances in genome-wide gene-genealogy reconstruction and develop methods to use thousands of trees to estimate per-generation dispersal rates and to locate the genetic ancestors of a sample back through time. We take a likelihood approach in continuous space using a simple approximate model (branching Brownian motion) as our prior distribution of spatial genealogies. After testing our method with simulations we apply it to Arabidopsis thaliana. We estimate a dispersal rate of roughly 60km2 per generation, slightly higher across latitude than across longitude, potentially reflecting a northward post-glacial expansion. Locating ancestors allows us to visualize major geographic movements, alternative geographic histories, and admixture. Our method highlights the huge amount of information about past dispersal events and population movements contained in genome-wide genealogies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101069">Introducing µGUIDE for quantitative imaging via generalized uncertainty-driven inference using deep learning</a></h4>

              
                This work proposes µGUIDE: a general Bayesian framework to estimate posterior distributions of tissue microstructure parameters from any given biophysical model or signal representation, with exemplar demonstration in diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Harnessing a new deep learning architecture for automatic signal feature selection combined with simulation-based inference and efficient sampling of the posterior distributions, µGUIDE bypasses the high computational and time cost of conventional Bayesian approaches and does not rely on acquisition constraints to define model-specific summary statistics. The obtained posterior distributions allow to highlight degeneracies present in the model definition and quantify the uncertainty and ambiguity of the estimated parameters.

                Phage-derived peptidoglycan hydrolases (i.e. lysins) are considered promising alternatives to conventional antibiotics due to their direct peptidoglycan degradation activity and low risk of resistance development. The discovery of these enzymes is often hampered by the limited availability of phage genomes. Herein, we report a new strategy to mine active peptidoglycan hydrolases from bacterial proteomes by lysin-derived antimicrobial peptide-primed screening. As a proof-of-concept, five <span class="underline">p</span>eptidoglycan <span class="underline">h</span>ydrolases from the <i><span class="underline">A</span>cinetobacter <span class="underline">b</span>aumannii</i> proteome (PHAb7-PHAb11) were identified using PlyF307 lysin-derived peptide as a template. Among them, PHAb10 and PHAb11 showed potent bactericidal activity against multiple pathogens even after treatment at 100°C for 1 hr, while the other three were thermosensitive. We solved the crystal structures of PHAb8, PHAb10, and PHAb11 and unveiled that hyper-thermostable PHAb10 underwent a unique folding-refolding thermodynamic scheme mediated by a dimer-monomer transition, while thermosensitive PHAb8 formed a monomer. Two mouse models of bacterial infection further demonstrated the safety and efficacy of PHAb10. In conclusion, our antimicrobial peptide-primed strategy provides new clues for the discovery of promising antimicrobial drugs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96025">High-throughput expansion microscopy enables scalable super-resolution imaging</a></h4>

              
                Expansion microscopy (ExM) enables nanoscale imaging using a standard confocal microscope through the physical, isotropic expansion of fixed immunolabeled specimens. ExM is widely employed to image proteins, nucleic acids, and lipid membranes in single cells; however, current methods limit the number of samples that can be processed simultaneously. We developed High-throughput Expansion Microscopy (HiExM), a robust platform that enables expansion microscopy of cells cultured in a standard 96-well plate. Our method enables ~4.2 x expansion of cells within individual wells, across multiple wells, and between plates. We also demonstrate that HiExM can be combined with high-throughput confocal imaging platforms to greatly improve the ease and scalability of image acquisition. As an example, we analyzed the effects of doxorubicin, a known cardiotoxic agent, on human cardiomyocytes (CMs) as measured by the Hoechst signal across the nucleus. We show a dose-dependent effect on nuclear DNA that is not observed in unexpanded CMs, suggesting that HiExM improves the detection of cellular phenotypes in response to drug treatment. Our method broadens the application of ExM as a tool for scalable super-resolution imaging in biological research applications.

                In growing cell populations such as tumours, mutations can serve as markers that allow tracking the past evolution from current samples. The genomic analyses of bulk samples and samples from multiple regions have shed light on the evolutionary forces acting on tumours. However, little is known empirically on the spatio-temporal dynamics of tumour evolution. Here, we leverage published data from resected hepatocellular carcinomas, each with several hundred samples taken in two and three dimensions. Using spatial metrics of evolution, we find that tumour cells grow predominantly uniformly within the tumour volume instead of at the surface. We determine how mutations and cells are dispersed throughout the tumour and how cell death contributes to the overall tumour growth. Our methods shed light on the early evolution of tumours in vivo and can be applied to high-resolution data in the emerging field of spatial biology.

                The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a key site where fear learning takes place through synaptic plasticity. Rodent research shows prominent low theta (~3–6 Hz), high theta (~6–12 Hz), and gamma (&gt;30 Hz) rhythms in the BLA local field potential recordings. However, it is not understood what role these rhythms play in supporting the plasticity. Here, we create a biophysically detailed model of the BLA circuit to show that several classes of interneurons (PV, SOM, and VIP) in the BLA can be critically involved in producing the rhythms; these rhythms promote the formation of a dedicated fear circuit shaped through spike-timing-dependent plasticity. Each class of interneurons is necessary for the plasticity. We find that the low theta rhythm is a biomarker of successful fear conditioning. The model makes use of interneurons commonly found in the cortex and, hence, may apply to a wide variety of associative learning situations.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99162">Adipocyte microRNA-802 promotes adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance by modulating macrophages in obesity</a></h4>

              
                Adipose tissue inflammation is now considered to be a key process underlying metabolic diseases in obese individuals. However, it remains unclear how adipose inflammation is initiated and maintained or the mechanism by which inflammation develops. We found that <i>microRNA-802</i> (<i>Mir802</i>) expression in adipose tissue is progressively increased with the development of dietary obesity in obese mice and humans. The increasing trend of <i>Mir802</i> preceded the accumulation of macrophages. Adipose tissue-specific knockout of <i>Mir802</i> lowered macrophage infiltration and ameliorated systemic insulin resistance. Conversely, the specific overexpression of <i>Mir802</i> in adipose tissue aggravated adipose inflammation in mice fed a high-fat diet. Mechanistically, <i>Mir802</i> activates noncanonical and canonical NF-κB pathways by targeting its negative regulator, TRAF3. Next, NF-κB orchestrated the expression of chemokines and SREBP1, leading to strong recruitment and M1-like polarization of macrophages. Our findings indicate that <i>Mir802</i> endows adipose tissue with the ability to recruit and polarize macrophages, which underscores <i>Mir802</i> as an innovative and attractive candidate for miRNA-based immune therapy for adipose inflammation.

">Polarized ATP synthase in synaptic mitochondria induced by learning and plasticity signals</a></h4>

              
                MINFLUX represents a state-of-the-art single-molecule localization microscopy technology that surpasses the conventional diffraction limit, enabling the visualization and analysis of nanostructures with exceptional precision. Despite its potential, the utilization of MINFLUX has been primarily confined to in vitro cultured cell environments. In this research, we have refined the sample preparation protocols to facilitate 3D MINFLUX imaging in fixed brain tissue sections, focusing on the mitochondrial distribution within dendritic spines and engram cells of the dentate gyrus. Probing single molecules in vivo reveals an interesting finding: the reorganization of mitochondrial inner membrane proteins during synaptic plasticity within dendritic spines of engram cells. Utilizing 3D MINFLUX nanoscopy, we identified a significant redistribution of -F1-ATP synthase, which correlates with learning related activities. This redistribution implies a pivotal function for polarized ATP synthesis in the vicinity of the postsynaptic zone, which may modulate both short-term and long-term synaptic modifications, thereby influencing synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation. Furthermore, dual-color 3D MINFLUX imaging has uncovered distinct patterns of mitochondrial reorganization involving both the inner and outer membranes within dendritic spines. These patterns, induced by plasticity signals, persist for up to 12 hours in neuronal cultures. This distinction highlights the presence of distinct regulatory mechanisms governing mitochondrial proteins during synaptic plasticity. These results offer new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity and underscore the transformative potential of 3D MINFLUX imaging for studying neuronal processes in the brain.

">Uncovering the electrical synapse proteome in retinal neurons via in vivo proximity labeling</a></h4>

              
                Through decades of research, we have gained a comprehensive understanding of the protein complexes underlying function and regulation of chemical synapses in the nervous system. Despite the identification of key molecules such as ZO-1 or CaMKII, we currently lack a similar level of insight into the electrical synapse proteome. With the advancement of BioID as a tool for in vivo proteomics, it has become possible to identify complex interactomes of a given protein of interest by combining enzymatic biotinylation with subsequent streptavidin affinity capture. In the present study, we applied different BioID strategies to screen the interactomes of Connexin 36 (mouse) the major neuronal connexin and its zebrafish orthologue Cx35b in retinal neurons. For in vivo proximity labeling in mice, we took advantage of the Cx36-EGFP strain and expressed a GFP-nanobody-TurboID fusion construct selectively in AII amacrine cells. For in vivo BioID in zebrafish, we generated a transgenic line expressing a Cx35b-TurboID fusion under control of the Cx35b promoter. Both two strategies allowed us to capture a plethora of molecules that were associated with electrical synapses and showed a high degree of evolutionary conservation in the proteomes of both species. Besides known interactors of Cx36 such as ZO-1 and ZO-2 we have identified more than 50 new proteins, such as scaffold proteins, adhesion molecules and regulators of the cytoskeleton. We further determined the subcellular localization of these proteins in AII amacrine and tested potential binding interactions with Cx36. Of note, we identified signal induced proliferation associated 1 like 3 (SIPA1L3), a protein that has been implicated in cell junction formation and cell polarity as a new scaffold of electrical synapses. Interestingly, SIPA1L3 was able to interact with ZO-1, ZO-2 and Cx36, suggesting a pivotal role in electrical synapse function. In summary, our study provides a first detailed view of the electrical synapse proteome in retinal neurons.

">Selective Inhibition of Cytosolic PARylation via PARG99: A Targeted Approach for Mitigating FUS-associated Neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                Neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are characterized by complex etiologies, often involving disruptions in functions of RNA/DNA binding proteins (RDBPs) such as FUS and TDP-43. The cytosolic mislocalization and aggregation of these proteins are linked to accumulation of unresolved stress granules (SGs), which exacerbate the disease progression. Poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP)-mediated PARylation plays a critical role in this pathological cascade, making it a potential target for intervention. However, conventional PARP inhibitors are limited by their detrimental effects on DNA repair pathways, which are already compromised in ALS. To address this limitation, we investigated a strategy focused on targeting the cytosolic compartment by expressing the cytosol-specific, natural PAR-glycohydrolase (PARG) isoform, PARG99. Using ALS patient derived FUS mutant induced pluripotent cells (iPSCs) and differentiated neurons, we observed elevated levels of FUS in insoluble fractions in mutant cells compared to mutation-corrected isogenic lines. The insoluble FUS as well as TDP-43 levels increased further in sodium arsenite-treated or oxidatively stressed cells, correlating with accumulation of unresolved SGs. Notably, both PARG99 and PARP inhibitors reduced SG formation and insoluble FUS levels, however, PARG99 treated cells exhibited significantly lower DNA damage markers and improved viability under oxidative and arsenite stress. This study highlights the potential of PARG99 as a cytosol-specific intervention to mitigate FUS-associated toxicity while preserving critical nuclear DNA repair mechanisms, offering a promising strategy for addressing the underlying pathology of ALS and potentially other SG-associated neurodegenerative diseases.

">Processing negative words in pun-humor: dynamic representation of mixed feelings blending amusement and negativity</a></h4>

              
                This study aims to investigate whether amusement and negativity counteract each other or are jointly intensified during the online processing of negative keywords in pun-humor sentences, and how mixed feelings blending these two emotional states are dynamically experienced over time. Participants read three types of sentences that included the same negative words as keywords: pun-humor (negative words can generate humorous effects by resonating with the context), non-humor (negative words seamlessly align with the context), and nonsensical (negative words cannot be integrated with the context) sentences. The behavioral ratings revealed that compared with non-humor and nonsensical sentences, pun-humor sentences evoked stronger amusement and intensified negative feelings, indicating that pun-humor sentences containing negative keywords can effectively elicit mixed feelings that encompass conflicting emotional states. The ERP results showed that the N400 (300-500 ms) elicited by negative words in pun-humor sentences was comparable to that in non-humor sentences, suggesting that negative words were connected contextually in both sentence types. Besides, negative words elicited greater LPC (600-800 ms) in pun-humor sentences than in non-humor and nonsensical sentences, suggesting that pun-humor sentences require additional semantic processing and more elaborate emotional processing. Moreover, the representational similarity analysis (RSA) results revealed that in pun-humor sentences, the representation of negativity persisted for a longer duration, and it occurred and peaked earlier than that of amusement. This implies that within the dynamic representation of mixed feelings, negativity was experienced first, whereas amusement was subsequently felt within a brief period, during which negativity was not offset but rather continued to be represented over a longer time span, resulting in the simultaneous presence of both amused and negative feelings. Taken together, these findings show that mixed feelings elicited during the online processing of negative keywords in pun-humor sentences can be dynamically experienced in a way that aligns with the highly simultaneous pattern and that negativity can be experienced before amusement during the dynamic representation of mixed feelings.

	<p>Background: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and deadly type of brain cancer in adults. Dysregulation of receptor tyrosine kinase pathways, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), contributes to therapeutic resistance. Drugs that inhibit tyrosine kinase activity and monoclonal antibodies against EGFR are strategies used in clinical trials. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a tumor treatment that involves the administration of a photosensitizing drug, followed by its activation with visible light, which causes cell death due to oxidative stress. Although PDT helps prolong median survival in patients with GBM, complete remission has not been achieved. Populations of GBM cells have been obtained from the T98G line resistant to PDT with methyl-5-aminolevulinic acid (Me-ALA) for characterization, comparing them with the original parental population. Objective: The objective of this work was to evaluate the general response of T98G GBM cells resistant to PDT when EGFR activity is inhibited with the drug erlotinib. Methods and results: It has been observed that the administration of the EGFR inhibitor drug in combination with PDT reduced viability (MTT) in resistant populations compared to PDT alone. Furthermore, the PpIX content (flow cytometry) was increased in the resistant population when cells were incubated with Me-ALA and erlotinib. Erlotinib prevented cell proliferation of parental and resistant spheroids. Wound closure was reduced in both parental and PDT-resistant populations. Conclusion: Our results indicate that EGFR activation would be relevant in the resistance of GBM cells to PDT.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Diabetes mellitus (DM), a widespread endocrine disorder characterized by chronic hyperglycemia, can cause nerve damage and increase the risk of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD). Effective blood glucose management is essential, and sitagliptin (SITG), a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, may offer neuroprotective benefits in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods: T2DM was induced in rats using nicotinamide (NICO) and streptozotocin (STZ), and biomarkers of AD and DM-linked enzymes, inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis were evaluated in the brain. Computational studies supported the in vivo findings. Results: SITG significantly reduced the brain enzyme levels of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), beta-secretase-1 (BACE-1), DPP-4, and glycogen synthase kinase-3&amp;amp;beta; (GSK-3&amp;amp;beta;) in T2DM-induced rats. It also reduced inflammation by lowering cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), tumor necrosis factor-&amp;amp;alpha; (TNF-&amp;amp;alpha;), and nuclear factor-&amp;amp;kappa;B (NF-&amp;amp;kappa;B). Additionally, SITG improved oxidative stress markers by reducing malondialdehyde (MDA) and enhancing glutathione (GSH). It increased anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma protein-2 (Bcl-2) while reducing pro-apoptotic markers such as Bcl-2-associated X (BAX) and Caspace-3. SITG also lowered blood glucose levels and improved plasma insulin levels. To explore potential molecular level mechanisms, docking was performed on AChE, COX-2, GSK-3&amp;amp;beta;, BACE-1, and Caspace-3. The potential binding affinity of SITG for the above-mentioned target enzymes were 10.8, 8.0, 9.7, 7.7, and 7.9 kcal/mol, respectively, comparable to co-crystallized ligands. Further binding mode analysis of the lowest energy conformation revealed interactions with the critical residues. Conclusions: These findings highlight SITG&amp;amp;rsquo;s neuroprotective molecular targets in T2DM-associated neurodegeneration and its potential as a therapeutic approach for AD, warranting further clinical investigations.</p>

	<p>Background: Concentric vessel-wall contrast enhancement (VW-CE) of the terminal carotid artery and its proximal branches may be linked to ischemic strokes, disease activity and progression in Moyamoya disease (MMD). The objective of this retrospective cohort study is to analyze the association between VW-CE and perioperative acute ischemic stroke (PAIS) occurring within 24 h after revascularization. Methods: All previously untreated MMD patients who required revascularization and who had undergone preoperative MRI with VW-CE-sequences were included. PAIS was detected by CT and/or diffusion-weighted MRI sequences within 24 h postoperatively. Results: Of the 110 patients included (female-to-male ratio: 2.7:1, median age: 45.1 (16.6&amp;amp;ndash;69.2); n = 247 revascularizations), a priori VW-CE was present in 67.3% (mean time from MRI to first surgery: 86 days &amp;amp;plusmn; 82 days). PAIS occurred in five patients undergoing primary revascularization (PAIS rate per revascularization: 2.1%), all of whom had a preoperative pathological VW-CE in the vascular segment corresponding to the stroke area. Two (40%) incidents of PAIS occurred in revascularized territory, while three (60%) occurred in non-revascularized vascular territory. In each case, the supplying artery exhibited VW-CE, indicating disease activity. No additional PAIS occurred during subsequent revascularizations in cases of multistage procedures (n = 38), such as ACA or PCA revascularization as a second step. Conclusion: Preoperative VW-CE in one or more vascular segments may be a marker for postoperative stroke in the respective vascular territory at the time of revascularization. VW-CE imaging should be routinely performed when planning revascularization in MMD. If VW-CE is found, strict perioperative monitoring of these high-risk patients should be performed to achieve the best results possible.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Narcolepsy is a chronic neurologic disorder associated with substantial challenges that affect the social, emotional, and financial quality-of-life domains. A social listening analysis and structured survey were conducted to better understand the candid perspective of people with narcolepsy (PWN) and their experience with twice-nightly sodium oxybate (SXB). Methods: To characterize conversations and experiences in narcolepsy communities where SXB was mentioned, a social media analysis was conducted from August 2011 to October 2022. A structured survey was administered to PWN taking oxybate therapy from October 2022 to November 2022. Results: From the social media analysis, the largest topic was related to &amp;amp;ldquo;cataplexy&amp;amp;rdquo;, with 537 posts/comments. The most frequent term was &amp;amp;ldquo;xyrem&amp;amp;rdquo;, with 22,200 mentions. Of the 87 survey respondents, 85 respondents had narcolepsy, 75.3% (64/85) reported missing their second dose of immediate-release SXB or mixed-salt oxybates, and 58.8% (50/85) of respondents reported that they took their second dose of oxybate &amp;amp;gt; 4 h after the first dose. Respondents reported poor sleep quality as the greatest effect or issue experienced after missing their second oxybate dose. When respondents were asked whether they had ever been injured after waking to take their second oxybate dose, 31.8% (27/85) of respondents reported an injury. Conclusions: PWN taking twice-nightly oxybates often report inconsistent adherence to the prescribed dosing, which results in negative consequences in their lives. This research provided an anonymized forum for PWN to voice challenges with middle-of-the-night awakenings that they may be reluctant to explain to their clinician.</p>

	<p>Background: There is currently increasing interest in the implication of traumatic brain injury (TBI) as a potential risk factor for long-term neurodegenerative conditions, such as dementia and Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD). In this context, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the association between TBI and the risk of dementia. Methods: A systematic search was performed across multiple electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library, to identify relevant meta-analyses and cohort studies. Studies were included if they reported effect sizes (odds ratios [ORs] or relative risks [RRs]) for the association between TBI, its severity, and the risk of dementia or AD. Meta-analyses were performed using random-effects models to account for heterogeneity, and sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results: A total of six studies were included in the analysis. The pooled results showed that TBI significantly increases the risk of dementia, with an overall odds ratio of 1.81 (95% CI: 1.53&amp;amp;ndash;2.14). Mild TBI was associated with a modest increase in dementia risk (OR = 1.96, 95% CI: 1.70&amp;amp;ndash;2.26), while moderate-to-severe TBI showed a stronger association (OR = 1.95, 95% CI: 1.55&amp;amp;ndash;2.45). In contrast, the association between TBI and AD was less consistent, with the pooled OR for AD being 1.18 (at 95% CI: 1.11&amp;amp;ndash;1.25) for mild TBI; however, in several studies, no significant association was observed (OR = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.91&amp;amp;ndash;1.15). The results also indicated substantial heterogeneity across studies, particularly in relation to AD outcomes. Conclusions: The findings from this umbrella meta-analysis confirm that TBI is a significant risk factor for dementia, with more severe TBIs conferring a higher risk. While mild TBIs also increase the risk of dementia, the effect is more pronounced in moderate-to-severe injuries. The evidence linking TBI to AD is less robust, with inconsistent findings across studies. Clinicians should consider long-term cognitive screening and management for individuals with a history of TBI, particularly those with moderate-to-severe injuries.</p>

	<p>Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the onset time to habitual psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) in adults referred to Guy&amp;amp;rsquo;s and St Thomas&amp;amp;rsquo; Neurophysiology Department for home video telemetry (HVT) with a clinical question of PNES. The primary objective was to determine the optimal time window for HVT recording for patients with suspected PNES to try to improve the allocation of clinical resources. The secondary objective was to explore any potential association between time to habitual PN ES onset and demographic indexes and other clinical, neuro-radiological and semiological findings. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of our XLTEK database between 2019 and 2020. A multifactorial analysis of PNES semiologic subtypes, patient demographics, psychiatric comorbidities and neuroimaging was conducted to explore their impact on time to PNES within an HVT study. People who had at least one typical PNES during their recording were included. The exclusion criteria included people who had the test performed without video recording. The total number of participants was 37. The data were extracted from our local XLTEK database. Statistical analyses using Mann&amp;amp;ndash;Whitney U and Fischer exact tests were carried out. Results: The mean time to first habitual PNES onset was seven hours, with a mean recording duration of 46 h. The most commonly occurring event type was blank spells (12, 32%), with the least common presentation being d&amp;amp;eacute;j&amp;amp;agrave; vu (1, 3%). There was a significant association between time to PNES onset and male sex (p = 0.04). There was a significant association between time to PNES onset and abnormal MRI findings (p = 0.02). Particular PNES semiologic subtypes were not significantly linked with PNES onset time. Conclusions: Our study highlights that on average, patients with PNES will rapidly have their first habitual event within an HVT study (mean time to event onset of seven hours), consistent with the current literature. This raises the question of whether HVT study duration could be reduced to release study resources and aid departmental efficiencies. We also observe the novel finding that men presented significantly earlier with their habitual PNES event than women, and that abnormal imaging findings were also significantly associated with an earlier time to event onset, although the reason for this association is yet to be determined.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: The biological basis for behavioral manifestations of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease remains unclear. Emotional and behavioral alterations of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease can result in substantial caregiver burden and lack effective management. This study expands upon previous work investigating behavioral alterations in mice with Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease and a potential treatment of increasing brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Methods: A total of 47 3xTg-AD (Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s) and 53 B6 (wildtype) mice were administered with ANA12 (an antagonist of TrkB receptor) or Vehicle (saline) and then rTMS or Sham treatment daily. After 14 days of treatments and injections, mouse behavior was assessed under various behavioral cognitive tests. Mice were then perfused, and brain samples were processed for histology and protein assays. Brain homogenates were analyzed for BDNF and its downstream signaling molecules. Results: Open field testing demonstrated that 3xTg-AD mice spent more time in the center than B6 mice. 3xTg-AD-Sham mice injected with ANA12 were the only group to travel significantly less distance than B6-ANA12-Sham or B6-Vehicle-Sham mice (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), while 3xTg-AD-rTMS mice (irrespective of injection) were not significantly different from B6 mice. 3xTg-AD mice had significantly greater measured levels of BDNF and TrkB than the wild-type mice. Conclusions: Treatment of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease using rTMS positively affects elements of hypoactivity, but not all behavioral abnormalities. rTMS shifted 3xTg-AD open field behavioral test measures, generating significant differences between untreated 3xTg-AD and B6 genotypes. Despite its benefit, further investigation of rTMS as a treatment for Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease as well as its biological underpinnings are needed.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: The impact of stroke location and volume on the development of post-stroke dysphagia is not fully understood. The aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship between acute ischemic lesions and the severity of dysphagia. Methods: Brain MRIs were obtained with a 1.5 Tesla MRI system (Magnetom Avanto B13, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). The brain MRI protocol included axial echo planar diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). The acute ischemic volume was obtained using DWI by drawing regions of interest (ROIs). The diagnosis and assessment of the severity of dysphagia was carried out by a multidisciplinary team and included the Dysphagia Outcome and Severity Scale (DOSS), the Penetration&amp;amp;ndash;Aspiration Scale (PAS), and the Pooling score (P-score). The threshold for statistical significance was set at 5%. Results: Among all the patients enrolled (n = 64), 28 (43.8%) were males and 36 (56.2%) were females, with a mean age of 78.8 years. Thirty-three (51.6%) of them had mild dysphagia and thirty-one (48.4%) had moderate&amp;amp;ndash;severe dysphagia. The total ischemic volume was negatively correlated with the DOSS (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.441, p = 0.0003) and positively with the P-score (rs = 0.3054, p = 0.0328). Conclusions: There are significant associations between the severity of dysphagia and the quantitative DWI-based data of the acute ischemic volume and anatomical location.</p>

	<p>Background: Transferring learned manipulations to new manipulation tasks has enabled humans to realize thousands of dexterous object manipulations in daily life. Two-digit grasp and three-digit grasp manipulations require different fingertip forces, and our brain can switch grasp types to ensure good performance according to motor memory. We hypothesized that several brain areas contribute to the execution of the new type of motor according to the motor memory. However, the motor memory mechanisms during this transfer period are still unclear. In the present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we aimed to investigate the cortical mechanisms involved in motor memory during the transfer phase of learned manipulation tasks. Methods: Using a custom-built T-shaped object with an adjustable weight distribution, the participants performed grasp and lift manipulation tasks under different conditions to simulate the learning and transfer phases. The learning phase consisted of four grasp-and-lift repetitions with one motor type, followed by a transfer phase with four repetitions involving different motors (adding or removing a digit). Results: By comparing brain activity in the learning and transfer phases, we identified three regions (the superior frontal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, and postcentral gyrus) associated with motor memory during the transfer of learned manipulations. Conclusions: Our findings improve the understanding of the role of the posterior parietal cortex in motor memory, highlighting how sensory information from memory and real-time input is integrated to generate novel motor control signals that guide the precise reapplication of control strategies. Furthermore, we believe that these areas contribute to motor learning from motor memory and may serve as key regions of interest for investigating neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

	<p>Background: Response&amp;amp;ndash;response (RR) binding, involving the integration of independently planned and executed responses, presents a novel perspective on action control. While behavioral evidence on RR binding has been extensively examined, corresponding electrophysiological evidence remains scarce. This study aims to contribute novel insights into RR binding by event-related potentials (ERP) techniques to provide new evidence for RR binding. Methods: An adapted prime-probe paradigm was employed, in which the required responses could either involve repetition or change conditions from the prime to the probe phase. EEG data were collected from thirty-six participants, and ERP analysis focused on the peak amplitude and latency of the P1 and P3 components. Results: Notably shorter RTs were observed in the response&amp;amp;ndash;repetition conditions compared to others, consistent with previous findings on RR binding. Furthermore, the response&amp;amp;ndash;repetition conditions exhibited larger P3 amplitudes and shorter P1 and P3 latencies relative to other conditions. Conclusions: In summary, this study strengthens the evidence base for RR binding by bridging both behavioral and electrophysiological perspectives.</p>

	<p>Introduction: In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative tool for enhancing stroke diagnosis, aiding treatment decision making, and improving overall patient care. Leading AI-driven platforms such as RapidAI, Brainomix&amp;amp;reg;, and Viz.ai have been developed to assist healthcare professionals in the swift and accurate assessment of stroke patients. Methods: Following the PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive systematic review was conducted using PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus. Characteristic descriptive measures were gathered as appropriate from all included studies, including the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and comparison of the available tools. Results: A total of 31 studies were included, of which 29 studies focused on detecting acute ischemic stroke (AIS) or large vessel occlusions (LVOs), and 2 studies focused on hemorrhagic strokes. The four main tools used were Viz.ai, RapidAI, Brainomix&amp;amp;reg;, and deep learning modules. Conclusions: AI tools in the treatment of stroke have demonstrated usefulness for diagnosing different stroke types, providing high levels of accuracy and helping to make quicker and more precise clinical judgments.</p>

	<p>Background: In the last decade, empirical studies on the beneficial effects of meditation on prosocial capacities have accumulated, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Buddhist sources state that liberating oneself from a fixed view of the self by gaining access to its transitory and malleable nature leads to increased compassion and other prosocial traits. These, however, have not yet been empirically tested. Methods: The current study aims at filling this gap by first examining whether 44 long term meditators differ from 53 controls in prosocial capacities on different levels of the socio-cognitive hierarchy, and second by examining whether these are associated with meditation-induced &amp;amp;lsquo;selfless&amp;amp;rsquo; states, operationalized here as the sense of boundary (SB) flexibility. We capitalize on our previous work on the neurophenomenology of mindfulness-induced SB dissolution, which yielded a neural index of SB-flexibility, solely for the meditators, and examine its correlations with a battery of validated behavioral prosociality tasks. Results: Our findings reveal enhanced low-level prosocial processes in meditators, including enhanced emotion recognition and reduced outgroup bias. We show the stability of SB flexibility over a year, demonstrating consistent high beta deactivation. The neural index of SB flexibility negatively correlates with recognizing negative emotions, suggesting a link to reduced social threat perception. Conclusions: These results connect the neural correlates of SB flexibility to prosociality, supported by stable high beta deactivations. We expect the results to raise awareness regarding the prosocial potential of flexing one&amp;amp;rsquo;s self-boundaries through meditation.</p>

                Introduction Many Ethiopian women, especially those who live in rural and pastoral areas, have little knowledge and a negative attitude toward long-acting reversible family planning. Therefore, this study investigated the factors that affect the knowledge and attitudes of women toward long-acting reversible contraceptives among pastoral women in southern Ethiopia. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 376 women of reproductive age who were randomly selected from three pastoral districts in the West Guji Zone. The data were collected by using a pretested interviewer-administered questionnaire. Ordinary logistic regression analyses with a p value < 0.05 were used to determine statistical significance. Results Less than half, 118 (31.40%), of the study participants had good knowledge, and 88 (23.40%) had a positive attitude toward long-acting reversible contraceptives. The negative predictors of good knowledge and positive attitudes were never attending school (OR: 0.31; 95% CI: 0.10, 0.96), not having a job (OR: 0.39; 95% CI: 0.19, 0.79), having an unplanned pregnancy (OR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.24, 0.63) and not having a history of abortion (OR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.21, 0.78). Conclusions Having maternal education, being employed, having a planned pregnancy, having partner support for family planning and having a history of abortion were predictors for good knowledge and positive attitudes. Thus, this study recommends collaborative efforts between the health sector and other stakeholders to support women’s employment and education, as well as developing a program to spread family planning-related messaging to enhance women’s attitudes and understanding.

                The translation of animal-based biomedical research into clinical research is often inadequate. Maximizing translation should be central to animal research on human diseases, guiding researchers in study design and animal model selection. However, practical considerations often drive the choice of animal model, which may not always reflect key patient characteristics, such as sex and age, impacting the disease's course. Despite diseases affecting both sexes, researchers frequently use male mice. To address this imbalance, journals and funding agencies have begun questioning the sex of animals used in studies and issued new guidelines. Conversely, the age of rodents is rarely discussed, even though many diseases primarily affect older patients. Young mice are commonly used, even in studies of diseases affecting older adults. Systematic comparisons between the age of rodents used and the age of patients in clinical trials are lacking. In this review, we systematically analyze the age and sex of mice used to model the five leading causes of global disability-adjusted life-years over the age of 75. We compare the results with the age and sex of patients in clinical trials focusing on Alzheimer's disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We also analyze whether the age of the mice used has changed over the past decade. By systematically assessing the age and sex of the mice, we aim to initiate a discussion on the appropriate choice of animal model to improve the translatability of research results.

                Background Forward Shoulder Posture (FSP) is one of the most common postural deviations of the upper back, which may affect the scapulohumeral rhythm (SHR). This study aimed to investigate changes in scapulohumeral rhythm during scapular plane shoulder abduction between individuals with and without FSP. Methods A cross sectional study with two group comparison. Young adults with FSP (N=39) with a forward shoulder angle ≥ 52°and without FSP(N=40) with a forward shoulder angle < 52° were recruited for the study. Scapular upward rotation was measured with the help of two inclinometers during scapular plane shoulder abduction, at resting shoulder abduction, at 30°, 60°, 90°, 120°, 150°, and at full range of shoulder abduction, and SHR was calculated. The scapulohumeral rhythm was compared between the two groups using an independent t test. Results Data analysis showed a statistically significant difference in scapulohumeral rhythm at 30°(p=0.004), 60°(p=0.013), and 90°(p=0.009) shoulder abduction between the two groups. There were no significant differences in the other ranges of shoulder abduction between the two groups. Conclusion Forward shoulder posture alters the scapulohumeral rhythm between 30 ° and 90°shoulder abduction. Clinicians, trainers, and sports therapists should be aware of this change to intervene at an early stage and prevent the development of pathological conditions around the shoulder.

                Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP) is widely used as a reporter gene, aiding in protein recovery and transduction studies. In this study, EGFP was tagged with eleven arginine residues (PolyR) and six histidine residues (His-tag) for purification. The aim was to enhance the synthesis of EGFP-PolyR in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and evaluate the effects of polyarginine modification on protein stability and expression levels. The expression of EGFP and EGFP-PolyR in S. cerevisiae was assessed through fluorescence measurements and protein levels. Structural analyses were conducted using in silico tools to investigate changes in beta strands and helices, which were validated through Western blots. Results showed that EGFP-PolyR maintained similar fluorescence levels to EGFP, but with notable structural changes. EGFP-PolyR's final beta strand terminates at Ala228, compared to Gly229 in EGFP, affecting the beta sheet's stability. Structural modifications also included altered helix lengths, with a longer helix 10 and shorter helix 9 in EGFP-PolyR. These alterations, along with shifts in helix-helix interactions, contribute to destabilization. Additionally, EGFP-PolyR exhibited unique gamma coils absent in EGFP, further differentiating its structure. The structural changes led to decreased protein expression and solubility, as indicated by Western blot analysis, with EGFP-PolyR showing significantly lower expression levels. The findings suggest that EGFP-PolyR is prone to aggregation and misfolding, characteristics often associated with aggregation-prone proteins.In conclusion, the polyarginine modification significantly impacts the structural integrity, stability, and solubility of EGFP. While fluorescence is retained, these changes hinder protein detectability and purification, highlighting the importance of considering structural alterations when modifying reporter proteins for experimental use.

                Background “Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI)” is a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders involving collagen type I with a 10–30% incidence of bleeding diathesis placing these individuals at an increased risk of bleeding. Our study aims to ascertain the risk factors that increase the propensity of perioperative blood transfusions in pediatric population. Methods A single center retrospective observational study of patients aged <18 years undergoing orthopedic surgeries at our tertiary care hospital from January 2016 to August 2024 were included and each surgery was analyzed as a discrete event. Age, type of OI, number of osteotomies, and number of bones operated simultaneously were recorded. The fall in hemoglobin, requirement for blood transfusions and associated factors were analyzed. Results Amongst 53 individuals who underwent surgery, 141 procedures were analyzed. The mean age was 11.07± 5.29 years, majority (n=33;62.2%) were phenotypically type III OI, and 42/53 (79%) patients underwent multiple osteotomies. Significant hemoglobin fall was observed after surgery (p<0.001) and was considerable in patients undergoing various osteotomies (p=0.002). Older children showed a smaller drop in hemoglobin level. Patients with type III OI showed significant hemoglobin fall (1.82 ± 0.86 g/dL). The transfusion requirement was seen in 23 (16.3%) surgeries besides it was significant in those undergoing multiple osteotomies (p= <0.05). Conclusion Our study inferred that the fall in hemoglobin was significant postoperatively in OI patients and was associated with younger age, type III OI, and multiple osteotomies. Before performing orthopedic surgeries on patients with OI, surgeons might consider the latter risk factors to explore therapeutic options aimed at reducing hemorrhage and improving outcomes.

                Background Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) methodology is considered the most suitable approach for relative performance efficiency calculation for banks as it is believed to be superior to traditional ratio-based analysis and other conventional performance evaluations. This study provides statistical evidence on the sampling error that can creep into performance evaluation studies using the DEA methodology. Inferences are drawn based on samples, and various preventive measures must be taken to eliminate or avoid sampling errors and misleading results. This study demonstrates the possibility of sampling error in DEA with the secondary data available in financial statements and reports from a sample set of banks. Methods The samples included 15 public sectors and five leading private sector banks in India based on their market share, and the data for calculating efficiencies were retrieved from the published audited reports. The sample data was collected from 2014 to 2017 because the banking sector in India witnessed a series of mergers of public sector banks post-2017, and the data after that would be skewed and not comparable due to the demonetization policy implementation and merger process-related consolidation implemented by the Government of India. The efficiency measures thus computed are further analyzed using non-parametric statistical tests. Results We found statistically significant discrepancies in the efficiency score calculations using DEA approach when specific outlier values. Evidence is provided on statistically significant differences in the efficiencies due to the inclusion and exclusion of particular samples in the DEA. Conclusion The study offers a novel contribution along with statistical evidence on the possible sampling error that can creep into the performance evaluation of organizations while applying the DEA methodology.

Research on cell differentiation facilitates a deeper understanding of the fundamental processes of life, elucidates the intrinsic mechanisms underlying diseases such as cancer, and advances the development of therapeutics and precision medicine. Existing methods for inferring cell differentiation trajectories from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data primarily rely on static gene expression data to measure distances between cells and subsequently infer pseudotime trajectories. In this work, we introduce a novel method, scGRN-Entropy, for inferring cell differentiation trajectories and pseudotime from scRNA-seq data. Unlike existing approaches, scGRN-Entropy improves inference accuracy by incorporating dynamic changes in gene regulatory networks (GRN). In scGRN-Entropy, an undirected graph representing state transitions between cells is constructed by integrating both static relationships in gene expression space and dynamic relationships in the GRN space. The edges of the undirected graph are then refined using pseudotime inferred based on cell entropy in the GRN space. Finally, the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm is applied to derive the cell differentiation trajectory. We validate the accuracy of scGRN-Entropy on eight different real scRNA-seq datasets, demonstrating its superior performance in inferring cell differentiation trajectories through comparative analysis with existing state-of-the-art methods.

                <p>by Maurizio Porfiri, Nicole Abaid, Simon Garnier</p>

Despite almost a century of research on energetics in biological systems, we still cannot explain energy regulation in social groups, like ant colonies. How do individuals regulate their collective activity without a centralized control system? What is the role of social interactions in distributing the workload amongst group members? And how does the group save energy by avoiding being constantly active? We offer new insight into these questions by studying an intuitive compartmental model, calibrated with and compared to data on ant colonies. The model describes a previously unexplored balance between positive and negative social feedback driven by individual activity: when activity levels are low, the presence of active individuals stimulates inactive individuals to start working; when activity levels are high, however, active individuals inhibit each other, effectively capping the proportion of active individuals at any one time. Through the analysis of the system stability, we demonstrate that this balance results in energetic spending at the group level growing proportionally slower than the group size. Our finding is reminiscent of Kleiber’s law of metabolic scaling in unitary organisms and highlights the critical role of social interactions in driving the collective energetic efficiency of group-living organisms.

                <p>by Noa L. Hedrich, Eric Schulz, Sam Hall-McMaster, Nicolas W. Schuck</p>

Identifying goal-relevant features in novel environments is a central challenge for efficient behaviour. We asked whether humans address this challenge by relying on prior knowledge about common properties of reward-predicting features. One such property is the rate of change of features, given that behaviourally relevant processes tend to change on a slower timescale than noise. Hence, we asked whether humans are biased to learn more when task-relevant features are slow rather than fast. To test this idea, 295 human participants were asked to learn the rewards of two-dimensional bandits when either a slowly or quickly changing feature of the bandit predicted reward. Across two experiments and one preregistered replication, participants accrued more reward when a bandit’s relevant feature changed slowly, and its irrelevant feature quickly, as compared to the opposite. We did not find a difference in the ability to generalise to unseen feature values between conditions. Testing how feature speed could affect learning with a set of four function approximation Kalman filter models revealed that participants had a higher learning rate for the slow feature, and adjusted their learning to both the relevance and the speed of feature changes. The larger the improvement in participants’ performance for slow compared to fast bandits, the more strongly they adjusted their learning rates. These results provide evidence that human reinforcement learning favours slower features, suggesting a bias in how humans approach reward learning.

                <p>by Vitaly V. Ganusov, Afsal Kolloli, Selvakumar Subbian</p>

Tuberculosis (TB), the disease caused by <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (Mtb), remains a major health problem with 10.6 million cases of the disease and 1.6 million deaths in 2021. It is well understood that pulmonary TB is due to Mtb growth in the lung but quantitative estimates of rates of Mtb replication and death in lungs of patients or animals such as monkeys or rabbits remain largely unknown. We performed experiments with rabbits infected with a novel, virulent clinical Mtb isolate of the Beijing lineage, HN878, carrying an unstable plasmid pBP10. In our in vitro experiments we found that pBP10 is more stable in HN878 strain than in a more commonly used laboratory-adapted Mtb strain H37Rv (the segregation coefficient being <i>s</i> = 0.10 in HN878 vs. <i>s</i> = 0.18 in H37Rv). Interestingly, the kinetics of plasmid-bearing bacteria in lungs of Mtb-infected rabbits did not follow an expected monotonic decline; the percent of plasmid-bearing cells increased between 28 and 56 days post-infection and remained stable between 84 and 112 days post-infection despite a large increase in bacterial numbers in the lung at late time points. Mathematical modeling suggested that such a non-monotonic change in the percent of plasmid-bearing cells can be explained if the lung Mtb population consists of several (at least 2) sub-populations with different replication/death kinetics: one major population expanding early and being controlled/eliminated, while another, a smaller population expanding at later times causing a counterintuitive increase in the percent of plasmid-bearing cells. Importantly, a model with one kinetically homogeneous Mtb population could not explain the data including when the model was run stochastically. Given that in rabbits HN878 strain forms well circumscribed granulomas, our results suggest independent bacterial dynamics in subsets of such granulomas. Our model predictions can be tested in future experiments in which HN878-pBP10 dynamics in individual granulomas is followed over time. Taken together, our new data and mathematical modeling-based analyses illustrate differences in Mtb dynamics in mice and rabbits confirming a perhaps somewhat obvious observation that “rabbits are not mice”.

                <p>by Jojo A. Prentice, Sandhya Kasivisweswaran, Robert van de Weerd, Andrew A. Bridges</p>

Bacteria frequently colonize niches by forming multicellular communities called biofilms. To explore new territories, cells exit biofilms through an active process called dispersal. Biofilm dispersal is essential for bacteria to spread between infection sites, yet how the process is executed at the single-cell level remains mysterious due to the limitations of traditional fluorescent proteins, which lose functionality in large, oxygen-deprived biofilms. To overcome this challenge, we developed a cell-labeling strategy utilizing fluorogen-activating proteins (FAPs) and cognate far-red dyes, which remain functional throughout biofilm development, enabling long-term imaging. Using this approach, we characterize dispersal at unprecedented resolution for the global pathogen <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>. We reveal that dispersal initiates at the biofilm periphery and approximately 25% of cells never disperse. We define novel micro-scale patterns that occur during dispersal, including biofilm compression during cell departure and regional heterogeneity in cell motions. These patterns are attenuated in mutants that reduce overall dispersal or that increase dispersal at the cost of homogenizing local mechanical properties. Collectively, our findings provide fundamental insights into the mechanisms of biofilm dispersal, advancing our understanding of how pathogens disseminate. Moreover, we demonstrate the broad applicability of FAPs as a powerful tool for high-resolution studies of microbial dynamics in complex environments.

Understanding the origin of eukaryotic cells is one of the most difficult problems in all of biology. A key challenge relevant to the question of eukaryogenesis is reconstructing the gene repertoire of the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA). As data sets grow, sketching an accurate genomics-informed picture of early eukaryotic cellular complexity requires provision of analytical resources and a commitment to data sharing. Here, we summarise progress towards understanding the biology of LECA and outline a community approach to inferring its wider gene repertoire. Once assembled, a robust LECA gene set will be a useful tool for evaluating alternative hypotheses about the origin of eukaryotes and understanding the evolution of traits in all descendant lineages, with relevance in diverse fields such as cell biology, microbial ecology, biotechnology, agriculture, and medicine. In this Consensus View, we put forth the status quo and an agreed path forward to reconstruct LECA’s gene content.

                Background This study examines the challenges faced by Ethiopian public universities in achieving institutional, administrative, academic, and financial autonomy. Institutional autonomy refers to a university’s ability to self-govern, set its mission, and establish policies without external interference. Administrative autonomy concerns decision-making in operations, academic autonomy relates to academic freedom and quality assurance, and financial autonomy involves control over resources and revenue generation. In Ethiopia, centralized governance, political interference, and limited financial strategies create significant barriers to autonomy. Method A qualitative research approach was employed, utilizing semi-structured interviews, key informant interviews, focus group discussions, and direct observations. Data were collected from 59 participants across three public universities. Tools included consent forms, interview guides, focus group discussion guides, and observation checklists. Thematic analysis was used to identify key patterns in the autonomy challenges. The study is grounded in Institutional Theory, Principal-Agent Theory, and Resource Dependency Theory. Result The findings indicate that institutional autonomy is constrained by centralized governance and political interference, limiting universities’ ability to make independent decisions, as explained by Institutional Theory. Administrative autonomy faces similar restrictions, with decision-making influenced by external entities, as highlighted by Principal-Agent Theory. Academic autonomy is challenged by the tension between standardization and institutional diversity, particularly in quality assurance and accreditation. Financial autonomy is limited by restricted revenue sources, economic instability, and a lack of innovative funding strategies, as discussed through Resource Dependency Theory. Conclusion The study concludes that Ethiopian public universities face significant barriers to autonomy. Addressing these challenges requires reducing strict governmental control, improving governance structures, and promoting independent decision-making and sources of incomes. Recommendations The study recommends implementing governance reforms, providing leadership training for university administrators, enhancing academic freedom with flexible quality assurance systems, and diversifying revenue streams through partnerships and expanded university enterprises to ensure financial sustainability.

                Background Home care services are an extension of hospital services provided by hospital staff. The hospital must conduct evaluation, coordination, and education for home care patients to ensure proper care and expedite their recovery. This service also introduces a new concept to the community, as it can help save on costs and equipment. The purpose of this study has been added to the background, namely to determine what factors can influence patient satisfaction with home care services from previously published literature. A systematic review examined the factors influencing patient satisfaction using home care services by following the PRISMA guidelines. PROSPERO submitted and approved the study protocol with the following numbers: CRD42023482315. Researchers have searched articles through the ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases. The researcher chose the three databases that are open access providers. Including Scopus and ScienceDirect are article search databases that can be accessed directly in the electronic resources of the University of Indonesia Library. The 10-year time span is considered as a source of literature that is still relevant to be used as a reference in evaluating home care service satisfaction. Result Two hundred eighty-eight articles were selected, but 10 met the inclusion criteria. It was found that factors influenced patient satisfaction with home care services and two things that did not affect them: financial aspects and working time. Conclusion Fifteen aspects influence patient satisfaction and two aspects that do not influence patient satisfaction. It is expected that the results of this literature review can be used as a reference for hospitals that provide home care services to pay attention to aspects that can affect satisfaction. The author realizes that the varying methods in the articles reviewed are deficiencies in the results of this study.

                Background Studies have this reported the presence of death anxiety, ranging from near-death experiences to physically ill people, to a simple thought about death, as well as when it is associated with states of loneliness. The Templer’s Death Anxiety Scale (DAS), based on Eysenk’s incubation theory, has been adapted and validated in different contexts and is still insufficient in countries such as Peru. This study aimed to determine the psychometric properties of the DAS, its internal structure, and factorial invariance. Methods An online scale was used in 1248 Peruvians aged between 18 and 70 years (M= 27.37, SD= 11.29) from all regions. DAS was validated using exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), convergent validity, measurement invariance, and internal consistency (reliability). Results Psychometric properties were found with adequate values in its structure and validity based on the internal structure through exploratory factor analysis, where it was found that the components of the scale are interrelated and the data matrix is factorizable. model of three specific factors and a general factor is presented, which is consistent with the theory and has practical utility, revealing adequate statistical values that reflect acceptable levels of reliability. Finally, there was fairness according to sex and age group of the scale by means of factorial invariance analysis. Conclusions Our results indicate adequate psychometric properties and facilitate a better data collection process for future research.

                Background RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play a critical role in regulating gene expression by binding to specific sites on RNA molecules. Identifying these binding sites is crucial for understanding the many functions of RBPs in cellular function, development and disease. Current experimental methods for identifying RBP binding sites, such as ultra-violet (UV) crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP), and especially the enhanced CLIP (eCLIP) protocol, were developed to identify authentic RBP binding sites experimentally. Methods To make this data more accessible to the scientific community, we have developed RBP-Tar (https://ncbr.muni.cz/RBP-Tar ), a web server and database that utilises eCLIP data for 167 RBPs mapped on the human genome. The web server allows researchers to easily search and retrieve binding site information by genomic location and RBP name. Use case Researchers can produce lists of all known RBP binding sites on a gene of interest, or produce lists of binding sites for one RBP on different genomic loci. Conclusions Our future goal is to continue to populate the web server with additional experimental datasets from CLIP experiments as they become available and processed, making it an increasingly valuable resource for the scientific community.

                A cerebral arteriovenous malformation (cAVM) is an abnormal tangle of cerebral blood vessels. The consensus document by the Joint Writing Group (JWG) highlighted which cAVM features should be recorded. Subsequent publications have reported cAVM angioarchitecture, but it is unknown if all followed the JWG recommendations. The aim of this systematic review was to describe use of the JWG guidelines. A database search, using the PRISMA checklist, was performed. We describe the proportion of publications that used JWG reporting standards, which standards were used, whether the definitions used differed from the JWG, or if any additional angiographic features were reported. Out of 4306 articles identified, 105 were selected, and a further 114 from other sources. Thirty-three studies (33/219; 15%) specifically referred to using JWG standards. Since the JWG publication, few studies have used their standards to report cAVMs. This implies that the angioarchitecture of cAVMs are not routinely fully described.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>B-cell–depletion via CD20 antibodies is a safe and effective treatment for active relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS). Both ocrelizumab (OCR) and ofatumumab (OFA) have demonstrated efficacy in randomized controlled trials and are approved for treatment of RMS, yet nothing is known on their comparative effectiveness, especially in the real-world setting.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This prospective cohort study includes patients that were started on either OCR or OFA between September 2021 and December 2023. Patients were followed until June 2024 and recruited at 3 large tertiary centers in Germany (Duesseldorf, Essen, and Giessen). Propensity-score-matching was used to address baseline imbalances among patients. Clinical relapses, presence of new or enlarging MRI lesions and 6-month confirmed disability worsening were evaluated. Non-inferiority of OFA compared to OCR was evaluated through comparison of Kaplan–Meier-estimates.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 1,138 patients were initially enrolled in the cohort. Following patient selection and propensity-score-matching, 544 OCR and 417 OFA patients were included in the final analysis. In our primary analysis, OFA was non-inferior to OCR in terms of relapses, disability progression, and accrual of MRI lesions. Subgroup analyses confirmed findings in previously naïve and platform-treated patients. Potential differences between OFA and OCR were seen in patients switching from S1P receptor modulators or natalizumab.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We here provide comparative data on the effectiveness of OCR and OFA in patients with active RMS. OFA was non-inferior to OCR in the overall cohort. Potential differences observed in patients switching from S1P receptor modulators or natalizumab require further validation. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Refractory status epilepticus (RSE) is a condition with serious mortality and morbidity rate, resistant to benzodiazepine and second-line antiepileptic drugs. This study aimed to electrophysiologically investigate the combination of NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine and GABAergic agent propofol in an RSE model induced by lithium-pilocarpine in male Sprague–Dawley rats. Seventy-two male Sprague–Dawley rats were divided into nine groups. The RSE model was induced by subcutaneous injection of lithium-CI (5 mEq/kg) and intraperitoneal injection of pilocarpine-HCl (320 mg/kg), after implanting tripolar EEG electrode. Ketamine (30, 60, and 90 mg/kg), propofol (20, 40, and 80 mg/kg), and combinations of both drugs (15 + 20 and 30 + 40 mg/kg) were administered intraperitoneally to animals with RSE. Video-EEG recordings were taken after inducing model and 48 h later. The efficacy of drugs was statistically evaluated based on spike frequencies (spikes/min) and amplitudes (mV). Compared to RSE group, it was determined that 30 and 60 mg/kg doses of ketamine provided effective seizure control and prevented mortality (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), while the 90 mg/kg showed toxic effects in all animals and caused mortality. The 80 mg/kg dose of propofol provided seizure control and reduced the mortality rate to 16.7% (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), whereas the 20 mg/kg resulted in a 100% mortality rate. The low-dose ketamine+propofol (15 + 20 mg/kg) combination provided early onset seizure control and were as effective as 80 mg/kg propofol (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The study concluded that in the experimental RSE model, seizure control could be achieved with low-dose combination of ketamine and propofol without the need for high doses as in monotherapy, thus preventing dose-related adverse effects.</p>
