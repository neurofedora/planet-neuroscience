                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The transcriptional heterogeneity at a single-nucleus level in human Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) dystrophic muscle has not been explored. Here, we aimed to understand the transcriptional heterogeneity associated with myonuclei, as well as other mononucleated cell types that underly BMD pathogenesis by performing single-nucleus RNA sequencing.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We profiled single-nucleus transcriptional profiles of skeletal muscle samples from 7 BMD patients and 3 normal controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 17,216 nuclei (12,879 from BMD patients and 4,337 from controls) were classified into 13 known cell types, including 9 myogenic lineages and 4 non-myogenic lineages, and 1 unclassified nuclear type according to their cell identities. Among them, type IIx myonuclei were the first to degenerate in response to dystrophin reduction. Differential expression analysis revealed that the fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) population had the largest transcriptional changes among all cell types. Sub-clustering analysis identified a significantly compositional increase in the activated FAPs (aFAPs) subpopulation in BMD muscles. Pseudotime analysis, regulon inference, and deconvolution analysis of bulk RNA-sequencing data derived from 29 BMD patients revealed that the aFAPs subpopulation, a distinctive and previously unrecognized mononuclear subtype, was profibrogenic and expanded in BMD patients. Muscle quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence analysis confirmed that the mRNA and protein levels of the aFAPs markers including <i>LUM</i>, <i>DCN</i>, and <i>COL1A1</i> in BMD patients were significantly higher than those in controls, respectively.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results provide insights into the transcriptional diversity of human BMD muscle at a single-nucleus resolution and new potential targets for anti-fibrosis therapies in BMD. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27069?af=R">Mapping Functional Connectivity Signatures of Pharmacoresistant Focal Cortical Dysplasia‐Related Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine common network alterations in focal cortical dysplasia pharmacoresistant epilepsy (FCD-PRE) using functional connectivity analysis of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This is a retrospective imaging cohort from Children's National Hospital (Washington, DC, USA) from January, 2011 to January, 2022. Patients with 3-T MRI-confirmed FCD-PRE underwent rsfMRI as part of routine clinical care. Patients were included if they were age 5–22 years at the time of the scan, and had a minimum of 18 months of follow-up. Healthy, typically-developing controls were included from Children's National Hospital (n = 16) and matched from Human Connectome Project-Development public dataset (n = 100).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 42 FCD-PRE patients (20 M:22 F, aged 14.2 ± 4.1 years) and 116 healthy controls (56 M:60 F, aged 13.7 ± 3.3 years) with rsfMRI were included. Seed-based functional connectivity maps were generated for each FCD, and each seed was used to generate a patient-specific z-scored connectivity map on 116 controls. FCD-PRE patients had mutual altered connectivity in regions of dorsal attention, default mode, and control networks. Functional connectivity was diminished within the FCD dominant functional network, as well as in homotopic regions. Cluster specific connectivity patterns varied by pathological subtype. Higher FCD connectivity to the limbic network was associated with increased odds of Engel I outcome.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study demonstrates diminished functional connectivity patterns in FCD-PRE, which may represent a neuromarker for the disease, independent of FCD location, involving the dorsal attention, default mode, and control functional networks. Higher connectivity to the limbic network is associated with a seizure-free outcome. Future multicenter, prospective studies are needed to allow for much earlier detection of signatures of treatment-resistant epilepsy. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14477">RISE-iEEG: Robust to Inter-Subject Electrodes Implantation Variability iEEG Classifier</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2408.14477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilization of intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) is rapidly increasing for clinical and brain-computer interface applications. iEEG facilitates the recording of neural activity with high spatial and temporal resolution, making it a desirable neuroimaging modality for studying neural dynamics. Despite its benefits, iEEG faces challenges such as inter-subject variability in electrode implantation, which makes the development of unified neural decoder models across different patients difficult. In this research, we introduce a novel decoder model that is robust to inter-subject electrode implantation variability. We call this model RISE-iEEG, which stands for Robust Inter-Subject Electrode Implantation Variability iEEG Classifier. RISE-iEEG employs a deep neural network structure preceded by a patient-specific projection network. The projection network maps the neural data of individual patients onto a common low-dimensional space, compensating for the implantation variability. In other words, we developed an iEEG decoder model that can be applied across multiple patients' data without requiring the coordinates of electrode for each patient. The performance of RISE-iEEG across multiple datasets, including the Audio-Visual dataset, Music Reconstruction dataset, and Upper-Limb Movement dataset, surpasses that of state-of-the-art iEEG decoder models such as HTNet and EEGNet. Our analysis shows that the performance of RISE-iEEG is 10\% higher than that of HTNet and EEGNet in terms of F1 score, with an average F1 score of 83\%, which is the highest result among the evaluation methods defined. Furthermore, the analysis of projection network weights in the Music Reconstruction dataset across patients suggests that the Superior Temporal lobe serves as the primary encoding neural node. This finding aligns with the auditory processing physiology.

                arXiv:2408.14478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing number of patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease, prognosis models have the potential to aid in early disease detection. However, current approaches raise dependability concerns as they do not account for uncertainty. In this work, we compare the performance of Monte Carlo Dropout, Variational Inference, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and Ensemble Learning trained on 512 patients to predict 4-year cognitive score trajectories with confidence bounds. We show that MC Dropout and MCMC are able to produce well-calibrated, and accurate predictions under noisy training data.

                arXiv:2408.14479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I present the first complete theory of OCD. OCD occurs when excessive CRH is released in the prefrontal cortex, activating cAMP. cAMP is a major inducer of HCN channels, which promote repeated neural firing. The combination of CRH, which is strongly associated with stress, and repeated firing that cannot be controlled, explains all of the features of OCD, including obsessions and compulsions of all kinds.

                arXiv:2408.14508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A suite of impressive scientific discoveries have been driven by recent advances in artificial intelligence. These almost all result from training flexible algorithms to solve difficult optimization problems specified in advance by teams of domain scientists and engineers with access to large amounts of data. Although extremely useful, this kind of problem solving only corresponds to one part of science - the "easy problem." The other part of scientific research is coming up with the problem itself - the "hard problem." Solving the hard problem is beyond the capacities of current algorithms for scientific discovery because it requires continual conceptual revision based on poorly defined constraints. We can make progress on understanding how humans solve the hard problem by studying the cognitive science of scientists, and then use the results to design new computational agents that automatically infer and update their scientific paradigms.

                arXiv:2212.04535v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mapping of human brain structural connectomes via diffusion MRI offers a unique opportunity to understand brain structural connectivity and relate it to various human traits, such as cognition. However, head displacement during image acquisition can compromise the accuracy of connectome reconstructions and subsequent inference results. We develop a generative model to learn low-dimensional representations of structural connectomes invariant to motion-induced artifacts, so that we can link brain networks and human traits more accurately, and generate motion-adjusted connectomes. We apply the proposed model to data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study and the Human Connectome Project (HCP) to investigate how our motion-invariant connectomes facilitate understanding of the brain network and its relationship with cognition. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed motion-invariant variational auto-encoder (inv-VAE) outperforms its competitors in various aspects. In particular, motion-adjusted structural connectomes are more strongly associated with a wide array of cognition-related traits than other approaches without motion adjustment.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10163">Learning temporal relationships between symbols with Laplace Neural Manifolds</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2302.10163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking across populations of neurons in many regions of the mammalian brain maintains a temporal memory, a neural timeline of the recent past. Behavioral results demonstrate that people can not only perceive a timeline over the remembered past, but also anticipate the time of future events over an analogous internal timeline. This paper presents a mathematical framework for building this timeline of the future. We assume that the input to the system is a time series of symbols -- sparse tokenized representations of the present -- in continuous time. The goal is to record pairwise temporal relationships between symbols over a wide range of time scales. We assume that the brain has access to a temporal memory in the form of the real Laplace transform of providing information about what symbols were presented when in the recent past. Hebbian associations with a diversity of synaptic time scales are formed between the past timeline and the present symbol. Hebbian associations between the Laplace transform of two functions record the Laplace transform of the convolution of those functions. This associative memory stores the convolution between past and the present. Knowing the temporal relationships between the past and the present allows one to infer relationships between the present and the future. With appropriate normalization, this Hebbian associative matrix can store a Laplace successor representation and a Laplace predecessor representation from which measures of temporal contingency can be evaluated. This framework synthesizes a number of recent neuroscientific findings including results from dopamine neurons in the mesolimbic forebrain.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00951">An internal sensory model allows for balance control using muscle spindle exafferent acceleration feedback</a></h4>

Abstract: All motor tasks with a mechanical system (a human body, a rider on a bicycle) that is approximately linear in the part of the state space where it stays most of the time (e.g., upright balance control) allow for optimal control actions that are a simple linear combination of full state sensory feedback. When the sensory feedback is not full state, optimal control for these approximately linear mechanical systems is based on an internal dynamical system that estimates the states, and that can be implemented as a recurrent neural network (RNN) in the central nervous system (CNS). It uses a sensory model to update the state estimates with the available (non-full state) sensory feedback. The weights of this RNN are fully specified by results from optimal feedback control. This is highly relevant for muscle spindle primary afferents under perfectly coordinated fusimotor and skeletomotor control because, under this condition, their firing rates scale with the exafferent joint acceleration component. A sensory model exists for this exafferent acceleration component, and this can be used by the CNS to estimate the states. As a proof of the viability of this mechanism, I demonstrate that it balances a standing body and a rider-bicycle combination using realistic parameter values and with forcing torques that are feasible for humans.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20324">Localising the Seizure Onset Zone from Single-Pulse Electrical Stimulation Responses with a CNN Transformer</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2403.20324v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders, often requiring surgical intervention when medication fails to control seizures. For effective surgical outcomes, precise localisation of the epileptogenic focus - often approximated through the Seizure Onset Zone (SOZ) - is critical yet remains a challenge. Active probing through electrical stimulation is already standard clinical practice for identifying epileptogenic areas. Our study advances the application of deep learning for SOZ localisation using Single-Pulse Electrical Stimulation (SPES) responses, with two key contributions. Firstly, we implement an existing deep learning model to compare two SPES analysis paradigms: divergent and convergent. These paradigms evaluate outward and inward effective connections, respectively. We assess the generalisability of these models to unseen patients and electrode placements using held-out test sets. Our findings reveal a notable improvement in moving from a divergent (AUROC: 0.574) to a convergent approach (AUROC: 0.666), marking the first application of the latter in this context. Secondly, we demonstrate the efficacy of CNN Transformers with cross-channel attention in handling heterogeneous electrode placements, increasing the AUROC to 0.730. These findings represent a significant step in modelling patient-specific intracranial EEG electrode placements in SPES. Future work will explore integrating these models into clinical decision-making processes to bridge the gap between deep learning research and practical healthcare applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework for multimodal contrastive learning utilizing a quantum encoder to integrate EEG (electroencephalogram) and image data. This groundbreaking attempt explores the integration of quantum encoders within the traditional multimodal learning framework. By leveraging the unique properties of quantum computing, our method enhances the representation learning capabilities, providing a robust framework for analyzing time series and visual information concurrently. We demonstrate that the quantum encoder effectively captures intricate patterns within EEG signals and image features, facilitating improved contrastive learning across modalities. This work opens new avenues for integrating quantum computing with multimodal data analysis, particularly in applications requiring simultaneous interpretation of temporal and visual data.

                arXiv:2408.14680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a memristor-based compute-in-memory hardware accelerator for on-chip training and inference, focusing on its accuracy and efficiency against device variations, conductance errors, and input noise. Utilizing realistic SPICE models of commercially available silver-based metal self-directed channel (M-SDC) memristors, the study incorporates inherent device non-idealities into the circuit simulations. The hardware, consisting of 30 memristors and 4 neurons, utilizes three different M-SDC structures with tungsten, chromium, and carbon media to perform binary image classification tasks. An on-chip training algorithm precisely tunes memristor conductance to achieve target weights. Results show that incorporating moderate noise (<15%) during training enhances robustness to device variations and noisy input data, achieving up to 97% accuracy despite conductance variations and input noises. The network tolerates a 10% conductance error without significant accuracy loss. Notably, omitting the initial memristor reset pulse during training considerably reduces training time and energy consumption. The hardware designed with chromium-based memristors exhibits superior performance, achieving a training time of 2.4 seconds and an energy consumption of 18.9 mJ. This research provides insights for developing robust and energy-efficient memristor-based neural networks for on-chip learning in edge applications.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14917">PMSN: A Parallel Multi-compartment Spiking Neuron for Multi-scale Temporal Processing</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2408.14917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) hold great potential to realize brain-inspired, energy-efficient computational systems. However, current SNNs still fall short in terms of multi-scale temporal processing compared to their biological counterparts. This limitation has resulted in poor performance in many pattern recognition tasks with information that varies across different timescales. To address this issue, we put forward a novel spiking neuron model called Parallel Multi-compartment Spiking Neuron (PMSN). The PMSN emulates biological neurons by incorporating multiple interacting substructures and allows for flexible adjustment of the substructure counts to effectively represent temporal information across diverse timescales. Additionally, to address the computational burden associated with the increased complexity of the proposed model, we introduce two parallelization techniques that decouple the temporal dependencies of neuronal updates, enabling parallelized training across different time steps. Our experimental results on a wide range of pattern recognition tasks demonstrate the superiority of PMSN. It outperforms other state-of-the-art spiking neuron models in terms of its temporal processing capacity, training speed, and computation cost. Specifically, compared with the commonly used Leaky Integrate-and-Fire neuron, PMSN offers a simulation acceleration of over 10 $\times$ and a 30 % improvement in accuracy on Sequential CIFAR10 dataset, while maintaining comparable computational cost.

                arXiv:2408.14925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm was recently proposed as a local learning method to address the limitations of backpropagation (BP), offering biological plausibility along with memory-efficient and highly parallelized computational benefits. However, it suffers from suboptimal performance and poor generalization, largely due to inadequate theoretical support and a lack of effective learning strategies. In this work, we reformulate FF using distance metric learning and propose a distance-forward algorithm (DF) to improve FF performance in supervised vision tasks while preserving its local computational properties, making it competitive for efficient on-chip learning. To achieve this, we reinterpret FF through the lens of centroid-based metric learning and develop a goodness-based N-pair margin loss to facilitate the learning of discriminative features. Furthermore, we integrate layer-collaboration local update strategies to reduce information loss caused by greedy local parameter updates. Our method surpasses existing FF models and other advanced local learning approaches, with accuracies of 99.7\% on MNIST, 88.2\% on CIFAR-10, 59\% on CIFAR-100, 95.9\% on SVHN, and 82.5\% on ImageNette, respectively. Moreover, it achieves comparable performance with less than 40\% memory cost compared to BP training, while exhibiting stronger robustness to multiple types of hardware-related noise, demonstrating its potential for online learning and energy-efficient computation on neuromorphic chips.

                arXiv:2408.14525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is an important part of many performance critical applications. This paper provides a simple alternative to existing approaches such as ensemble learning and bayesian neural networks. By directly modeling the loss distribution with an Implicit Quantile Network, we get an estimate of how uncertain the model is of its predictions. For experiments with MNIST and CIFAR datasets, the mean of the estimated loss distribution is 2x higher for incorrect predictions. When data with high estimated uncertainty is removed from the test dataset, the accuracy of the model goes up as much as 10%. This method is simple to implement while offering important information to applications where the user has to know when the model could be wrong (e.g. deep learning for healthcare).

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14843">Correntropy-Based Improper Likelihood Model for Robust Electrophysiological Source Imaging</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2408.14843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian learning provides a unified skeleton to solve the electrophysiological source imaging task. From this perspective, existing source imaging algorithms utilize the Gaussian assumption for the observation noise to build the likelihood function for Bayesian inference. However, the electromagnetic measurements of brain activity are usually affected by miscellaneous artifacts, leading to a potentially non-Gaussian distribution for the observation noise. Hence the conventional Gaussian likelihood model is a suboptimal choice for the real-world source imaging task. In this study, we aim to solve this problem by proposing a new likelihood model which is robust with respect to non-Gaussian noises. Motivated by the robust maximum correntropy criterion, we propose a new improper distribution model concerning the noise assumption. This new noise distribution is leveraged to structure a robust likelihood function and integrated with hierarchical prior distributions to estimate source activities by variational inference. In particular, the score matching is adopted to determine the hyperparameters for the improper likelihood model. A comprehensive performance evaluation is performed to compare the proposed noise assumption to the conventional Gaussian model. Simulation results show that, the proposed method can realize more precise source reconstruction by designing known ground-truth. The real-world dataset also demonstrates the superiority of our new method with the visual perception task. This study provides a new backbone for Bayesian source imaging, which would facilitate its application using real-world noisy brain signal.

                arXiv:2408.14909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Known as low energy consumption networks, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained a lot of attention within the past decades. While SNNs are increasing competitive with artificial neural networks (ANNs) for vision tasks, they are rarely used for long sequence tasks, despite their intrinsic temporal dynamics. In this work, we develop spiking state space models (SpikingSSMs) for long sequence learning by leveraging on the sequence learning abilities of state space models (SSMs). Inspired by dendritic neuron structure, we hierarchically integrate neuronal dynamics with the original SSM block, meanwhile realizing sparse synaptic computation. Furthermore, to solve the conflict of event-driven neuronal dynamics with parallel computing, we propose a light-weight surrogate dynamic network which accurately predicts the after-reset membrane potential and compatible to learnable thresholds, enabling orders of acceleration in training speed compared with conventional iterative methods. On the long range arena benchmark task, SpikingSSM achieves competitive performance to state-of-the-art SSMs meanwhile realizing on average 90\% of network sparsity. On language modeling, our network significantly surpasses existing spiking large language models (spikingLLMs) on the WikiText-103 dataset with only a third of the model size, demonstrating its potential as backbone architecture for low computation cost LLMs.

Abstract: In this paper, a compact microstrip forward broadside coupler (MFBC) with high coupling level is proposed in the frequency band of 3.5-3.8 GHz. The coupler is composed of two parallel pixelated transmission lines. To validate the designstrategy, the proposed MFBC is fabricated and measured. The measured results demonstrate a forward coupler with 3 dB coupling, and a compact size of 0.12 {\lambda}g x 0.10{\lambda}g. Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) design methodology and flexibility of pixelation enable us to optimize the proposed MFBC with desired coupling level and operating frequency within a fixed dimension. Also, low sensitivity to misalignment between two coupled TLs makes the proposed coupler a good candidate for near-field Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) application and sensors.

Abstract: This paper first proposes the Halfway Escape Optimization (HEO) algorithm, a quantum-inspired metaheuristic designed to address general optimization problems characterized by rugged landscapes and high-dimensionality with an efficient convergence rate. The study presents a comprehensive comparative evaluation of HEO's performance against established optimization algorithms, including Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm (AFSA), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), and Quantum behaved Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO). The primary analysis encompasses 14 benchmark functions with dimension 30, demonstrating HEO's effectiveness and adaptability in navigating general optimization landscapes and providing valuable insights into its performance. The test of HEO in Pressure Vessel Design and Tubular Column Design infers its feasibility and potential in real-time applications. Further validation in Osmancik-97 and Cammeo Rice Classification proves the effectiveness of HEO and achieves a higher accuracy record.

                Abstract* The swift parrot (Lathamus discolor) is a Critically Endangered migratory parrot that breeds in Tasmania and winters on the Australian mainland. Here we provide a reference genome assembly for the swift parrot. We sequence PacBio HiFi reads to create a high-quality reference assembly and identify a complete mitochondrial sequence. We also generate a reference transcriptome from five organs to inform genome annotation. The genome was 1.24 Gb in length and consisted of 847 contigs with a contig N50 of 18.97 Gb and L50 of 20 contigs. This study provides an annotated reference assembly and transcriptomic resources for the swift parrot to assist in future conservation genomic research.

                This report presents the successful orthodontic management of a case of odontoma associated with impaction of the mandibular right permanent canine and Molar-incisor-hypomineralization (MIH). Although case studies have reported the management of odontomas and MIH as separate entities, there is a lack of evidence regarding the comprehensive management of patients presenting with a combination of odontoma, dental impaction, and MIH. A 15-year, 7-month-old female patient complained of the appearance of her smile and the delayed eruption of her mandibular right permanent canine. She was diagnosed with Angle’s Class I molar relationship and Class II canine relationship with the maxillary permanent right lateral incisor in a lingual crossbite. Furthermore, she had mandibular right permanent canine impaction, retained mandibular right primary canine, and MIH in the permanent anterior teeth and first molars. The management involved the removal of the odontoma to allow for orthodontic traction of the lower permanent right canine. After that, the esthetic appearance of the teeth was improved through restorative treatment.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-617/v2?src=rss">Zoom fatigue related to online learning among medical students in Thailand:  Prevalence, predictors, and association with depression [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the learning pattern of medical students shifted from onsite to online. This transition may contribute to what has been called “Zoom fatigue.” This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of Zoom fatigue related to online learning, identify associated factors of Zoom fatigue, and explore its correlation with depression among medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted among 1st to 6th-year Thai medical students. The online survey was administered using a demographic and health behavior questionnaire, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and the Thai version of the Zoom Exhaustion & Fatigue Scale (ZEF-T). Results Among the 386 participating students, 221 (57%) were female, with a mean age of 20.6 years. The prevalence of high Zoom fatigue was 9.6%. In the multivariable regression analysis, a lower academic year and a higher number of online learning sessions were significant predictors of Zoom fatigue (p < 0.001), while regular exercise emerged as a protective factor (p = 0.009). The prevalence of depressive disorder was 61.9%, and a significant correlation was found between having a depressive disorder and experiencing Zoom fatigue (p = 0.004). Conclusion Zoom fatigue among medical students was correlated with depression. Consequently, medical students experiencing Zoom fatigue should undergo further assessment for depression. It is crucial to closely monitor medical students in lower academic years with a high number of online sessions for signs of Zoom fatigue. Additionally, implementing strategies, such as reducing the frequency of online sessions and promoting regular exercise, may help alleviate the symptoms.

                Background Despite the legalization of cannabis use for medical purposes in Thailand in February 2019, illicit providers are still widespread and accessible. This study aimed to understand why people still chose to receive medical cannabis treatment or products from unlicensed or illegal providers. The practices of unlicensed or illegal providers in provision of medical cannabis products or treatment services were also examined. Methods Qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted among medical cannabis providers and users, including 36 unlicensed and 7 licensed providers and 25 users in 2019-2021. Snowball sampling was used to recruit participants until saturation of data was achieved. Interviews included open-ended questions about the providers’ practices and attitudes towards medical cannabis. Interviews were recorded and transcribed, and thematic analysis was performed. Results Overall, six reasons were identified to answer why unlicensed/illicit providers were still popular, including: 1) easy accessibility; 2) familiarity with the unlicensed providers before the legal scheme became available; 3) favorable characters (kind, supportive, non-judgmental) of unlicensed providers; 4) affordable treatment fees; 5) trust in the quality of the medicines; and 6) lack of knowledge and negative attitudes towards cannabis from healthcare professionals. Most providers started their career as medical cannabis providers by using it themselves or with their relatives and being satisfied with the results. They used cannabis products to treat all diseases, including skin, eyes, HIV/AIDS, non-communicable diseases and all kinds of cancers. Additionally, they believed that it was effective, with no or minimal adverse effects. Conclusions This study suggests that some patients will continue receiving medical cannabis treatment and products from unlicensed or illegal providers. More attention should be paid on increasing the capacity of medical cannabis service systems within public health hospitals, and the certification of unlicensed providers, so as to integrate them into a regulated system.

                Background Staphylococcus aureus infections, including Methicillin-Resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and Methicillin-Sensitive S. aureus (MSSA), present significant challenges in healthcare due to rising antimicrobial resistance. This study evaluates the genetic basis of antibiotic resistance in S. aureus, focusing on key resistance-associated genes mecA and PVL. Methods A total of 568 clinical specimens were analyzed for the presence of S. aureus. Demographic data were collected to assess age-dependent prevalence. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted to evaluate resistance patterns. The prevalence of the mecA and PVL genes was determined using molecular techniques. Results S. aureus was identified in 37.9% of cases, with the highest prevalence (60-79 age group). All S. aureus isolates showed 100% resistance to penicillin. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains accounted for 84.19% of isolates, with a significant presence of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains. The mecA gene was prevalent in 82.79% of MRSA isolates, indicating its strong association with methicillin resistance. Additionally, 41.86% of all S. aureus isolates were positive for the PVL gene, highlighting its widespread distribution. Conclusions The high prevalence of mecA and PVL genes in S. aureus strains underscores the challenges in managing these infections. These findings emphasize the necessity for judicious antibiotic use and enhanced collaborative efforts to combat antimicrobial resistance. Understanding the genetic basis of resistance can inform more effective diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive strategies, ultimately improving patient outcomes in S. aureus infections.

                <p>Moving effectively is essential for any animal. Thus, many different kinds of brain processes likely contribute to learning and adapting movement. How these contributions are combined is unknown. Nevertheless, the field of motor adaptation has been working under the assumption that measures of explicit and implicit motor adaptation can simply be added in total adaptation. While this has been tested, we show that these tests were insufficient. We put this additivity assumption to the test in various ways and find that measures of implicit and explicit adaptation are not additive. This means that future studies should measure both implicit and explicit adaptation directly. It also challenges us to disentangle how various motor adaptation processes do combine when producing movements and may have implications for our understanding of other kinds of learning as well (data and code: <A HREF="https://osf.io/3yhw5">https://osf.io/3yhw5</A>).</p>

                <p>The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays a pivotal role in regulating working memory, executive function, and self-regulatory behaviors. Dysfunction in the mPFC circuits is a characteristic feature of several neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Chronic stress (CS) is widely recognized as a major triggering factor for the onset of these disorders. Although evidence suggests synaptic dysfunction in mPFC circuits following CS exposure, it remains unclear how different neuronal populations in the infralimbic (IL) and prelimbic (PL) cortices are affected in terms of synaptic inhibition/excitation balance (<I>I</I>/<I>E</I> ratio). Here, using neuroproteomic analysis and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in pyramidal neurons (PNs) and parvalbumin (PV) interneurons within the PL and IL cortices, we examined the synaptic changes after 21&nbsp;d of chronic unpredictable stress, in male mice. Our results reveal distinct impacts of CS on PL and IL PNs, resulting in an increased <I>I</I>/<I>E</I> ratio in both subregions but through different mechanisms: CS increases inhibitory synaptic drive in the PL while decreasing excitatory synaptic drive in the IL. Notably, the <I>I</I>/<I>E</I> ratio and excitatory and inhibitory synaptic drive of PV interneurons remained unaffected in both PL and IL circuits following CS exposure. These findings offer novel mechanistic insights into the influence of CS on mPFC circuits and support the hypothesis of stress-induced mPFC hypofunction.</p>

                <p>The auditory brainstem response (ABR) is a measure of subcortical activity in response to auditory stimuli. The wave V peak of the ABR depends on the stimulus intensity level, and has been widely used for clinical hearing assessment. Conventional methods estimate the ABR average electroencephalography (EEG) responses to short unnatural stimuli such as clicks. Recent work has moved toward more ecologically relevant continuous speech stimuli using linear deconvolution models called temporal response functions (TRFs). Investigating whether the TRF waveform changes with stimulus intensity is a crucial step toward the use of natural speech stimuli for hearing assessments involving subcortical responses. Here, we develop methods to estimate level-dependent subcortical TRFs using EEG data collected from 21 participants listening to continuous speech presented at 4 different intensity levels. We find that level-dependent changes can be detected in the wave V peak of the subcortical TRF for almost all participants, and are consistent with level-dependent changes in click-ABR wave V. We also investigate the most suitable peripheral auditory model to generate predictors for level-dependent subcortical TRFs and find that simple gammatone filterbanks perform the best. Additionally, around 6 min of data may be sufficient for detecting level-dependent effects and wave V peaks above the noise floor for speech segments with higher intensity. Finally, we show a proof-of-concept that level-dependent subcortical TRFs can be detected even for the inherent intensity fluctuations in natural continuous speech.</p>

                Background The discovery of an ideal and effective therapy is urgently required for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. The main pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease that appear before the clinical symptoms are neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid plaques, brain inflammation, and neuronal atrophy throughout the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. GSK-3β (Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3β) is regarded as the most important and promising target for therapeutic use because GSK-3β expression levels increase with age and are the most abundant and hyperactive in the brains of patients with Alzheimer’s disease. Methods We used Maestro, which is Schrodinger, for our computational simulation studies. In the present work, we have used different modules that were used in previous studies with a little modification, the modules such as Protein Preparation with the help of Protein Preparation Wizard, Ligand Preparation with the help of LigPrep, for ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion) prediction we used Qikprop, Docking studies we used Glide module, Binding energy prediction we used Prime and Molecular dynamic simulation studies by Desmond Results Our focus is mainly on an in-silico approach, focusing on library generation; we first drew an imidazo [1,5-a]pyridine-3-carboxamide (IMID 2) scaffold structure at Enamine and subjected it to a substructure search to target the receptor grid region (ATP-competitive site) of 6Y9R. They were then subjected to various screening processes. Finally, we selected nine compounds and subjected them to molecular dynamic simulation studies. Conclusions Nine compounds showed good results with the most stable interactions. Further experiments and studies are required to confirm these results.

                The exponential increase in the number of submissions, further accelerated by generative AI, and the decline in the availability of experts are burdening the peer review process. This has led to high unethical desk rejection rates, a growing appeal for the publication of unreviewed preprints, and a worrying proliferation of predatory journals. The idea of monetarily compensating peer reviewers has been around for many years; maybe, it is time to take it seriously as one way to save the peer review process. Here, I argue that paying reviewers, when done in a fair and transparent way, is a viable solution. Like the case of professional language editors, part-time or full-time professional reviewers, managed by universities or for-profit companies, can be an integral part of modern peer review. Being a professional reviewer could be financially attractive to retired senior researchers and to researchers who enjoy evaluating papers but are not motivated to do so for free. Moreover, not all produced research needs to go through peer review, and thus persuading researchers to limit submissions to their most novel and useful research could also help bring submission volumes to manageable levels. Overall, this paper reckons that the problem is not the peer review process per se but rather its function within an academic ecosystem dominated by an unhealthy culture of ‘publish or perish’. Instead of reforming the peer review process, academia has to look for better science dissemination schemes that promote collaboration over competition, engagement over judgement, and research quality and sustainability over quantity.

                Background Home care services are an extension of hospital services provided by hospital staff. The hospital must conduct evaluation, coordination, and education for home care patients to ensure proper care and expedite their recovery. This service also introduces a new concept to the community, as it can help save on costs and equipment Methods A systematic review examined the factors influencing patient satisfaction using home care services by following the PRISMA guidelines. PROSPERO submitted and approved the study protocol with the following numbers: CRD42023482315. Result Researchers have searched articles through the ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases. Two hundred eighty-eight articles were selected, but 10 met the inclusion criteria. It was found that factors influenced patient satisfaction with home care services and two things that did not affect them: financial aspects and working time. Conclusion Fifteen aspects influence patient satisfaction and two aspects that do not influence patient satisfaction.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-199/v2?src=rss">Social distancing between personal belongings during the COVID-19 pandemic [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to instructions and suggestions from governments and experts to maintain social (physical) distance between people to prevent aerosol transmission of the virus, which is now becoming the norm. Thus, we examined whether the pandemic extended the distance between personal belongings. Methods: We recruited 68 university students and instructed them to place their belongings on a long table following another participant (i.e., confederate). We measured the physical distance between the two belongings (i.e., the participant’s and the confederate’s). We collected data between June 10, 2022 and January 23, 2023. Pre-pandemic data was from Ariga (2016). Analysis was completed with one-tailed t-tests. Results: Compared with the pre-pandemic results, via one-tailed t-test, the distance between the two belongings during the pandemic was significantly longer. Our results supported the hypothesis that the psychological framework for processing people’s belongings has dramatically changed during this pandemic. Conclusion: This change may have been driven by social distancing practices or an increase in perceived vulnerability to disease. Our results provide new implications for future public spatial design, in other words, not only the distance between people, but also the distance between their belongings.

Bemnifosbuvir (AT-527) and AT-752 are guanosine analogues currently in clinical trials against several RNA viruses. Here, we show that these drugs require a minimal set of 5 cellular enzymes for activation to their common 5′-triphosphate AT-9010, with an obligate order of reactions. AT-9010 selectively inhibits essential viral enzymes, accounting for antiviral potency. Functional and structural data at atomic resolution decipher <i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-purine deamination compatible with its metabolic activation. Crystal structures of human histidine triad nucleotide binding protein 1, adenosine deaminase-like protein 1, guanylate kinase 1, and nucleoside diphosphate kinase at 2.09, 2.44, 1.76, and 1.9 Å resolution, respectively, with cognate precursors of AT-9010 illuminate the activation pathway from the orally available bemnifosbuvir to AT-9010, pointing to key drug–protein contacts along the activation pathway. Our work provides a framework to integrate the design of antiviral nucleotide analogues, confronting requirements and constraints associated with activation enzymes along the 5′-triphosphate assembly line.

                Sclerosing lymphocytic lobulitis, also known as diabetic mastopathy, is a rare and benign pathology predominantly observed in young women with type I diabetes, typically with degenerative complications. Clinically, the lesion can mimic carcinoma. Biopsy remains the gold standard for a definitive diagnosis. Radical surgery is generally unnecessary when histological verification can be achievedusing core needle biopsy. This case report details the clinical and radiological findings, as well as the management of a 33-year-old patient with a 22-year history of type I diabetes who presented with sclerosing lymphocytic lobulitis.

                A 56-year-old female with a medical history of unspecified hyperthyroidism and a recent thyroid storm presented to the ED with tachycardia, hypertension, and bilateral enlarged parotid glands. During a previous hospitalization, she was diagnosed with unspecified hyperthyroidism and started on methimazole. During hospitalization, laboratory findings suggested Graves’ disease with an acute thyroid storm. The patient also complained of enlarged parotid glands bilaterally. CT tomography of the neck revealed no calculi of the parotid glands but showed extensive fatty replacement, possibly related to methimazole use. Treatment with propranolol and IV hydrocortisone improved thyroid function. Due to the suspicion of methimazole-induced parotitis, she was transitioned to a reduced methimazole dosage for treatment of Graves’ disease, which subsequently improved her parotitis. Methimazole, the standard initial treatment for Graves’ disease, is generally well-tolerated. It can cause adverse reactions; however, parotitis is very rare and has been documented in only a few case reports. Owing to the limited number of reports, its incidence is currently unknown. Here, we present a case of methimazole-induced parotitis as an unusual presentation of thyroid storm. Drug-induced reactions can only be considered once common causes of parotitis such as viral infection, obstruction, and autoimmune diseases are ruled out. Treatment involves dosage adjustments and supportive care. Methimazole-induced parotitis is often misdiagnosed and overlooked because of the lack of reported cases. This necessitates future research into the reaction mechanisms and optimal treatment.

                Background The objective of this systematic review was to analyze the effects of the physical activity (PA) intervention as an adjuvant strategy to pharmacological treatment in people with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and non-remitted depression (NRD). Methods A search strategy was realized from five databases: PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science. Eleven articles attained the inclusion criteria. The Physiotherapy Evidence Database and Oxford’s Evidence Levels were used to classify the quality appraisal. Results The more significant outcome for this analysis was the improvement of depression by PA or exercise in TRD and NRD. According to the FITT (Frequency, Intensity, Time, and Type) principle, there was some variability in the PA intervention, and except for one article, they all were classified as excellent in terms of quality description. Conclusions This review highlights the potential of PA intervention as an adjuvant program to improve different traits of TRD and NRD. The remission of depression seems to be higher after PA intervention, showing improvements in quality of life, sleep quality, executive function, and vitality.

                Background Cassava is an outcrossing, highly heterozygous plant that is reported to suffer from inbreeding depression. However, unraveling recessive traits and exploring additive genes would require a limited level of inbreeding for the genetic improvement of cassava. Method The impact of inbreeding depression (ID) on agronomic and biotic tolerance of cassava was evaluated using the S1 progenies of five African cassava varieties (TMS 30572, TME 419, TMS 98/0505, TMS 01/1371, and TMS 98/0002) at the seedling and clonal evaluation stages. Results At both trial stages, the effects of ID were severe on average performance of fresh root yield and fresh foliage yield; moderate on harvest index, dry matter content, vigor, and tolerance to cassava mosaic disease, cassava bacterial blight, and cassava anthracnose diseases; and less severe on plant height. Further examination of S1 families using molecular markers showed varying levels of heterozygosity at several loci across the genome. In addition, the degree of heterozygosity and ID varied by the S1 family. The TMS 01/1371 family showed the lowest degree of heterozygosity and ID on the average performance of different agronomic attributes, indicating that inbreeding may be strategically explored in this family to increase genetic gain and identify useful recessive traits. Lastly, the observed depression from inbreeding was higher in seedling evaluation than in clonal evaluation trials for fresh root yield, fresh foliage yield, harvest index, and dry matter content. Conclusion S1 individuals showing relatively low heterozygosity based on SNP data were selected as parents to advance genetic gain in cassava. Generally, reduced heterozygosity was prominent in traits with severe ID impacts on average phenotypic performance. Our results highlight the relative importance of exploring non-additive genetic effects and transgressive segregations for favorable allele combinations in cassava improvement.

                Background: Clinical treatments involving autologous cell-based therapies (ACBT) remain prevalent despite a lack of scientific backing and an evolving regulatory landscape aimed at assessing their safety and efficacy for clinical adoption. This study seeks to assess patients’ experiences and perceptions of clinical treatments involving ACBT and their knowledge and views of the regulatory context and associated governance issues. Methods: An anonymous online survey of 181 participants who have been treated or are in the process of being treated with ACBT was conducted. Recruitment was via social media platforms. Data was collected through Qualtrics and analyzed using SPSS 29 for the quantitative responses and NVivo 1.7.1 for the qualitative responses. Results: Several themes emerged from the data, including the prominent role of healthcare providers throughout the patient journey, informational practices during the clinical encounter, the high prevalence of pay-for-participation trials, patients’ gaps in regulatory knowledge, and patients’ priorities regarding clinical trials and regulation of ACBT. Conclusions: The study makes a novel contribution to the literature by providing the first analysis of patients’ experiences and perceptions of an emerging cell-based therapy within an evolving regulatory landscape. The findings serve as a valuable resource for developing policy, promoting scientific rigor, and ensuring ethical oversight of ACBT and other upcoming cell-based therapies.

                <i>Schistosoma mansoni</i> is a parasitic flatworm that causes the major neglected tropical disease schistosomiasis. The miracidium is the first larval stage of the life cycle. It swims and infects a freshwater snail, transforms into a mother sporocyst, where its stem cells generate daughter sporocysts that give rise to human-infective cercariae larvae. To understand the miracidium at cellular and molecular levels, we created a whole-body atlas of its ~365 cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified 19 transcriptionally distinct cell clusters. In situ hybridisation of tissue-specific genes revealed that 93% of the cells in the larva are somatic (57% neural, 19% muscle, 13% epidermal or tegument, 2% parenchyma, and 2% protonephridia) and 7% are stem. Whereas neurons represent the most diverse somatic cell types, trajectory analysis of the two main stem cell populations indicates that one of them is the origin of the tegument lineage and the other likely contains pluripotent cells. Furthermore, unlike the somatic cells, each of these stem populations shows sex-biased transcriptional signatures suggesting a cell-type-specific gene dosage compensation for sex chromosome-linked loci. The miracidium represents a simple developmental stage with which to gain a fundamental understanding of the molecular biology and spatial architecture of schistosome cells.

                Organelle heterogeneity and inter-organelle contacts within a single cell contribute to the limited sensitivity of current organelle separation techniques, thus hindering organelle subpopulation characterization. Here, we use direct current insulator-based dielectrophoresis (DC-iDEP) as an unbiased separation method and demonstrate its capability by identifying distinct distribution patterns of insulin vesicles from INS-1E insulinoma cells. A multiple voltage DC-iDEP strategy with increased range and sensitivity has been applied, and a differentiation factor (ratio of electrokinetic to dielectrophoretic mobility) has been used to characterize features of insulin vesicle distribution patterns. We observed a significant difference in the distribution pattern of insulin vesicles isolated from glucose-stimulated cells relative to unstimulated cells, in accordance with maturation of vesicles upon glucose stimulation. We interpret the difference in distribution pattern to be indicative of high-resolution separation of vesicle subpopulations. DC-iDEP provides a path for future characterization of subtle biochemical differences of organelle subpopulations within any biological system.

                Host-microbe interactions are virtually bidirectional, but how the host affects their microbiome is poorly understood. Here, we report that the host is a critical modulator to regulate the lifestyle switch and pathogenicity heterogeneity of the opportunistic pathogens <i>Serratia marcescens</i> utilizing the <i>Drosophila</i> and bacterium model system. First, we find that <i>Drosophila</i> larvae efficiently outcompete <i>S. marcescens</i> and typically drive a bacterial switch from pathogenicity to commensalism toward the fly. Furthermore, <i>Drosophila</i> larvae reshape the transcriptomic and metabolic profiles of <i>S. marcescens</i> characterized by a lifestyle switch. More importantly, the host alters pathogenicity and heterogeneity of <i>S. marcescens</i> in the single-cell resolution. Finally, we find that larvae-derived AMPs are required to recapitulate the response of <i>S. marcescens</i> to larvae. Altogether, our findings provide an insight into the pivotal roles of the host in harnessing the life history and heterogeneity of symbiotic bacterial cells, advancing knowledge of the reciprocal relationships between the host and pathogen.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88762">Auditory confounds can drive online effects of transcranial ultrasonic stimulation in humans</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial ultrasonic stimulation (TUS) is rapidly emerging as a promising non-invasive neuromodulation technique. TUS is already well-established in animal models, providing foundations to now optimize neuromodulatory efficacy for human applications. Across multiple studies, one promising protocol, pulsed at 1000 Hz, has consistently resulted in motor cortical inhibition in humans (Fomenko et al., 2020). At the same time, a parallel research line has highlighted the potentially confounding influence of peripheral auditory stimulation arising from TUS pulsing at audible frequencies. In this study, we disentangle direct neuromodulatory and indirect auditory contributions to motor inhibitory effects of TUS. To this end, we include tightly matched control conditions across four experiments, one preregistered, conducted independently at three institutions. We employed a combined transcranial ultrasonic and magnetic stimulation paradigm, where TMS-elicited motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) served as an index of corticospinal excitability. First, we replicated motor inhibitory effects of TUS but showed through both tight controls and manipulation of stimulation intensity, duration, and auditory masking conditions that this inhibition was driven by peripheral auditory stimulation, not direct neuromodulation. Furthermore, we consider neuromodulation beyond driving overall excitation/inhibition and show preliminary evidence of how TUS might interact with ongoing neural dynamics instead. Primarily, this study highlights the substantial shortcomings in accounting for the auditory confound in prior TUS-TMS work where only a flip-over sham and no active control was used. The field must critically reevaluate previous findings given the demonstrated impact of peripheral confounds. Furthermore, rigorous experimental design via (in)active control conditions is required to make substantiated claims in future TUS studies. Only when direct effects are disentangled from those driven by peripheral confounds can TUS fully realize its potential for research and clinical applications.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93758">Disentangling the relationship between cancer mortality and COVID-19 in the US</a></h4>

              
                Cancer is considered a risk factor for COVID-19 mortality, yet several countries have reported that deaths with a primary code of cancer remained within historic levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we further elucidate the relationship between cancer mortality and COVID-19 on a population level in the US. We compared pandemic-related mortality patterns from underlying and multiple cause (MC) death data for six types of cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer’s. Any pandemic-related changes in coding practices should be eliminated by study of MC data. Nationally in 2020, MC cancer mortality rose by only 3% over a pre-pandemic baseline, corresponding to ~13,600 excess deaths. Mortality elevation was measurably higher for less deadly cancers (breast, colorectal, and hematological, 2–7%) than cancers with a poor survival rate (lung and pancreatic, 0–1%). In comparison, there was substantial elevation in MC deaths from diabetes (37%) and Alzheimer’s (19%). To understand these differences, we simulated the expected excess mortality for each condition using COVID-19 attack rates, life expectancy, population size, and mean age of individuals living with each condition. We find that the observed mortality differences are primarily explained by differences in life expectancy, with the risk of death from deadly cancers outcompeting the risk of death from COVID-19.

                Dravet syndrome (DS) is a devastating early-onset refractory epilepsy syndrome caused by variants in the <i>SCN1A</i> gene. A disturbed GABAergic interneuron function is implicated in the progression to DS but the underlying developmental and pathophysiological mechanisms remain elusive, in particularly at the chromatin level. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from DS cases and healthy donors were used to model disease-associated epigenetic abnormalities of GABAergic development. Chromatin accessibility was assessed at multiple time points (Day 0, Day 19, Day 35, and Day 65) of GABAergic differentiation. Additionally, the effects of the commonly used anti-seizure drug valproic acid (VPA) on chromatin accessibility were elucidated in GABAergic cells. The distinct dynamics in the chromatin profile of DS iPSC predicted accelerated early GABAergic development, evident at D19, and diverged further from the pattern in control iPSC with continued differentiation, indicating a disrupted GABAergic maturation. Exposure to VPA at D65 reshaped the chromatin landscape at a variable extent in different iPSC-lines and rescued the observed dysfunctional development of some DS iPSC-GABA. The comprehensive investigation on the chromatin landscape of GABAergic differentiation in DS-patient iPSC offers valuable insights into the epigenetic dysregulations associated with interneuronal dysfunction in DS. Moreover, the detailed analysis of the chromatin changes induced by VPA in iPSC-GABA holds the potential to improve the development of personalized and targeted anti-epileptic therapies.

                <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> is a global public health concern due to the rising myriad of hypervirulent and multidrug-resistant clones both alarmingly associated with high mortality. The molecular mechanisms underpinning these recalcitrant <i>K. pneumoniae</i> infection, and how virulence is coupled with the emergence of lineages resistant to nearly all present-day clinically important antimicrobials, are unclear. In this study, we performed a genome-wide screen in <i>K. pneumoniae</i> ECL8, a member of the endemic K2-ST375 pathotype most often reported in Asia, to define genes essential for growth in a nutrient-rich laboratory medium (Luria-Bertani [LB] medium), human urine, and serum. Through transposon directed insertion-site sequencing (TraDIS), a total of 427 genes were identified as essential for growth on LB agar, whereas transposon insertions in 11 and 144 genes decreased fitness for growth in either urine or serum, respectively. These studies not only provide further knowledge on the genetics of this pathogen but also provide a strong impetus for discovering new antimicrobial targets to improve current therapeutic options for <i>K. pneumoniae</i> infections.

">Vascular FLRT2 regulates venous-mediated angiogenic expansion and CNS barriergenesis</a></h4>

              
                Veins have emerged as the origin of all other endothelial cell subtypes needed to expand vascular networks during developmental and pathological neoangiogenesis. Here, we uncover the significant role of the angioneurin Fibronectin Leucine Rich Transmembrane protein (FLRT) 2 in central nervous system (CNS) vascular development in the mouse. Early postnatal FLRT2 deletion reveals specific defects in retinal veins, impacting endothelial cell proliferation, sprouting and polarity that result in reduced tip cells at the vascular front. FLRT2 interacts with VE-cadherin and together with the endocytic adaptor protein Numb contribute to the modulation of adherens junction morphology in both retina and cerebral cortex in vivo. Utilizing expansion microscopy, we visualize the altered dynamic distribution of VE-cadherin in tissue of FLRT2 endothelial mutants. Additionally, FLRT2 in cortical vessels regulates the crosstalk between adherens and tight junctions, influencing blood-brain barrier development. Our findings position FLRT2 as a vein-specific crucial regulator of CNS vascular development.

">Dissociating External and Internal Attentional Selection</a></h4>

              
                Visual Working Memory (VWM) stores visual information for upcoming actions. Just as attention can shift externally towards relevant objects in the visual environment, attention can shift internally towards (i.e., prioritize) VWM content that is relevant for upcoming tasks. Internal and external attentional selection share a number of key neural and functional characteristics, which include their spatial organization: recent work has shown that spatial attention is directed towards the previous location of a prioritized memory item, similar to how a perceived stimulus is prioritized. Attending stimuli that are physically present is useful, as it enhances processing of the relevant visual input. When prioritizing items in memory, however, attending the prior stimulus location cannot serve this purpose, as there is no visual input to enhance. Here, we address this apparent contradiction which highlights the gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying external and internal visual attention. In two EEG experiments, we compare location-specific sensory enhancement during the attentional selection of external (perceived) as compared to internal (memorized) stimuli. During both internal and external selection we observed a lateralization of alpha oscillations and gaze position bias toward the previous locations of prioritized items, confirming earlier findings that suggested an inherent spatial organization within VWM. Critically, using Rapid Invisible Frequency Tagging (RIFT), we show that sensory enhancement at the attended location is only observed during external attentional selection of (perceived) stimuli. No such location-specific sensory enhancement was observed during attentional selection of items in VWM. Furthermore, we found no clear relationship across trials between alpha lateralization and sensory enhancement (measured through RIFT) during external attention, suggesting that these two metrics indeed reflect distinct cognitive mechanisms. In sum, using a novel combination of EEG and RIFT, we demonstrate a fundamental distinction between the neural mechanisms underlying the selection of perceived and memorized objects. Both types of selection operate within a spatial reference frame, but only external selection modulates early sensory processing. Our findings suggest that the visual system is not vestigially recruiting existing mechanisms of external attention for prioritization in VWM, but is instead using space as an organizational principle to store and select items in VWM.

">Exosomes can modulate the early hyperexcitability in cortical neurons with ASD-associated Shank3 mutation.</a></h4>

              
                Shank3, a scaffolding protein, is critical for synaptic structure and function, particularly for the formation and maintenance of dendritic spines. Shank3 mutations are strongly implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and related neuropsychiatric conditions such as Phelan-McDermid Syndrome (PMS) also known as the 22q13.3 deletion syndrome. Previous work has recognized early hyperexcitability in cortical neurons derived from ASD patients with various gene mutations as a potential common endophenotype. In this study, we examined the effects of exosomes extracted from several cell types on the neurophysiological properties of cortical neurons derived from Shank3 (c.3679insG mutation) induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). First, we sought to understand the implications of exosome-based intercellular communication on the neurophysiology of Shank3 mutant and control neurons by switching their respective exosomes. We found that while control neuron-derived exosomes do not change the neurophysiology of Shank3 neurons, the Shank3 neuron-derived exosomes transfer the early hyperexcitability and other ASD-related phenotypes to control neurons. Next, we also explored the therapeutic potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and iPSC-derived exosomes from healthy donors in the Shank3 cortical neurons. We demonstrate that both MSC and iPSC-derived exosomes rescue the early hyperexcitability and accelerated maturation of Shank3 neurons. Proteomic analysis of exosomes derived from Shank3 mutant and control neurons, as well as from exosomes derived from MSCs and iPSCs, revealed distinct protein cargoes that may cause changes in the neurophysiological properties of the recipient neurons. Our results hence provide novel insights into the pathophysiology of ASD emphasizing the importance of exosomes in intercellular communication and their potential to influence intrinsic and network properties of neurons. Moreover, our findings support the need for further exploration of exosome-based interventions as potential therapeutics for treating neurodevelopmental disorders.

">Therapeutic suppression of Tubb4a rescues H-ABC leukodystrophy</a></h4>

              
                Hypomyelination and atrophy of basal ganglia and cerebellum (H-ABC) is a rare leukodystrophy associated with causal variants in {beta}-tubulin 4A (TUBB4A). The recurring variant p.Asp249Asn (D249N) presents in infancy with dystonia, communication deficits, and loss of ambulation during the first decade of life. In this study, we characterized a genetic murine series (Tubb4aKO/KO, Tubb4aD249N/+, Tubb4aD249N/KO, and Tubb4aD249N/D249N) to demonstrate that disease severity correlates with the expression of mutant Tubb4a and relative preservation of WT tubulin. To further evaluate the translational potential of Tubb4a suppression as a therapy in H-ABC, we identified a well-tolerated Tubb4a-targeted antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) candidate that selectively reduces Tubb4a in vitro and in vivo. Notably, single intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of ASO in postnatal Tubb4aD249N/KO mice drastically extends its lifespan, improves motor phenotypes, and reduces seizures. Neuropathologically, ASO treatment in Tubb4aD249N/KO mice restores myelin and oligodendrocyte survival. Furthermore, in vivo visual evoked potential latencies recover in ASO-treated Tubb4aD249N/KO mice. This is the first preclinical proof-of-concept for Tubb4a suppression via ASO as a disease-modifying therapy for H-ABC.

">Circuit firing homeostasis following synaptic perturbation ensures robust behavior</a></h4>

              
                Homeostatic regulation of excitability and synaptic transmission ensures stable neural circuit output under changing conditions. We find that pre- or postsynaptic weakening of motor neuron (MN) to muscle glutamatergic transmission in Drosophila larva has little impact on locomotion, suggesting non-synaptic compensatory mechanisms. In vivo imaging of MN to muscle synaptic transmission and MN activity both show that synaptic weakening increases activity in tonic type Ib MNs, but not in the phasic type Is MN that innervate the same muscles. Additionally, an inhibitory class of pre-MNs that innervates type Ib-but not Is-MNs decreases activity. Our experiments suggest that weakening of MN evoked synaptic release onto the muscle is compensated for by an increase in MN firing due to a combined cell-autonomous increase in excitability and decreased inhibitory central drive. Selectivity for type Ib MNs may serve to restore tonic drive while absence of firing adjustment in the convergent Is MN can maintain the contraction wave dynamics needed for locomotion.

                Volume electron microscopy (vEM) datasets such as those generated for connectome studies allow nanoscale quantifications and comparisons of the cell biological features underpinning circuit architectures. Quantifications of cell biological relationships in the connectome result in rich multidimensional datasets that benefit from data science approaches, including dimensionality reduction and integrated graphical representations of neuronal relationships. We developed NeuroSCAN, an online open-source platform that bridges sophisticated graph analytics from data science approaches with the underlying cell biological features in the connectome. We apply NeuroSCAN to a complete published record of C. elegans brain neuropils and demonstrate how these integrated representations of neuronal relationships facilitate comparisons across connectomes, catalyzing new insights on the structure-function of the circuits and their changes during development. NeuroSCAN is designed for intuitive examination and comparisons across connectomes, enabling synthesis of knowledge from high-level abstractions of neuronal relationships derived from data science techniques to the detailed identification of the cell biological features underpinning these abstractions.

">Behavioral screening defines three molecular Parkinsonism subgroups in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Parkinsonism is defined by motor dysfunction, but the specific upstream molecular causes of these clinical symptoms can vary widely. We hypothesize that these causes converge onto a limited number of core cellular pathways. To investigate this, we created a new collection of 24 genetically very well-controlled animal models of familial forms of parkinsonism. Using unbiased behavioral screening and machine learning we identified three clusters of mutants that converge on (1) mitochondrial function; (2) retromer/vesicle trafficking; and (3) proteostasis/autophagy. Genes within each cluster have a similar genetic interaction profile and compounds that target specific molecular pathways ameliorate dopaminergic neuron dysfunction in a cluster-specific manner. This suggests that familial parkinsonism can be stratified into three broad functional groups and our findings pave the way for targeted biomarker discovery and drug development.

                The G4C2 hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C9ORF72 is the major genetic cause of both amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (C9-ALS/FTD). Despite considerable efforts, the development of mouse models of C9-ALS/FTD useful for therapeutic development has proven challenging due to the intricate interplay of genetic and molecular factors underlying this neurodegenerative disorder, in addition to species differences. This study presents a robust investigation of the cellular pathophysiology and behavioral outcomes in a previously described AAV mouse model of C9-ALS expressing 66 G4C2 hexanucleotide repeats. Despite displaying key molecular ALS pathological markers including RNA foci, dipeptide repeat (DPR) protein aggregation, p62 positive stress granule formation as well as mild gliosis, the AAV-(G4C2)66 mouse model in this study exhibits negligible neuronal loss, no motor deficits, and functionally unimpaired TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43). While our findings indicate and support that this is a robust and pharmacologically tractable model for investigating the molecular mechanisms and cellular consequences of (G4C2) repeat driven DPR pathology, it is not suitable for investigating the development of disease associated neurodegeneration, TDP-43 dysfunction, gliosis, and motor performance. Our findings underscore the complexity of ALS pathogenesis involving genetic mutations and protein dysregulation and highlight the need for more comprehensive model systems that reliably replicate the multifaceted cellular and behavioral aspects of C9-ALS.

">Birth order specified recruitment of motor circuits during spontaneous neural activity in zebrafish embryo</a></h4>

              
                Modular organization of spinal neural circuits control dynamic regulation of locomotion. However, it is unknown when or how the distinct microcircuits emerge during development. We carried out high-resolution calcium imaging of neural activity driving the first motor behavior in the zebrafish embryo. During this period, at least two waves of neurogenesis occur to generate primary and secondary motoneurons. We found that embryos containing only primary motoneurons exhibit a single highly synchronized rhythmic circuit between the interneurons and motoneurons. Later, embryos with both primary and secondary motoneurons have two distinct interneuron-motoneuron circuits, one containing primary motoneurons displaying low-frequency activity and the other containing secondary motoneurons with high-frequency activity. The results indicate a mode of birth order determined microcircuits where neurons that are born together are recruited together. Nicotine affected neuronal activity frequency, revealing a functional role for cholinergic signaling in the emergence of patterned spinal microcircuits. Indeed, we found aberrant arrhythmic synchronized activity in mutants for cholineacetyltransferase-a where acetylcholine is no longer synthesized. Overall, we reveal the sequential recruitment of birth order specified microcircuits during the emergence of the earliest motor behavior and highlight a conserved role for cholinergic signaling in regulating rhythmic neural activity in the embryonic spinal cord.

">Would you agree if N is three?On statistical inference for small N.</a></h4>

              
                Non-human primate studies traditionally use two or three animals. We previously used standard statistics to argue for using either one animal, for an inference about that sample, or five or more animals, for a useful inference about the population. A recently proposed framework argued for testing three animals and accepting the outcome found in the majority as the outcome that is most representative for the population. The proposal tests this framework under various assumptions about the true probability of the representative outcome in the population, i.e. its typicality. On this basis, it argues that the framework is valid across a wide range of typicalities. Here, we show (1) that the error rate of the framework depends strongly on the typicality of the representative outcome, (2) that an acceptable error rate requires this typicality to be very high (87% for a single type of outlier), which actually renders empirical testing beyond a single animal obsolete, (3) that moving from one to three animals decreases error rates mainly for typicality values of 70-90%, and much less for both lower and higher values. Furthermore, we use conjunction analysis to demonstrate that two out of three animals with a given outcome only allow to infer a lower bound to typicality of 9%, which is of limited value. Thus, the use of two or three animals does not allow a useful inference about the population, and if this option is nevertheless chosen, the inferred lower bound of typicality should be reported.

">Neural tracking of auditory statistical regularities is reduced in adults with dyslexia</a></h4>

              
                Listeners implicitly use statistical regularities to segment continuous sound input into meaningful units, e.g., transitional probabilities between syllables to segment a speech stream into separate words. Implicit learning of such statistical regularities in a novel stimulus stream is reflected in a synchronisation of neural responses to the sequential stimulus structure. The present study aimed to test the hypothesis that neural tracking of the statistical stimulus structure is reduced in individuals with dyslexia who have weaker reading and spelling skills, and possibly also weaker statistical learning abilities in general, compared to healthy controls. To this end, adults with and without dyslexia were presented with continuous streams of (non-speech) tones, which were arranged into triplets, such that transitional probabilities between single tones were high within triplets and low between triplets. We found that neural tracking of the triplet structure, i.e., phase coherence of EEG response at the triplet rate relative to the tone rate, was reduced in adults with dyslexia compared to the control group. Moreover, enhanced neural tracking of the statistical structure was associated with better spelling skills. These results suggest that individuals with dyslexia have a rather broad deficit in processing structure in sound instead of a merely phonological deficit.

">Assessing neuronal correlates of salience and their adaptability with naturalistic textures in macaque V1 and V2</a></h4>

              
                Salience is critical to vision. It allows stimuli that are different from their surroundings to 'pop out', drawing our attention. Perceptual salience is postulated to be encoded via a saliency map, based on differences in neuronal responsivity to simple image features at different spatial locations. Simple image features such as luminance, orientation and color are known to affect saliency and many of these features are encoded in primary visual cortex (V1), which several influential theories propose instantiate a saliency map. However, the degree to which more complex image features can determine salience, and whether there are neural correlates of salience which are computed outside of V1, remains unclear. Here we use displays of naturalistic textures to test for neural correlates of salience-termed pop-out responses-in V1 and area V2 of anesthetized macaque monkeys. Sensitivity to higher-order texture statistics arises in V2, so pop-out responses for these displays, if they exist, would be expected to be computed after V1. We presented displays in which a target texture, presented within the neuronal receptive field, was surrounded by distractors. Distractors could differ from the target texture in either higher-order texture statistics only, or in both lower- and higher-order statistics. We found little evidence for pop-out signals in either V1 or V2, for either display type. However, brief periods of adaptation could induce pop-out responses in V2. This suggests that adaptation might define which features of the environment are most salient, even if those features would otherwise not evoke pop-out responses.

">Acetate enhances spatial memory in females via sex- and brain region-specific epigenetic and transcriptional remodeling</a></h4>

              
                Metabolic control of chromatin and gene expression is emerging as a key, but largely unexplored aspect of gene regulation. In the brain, metabolic-epigenetic interactions can influence critical neuronal functions. Here, we use a combination of behavioral, proteomic and genomic approaches to demonstrate that the intermediary metabolite acetate enhances memory in a brain region- and sex-specific manner. We show that acetate facilitates the formation of dorsal hippocampus-dependent spatial memories in female but not in male mice, while having no effect on cortex-dependent non-spatial memories in either sex. Acetate-enhanced spatial memory is driven by increased acetylation of histone variant H2A.Z, and upregulation of genes implicated in spatial learning in the dorsal hippocampus of female mice. In line with the sex-specific behavioral outcomes, the effect of acetate on dorsal hippocampal histone modifications and gene expression shows marked differences between the sexes during critical windows of memory formation (consolidation and recall). Overall, our findings elucidate a novel role for acetate, a ubiquitous and abundant metabolite, in regulating dorsal hippocampal chromatin, gene expression and learning, and outline acetate exposure as a promising new approach to enhance memory formation.

">Center-surround inhibition by expectation: a neuro-computational account</a></h4>

              
                Expectation is beneficial for adaptive behavior through quickly deducing plausible interpretations of information. The profile and underlying neural computations of this process, however, remain unclear. When participants expected a grating with a specific orientation, we found a center-surround inhibition profile in orientation space, which was independent from attentional modulations by task-relevance. Using computational modeling, we showed that this center-surround inhibition could be reproduced by either a sharpening of tuning curves of expected orientation or a shift of tuning curves of unexpected orientations. Intriguingly, these two computations were further supported by orientation-adjustment and orientation-discrimination experiments. Finally, the ablation studies in convolutional neural networks revealed that predictive coding feedback played a critical role in the center-surround inhibition in expectation. Altogether, our study reveals for the first time that expectation results in both enhancement and suppression, optimizing plausible interpretations during perception by enhancing expected and attenuating similar but irrelevant and potentially interfering representations.

">Sodium channel inhibitors alter the progress of tangle development in a mouse model of dementia</a></h4>

              
                Sodium channel inhibitors have been reported to protect against a range of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. Here the effect of chronic administration of two Na+ channel inhibitors with different mechanisms of action, phenytoin and GS967 are tested in mouse models of different stages of Alzheimers disease. Subtle changes in the distribution of plaque sizes were observed in AppNLGF/NLGF mouse at 3 months of age, after being fed control or drug-supplemented chow from weaning onwards, with phenytoin treatment resulting in a significant increase in the frequency of the smallest plaques and a decrease in large plaques. The later pathology of neurofibrillary tangles was studied, in old age, by supplementing the food of transgenic mice with a P301L mutation in Tau. Chronic administration of Na+ inhibitors from 15 months of age resulted in a decrease in the density of MC1-positive neurofibrillary tangles, possibly due to effects on microglial Na+ channels. The density of microglial cells was strongly correlated with the density of neurofibrillary tangles but only in mice treated with the Na+ inhibitors.

">Alterations in large-scale resting-state network nodes following transcranial focused ultrasound of deep brain structures</a></h4>

              
                Background: Low-intensity transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) is a brain stimulation approach that holds immense promise for the treatment of brain-based disorders. Several studies in humans have shown that tFUS can successfully modulate perfusion in focal sonication targets including the amygdala; however, limited research has explored how tFUS impacts the function of large-scale neural networks. Objective: The aim of the current study was to address this gap and examine changes in resting-state connectivity between large-scale network nodes using a randomized, double-blind, within-subject crossover study design. Methods: Healthy adults (n=18) completed two tFUS sessions, 14 days apart. Each session included tFUS of either the right amygdala or the left entorhinal cortex (ErC). The inclusion of two active targets allowed for within-subjects comparisons as a function of the locus of sonication. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was collected before and after each tFUS session. Results: tFUS altered resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) within and between rs-network nodes. Specifically, pre-to-post sonication of the right amygdala modulated connectivity within nodes of the salience network (SAN) and between nodes of the SAN and the default-mode network (DMN) and fronto-parietal network (FRP). A decrease in SAN to FPN connectivity was specific to the amygdala target. Pre-to-post sonication of the left ErC was found to modulate connectivity between the dorsal attention network (DAN) and FPN and DMN. An increase in DAN to DMN connectivity was specific to the ErC target. Conclusion: These preliminary findings may suggest that tFUS induces neuroplastic changes beyond the immediate sonication target.

">Neural correlates of age-related changes in social decisions from episodic memory</a></h4>

              
                Older adults are frequent victims of financial scams. Previous behavioral research suggests that this may be due to systematic biases in how they make decisions about whom to trust: for instance, Lempert et al. (2022) found that relative to younger adults, older adults were more likely to base decisions about whether to re-engage with someone on how generous that person looked, rather than on their memory for how they had previously behaved. Here, we aimed to identify the neural correlates of these age-dependent changes in social decision-making in order to clarify the mechanism by which they emerge. Using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), we measured neural activity while a total of 86 participants -- 45 younger and 41 older adults -- learned about how much of a $10 endowment an individual, represented by a picture of their face, was willing to share with them in a dictator game. After this encoding phase, participants then made decisions about whom they wanted to play another round of the dictator game with. In line with previous findings, we found that older adults did not reliably prefer to re-engage with people who had proven themselves to be generous. This bias was the result of several factors: (1) older adults had worse associative memory for how much each person had shared, possibly due to an age-dependent decrease in neural activity in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) during encoding, (2) older adults had a stronger tendency to re-engage with familiar over novel faces regardless of their past behavior, and (3) while activity in value-responsive brain regions tracked with how generous a face looked across the age range, older adults were less able to inhibit the influence of these irrelevant perceptual features when it was necessary to do so. In line with this behavioral effect, younger adults showed greater activation in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) during choices that required suppressing irrelevant perceptual features in favor of associative memory. Taken together, our findings highlight age-dependent changes in both the ability to encode relevant information and to adaptively deploy it in service of social decisions.

">On-Demand Seizures Facilitate Rapid Screening of Therapeutics for Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                Animal models of epilepsy are critical in drug development and therapeutic testing, but dominant methods for pharmaceutical evaluation face a tradeoff between higher throughput and etiological relevance. For example, in temporal lobe epilepsy, a type of epilepsy where seizures originate from limbic structures like the hippocampus, the main screening models are either based on acutely induced seizures in wild type, naive animals or spontaneous seizures in chronically epileptic animals. Both types have their disadvantages - the acute convulsant or kindling induced seizures do not account for the myriad neuropathological changes in the diseased, epileptic brains, and spontaneous behavioral seizures are sparse in the chronically epileptic models, making it time-intensive to sufficiently power experiments. In this study, we took a mechanistic approach to precipitate seizures "on demand" in chronically epileptic mice. We briefly synchronized principal cells in the CA1 region of the diseased hippocampus to reliably induce stereotyped on-demand behavioral seizures. These induced seizures resembled naturally occurring spontaneous seizures in the epileptic animals and could be stopped by commonly prescribed anti-seizure medications such as levetiracetam and diazepam. Furthermore, we showed that seizures induced in chronically epileptic animals differed from those in naive animals, highlighting the importance of evaluating therapeutics in the diseased circuit. Taken together, we envision our model to advance the speed at which both pharmacological and closed loop interventions for temporal lobe epilepsy are evaluated.

">Photoperiodicity in Glucose Metabolism in the Human Brain</a></h4>

              
                Photoperiodicity in the human brain function, which is a critical factor for social well-being, has been widely debated. In this study, 432 healthy males underwent fasting-state brain [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) scanning twice: first at the baseline and then at the 5-year follow-up. We analyzed the effect of day length on brain glucose uptake separately for the baseline and follow-up studies and examined changes in glucose consumption as a function of the day length deviation for each participant between the repeated PET scans. Glucose uptake in the cuneus was consistently predicted by the day length on the day of scanning and by within-participant day length deviations. This longitudinal large-scale PET study provides a landmark evidence for photoperiodicity in glucose metabolism in the human brain. The cuneus may be an essential part of the visual cortex, translating environmental photoperiodic changes into temporal cues that influence cognitive function and social behavior.

">A theory of rapid behavioral inferences under the pressure of time</a></h4>

              
                To survive, animals must be able quickly infer the state of their surroundings. For example, to successfully escape an approaching predator, prey must quickly estimate the direction of approach from incoming sensory stimuli. Such rapid inferences are particularly challenging because the animal has only a brief window of time to gather sensory stimuli, and yet the accuracy of inference is critical for survival. Due to evolutionary pressures, nervous systems have likely evolved effective computational strategies that enable accurate inferences under strong time limitations. Traditionally, the relationship between the speed and accuracy of inference has been described by the "speed-accuracy tradeoff" (SAT), which quantifies how the average performance of an ideal observer improves as the observer has more time to collect incoming stimuli. While this trial-averaged description can reasonably account for individual inferences made over long timescales, it does not capture individual inferences on short timescales, when trial-to-trial variability gives rise to diverse patterns of error dynamics. We show that an ideal observer can exploit this single-trial structure by adaptively tracking the dynamics of its belief about the state of the environment, which enables it make more rapid inferences and more reliably track its own error but also causes it to violate the SAT. We show that these features can be used to improve overall performance during rapid escape. The resulting behavior qualitatively reproduces features of escape behavior in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, whose escapes have presumably been highly optimized by natural selection.

">Perception/action coupling is modulated by the age-related motor skills of the agent performing the action</a></h4>

              
                The perception/action coupling, underpinned by Mirror Neurons, allows the understanding of others' action goal and intention picked up from cues conveyed by the individual's kinematics and the context of the action. This mechanism can be modulated by familiarity with the observed action, by motor experience and motor expertise for that action, but could it be modulated by the age-related motor skills of the agent performing the action? We used an eye-tracking visual preference paradigm to study the modulation of perception/action coupling in 62 adults when viewing videos of daily actions presented in a forward reading direction or, for the same action, in a backward reading direction. Video actions were performed by young actors aged 4, 8, and 13 years and by adults. We found greater pupil dilation for all backward videos compared to forward videos. Interestingly, pupil dilation was greater for the forward videos with child actors than for those with adolescent/adult actors. An overall comparison of looking times during the preference phase did not reveal a preference for either video but testing for a context effect revealed a preference for backward videos when the last video observed in the exposure phase was forward. This study demonstrated the influence of the agent's age-related motor abilities on the observer's perception/action coupling and revealed that pupil dilation and the context effect could be relevant cues for exploring this coupling in a non-invasive, passive experimental setup that is particularly suitable for exploring perception/action coupling in very young children with a developmental disorder.

">Decoding the elite soccer players psychological profile</a></h4>

              
                Soccer is arguably the most widely followed sport worldwide, and many dream of becoming soccer players. However, only a few manage to achieve this dream, which has cast a significant spotlight on elite soccer players who possess exceptional skills to rise above the rest. Originally, such attention was focused on their great physical abilities. However, recently, it a new perspective has emerged, suggesting that being an elite soccer player require a deep understanding of the game, rapid information processing and decision-making. This growing attention has led to several studies suggesting higher executive functions in soccer players compared to the general population. Unfortunately, these studies often had small and non-elite samples, focusing mainly on executive functions alone without employing advanced machine learning techniques. In this study, we used artificial neural networks to comprehensively investigate the personality traits and cognitive abilities of a sample of 328 participants, including 204 elite soccer players from the top teams in Brazil and Sweden. Our findings indicate that elite soccer players demonstrate heightened planning and memory capacities, enhanced executive functions, especially cognitive flexibility, elevated levels of conscientiousness, extraversion, and openness to experience, coupled with reduced neuroticism and agreeableness. This research provides insights into the psychology of elite soccer players, holding significance for talent identification, development strategies in soccer and offering insights into the psychological profiles associated with success.

">SpinalTRAQ: A novel volumetric cervical spinal cord atlas identifies the corticospinal tract synaptic projectome in healthy and post-stroke mice</a></h4>

              
                Descending corticospinal tract (CST) connections to the neurons of the cervical spinal cord are vital for performance of forelimb-specific fine motor skills. In rodents, CST axons are almost entirely crossed at the level of the medullary decussation. While specific contralateral axon projections have been well-characterized using anatomic and molecular approaches, the field currently lacks a cohesive imaging modality allowing rapid quantitative assessment of the entire, bilateral cervical cord projectome at the level of individual laminae and cervical levels. This is potentially important as the CST is known to undergo marked structural remodeling in development, aging, and disease. We developed SpinalTRAQ (Spinal cord Tomographic Registration and Automated Quantification), a novel volumetric cervical spinal cord atlas and machine learning-driven microscopy acquisition and analysis pipeline that uses serial two-photon tomography- images to generate unbiased, region-specific quantification of the fluorescent pixels of anterograde AAV-labeled CST pre-synaptic terminals. In adult mice, the CST synaptic projectome densely innervates the contralateral hemicord, particularly in laminae 5 and 7, with sparse, monosynaptic input to motoneurons in lamina 9. Motor pools supplying axial musculature in the upper cervical cord are bilaterally innervated. The remainder of the ipsilateral cord has sparse labeling in a distinct distribution compared to the contralateral side. Following a focal stroke of the motor cortex, there is a complete loss of descending corticospinal axons from the injured side. Consistent with prior reports of axon collateralization, the CST spinal projectome increases at four weeks post-stroke and continues to elevate by six weeks post stroke. At six weeks post-stroke, we observed striking synapse formation in the denervated hemicord from the uninjured CST in a homotopic distribution. Additionally, CST synaptic reinnervation increases in the denervated lamina 9 in nearly all motoneuron pools, exhibiting novel patterns of connectivity. Detailed level- and lamina-specific quantification of the bilateral cervical spinal cord synaptic projectome reveals previously undescribed patterns of CST connectivity in health and injury-related plasticity.

	<p>Background: Psoriasis is a chronic skin disorder affecting 2&amp;amp;ndash;3% of the global population, and is associated with several comorbidities, including psychiatric disorders. This study aimed to identify factors influencing anxiety, depression, and quality of life (QoL) in patients with psoriasis. Methods: This observational study included 112 patients diagnosed with psoriasis. Dermatological and psychiatric assessments were conducted using Psodisk, the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R), and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). Descriptive statistics, correlation analyses, and multivariate regression models were employed. Results: The sample was predominantly middle-aged males (mean age 48.91 years). Females (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), patients with arthritis (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), and those with a sedentary lifestyle (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) showed higher anxiety and depression scores. Psodisk subscales significantly correlated with psychiatric symptoms and QoL measures (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Pain (B: 0.63, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05; B: &amp;amp;minus;2.03, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) and sleep disturbances (B: 0.68, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01; B: 0.60, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01; B: &amp;amp;minus;1.46, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01; B: &amp;amp;minus;1.57, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05; B: 3.91, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05) emerged as major predictors of poor mental health and reduced QoL. Conclusions. The study underscores the complex relationship between psoriasis, psychiatric comorbidities, and QoL. Key factors exacerbating anxiety and depression include female gender, arthritis, and sedentary lifestyle. Comprehensive management of psoriasis should address both dermatological and psychological aspects, with a focus on pain relief and improving sleep quality to enhance overall patient well-being.</p>

	<p>In recent research, dendritic neuron-based models have shown promise in effectively learning and recognizing object motion direction within binary images. Leveraging the dendritic neuron structure and On&amp;amp;ndash;Off Response mechanism within the primary cortex, this approach has notably reduced learning time and costs compared to traditional neural networks. This paper advances the existing model by integrating bio-inspired components into a learnable dendritic neuron-based artificial visual system (AVS), specifically incorporating mechanisms from horizontal and bipolar cells. This enhancement enables the model to proficiently identify object motion directions in grayscale images, aligning its threshold with human-like perception. The enhanced model demonstrates superior efficiency in motion direction recognition, requiring less data (90% less than other deep models) and less time for training. Experimental findings highlight the model&amp;amp;rsquo;s remarkable robustness, indicating significant potential for real-world applications. The integration of bio-inspired features not only enhances performance but also opens avenues for further exploration in neural network research. Notably, the application of this model to realistic object recognition yields convincing accuracy at nearly 100%, underscoring its practical utility.</p>

	<p>Background: Art therapy has a long history of applications in cognitive and motor rehabilitation. More recently, a growing body of scientific literature has highlighted the potential of virtual reality in neurorehabilitation, though it has focused more on the technology itself than on the principles adopted in digital scenarios. Methods: This study is a single-blind randomized controlled trial conducted on 40 patients with stroke, comparing conventional therapy (physical therapy for the upper and lower limbs, for posture and balance, cognitive therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and specific therapy for swallowing, bowel, and bladder dysfunctions) to a protocol in which the upper limb physical therapy was substituted with art therapy administered by means of virtual reality exploiting the so-called Michelangelo effect. Results: After 12 sessions, patients in the virtual art therapy group showed a significantly greater improvement in independence in activities of daily living, as assessed by the Barthel Index (interaction of time and group: p = 0.001). Significant differences were also found in terms of upper limb muscle strength (Manual Muscle Test, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) and reduction in spasticity (Ashworth scale, p = 0.007) in favor of the experimental group. In the virtual art therapy group, the effectiveness of the intervention was significantly correlated with patient participation (Pittsburgh Rehabilitation Participation Scale: R = 0.41), patient satisfaction (R = 0.60), and the perceived utility of the intervention by the therapist (R = 0.43). Conclusions: These findings support the efficacy of virtual art therapy leveraging the Michelangelo effect. Further studies should also focus on cognitive domains that could benefit from this type of approach.</p>

	<p>Delirium is often the first symptom of incipient acute illness or complications and must therefore be detected promptly. Nevertheless, routine screening for delirium in acute care hospital wards is often inadequate. We recently implemented a simple, user-friendly delirium screening test (RMA) that can be administered during ward rounds and routine nursing care. The test was found to be non-inferior to 4AT in terms of sensitivity and specificity. However, the dominant factors to take into account when assessing the performance of a test added to the routine work of busy acute care hospital wards are ease of administration, real-life amenability and the ability of the staff to adhere to testing requirements. In this study, we evaluated the prevalence of daily RMA tests that were not administered as scheduled and the impact of these omissions on the overall real-world performance of RMA. Using point-in-time assessments of 4AT by an external rater, we found that complete RMA was administered in 88.8% of the days. Physicians omitted significantly more tests than nurses, but their results were more specific for delirium. Omissions reduced the sensitivity and specificity of RMA for delirium (compared to 4AT) from 90.7% to 81.7%, and from 99.2% to 87.8%, respectively. Ideally, the number of omitted RMA tests should be minimized. However, if over 85% of the daily quota of complete tests are administered, the sensitivity and specificity of RMA for diagnosing delirium as soon as it appears remain at acceptable levels.</p>

The identification of cancer driver genes is crucial for early detection, effective therapy, and precision medicine of cancer. Cancer is caused by the dysregulation of several genes at various levels of regulation. However, current techniques only capture a limited amount of regulatory information, which may hinder their efficacy. In this study, we present IMI-driver, a model that integrates multi-omics data into eight biological networks and applies Multi-view Collaborative Network Embedding to embed the gene regulation information from the biological networks into a low-dimensional vector space to identify cancer drivers. We apply IMI-driver to 29 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and compare its performance with nine other methods on nine benchmark datasets. IMI-driver outperforms the other methods, demonstrating that multi-level network integration enhances prediction accuracy. We also perform a pan-cancer analysis using the genes identified by IMI-driver, which confirms almost all our selected candidate genes as known or potential drivers. Case studies of the new positive genes suggest their roles in cancer development and progression.

                <p>by Efrat Cohen-Davidi, Isana Veksler-Lublinsky</p>

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. In animals, this regulation is achieved via base-pairing with partially complementary sequences on mainly 3’ UTR region of messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Computational approaches that predict miRNA target interactions (MTIs) facilitate the process of narrowing down potential targets for experimental validation. The availability of new datasets of high-throughput, direct MTIs has led to the development of machine learning (ML) based methods for MTI prediction. To train an ML algorithm, it is beneficial to provide entries from all class labels (i.e., positive and negative). Currently, no high-throughput assays exist for capturing negative examples. Therefore, current ML approaches must rely on either artificially generated or inferred negative examples deduced from experimentally identified positive miRNA-target datasets. Moreover, the lack of uniform standards for generating such data leads to biased results and hampers comparisons between studies. In this comprehensive study, we collected methods for generating negative data for animal miRNAs–target interactions and investigated their impact on the classification of true human MTIs. Our study relies on training ML models on a fixed positive dataset in combination with different negative datasets and evaluating their intra- and cross-dataset performance. As a result, we were able to examine each method independently and evaluate ML models’ sensitivity to the methodologies utilized in negative data generation. To achieve a deep understanding of the performance results, we analyzed unique features that distinguish between datasets. In addition, we examined whether one-class classification models that utilize solely positive interactions for training are suitable for the task of MTI classification. We demonstrate the importance of negative data in MTI classification, analyze specific methodological characteristics that differentiate negative datasets, and highlight the challenge of ML models generalizing interaction rules from training to testing sets derived from different approaches. This study provides valuable insights into the computational prediction of MTIs that can be further used to establish standards in the field.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) involves aggregation of amyloid β and tau, neuron loss, cognitive decline, and neuroinflammatory responses. Both resident microglia and peripheral immune cells have been associated with the immune component of AD. However, the relative contribution of resident and peripheral immune cell types to AD predisposition has not been thoroughly explored due to their similarity in gene expression and function. To study the effects of AD associated variants on <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements, we train convolutional neural network (CNN) regression models that link genome sequence to cell type-specific levels of open chromatin, a proxy for regulatory element activity. We then use <i>in silico</i> mutagenesis of regulatory sequences to predict the relative impact of candidate variants across these cell types. We develop and apply criteria for evaluating our models and refine our models using massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) data. Our models identify multiple AD-associated variants with a greater predicted impact in peripheral cells relative to microglia or neurons. Our results support their use as models to study the effects of AD-associated variants and even suggest that peripheral immune cells themselves may mediate a component of AD predisposition. We make our library of CNN models and predictions available as a resource for the community to study immune and neurological disorders.

                <p>by Anubha Dey, Suresh Mudunuri, Manjari Kiran</p>

Synthetic lethality (SL) and synthetic viability (SV) are commonly studied genetic interactions in the targeted therapy approach in cancer. In SL, inhibiting either of the genes does not affect the cancer cell survival, but inhibiting both leads to a lethal phenotype. In SV, inhibiting the vulnerable gene makes the cancer cell sick; inhibiting the partner gene rescues and promotes cell viability. Many low and high-throughput experimental approaches have been employed to identify SLs and SVs, but they are time-consuming and expensive. The computational tools for SL prediction involve statistical and machine-learning approaches. Almost all machine learning tools are binary classifiers and involve only identifying SL pairs. Most importantly, there are limited properties known that best describe and discriminate SL from SV. We developed MAGICAL (<i>Multi-class Approach for Genetic Interaction in Cancer via Algorithm Learning</i>), a multi-class random forest based machine learning model for genetic interaction prediction. Network properties of protein derived from physical protein-protein interactions are used as features to classify SL and SV. The model results in an accuracy of ~80% for the training dataset (CGIdb, BioGRID, and SynLethDB) and performs well on DepMap and other experimentally derived reported datasets. Amongst all the network properties, the shortest path, average neighbor2, average betweenness, average triangle, and adhesion have significant discriminatory power. MAGICAL is the first multi-class model to identify discriminatory features of synthetic lethal and viable interactions. MAGICAL can predict SL and SV interactions with better accuracy and precision than any existing binary classifier.

                <p>by Jingjing Li, Laia Jordana, Haytham Mehsen, Xinyue Wang, Vincent Archambault</p>

In animals, mitosis involves the breakdown of the nuclear envelope and the sorting of individualized, condensed chromosomes. During mitotic exit, emerging nuclei reassemble a nuclear envelope around a single mass of interconnecting chromosomes. The molecular mechanisms of nuclear reassembly are incompletely understood. Moreover, the cellular and physiological consequences of defects in this process are largely unexplored. Here, we have characterized a mechanism essential for nuclear reassembly in <i>Drosophila</i>. We show that Ankle2 promotes the PP2A-dependent recruitment of BAF and Lamin at reassembling nuclei, and that failures in this mechanism result in severe nuclear defects after mitosis. We then took advantage of perturbations in this mechanism to investigate the physiological responses to nuclear reassembly defects during tissue development in vivo. Partial depletion of Ankle2, BAF, or Lamin in imaginal wing discs results in wing development defects accompanied by apoptosis. We found that blocking apoptosis strongly enhances developmental defects. Blocking p53 does not prevent apoptosis but enhances defects due to the loss of a cell cycle checkpoint. Our results suggest that apoptotic and p53-dependent responses play a crucial role in safeguarding tissue development in response to sporadic nuclear reassembly defects.

                <p>by Quinn K. Langdon, Jeffrey S. Groh, Stepfanie M. Aguillon, Daniel L. Powell, Theresa Gunn, Cheyenne Payne, John J. Baczenas, Alex Donny, Tristram O. Dodge, Kang Du, Manfred Schartl, Oscar Ríos-Cárdenas, Carla Gutiérrez-Rodríguez, Molly Morris, Molly Schumer</p>

Over the past 2 decades, biologists have come to appreciate that hybridization, or genetic exchange between distinct lineages, is remarkably common—not just in particular lineages but in taxonomic groups across the tree of life. As a result, the genomes of many modern species harbor regions inherited from related species. This observation has raised fundamental questions about the degree to which the genomic outcomes of hybridization are repeatable and the degree to which natural selection drives such repeatability. However, a lack of appropriate systems to answer these questions has limited empirical progress in this area. Here, we leverage independently formed hybrid populations between the swordtail fish <i>Xiphophorus birchmanni</i> and <i>X</i>. <i>cortezi</i> to address this fundamental question. We find that local ancestry in one hybrid population is remarkably predictive of local ancestry in another, demographically independent hybrid population. Applying newly developed methods, we can attribute much of this repeatability to strong selection in the earliest generations after initial hybridization. We complement these analyses with time-series data that demonstrates that ancestry at regions under selection has remained stable over the past approximately 40 generations of evolution. Finally, we compare our results to the well-studied <i>X</i>. <i>birchmanni × X</i>. <i>malinche</i> hybrid populations and conclude that deeper evolutionary divergence has resulted in stronger selection and higher repeatability in patterns of local ancestry in hybrids between <i>X</i>. <i>birchmanni</i> and <i>X</i>. <i>cortezi</i>.

                <p>by Shawn D. Burton, Christina M. Malyshko, Nathaniel N. Urban</p>

Inhibitory circuits in the mammalian olfactory bulb (OB) dynamically reformat olfactory information as it propagates from peripheral receptors to downstream cortex. To gain mechanistic insight into how specific OB interneuron types support this sensory processing, we examine unitary synaptic interactions between excitatory mitral and tufted cells (MTCs), the OB projection neurons, and a conserved population of anaxonic external plexiform layer interneurons (EPL-INs) using pair and quartet whole-cell recordings in acute mouse brain slices. Physiological, morphological, neurochemical, and synaptic analyses divide EPL-INs into distinct subtypes and reveal that parvalbumin-expressing fast-spiking EPL-INs (FSIs) perisomatically innervate MTCs with release-competent dendrites and synaptically detonate to mediate fast, short-latency recurrent and lateral inhibition. Sparse MTC synchronization supralinearly increases this high-fidelity inhibition, while sensory afferent activation combined with single-cell silencing reveals that individual FSIs account for a substantial fraction of total network-driven MTC lateral inhibition. OB output is thus powerfully shaped by detonation-driven high-fidelity perisomatic inhibition.

                Recent work by Giusti and colleagues showed that circTulp4 modulates excitatory synaptic strength. Knocking down circTulp4 disrupts the excitation–inhibition (E/I) balance in mice and leads to hypersensitivity toward aversive stimuli. These observations update our appreciation of the functions of circular (circ)RNA in the nervous system and their potential implication in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders.

                Quiescence is a prolonged but reversible state of cell-cycle arrest that is an adaptive feature of most adult stem cell populations. In the brain, quiescence helps to protect adult neural stem cells from stress and supports lifelong neurogenesis. Unfortunately however, entry into a quiescent or a slow-cycling state is also a malignant feature of brain cancer stem cells. In glioblastoma, where the process has been best characterised, quiescent glioma stem cells preferentially survive chemoradiation, and after therapy, reactivate to regrow the tumour and drive recurrence. In this Review, we discuss the in vitro and in vivo models that have been developed for studying neural stem cell quiescence and how these tools may be used to deepen biological understanding and to develop novel therapies targeting quiescent glioma stem cells.

">Dynamic modeling of EEG responses to natural speech reveals earlier processing of predictable words</a></h4>

              
                In recent years, it has become clear that EEG indexes the comprehension of natural, narrative speech. One particularly compelling demonstration of this fact can be seen by regressing EEG responses to speech against measures of how individual words in that speech linguistically relate to their preceding context. This approach produces a so-called temporal response function that displays a centro-parietal negativity reminiscent of the classic N400 component of the event-related potential. One shortcoming of previous implementations of this approach is that they have typically assumed a linear, time-invariant relationship between the linguistic speech features and the EEG responses. In other words, the analysis typically assumes that the response has the same shape and timing for every word - and only varies (linearly) in terms of its amplitude. In the present work, we relax this assumption under the hypothesis that responses to individual words may be processed more rapidly when they are predictable. Specifically, we introduce a framework wherein the standard linear temporal response function can be modulated in terms of its amplitude, latency, and temporal scale based on the expectedness of the current and prior words. We use the proposed approach to model EEG recorded from a set of participants who listened to an audiobook narrated by a single talker, and a separate set of participants who attended to one of two concurrently presented audiobooks. We show that expected words are processed faster - evoking lower amplitude N400-like responses with earlier peaks - and that this effect is driven both by the word's own predictability and the predictability of the immediately preceding word. Additional analysis suggests that this finding is not simply explained based on how quickly words can be disambiguated from their phonetic neighbors. As such, our study demonstrates that the timing and amplitude of brain responses to words in natural speech depend on their predictability. By accounting for these effects, our framework also improves the accuracy with which neural responses to natural speech can be modeled.

">Transcriptomically-measured gene expression predicts physiological variation across single neurons in humans and mice</a></h4>

              
                Single-cell transcriptomics measures the molecular landscape of individual neurons with unprecedented efficiency and scale. This insight has the potential to advance our understanding of the molecular basis of neuronal function, and to identify druggable targets for disease treatments. However, transcriptomics also suffers from greater measurement noise than traditional techniques (e.g., RT-PCR), which raises questions about its ability to offer insight into function at true single-cell resolution. We tested if transcriptomic data could yield insight into function of individual neurons in human and mouse neocortex by analyzing two datasets collected via Patch-Seq, a powerful technique for obtaining transcriptomic and physiology data from the same neuron. We found that computational models trained on single-cell transcriptomic data robustly predicted physiology of individual neurons. Critically, models trained on single cells outperformed those trained on cell type averages when predicting single-cell physiology. Thus, the standard approach of denoising single-cell transcriptomic data by averaging on cell types sacrifices functionally-relevant information. Our analysis also revealed novel relationships between gene expression and physiology, including a potential molecular substrate of human-mouse cross-species differences in the speed of single-neuron computation. Broadly, our findings highlight the promise of Patch-Seq for generating new insight into the molecular basis of neuronal function.

">Impact of intragenic NRXN1 deletions on early cortical development</a></h4>

              
                Background: Deletions in NRXN1 are strongly associated with neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions. While exonic deletions are well-studied, intragenic deletions, particularly in intron 5, are less understood and generally consider benign. Recent studies show exonic deletions impact isoform diversity during neurodevelopment, affecting neurogenesis and neuronal function. However, whether intragenic deletions impact isoform expression and neurodevelopment remains underexplored. Methods: We used hiPSCs from typically developing individuals (control) and those with NRXN1 intron 5 deletions to study neurodevelopment. HiPSCs were differentiated towards a cortical fate, with NRXN1 isoform expression, molecular differences, and neuronal morphology examined. Results: We observed distinct NRXN1 isoform expression dynamics during early neurodevelopment, with two expression peaks post-neuronal induction and NRXN1{beta} being most highly expressed. Both NRXN1 deletion and control lines showed similar acquisition of regional and cell fate identity, but significant differences in NRXN1 isoform expression were observed between deletion and control lines, and between deletion lines. RNA sequencing revealed genotype-dependent alterations, particularly in pathways related to synaptic function and neuronal morphology. Consistent with these findings, NRXN1 deletion lines exhibited altered dendrite outgrowth, with variations between deletion lines. Conclusions: Our results indicate a potential role for intron 5 in controlling NRXN1 isoform expression during neurodevelopment. Alterations in gene expression profiles, correlated with morphological changes, suggest a role for NRXN1 isoforms in shaping dendritic morphology. Molecular and cellular differences observed between lines with identical intronic deletions suggest that additional factors, such as genetic background or biological sex, may also play an important role in these phenotypes. Collectively, these findings indicate that NRXN1 intronic deletions are not benign, influencing isoform expression, cellular phenotypes, and neurodevelopment.

">A novel iPSC model of Bryant-Li-Bhoj neurodevelopmental syndrome demonstrates the role of histone H3.3 in neuronal differentiation and maturation</a></h4>

              
                Background Bryant-Li-Bhoj neurodevelopmental syndrome (BLBS) is neurogenetic disorder caused by variants in H3-3A and H3-3B, the two genes that encode the histone H3.3 protein. Ninety-nine percent of individuals with BLBS show developmental delay/intellectual disability, but the mechanism by which variants in H3.3 result in these phenotypes is not yet understood. As a result, only palliative interventions are available to individuals living with BLBS. Methods Here, we investigate how one BLBS-causative variant, H3-3B p.Leu48Arg (L48R), affects neurodevelopment using an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) model differentiated to 2D neural progenitor cells (NPCs), 2D forebrain neurons (FBNs), and 3D dorsal forebrain organoids (DFBOs). We employ a multi-omic approach in the 2D models to quantify the resulting changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility. We used immunofluorescence (IF) staining to define the identities of cells in the 3D DFBOs. Results In the 2D systems, we found dysregulation of both gene expression and chromatin accessibility of genes important for neuronal fate, maturation, and function in H3.3 L48R compared to control. Our work in 3D organoids corroborates these findings, demonstrating altered proportions of radial glia and mature neuronal cells. Conclusions These data provide the first mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of BLBS from a human-derived model of neurodevelopment, which suggest that the L48R increases H3-3B expression, resulting in the hyper-deposition of H3.3 into the nucleosome which underlies changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility. Functionally, this causes dysregulation of cell adhesion, neurotransmission, and the balance between excitatory and inhibitory signaling. These results are a crucial step towards preclinical development and testing of targeted therapies for this and related disorders.

">Using Dual-Coil TMS-EEG to Probe Bilateral Brain Mechanisms in Healthy Aging and Mild Cognitive Impairment</a></h4>

              
                Background: A widespread observation in the cognitive neuroscience of aging is that older adults show a more bilateral pattern of task-related brain activation. These observations are based on inherently correlational approaches. The current study represents a targeted assessment of the role of bilaterality using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Objective: We used a novel bilateral TMS-stimulation paradigm, applied to a group of healthy older adults (hOA) and older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), with two aims: First, to elucidate the neurophysiological effects of bilateral neuromodulation, and second to provide insight into the neurophysiological basis of bilateral brain interactions. Methods: Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded while participants received six forms of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS): unilateral and bilateral rTMS trains at an alpha (8 Hz) and beta (18 Hz) frequency, as well as two sham conditions (unilateral, bilateral) mimicking the sounds of TMS. Results: First, time-frequency analyses of oscillatory power induced by TMS revealed that unilateral beta rTMS elicited rhythmic entrainment of cortical oscillations at the same beta-band frequency. Second, both bilateral alpha and bilateral beta stimulation induced a widespread reduction of alpha power. Lastly, healthy older adults showed greater TMS-related reductions in alpha power in response to bilateral rTMS compared to the MCI cohort. Conclusion: Overall, these results demonstrate frequency-specific responses to bilateral rTMS in the aging brain, and provide support for inhibitory models of hemispheric interaction across multiple frequency bands.

">Natural Language Processing Applied to Spontaneous Recall of Famous Faces Reveals Memory Dysfunction in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Patients</a></h4>

              
                Objective and Background. Epilepsy patients rank memory problems as their most significant cognitive comorbidity. Current clinical assessments are laborious to administer and score and may not always detect subtle memory decline. The Famous Faces Task (FF) has robustly demonstrated that left temporal lobe epilepsy (LTLE) patients remember fewer names and biographical details compared to right TLE (RTLE) patients and healthy controls (HCs). We adapted the FF task to capture subjects' entire spontaneous spoken recall, then scored responses using manual and natural language processing (NLP) methods. We expected to replicate previous group level differences using spontaneous speech and semi-automated analysis. Methods. Seventy-three (N=73) adults (28 LTLE, 18 RTLE, and 27 HCs) were included in a case-control prospective study design. Twenty FF in politics, sports, and entertainment (active 2008-2017) were shown to subjects, who were asked if they could recognize and spontaneously recall as much biographical detail as possible. We created human-generated and automatically-generated keyword dictionaries for each celebrity, based on a randomly selected training set of half of the HC transcripts. To control for speech output, we measured the speech duration, total word count and content word count for the FF task and a Cookie Theft Control Task (CTT), in which subjects were merely asked to describe a visual scene. Subjects' responses to FF and CTT tasks were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed in a blinded manner with a combination of manual and automated NLP approaches. Results. Famous face recognition accuracy was similar between groups. LTLE patients recalled fewer biographical details compared to HCs and RTLEs using both the gold-standard human-generated dictionary (24%+/-12% vs. 31%+/-12% and 30%+/-12%, p=0.007) and the automated dictionary (24%+/-12% vs. 31%+/-12% and 32%+/-13%, p=0.007). There were no group level differences in speech duration, total word count, or content word count for either the FF and CTT to explain difference in recall performance. There was a positive, statistically significant relationship between MOCA score and FF recall performance as scored by the human-generated (rho = .327, p= .029) and automatically-generated dictionaries (rho = .422, p= .004) for TLE subjects, but not HCs, an effect that was driven by LTLE subjects. Discussion. LTLE patients remember fewer details of famous people than HCs or RTLE patients, as discovered by NLP analysis of spontaneous recall. Decreased biographical memory was not due to decreased speech output and correlated with lower MOCA scores. NLP analysis of spontaneous recall can detect memory dysfunction in clinical populations in a semi-automated, objective, and sensitive manner.

">Investigating microscopic angioarchitecture in the human visual cortex in 3D with angioMASH tissue clearing and labelling</a></h4>

              
                Non-invasive imaging techniques, such as ultra-high field fMRI, are intricately connected to the underlying vasculature and are approaching ever higher resolutions. For the analysis of fMRI signals over cortical depth at such high resolutions, microvascular differences might have to be taken into account. Therefore, a better understanding of the laminar distribution and interareal differences in the cortical vasculature is becoming more important. However, in comparison to cyto- and myeloarchitecture, the study of angioarchitecture has received far less attention and relatively few methods have been described to visualise the vascular network in the human brain. Here we present angioMASH, a method for double labelling angioarchitecture and cytoarchitecture in archival human brain tissue, based on the cytoarchitecture labelling and optical clearing of the recently published MASH protocol. The double labelling and optical clearing of thick human brain slices can be accomplished within 16 days. We use this method to acquire multi-resolution 3D datasets of combined cyto- and angioarchitecture in large human samples covering visual areas V1 and V2. We demonstrate for the first time, that classical angioarchitectonic features can be visualised in the human cortex and in 3D using tissue clearing and light-sheet microscopy. Lastly, we show differences in the vessel density and orientation over cortical depth within and between the two areas. Especially in V1, the vascular density is not homogeneous over cortical depth, but shows distinct layering. These layers are also determined by changes in the orientation of the blood vessels from a predominantly radial to a more tangential distribution. In V2, differences in vascular density are less pronounced, but orientation profiles follow a similar trend over cortical depth. We discuss potential consequences of these differences for the interpretation of non-invasive functional imaging modalities such as fMRI or fNIRS.

	<p>This study investigates the protective effects of magnesium sulfate on dopamine neurons in the retinas of rats with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD). Rapidly progressing cognitive decline often precedes or coincides with the motor symptoms associated with PD. PD patients also frequently exhibit visual function abnormalities. However, the specific mechanisms underlying visual dysfunction in PD patients are not yet fully understood. Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether magnesium homeostasis affects dopaminergic neurons in the retina of PD rats. Thirty-six rats were divided into four groups: (1) control, (2) control with magnesium sulfate (control/MgSO4), (3) Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD), and (4) Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease with magnesium sulfate (PD/MgSO4). The apomorphine-induced (APO) rotation test assessed the success of the PD models. The open-field experiment measured the rats&amp;amp;rsquo; anxiety levels. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and glutamate levels, indicators of dopamine neuron survival, were detected using immunofluorescence staining. Protein levels of solute carrier family 41 A1 (SCL41A1), magnesium transporter 1 (MagT1), and cyclin M2 (CNNM2) in the retina were analyzed using Western blot. Results showed that, compared to the PD group, rats in the PD/MgSO4 group had improved psychological states and motor performance at two and four weeks post-surgery. The PD/MgSO4 group also exhibited significantly higher TH fluorescence intensity in the left retinas and lower glutamate fluorescence intensity than the PD group. Additional experiments indicated that the protein levels of SLC41A1, MagT1, and CNNM2 were generally higher in the retinas of the PD/MgSO4 group, along with an increase in retinal magnesium ion content. This suggests that magnesium sulfate may reduce glutamate levels and protect dopamine neurons in the retina. Thus, magnesium sulfate might have therapeutic potential for visual functional impairments in PD patients.</p>

	<p>This study examines the feasibility of using event-related potentials (ERPs) obtained from electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings as biomarkers for long-term memory item classification. Previous studies have identified old/new effects in memory paradigms associated with explicit long-term memory and familiarity. Recent advancements in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have enabled the classification of ERP trials under different conditions and the identification of features related to neural processes at the single-trial level. We employed this approach to compare three CNN models with distinct architectures using experimental data. Participants (N = 25) performed an association memory task while recording ERPs that were used for training and validation of the CNN models. The EEGNET-based model achieved the most reliable performance in terms of precision, recall, and specificity compared with the shallow and deep convolutional approaches. The classification accuracy of this model reached 62% for known items and 66% for unknown items. Good overall accuracy requires a trade-off between recall and specificity and depends on the architecture of the model and the dataset size. These results suggest the possibility of integrating ERP and CNN into online learning tools and identifying the underlying processes related to long-term memorization.</p>

	<p>Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) is the most common four-repeat tauopathy. PSP cases are typically characterized by vertical gaze palsy and postural instability; however, various phenotypes have been reported, making antemortem diagnosis based on clinical symptoms challenging. The development of biomarkers reflecting brain pathology and the ability to diagnose patients based on these biomarkers are essential for developing future intervention strategies, including disease-modifying therapies. However, despite many dedicated efforts, no highly specific fluid biomarker for PSP has yet been established. Conversely, several cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease (AD) have been established, and an AT(N) classification system has been proposed. Typically, among patients with AD, CSF amyloid &amp;amp;beta;42 (A&amp;amp;beta;42), but not A&amp;amp;beta;40, is decreased, resulting in a reduction in the A&amp;amp;beta;42/A&amp;amp;beta;40 ratio, while tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau181) and total tau (t-tau) are increased. Interestingly, the core CSF AD biomarkers show unique patterns in patients with PSP. Furthermore, reports have indicated that the CSF levels of both A&amp;amp;beta;42 and A&amp;amp;beta;40 are decreased independently of A&amp;amp;beta; accumulation in PSP. Therefore, the A&amp;amp;beta;42/A&amp;amp;beta;40 ratio could potentially be used to differentiate PSP from AD. Additionally, studies have reported that CSF p-tau and t-tau are reduced in PSP, and that the neurofilament light chain is remarkably increased compared to healthy controls and patients with AD, even though PSP is a neurodegenerative disease associated with tau accumulation. These PSP-specific changes in AD-related core biomarkers may reflect the pathology of PSP and contribute to its diagnosis. As such, elucidating the mechanisms underlying the observed decreases in A&amp;amp;beta; and tau levels could facilitate a better understanding of the pathogenesis of PSP.</p>

	<p>The presence of anxiety in individuals with epilepsy significantly influences their medical treatment and quality of life and often goes unrecognized or untreated, posing a challenge to differential diagnosis. The study aimed to investigate the influence of epilepsy characteristics on anxiety. The research involved 155 patients with generalized and focal drug-sensitive [DSE] and drug-resistant [DRE] epilepsy. Hamilton anxiety rating scale [HAS] was used to assess the symptoms of anxiety at three time points [baseline, 12, and 18 months]. DSE patients exhibited significantly lower HAM-A scores than patients with DRE at the initial visit [p = 0.000] after 12 [p = 0.000] and 18-month follow-up [p = 0.000]. Focal DRE patients presented higher HAM-A scores than focal DSE patients in the initial visit [p = 0.000] after 12 [p = 0.000] and 18 months [p = 0.000]. Medication responsiveness, seizure type, and illness duration emerged as significant anxiety predictors [p = 0.000]. After 18 months of follow-up, significant contributors to anxiety were drug responsivity and illness duration [p = 0.000]. The occurrence of anxiety in epilepsy patients is most significantly influenced by well-controlled epilepsy and a positive response to medication.</p>

	<p>Auditory steady-state response (ASSR) is the result of the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s ability to follow and entrain its oscillatory activity to the phase and frequency of periodic auditory stimulation. Gamma-band ASSR has been increasingly investigated with intentions to apply it in neuropsychiatric disorders diagnosis as well as in brain&amp;amp;ndash;computer interface technologies. However, it is still debatable whether attention can influence ASSR, as the results of the attention effects of ASSR are equivocal. In our study, we aimed to systemically review all known articles related to the attentional modulation of gamma-band ASSRs. The initial literature search resulted in 1283 papers. After the removal of duplicates and ineligible articles, 49 original studies were included in the final analysis. Most analyzed studies demonstrated ASSR modulation with differing attention levels; however, studies providing mixed or non-significant results were also identified. The high versatility of methodological approaches including the utilized stimulus type and ASSR recording modality, as well as tasks employed to modulate attention, were detected and emphasized as the main causality of result inconsistencies across studies. Also, the impact of training, inter-individual variability, and time of focus was addressed.</p>

	<p>This work aims to shed light on the differential diagnosis of complex post-traumatic stress disorder (cPTSD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and borderline personality disorder (BPD) within the context of intimate partner violence (IPV), which represents a highly innovative field of clinical research. To this end, a critical review of the literature was conducted to identify and compare the clinical patterns and symptomatic overlaps among cPTSD, PTSD, and BPD, with an emphasis on their manifestation in both IPV victims and offenders. The results show that despite some symptomatic similarities, cPTSD, PTSD, and BPD have distinct clinical patterns of interpersonal violence. Specifically, disturbances in self-organization (DSO) are more commonly found in offenders, while the diagnosis of cPTSD seems more aligned with the psychological functioning of victims. In addition, cPTSD and specific characteristics of BPD, such as fear of rejection and instability of identity, constitute risk factors for IPV victimization. cPTSD is shown as a predisposing factor not only for IPV victims but also for offenders, while PTSD emerges as a consequential factor. The specific pathways linking PTSD, cPTSD, and BPD with IPV have significant implications for clinical practice. Further research is needed to understand these profiles and the mechanisms linking trauma-related features to IPV, which is crucial for implementing effective violence prevention programs.</p>

	<p>Tobacco consumption in schizophrenia (SCHZ) patients is highly prevalent. Data support the occurrence of sequential events during comorbidity establishment, and both smoking first, SCHZ second and SCHZ first, smoking second sequences have been proposed. To investigate whether these two possibilities lead to distinct outcomes of comorbidity, we used a phencyclidine-induced SCHZ model and nicotine exposure as a surrogate of smoking. C57Bl/6 mice were submitted to a protocol that either began with 4 days of phencyclidine exposure or 4 days of nicotine exposure. This period was followed by 5 days of combined phencyclidine + nicotine exposure. Locomotor sensitization and pre-pulse inhibition (PPI) were assessed due to their well-known associations with SCHZ as opposed to rearing, an unrelated behavior. Nicotine priming potentiated phencyclidine-evoked sensitization. However, nicotine exposure after SCHZ modeling did not interfere with phencyclidine&amp;amp;rsquo;s effects. In the PPI test, nicotine after SCHZ modeling worsened the phencyclidine-evoked deficiency in males. In contrast, nicotine priming had no effects. Regarding rearing, nicotine priming failed to interfere with phencyclidine-mediated inhibition. Similarly, phencyclidine priming did not modify nicotine-mediated inhibition. The present results indicate that the sequence, either SCHZ-first or nicotine-first, differentially impacts comorbidity outcomes, a finding that is relevant for the identification of mechanisms of nicotine interference in the neurobiology of SCHZ.</p>

	<p>Over the past 20 years, there has been a growing interest in the processing of tool objects, and in the spatial S-R correspondence effects obtained with pictures of manipulable objects. Beyond the original affordance activation account, a location coding account has been proposed for such behavioral effects, which states that the location of the visually salient portion of an object speeds up spatially aligned motor responses and slows down misaligned ones. Furthermore, an additional action coding account has been proposed, according to which it is the direction of the action of the perceived object (e.g., &amp;amp;ldquo;pouring tea leftward&amp;amp;rdquo; when the spout of a teapot is leftward-oriented) that biases motor performance. We investigated this action coding account of S-R correspondence effects by comparing the reaction time (RT) performance of two groups: younger (6 to 9 years old) and older (10 to 13 years old) children. We assumed that knowledge of tool objects and the activation of action codes from object perception is proportional to age. Therefore, a larger correspondence effect was hypothesized for the older relative to the younger children&amp;amp;rsquo;s group. Consistently, a 34 ms correspondence effect was observed in the older children relative to the younger ones (18 ms). The results support the view that action direction is a constitutive feature of tool objects, which is subject to experience, and thus, to increasing knowledge over time.</p>

	<p>Ideomotor apraxia is a cognitive disorder most often resulting from acquired brain lesions (i.e., strokes or tumors). Neuroimaging and lesion studies have implicated several brain regions in praxis and apraxia, but most studies have described (sub)acute patients. This study aimed to extend previous research by analyzing data from 115 left hemisphere chronic stroke patients using the praxis subtest of the Western Aphasia Battery, which is divided into four action types: facial, upper limb, complex, and instrumental. Lesion&amp;amp;ndash;symptom mapping was used to identify brain regions most critically associated with difficulties in each of the four subtests. Complex and instrumental action deficits were associated with left precentral, postcentral, and superior parietal gyri (Brodmann areas 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6), while the facial and upper limb action deficits maps were restricted to left inferior, middle, and medial temporal gyri (Brodmann areas 20, 21, 22, and 48). We discuss ideas about neuroplasticity and cortical reorganization in chronic stroke and how different methodologies can reveal different aspects of lesion and recovery networks in apraxia.</p>

                Background There is no doubt that vaccination is crucial for preventing the spread of diseases; however, not every vaccine is perfect or will work for everyone. The main objective of this work is to predict which vaccine will be most effective for a candidate without causing severe adverse reactions and to categorize a patient as potentially at high risk of death from the COVID-19 vaccine. Methods A comprehensive analysis was conducted using a dataset on COVID-19 vaccine adverse reactions, exploring binary and multiclass classification scenarios. Ensemble models, including Random Forest, Decision Tree, Light Gradient Boosting, and extreme gradient boosting algorithm, were utilized to achieve accurate predictions. Class balancing techniques like SMOTE, TOMEK_LINK, and SMOTETOMEK were incorporated to enhance model performance. Results The study revealed that pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, history of allergies, prior vaccinations, other medications, age, and gender were crucial factors associated with poor outcomes. Moreover, using medical history, the ensemble learning classifiers achieved accuracy scores ranging from 75% to 87% in predicting the vaccine type and mortality possibility. The Random Forest model emerged as the best prediction model, while the implementation of the SMOTE and SMOTETOMEK methods generally improved model performance. Conclusion The random forest model emerges as the top recommendation for machine learning tasks that require high accuracy and resilience. Moreover, the findings highlight the critical role of medical history in optimizing vaccine outcomes and minimizing adverse reactions.

                This work is an application of experimental temperature data previously collected in a residential building in Douala, Cameroon, in order to analyze thermal discomfort. The data was collected according to three occupancy scenarios over 12 month period using thermohygrometer sensors. The temperature data are analysed in comparison with the comfortable temperature range from 24°C to 28°C. The degree hour (DH) method was used to assess the severity of thermal discomfort in a hot and humid climate. The results reveal that the open C1, closed C2 and inhabited C3 rooms corresponding to scenarios C1, C2 and C3 respectively, have 7270.6°H, 9063.9°H and 10023°H. The inhabited room C3 has the largest DH and although the room C1 has the smallest DH, the latter largely exceeded the tolerable limit value of 1250°H set by the RE2020 Environmental Regulations. Results from this work can serve in building modelling for researchers and architects to act for the alleviation of thermal discomfort in regions with hot and humid climate.

                Background As graph datasets—including social networks, supply chains, and bioinformatics data—grow in size and complexity, researchers are driven to search for solutions enhancing model efficiency and speed. One avenue that may provide a solution is Quantum Graph Learning (QGL), a subfield of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) that applies machine learning inspired or powered by quantum computing to graph learning tasks. Methods We reevaluate Quantum Feature Embeddings (QFE), a QGL methodology published by Xu et al. earlier this year. QFE uses Variational Quantum Circuits to preprocess node features and then sends them to a classical Graph Neural Network (GNN), with the goal of increasing performance and/or decreasing total model size. Xu et al. evaluated this methodology by comparing its performance with the performance of variously-sized classical models on the benchmark datasets PROTEINS and ENZYMES, and they report success. Our core methodology and learning task remain unchanged. However, we have made several changes to the experimental design that enhance the rigor of the study: 1) we include the testing of models with no embedder; 2) we conduct a thorough hyperparameter search using a state-of-the-art optimization algorithm; and 3) we conduct stratified five-fold cross-validation, which mitigates the bias produced by our small datasets and provides multiple test statistics from which we can calculate a confidence interval. Results We produce classical models that perform comparably to QFE and significantly outperform the small classical models used in Xu et al.’s comparison. Notably, many of our classical models achieve this using fewer parameters than the QFE models we trained. Xu et al. do not report their total model sizes. Conclusion Our study sheds doubt on the efficacy of QFE by demonstrating that small, well-tuned classical models can perform just as well as QFE, highlighting the importance of hyperparameter tuning and rigorous experimental design.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-960/v1?src=rss">Identifying factors influencing faculty attitude towards digital technology in higher education and its impact on faculty engagement and work performance: a mediating analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background This study investigated the influence of various factors on Faculty Attitude, Faculty Engagement, and Work Performance in higher education. The study specifically examined the impact of faculty attitudes towards digital technology on their level of involvement and effectiveness in the classroom. Furthermore, it investigated how the utilization of digital technology by faculty members influences the connection between their attitudes and job performance. Methods The study utilized a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative and qualitative methodologies to collect thorough data to explore the factors influencing faculty attitude. A survey was performed among 438 faculty members from higher educational institutions in the Delhi and NCR region. Results The results indicated a strong positive relationship of perceived usefulness, mutual learning, institutional support, collaborativeness, creativity, critical thinking, and faculty attitude towards digital technology adoption in academic setting. Nevertheless, External Pressure did not exhibit a significant relationship. The study revealed that the attitude of faculty members has a significant impact on both their work performance and engagement. Additionally, faculty engagement was found to have a positive impact on work performance. The mediation Analysis revealed that Faculty Engagement served as a partial mediator in the association between Faculty Attitude and Work Performance. Conclusions The study’s implications underscore the urgent need of fostering positive attitudes and engagement among faculty members for enhancing their performance in academic settings. Some of the limitations and implication of the study and future direction of the research directions are suggested.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012361">aiSEGcell: User-friendly deep learning-based segmentation of nuclei in transmitted light images</a></h4>

Segmentation is required to quantify cellular structures in microscopic images. This typically requires their fluorescent labeling. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can detect these structures also in only transmitted light images. This eliminates the need for transgenic or dye fluorescent labeling, frees up imaging channels, reduces phototoxicity and speeds up imaging. However, this approach currently requires optimized experimental conditions and computational specialists. Here, we introduce “aiSEGcell” a user-friendly CNN-based software to segment nuclei and cells in bright field images. We extensively evaluated it for nucleus segmentation in different primary cell types in 2D cultures from different imaging modalities in hand-curated published and novel imaging data sets. We provide this curated ground-truth data with 1.1 million nuclei in 20,000 images. aiSEGcell accurately segments nuclei from even challenging bright field images, very similar to manual segmentation. It retains biologically relevant information, e.g. for demanding quantification of noisy biosensors reporting signaling pathway activity dynamics. aiSEGcell is readily adaptable to new use cases with only 32 images required for retraining. aiSEGcell is accessible through both a command line, and a napari graphical user interface. It is agnostic to computational environments and does not require user expert coding experience.

                <p>by Bjarke Haldrup Pedersen, Filipa Bica Simões, Ivan Pogrebnyakov, Martin Welch, Helle Krogh Johansen, Søren Molin, Ruggero La Rosa</p>

Metabolism provides the foundation for all cellular functions. During persistent infections, in adapted pathogenic bacteria metabolism functions radically differently compared with more naïve strains. Whether this is simply a necessary accommodation to the persistence phenotype or if metabolism plays a direct role in achieving persistence in the host is still unclear. Here, we characterize a convergent shift in metabolic function(s) linked with the persistence phenotype during <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> colonization in the airways of people with cystic fibrosis. We show that clinically relevant mutations in the key metabolic enzyme, pyruvate dehydrogenase, lead to a host-specialized metabolism together with a lower virulence and immune response recruitment. These changes in infection phenotype are mediated by impaired type III secretion system activity and by secretion of the antioxidant metabolite, pyruvate, respectively. Our results show how metabolic adaptations directly impinge on persistence and pathogenicity in this organism.

                <p>by Juan Du, Weiqiang Liu, Meng Li, Zihao Li, Xuanjing Li, Yichen Dai, Gaoming Liu, Xiao Wang, Pingfen Zhu, Vadim N. Gladyshev, Xuming Zhou</p>

The naked mole rat (NMR), <i>Heterocephalus glaber</i>, is known as the longest-lived rodent and is extraordinarily resistant to hypoxia and cancer. Here, both NMR embryonic fibroblasts (NEFs) and their mouse counterparts (MEFs) were subjected to anoxic conditions (0% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>). A combination of comparative transcriptomics and proteomics was then employed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Notably, we observed distinct levels of histone H1.2 (encoded by <i>HIST1H1C</i>) accumulation between NEFs and MEFs. Subsequent mechanistic analyses showed that higher H1.2 expression in NEFs was associated with the lower expression of its inhibitor, <i>PARP1</i>. Additionally, we discovered that H1.2 can directly interact with HIF-1α PAS domains, thereby promoting the expression of HIF-1α through facilitating the dimerization with HIF-1β. The overexpression of H1.2 was also found to trigger autophagy and to suppress the migration of cancer cells, as well as the formation of xenograft tumors, via the NRF2/P62 signaling pathway. Moreover, an engineered H1.2 knock-in mouse model exhibited significantly extended survival in hypoxic conditions (4% O<sub>2</sub>) and showed a reduced rate of tumor formation. Collectively, our results indicate a potential mechanistic link between H1.2 and the dual phenomena of anoxic adaptation and cancer resistance.

                <p>by Tea Kohlbrenner, Simon Berger, Ana Cristina Laranjeira, Tinri Aegerter-Wilmsen, Laura Filomena Comi, Andrew deMello, Alex Hajnal</p>

Germ cell apoptosis in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> hermaphrodites is a physiological process eliminating around 60% of all cells in meiotic prophase to maintain tissue homeostasis. In contrast to programmed cell death in the <i>C</i>. <i>elegans</i> soma, the selection of germ cells undergoing apoptosis is stochastic. By live-tracking individual germ cells at the pachytene stage, we found that germ cells smaller than their neighbors are selectively eliminated through apoptosis before differentiating into oocytes. Thus, cell size is a strong predictor of physiological germ cell death. The RAS/MAPK and ECT/RHO/ROCK pathways together regulate germ cell size by controlling actomyosin constriction at the apical rachis bridges, which are cellular openings connecting the syncytial germ cells to a shared cytoplasmic core. Enhancing apical constriction reduces germ cell size and increases the rate of cell death while inhibiting the actomyosin network in the germ cells prevents their death. We propose that actomyosin contractility at the rachis bridges of the syncytial germ cells amplifies intrinsic disparities in cell size. Through this mechanism, the animals can adjust the balance between physiological germ cell death and oocyte differentiation.

                Introduction Neuroinflammase, a key mechanism in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer and Parkinson, is influenced by statin, a lipid-binding protein. Studies show that statin can mitigate the likelihood of developing dementia and Alzheimer’s disease and can also reduce leukocytosis and T-regulatory function. Nevertheless, there is restricted literature on the use of statin in neuroinflammation. The objective of this investigation is to conduct a bibliometric analysis of statin use in neuroinflammation, providing valuable insights into research development and future research questions. Methods In this work, a literature review methodology is employed to gather data from the Scopus database using the keywords neuroinflammation and statins. Data were analyzed using Biblioshiny and VOSviewer software to produce visualizations and bibliometric maps. We conducted quantitative and qualitative analysis. Results The research trend found are Documents by Year, Most Global Cited Document, Most Relevant Sources, Factorial Map Of The Documents With The Highest Contributes, Documents by Author, Most Relevant Affiliations, Documents by Subject Area, Trend Topic, Network Visualization, Overlay visualization of scopus, database using Vosviewer, Density Visualization, Thematic Map, Thematic Evolution, Cluster Analysis, Qualitative Analysis, and Word Cloud. Conclusions The study highlights the potential for further research on statins and neuroinflammation, aiming to better understand their role in treating neuroinflammation and enhance the quality of life for patients with neuroinflammatory conditions.

                Background Trade openness shows a positive impact on economic growth, supported by economic theory, and export diversification and economic complexity show a positive dynamic in trade openness in the world; however, a specificity is generated in South American countries. Therefore, the objective of the research is to analyse the macroeconomic determinants of trade openness in Latin American countries. Methods The research approach was quantitative and explanatory using panel data methodology from the databases of the World Bank, Harvard University and the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean for the period 2000-2020. Results The fixed effects panel data model showed that the variables that had a negative impact on trade openness were GDP, the economic complexity index and the logistic performance index, while the variables that had a positive impact were exports of high-tech products (a proxy for innovation), exports, imports, research and development expenditure and interregional trade in goods. Conclusions Therefore, during the analysis period of 2000-2020 in South America, based on the panel data analysis under fixed effects, a total of 8 countries had a negative impact on trade openness, and only the economies of Chile, French Guiana, and Brazil had a positive impact on trade openness; these economies are characterized by their better performance in the economic complexity index, their higher percentage of budget for research and development expenses, and their trade policies oriented towards the industrialization of their value-added products.

                Where did Ecuador’s foreign debt originate and grow to alarming levels? The purpose of this article is to describe, from an analytical perspective based on the contributions of various authors, the origin of Ecuador’s external debt with international institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, as well as the support that these organizations provide for the development of the countries of the South, case Ecuador. To achieve this purpose, a documentary methodology was implemented that included an exhaustive review of studies focused on the specific variables subject to analysis, the PRISMA tool and Atlas.ti 23 were used. The results show that the creation of these financing agencies in their attempt to support the financial stability of developing countries has not been sufficiently effective in improving the welfare conditions of a good percentage of the population and has generated an imbalance in the sustained development of the poorest countries. It is concluded that the capitalist system gives predominant priority to the economic growth of nations, thus relegating in its model the consideration of human development. This orientation does not contribute effectively to the improvement of crucial aspects such: education, health and the standard of living of the population.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Neurofilament light chains (NfL) and phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chains (pNfH), established as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in hospital-based amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) cohorts, are now surrogate markers in clinical trials. This study extends their evaluation to a population level, with the aim of advancing their full establishment and assessing the transferability of biomarker findings from controlled cohorts to real-world ALS populations.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We measured serum NfL and pNfH levels in all ALS patients (n = 790) and general population controls (n = 570) with available baseline samples participating in the epidemiological ALS Registry Swabia, providing platform-specific (ELLA™) reference data and Z-scores for controls, as well as reference data, disease-specific Z-scores and longitudinal data in ALS. We evaluated the diagnostic and prognostic utility of neurofilaments and quantified the impact of ALS-related factors and non-ALS confounders.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Neurofilaments showed high diagnostic and prognostic utility at the population level, with NfL superior to pNfH. The novel concept of a population-based ALS Z-score significantly improved the prognostic utility compared to absolute raw values. Both biomarkers increased more strongly with age in controls than in ALS, and age adjustment improved diagnostic accuracy. Our data show that disease progression rates, ALS phenotype, body mass index (BMI), and renal function need to be considered when interpreting neurofilament levels; longitudinal neurofilament levels were generally stable in individual patients, especially when adjusted for age and baseline levels.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Population-based assessment enhances the utility of particularly serum NfL as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in ALS and improves the translation of findings from controlled cohorts to real-world populations. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Background Environmental enteropathy (EE) is a highly prevalent subclinical inflammatory intestinal disorder associated with growth failure, impaired neurocognitive development, poor response to oral vaccines, and micronutrient deficiencies. However, EE research and clinical trials are hampered by the lack of non-invasive tools for measuring intestinal function in detail. This study aims to develop new tools for the measurement of multiple domains of gut functional capacity. Methods The GI TOOLS project is a cross-sectional study that will recruit adults aged 18-65 years with EE in Lusaka, Zambia. Each participant will undergo assessment of gut functional capacity using novel near-point-of-care tools and provide multiple samples for detailed laboratory analyses. Participants will also undergo endoscopy for collection of duodenal biopsies. Novel techniques include stable isotopes approaches to measuring digestion, absorption, and bidirectional transmucosal amino acid flux, a non-invasive fluorescence tool for real-time evaluation of gut permeability, and assessment of reverse permeation of intravenous antibiotics to be carried out separately in Zimbabwe. Stool and duodenal microbiome sequencing using MinION sequencing, metabolome analysis applied to plasma and intestinal fluids, blood immune cell phenotyping, in vitro epithelial barrier models, and duodenal immunohistochemistry will also be used to explore EE in depth. These will all be integrated with gold standard histology and mucosal morphometry, alongside lactulose permeation data, and stool and plasma biomarker analysis. The protocol has been approved by ethics committees and regulators in Zambia, Zimbabwe, and the UK. Participants will give informed consent before they can participate Anticipated outcomes Based on this extensive phenotyping, tests will be developed which can be simplified and refined for use in adults and children with EE, and for clinical trials. Findings from this project will be disseminated through in-person meetings with caregivers and regulatory bodies, presentations at conferences and in peer-reviewed journals.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-955/v1?src=rss">Confirmatory Factor Analysis and Propensity to Cheat Scale Validation in the Ethiopian Public Higher Education Institutions [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background This study was primarily intended to develop and validate a comprehensive and psychometrically acceptable measure of students’ propensity to cheat (PTC) behavior among undergraduate students in Ethiopian universities by assessing their engagement in different types of cheating behavior. Methods The present study employed an explanatory research design using a questionnaire based on the Propensity to Cheat Scale (PCS). The questionnaire was administered to 500 university students (male = 367 [73.4%]; female = 133 [26.6%]) selected from three Ethiopian public universities between November and January 2022. In order to measure the underlying variables of propensity towards cheating, a factor model is developed using exploratory factor analysis, and confirmatory factor analysis was employed to validate the students’ perceived PTC. The internal consistency of the PTC scale was assessed using reliability analysis, and validity evaluations were conducted to confirm the scale’s discriminant and convergent validity. Results Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) results revealed a good fit to the data, and the internal consistency of the PCS was found to be strong, providing a reliable measure of students’ propensity for cheating. Validity evaluations, including discriminant validity and convergent validity, confirmed the validity of the scale. The average variance extracted (AVE) and composite reliability values also supported the scale’s convergent validity. The multidimensional concept of the PTC was supported by a four-factor solution consisting of 26 reliable and valid items. Conclusion The findings of the study demonstrate that the scale has also provided sufficient evidence of convergent and discriminant validity. By establishing discriminant and convergent validity, as well as reliability, through different validation procedures, the study has provided strong evidence for the effectiveness of the PCS as an instrument for determining whether university students are likely to engage in cheating behavior.

     alt="Electro-Clinical Features and Functional Connectivity Analysis in SYN1-Related Epilepsy"/>
<p>
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>There is currently scarce data on the electroclinical characteristics of epilepsy associated with synapsin 1 (<i>SYN1</i>) pathogenic variations. We examined clinical and electro-encephalographic (EEG) features in patients with epilepsy and <i>SYN1</i> variants, with the aim of identifying a distinctive electroclinical pattern.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this retrospective multicenter study, we collected and reviewed demographic, genetic, and epilepsy data of 19 male patients with <i>SYN1</i> variants. Specifically, we analyzed interictal EEG data for all patients, and electro-clinical data from 10 epileptic seizures in 5 patients, using prolonged video-EEG monitoring recordings. Inter-ictal EEG functional connectivity parameters and frequency spectrum of the 10 patients over 12 years of age, were computed and compared with those of 56 age- and sex-matched controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The main electroclinical features of epilepsy in patients with <i>SYN1</i> were (1) EEG background and organization mainly normal; (2) interictal abnormalities are often rare or not visible on EEG; (3) more than 60% of patients had reflex seizures (cutaneous contact with water and defecation being the main triggers) isolated or associated with spontaneous seizures; (4) electro-clinical semiology of seizures was mainly temporal or temporo-insulo/perisylvian with a notable autonomic component; and (5) ictal EEG showed a characteristic rhythmic theta/delta activity predominating in temporo-perisylvian regions at the beginning of most seizures. Comparing patients with <i>SYN1</i> to healthy subjects, we observed a shift to lower frequency bands in power spectrum of interictal EEG and an increased connectivity in both temporal regions.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>A distinct epilepsy syndrome emerges in patients with <i>SYN1</i>, with a rather characteristic clinical and EEG pattern suggesting predominant temporo-insular involvement. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-954/v1?src=rss">Perspectives and guidance for developing artificial intelligence-based applications for healthcare using medical images [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Artificial intelligence (AI) has significant potential to transform healthcare and improve patient care. However, successful development and integration of AI models requires careful consideration of study designs and sample size calculations for development and validation of models, publishing standards, prototype development for translation and collaboration with stakeholders. As the field is relatively new and rapidly evolving there is a lack of guidance and agreement on best practices for most of these steps. We engaged stakeholders in the form of clinicians, researchers from academia and industry, and data scientists to discuss various aspects of the translational pipeline and identified the challenges researchers in the field face and potential solutions to them. In this viewpoint, we present the summary of our discussions as a brief guide on the process of developing AI-based applications for healthcare using medical images. We organized the entire process into six major themes (i.e., The gaps AI can fill in healthcare, Development of AI models for healthcare: practical and important things to consider, Good practices for validation of AI models for healthcare: study designs and sample size calculation, Points to consider when publishing AI models, Translation towards products, Challenges and potential solutions from a technical perspective) and presented important points as a rule of thumb. We conclude that successful integration of AI in healthcare requires a collaborative approach, rigorous validation, adherence to best practices as described and cited, and consideration of technical aspects.

                Background Sonneratia caseolaris, known as the red pidada, has been widely utilized by the Indonesian. S. caseolaris leaves contain various active compounds, contributing to their popularity in the treatment of various diseases. Mangrove leaves are also known to exhibit very high antioxidant activity. This study aims to assess the antioxidant activity of S . caseolaris leaves extracted using different solvents. The resulting extract was evaluated for antioxidant activity by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity (DPPH) techniques. Methods Analysis of total flavonoids, total phenols, identification of active compounds with Liquid Chromatography High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (LC-HRMS), and bioinformatics were also carried out to obtain temporary conclusions about the antioxidant activity of S. caseolaris leaf extract. Results The results indicated that S. caseolaris leaves extracted with methanol and distilled water exhibited the highest antioxidant activity compared to other extracts. The analysis of total flavonoids and total phenols yielded results consistent with the antioxidant activity tests. LC-HRMS results identified three compounds in all S. caseolaris leaf extracts with antioxidant activity, namely Tempo, Choline, and Betaine. Tempo demonstrated a higher antioxidant activity than Choline and Betaine, as indicated by the binding affinity values in the bioinformatics analysis. Conclusions It is evident that S. caseolaris leaf extract has the potential to serve as an effective an antioxidant agent. Further research is needed to elucidate confirm the potential compounds in Sonneratia caseolaris leaves water extract interact with the target protein Keap1. S. caseolaris, in order to utilize them as active components in food and enhance antioxidant consumption among consumers.

                Purpose The current cadaveric report describes the abnormal origin and course of testicular arteries (TAs) in two donated cadavers, along with a renal artery (RA) duplication. Methods Dissection of the inferior vena cava (IVC) and the abdominal aorta (AA) branching patterns were performed in 90-year-old- and 76-year-old formalin-embalmed donated male cadavers. Results Variants of the TA origin and course were identified, as coexisting with RA variants. Case 1: A right-sided RA (RRA) duplication (recorded as superior and inferior renal artery-SRA and IRA) with origin from the AA, coexisted with a right TA (RTA) that originated from the IRA and descended anteriorly to the ureter. The left TA (LTA) originated from the AA proximal to the origin of the left RA (LRA). The LTA coursed in front of the common drainage of the left testicular and renal vein into the IVC. Case 2: A bilateral RA duplication was identified and recorded as SRA and IRA. The right-sided SRA originated from the AA upper level and played the role of the accessory RA (ARA). The main perfusion of the right kidney was performed by the IRA which was further trifurcated into a superior polar, an inferior polar (IPA), and a TA. The RTA had a high origin from the IPA. Conclusion The current study reported two cases of TAs with abnormal origin and course accompanied by an RA duplication. A thorough knowledge of the origin and course of the TAs has clinical implications for the kidneys and testicle’ surgery.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-69/v3?src=rss">What can we experience and report on a rapidly presented image? Intersubjective measures of specificity of freely reported contents of consciousness [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: A majority of previous studies appear to support a view that human observers can only perceive coarse information from a natural scene image when it is presented rapidly (<100ms, masked). In these studies, participants were often forced to choose an answer from options that experimenters preselected. These options can underestimate what participants experience and can report on it. The current study aims to introduce a novel methodology to investigate how detailed information participants can report after briefly seeing a natural scene image. Methods: We used a novel free-report paradigm to examine what people can freely report following a rapidly presented natural scene image (67/133/267ms, masked). N = 670 online participants typed up to five words to report what they saw in the image together with confidence of the respective responses. We developed a novel index, Intersubjective Agreement (IA). IA quantifies how specifically the response words were used to describe the target image, with a high value meaning the word is not often reported for other images. Importantly, IA eliminates the need for experimenters to preselect response options. Results: The words with high IA values are often something detailed (e.g., a small object) in a particular image. With IA, unlike commonly believed, we demonstrated that participants reported highly specific and detailed aspects of the briefly (even at 67ms, masked) shown image. Further, IA is positively correlated with confidence, indicating metacognitive conscious access to the reported aspects of the image. Conclusion: These new findings challenge the dominant view that the content of rapid scene experience is limited to global and coarse gist. Our novel paradigm opens a door to investigate various contents of consciousness with a free-report paradigm.

                Background With the rapid aging of the population, increasing life satisfaction among older adults is essential. Negative perceptions of older adults are internalized, leading to poor mental health. This study hypothesized that participants with more negative perceptions of older adults would have lower life satisfaction. Methods A cross-sectional survey of older adults was conducted across five wards and four cities in Tokyo, Japan. Participants responded to questions regarding demographics, life satisfaction, and negative perceptions of older adults. Data from 285 participants (264 women, M = 71.97 years) were analyzed. Results The intraclass correlation coefficient for life satisfaction concerning residential areas was. 03 (95% confidence interval [CI] = [-.03, .10]). Instead of multilevel models, a multiple regression model with life satisfaction as the dependent variable and negative perceptions of older adults and demographics as the independent variables yielded the best fit. Results indicated that participants with more negative perceptions of older adults reported lower life satisfaction (β = -.16, 95% CI = [-.28, -.04], p = .008), supporting our hypothesis. Conclusions This study was constrained by limited variance in residential areas and a predominantly female participant pool. Previous studies have shown that higher life satisfaction is associated with increased social participation and extended life expectancy, and interventions aimed at enhancing life satisfaction in older adults are significant. Further exploration is warranted to ascertain whether a causal relationship exists, wherein more negative perceptions of older adults diminish life satisfaction.

                The acceptance rate towards COVID-19 vaccination among the global population could be higher due to the need for more education or awareness of prevention strategies to control the COVID-19 outbreak. Thus, there is a dire need to reduce the population’s reluctance towards COVID-19 vaccination across the globe, which will ultimately lead to the implementation of prevention and control strategies against the COVID-19 virus and improving health outcomes across the globe. The following study intends to conduct a systematic review of the literature to evaluate the relationship between COVID-19 vaccination and the current trends related to COVID-19 vaccination faced by the global population. The methodology employed in this study primarily focused on assessing secondary data by conducting a systematic literature review. Internet and electronic databases were used to select research articles to obtain secondary sources. Six articles were selected from ScienceDirect and Google Scholar for a systematic literature review. The keywords used for the selection of articles were “COVID-19,” “Global trends,” Reluctance, “and “vaccination.” The selected articles that were most suitable for the topic consisted of global trends related to COVID-19 vaccination. Six articles relevant to the topic were selected and reviewed. The selected articles showed data collection results from different research journals. The findings of the six research articles depicted common themes, such as each vaccine having a different level of access attitude towards the regional existence, which primarily depends on the variability to determine the vaccine’s effectiveness. Further studies are required to evaluate the factors and strategies that help healthcare organizations and governments reduce the reluctance to use the COVID-19 vaccine among populations worldwide.

                Dysregulation of RNA processing contributes to multiple neurodegenerative diseases. In this article, Wu et al. demonstrated that nuclear speckle dysfunction represents a converging toxic pathway contributed by both (GGGGCC)n repeat RNA and the noncanonical translation product poly-GR in C9ORF72-FTD/ALS. Impaired nuclear speckle integrity induces RNA mis-splicing and causes neuronal degeneration.

                The exon junction complex (EJC) is critical for the mRNA life cycle in eukaryotic cells. Alsina et al. report that the nucleating component of this complex, EIF4A3, acts non-canonically as a microtubule-binding protein in neurons to regulate axonal growth.

                Lingamallu et al. demonstrate that club cells (CCs), facultative stem cells of the lower airways, are maintained by canonical Notch signaling. Most CCs, excluding a subpopulation at NEBs and terminal bronchioles (v-CCs), transdifferentiate into multiciliated cells upon Notch inhibition. v-CCs escape due to β-catenin activation and repair airways post Notch inhibition.

                Yasumizu et al. identify MG-specific features in thymoma and thymic hyperplasia using spatial transcriptomics. Combining single-cell RNA-seq and GWAS data, they find MG susceptibility enriched in the medulla region of thymoma, characterized by specific immune cells. These findings provide a foundation for future MG research.

                de Kivit et al. reveal discerning lipidomes of conventional T cells (Tconvs) versus thymus-derived regulatory T cells (tTreg). Effector tTregs can use either glucose or lactate to synthesize long and unsaturated fatty acids, on which they rely for proliferation and suppressive function. These tTreg-specific properties may be therapeutically exploited.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94407">Association with TFIIIC limits MYCN localisation in hubs of active promoters and chromatin accumulation of non-phosphorylated RNA polymerase II</a></h4>

              
                MYC family oncoproteins regulate the expression of a large number of genes and broadly stimulate elongation by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). While the factors that control the chromatin association of MYC proteins are well understood, much less is known about how interacting proteins mediate MYC’s effects on transcription. Here, we show that TFIIIC, an architectural protein complex that controls the three-dimensional chromatin organisation at its target sites, binds directly to the amino-terminal transcriptional regulatory domain of MYCN. Surprisingly, TFIIIC has no discernible role in MYCN-dependent gene expression and transcription elongation. Instead, MYCN and TFIIIC preferentially bind to promoters with paused RNAPII and globally limit the accumulation of non-phosphorylated RNAPII at promoters. Consistent with its ubiquitous role in transcription, MYCN broadly participates in hubs of active promoters. Depletion of TFIIIC further increases MYCN localisation to these hubs. This increase correlates with a failure of the nuclear exosome and BRCA1, both of which are involved in nascent RNA degradation, to localise to active promoters. Our data suggest that MYCN and TFIIIC exert an censoring function in early transcription that limits promoter accumulation of inactive RNAPII and facilitates promoter-proximal degradation of nascent RNA.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93062">The role of heterochronic gene expression and regulatory architecture in early developmental divergence</a></h4>

              
                New developmental programs can evolve through adaptive changes to gene expression. The annelid <i>Streblospio benedicti</i> has a developmental dimorphism, which provides a unique intraspecific framework for understanding the earliest genetic changes that take place during developmental divergence. Using comparative RNAseq through ontogeny, we find that only a small proportion of genes are differentially expressed at any time, despite major differences in larval development and life history. These genes shift expression profiles across morphs by either turning off any expression in one morph or changing the timing or amount of gene expression. We directly connect the contributions of these mechanisms to differences in developmental processes. We examine F<sub>1</sub> offspring – using reciprocal crosses – to determine maternal mRNA inheritance and the regulatory architecture of gene expression. These results highlight the importance of both novel gene expression and heterochronic shifts in developmental evolution, as well as the <i>trans</i>-acting regulatory factors in initiating divergence.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87880">Drosophila model to clarify the pathological significance of OPA1 in autosomal dominant optic atrophy</a></h4>

              
                Autosomal dominant optic atrophy (DOA) is a progressive form of blindness caused by degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and their axons, mainly caused by mutations in the OPA1 mitochondrial dynamin <i>like</i> GTPase (<i>OPA1</i>) gene. <i>OPA1</i> encodes a dynamin-like GTPase present in the mitochondrial inner membrane. When associated with OPA1 mutations, DOA can present not only ocular symptoms but also multi-organ symptoms (DOA plus). DOA plus often results from point mutations in the GTPase domain, which are assumed to have dominant-negative effects. However, the presence of mutations in the GTPase domain does not always result in DOA plus. Therefore, an experimental system to distinguish between DOA and DOA plus is needed. In this study, we found that loss-of-function mutations of the <i>dOPA1</i> gene in <i>Drosophila</i> can imitate the pathology of optic nerve degeneration observed in DOA. We successfully rescued this degeneration by expressing the human <i>OPA1</i> (<i>hOPA1</i>) gene, indicating that <i>hOPA1</i> is functionally interchangeable with <i>dOPA1</i> in the fly system. However, mutations previously identified did not ameliorate the <i>dOPA1</i> deficiency phenotype. By expressing both WT and DOA plus mutant <i>hOPA1</i> forms in the optic nerve of <i>dOPA1</i> mutants, we observed that DOA plus mutations suppressed the rescue, facilitating the distinction between loss-of-function and dominant-negative mutations in <i>hOPA1</i>. This fly model aids in distinguishing DOA from DOA plus and guides initial <i>hOPA1</i> mutation treatment strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/68404">Inhibitors of the small membrane (M) protein viroporin prevent Zika virus infection</a></h4>

              
                <i>Flaviviruses</i>, including Zika virus (ZIKV), are a significant global health concern, yet no licensed antivirals exist to treat disease. The small Membrane (M) protein plays well-defined roles during viral egress and remains within virion membranes following release and maturation. However, it is unclear whether M plays a functional role in this setting. Here, we show that M forms oligomeric membrane-permeabilising channels <i>in vitro</i>, with increased activity at acidic pH and sensitivity to the prototypic channel-blocker, rimantadine. Accordingly, rimantadine blocked an early stage of ZIKV cell culture infection. Structure-based channel models, comprising hexameric arrangements of two <i>trans</i>-membrane domain protomers were shown to comprise more stable assemblages than other oligomers using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Models contained a predicted lumenal rimantadine binding site, as well as a second druggable target region on the membrane-exposed periphery. <i>In silico</i> screening enriched for repurposed drugs/compounds predicted to bind to either one site or the other. Hits displayed superior potency <i>in vitro</i> and in cell culture compared with rimantadine, with efficacy demonstrably linked to virion-resident channels. Finally, rimantadine effectively blocked ZIKV viraemia in preclinical models, supporting that M constitutes a physiologically relevant target. This could be explored by repurposing rimantadine, or development of new M-targeted-therapies.

	<p>In neuropsychology and clinical psychology, the efficacy of virtual reality (VR) experiences for knowledge acquisition and the potential for modifying conduct are well documented. Consequently, the scope of VR experiences for educational purposes has expanded in the health field in recent years. In this study, we sought to assess the effectiveness of ViveDe in a psychoeducational caregiver program. ViveDe is a VR application that presents users with possible daily life situations from the perspective of individuals with dementia. These situations can be experienced in immersive mode through 360&amp;amp;deg; video. This research aimed to ascertain the associations between the sense of presence that can be achieved in VR and some users&amp;amp;rsquo; psychological characteristics, such as distress and empathetic disposition. The study involved 36 informal caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. These participants were assessed using scales of anxiety and depression, perceived stress, empathy, and emotional regulation. They were asked to participate in a six-session psychoeducation program conducted online on dementia topics, in addition to experiencing the ViveDe application. The immersive VR sessions enabled the caregivers to directly experience the symptoms of dementia (e.g., spatial disorientation, agnosia, difficulty in problem-solving, and anomia) in everyday and social settings. The results indicated that although the experience in ViveDe (evaluated using the XRPS scale and five questions about emotional attunement) showed efficacy in producing a sense of first-person participation in the symptoms of dementia, further research is needed to confirm this. The structural equation model provided evidence that the characteristics of individuals who enjoy the VR experience play a determining role in the perceived sense of presence, which in turn affects the efficacy of the VR experience as a psychoeducational tool. Further research will be conducted to ascertain the potential role of these elements in conveying change in the caregivers of people with dementia. This will help us study the long-term effectiveness of a large-scale psychoeducation program in VR.</p>

	<p>Musculoskeletal conditions often involve pain related to specific movements. However, most studies on the impact of experimental pain on motor performance and learning have used tonic pain models. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of experimental phasic pain during the preparation or execution of a reaching task on the acquisition and retention of sensorimotor adaptation. Participants were divided into three groups: no pain, pain during motor preparation, and pain during motor execution. Pain was induced over the scapula with a laser while participants performed a force field adaptation task over two days. To assess the effect of pain on motor performance, two baseline conditions (with or without pain) involving unperturbed pointing movements were also conducted. The results indicated that the timing of the nociceptive stimulus differently affected baseline movement performance. Pain during motor preparation shortened reaction time, while pain during movement execution decreased task performance. However, when these baseline effects were accounted for, no impact of pain on motor adaptation or retention was observed. All groups showed significant improvements in all motor variables for both adaptation and retention. In conclusion, while acute phasic pain during motor preparation or execution can affect the movement itself, it does not interfere with motor acquisition or retention during a motor adaptation task.</p>

	<p>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with inflammation and a high level of comorbidities. Atypical depression (AD) is a MDD subtype based on DSM criteria, that could have specific underlying biological mechanisms. AD is associated with elevated cardiovascular (CVD) comorbidities, higher risk of suicide attempts, hypersomnia, and anxiety disorder. In this study, we aim to investigate if AD and polysomnographic parameters could be associated with low-grade inflammation (LGI). LGI is defined by a range from 3 to 10 mg/L of C-reactive protein levels. We carried out a retrospective cohort study in which 765 individuals with MDD were split into two groups: with and without LGI. Our results exhibit differences between the groups for the polysomnographic parameters, with the LGI group showing parameters already associated with inflammation such as reduced rapid eye movement sleep and elevated hypoxemia markers (identified as CVD risk factor). We found that AD is associated with LGI (OR 1.48; p = 0.047) after adjustment. Likewise, we found an LGI prevalence in AD higher (34.8%) than in MDD without atypical features (26.8%). Overall, these results confirm the low-grade inflammation feature of AD and highlight polysomnographic parameters associated with LGI that could also act as risk factors in this context.</p>

	<p>Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is a severe complication following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), linked to poor functional outcomes and prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stays. Timely DCI diagnosis is crucial but remains challenging. Dysregulated blood glucose, commonly observed after aSAH, may impair the constant glucose supply that is vital for brain function, potentially contributing to DCI. This study aimed to assess whether glucose indices could help identify at-risk patients and improve DCI detection. This retrospective, single-center observational study examined 151 aSAH patients between 2016 and 2019. Additionally, 70 of these (46.4%) developed DCI and 81 did not (no-DCI). To determine the value of glycemic indices for DCI, they were analyzed separately in patients in the period before (pre-DCI) and after DCI (post-DCI). The time-weighted average glucose (TWAG, p = 0.024), mean blood glucose (p = 0.033), and novel time-unified dysglycemic rate (TUDR140, calculated as the ratio of dysglycemic to total periods within a glucose target range of 70&amp;amp;ndash;140 mg/dL, p = 0.042), showed significantly higher values in the pre-DCI period of the DCI group than in the no-DCI group. In the time-series analysis, significant increases in TWAG and TUDR140 were observed at the DCI onset. In conclusion, DCI patients showed elevated blood glucose levels before and a further increase at the DCI onset. Prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings, as this retrospective, single-center study cannot completely exclude confounders and limitations. In the future blood glucose indices might become valuable parameters in multiparametric models to identify patients at risk and detect DCI onset earlier.</p>

                Background Insufficient and above WHO-recommended levels of iodine intake during pregnancy can lead to serious health outcomes. This study aimed to assess median urine iodine concentration and its associated risk factors among pregnant women in the Mbeya region, Tanzania. Method A cross sectional survey involving 420 pregnant women (n=420) aged 15-49, registered in Reproductive and Child Health Clinics was conducted. Socio-demographic and dietary factors were assessed by structured questionnaire and the urine samples were analyzed using the ammonium persulfate digestion method. Results Median urinary iodine concentration (mUIC) was 279.4μg/L and it ranged from 26.1 to 1915μg/L. Insufficient mUIC (below 150μg/L) was observed in 17.14% of participants, sufficient mUIC was 24.29% and 58.57% had mUIC above the recommended level (>250μg/L). Sample women who reported consuming fish in the last 24 hours had an increased risk of insufficient mUIC [Adjusted OR= 2.60 (95%CI 1.31-5.15)] while the risk was lower for those who attended at least primary education [AOR= 0.29 (CI 0.08-0.99)]. Further, sample women resident in Mbarali district, in the oldest age group (35-49) and having a higher socio-economic status were associated with an increased risk of having MUIC above recommended level [AOR=4.09 (CI 1.85-9.010], [AOR=2.51 (CI 0.99-6.330] and, [AOR=2.08 (CI 0.91-4.71) respectively. Conclusion This study demonstrated a significant association between geographical, age and socio-economic factors and median urine iodine concentration above the WHO-recommended level. Further, this study found association between inadequate iodine in diet and insufficient median urine iodine concentration. Therefore, educational programs on iodine intake should be strengthened.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/12-350/v2?src=rss">In-depth assessment of Iraqi physicians' adherence to treatment guidelines for different diseases: a qualitative study [version 2; peer review: 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In healthcare settings, specialists from different fields may follow the most well-known, reliable, and easy-to-understand medical guidelines. This study aimed to determine Iraqi physicians’ adherence to treatment guidelines, to specify which treatment guidelines are utilized for each disease and identify their barriers to follow the guidelines. Methods: This was qualitative study including face-to-face and virtual semi-structured interviews with specialist physicians from different disciplines. The interviews were conducted between December 2021 and May 2022 in Kirkuk province, Iraq. The qualitative data generated through interviews was analyzed using thematic analysis. Result: The study recruited 48 specialists (27 male and 21 female) from seven medical specialties at two large government hospitals. Most physicians (38 /44) revealed that healthcare settings implement treatment guidelines in more than half of cases. American guideline was the most used among the participating physicians. European and British guidelines and textbooks were also used by some specialties. Unfortunately, most (43 out of 47) physicians were unaware of Iraqi treatment guideline. Most senior physicians often followed the same guidelines for one branch, with little variation in approach based on their experience and flexibility. Almost all participating physicians believed that shortages in treatment (46/47) and investigation/lab materials (45/47) and low patient adherence (44/47) are major barriers to implement the guideline(s). Six out of seven specialties experienced shortage in the essential medications that recommended by the guidelines Conclusions: Most physicians followed well-known international guidelines. Each specialty follows different guidelines relying on the disease. Medication shortage in the public hospitals was the main barrier facing physicians to implement treatment guidelines. Enhancing physician awareness of the Iraqi guidelines should be encouraged. Finally, securing essential medicines in public hospitals is pivotal to adopt evidence-based guidelines effectively.

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play vital roles in transcription and translation. Identification of circRNA-RBP (RNA-binding protein) interaction sites has become a fundamental step in molecular and cell biology. Deep learning (DL)-based methods have been proposed to predict circRNA-RBP interaction sites and achieved impressive identification performance. However, those methods cannot effectively capture long-distance dependencies, and cannot effectively utilize the interaction information of multiple features. To overcome those limitations, we propose a DL-based model iCRBP-LKHA using deep hybrid networks for identifying circRNA-RBP interaction sites. iCRBP-LKHA adopts five encoding schemes. Meanwhile, the neural network architecture, which consists of large kernel convolutional neural network (LKCNN), convolutional block attention module with one-dimensional convolution (CBAM-1D) and bidirectional gating recurrent unit (BiGRU), can explore local information, global context information and multiple features interaction information automatically. To verify the effectiveness of iCRBP-LKHA, we compared its performance with shallow learning algorithms on 37 circRNAs datasets and 37 circRNAs stringent datasets. And we compared its performance with state-of-the-art DL-based methods on 37 circRNAs datasets, 37 circRNAs stringent datasets and 31 linear RNAs datasets. The experimental results not only show that iCRBP-LKHA outperforms other competing methods, but also demonstrate the potential of this model in identifying other RNA-RBP interaction sites.

                <p>by Lucas Rudelt, Daniel González Marx, F. Paul Spitzner, Benjamin Cramer, Johannes Zierenberg, Viola Priesemann</p>

A core challenge for the brain is to process information across various timescales. This could be achieved by a hierarchical organization of temporal processing through intrinsic mechanisms (e.g., recurrent coupling or adaptation), but recent evidence from spike recordings of the rodent visual system seems to conflict with this hypothesis. Here, we used an optimized information-theoretic and classical autocorrelation analysis to show that information- and correlation timescales of spiking activity increase along the anatomical hierarchy of the mouse visual system under visual stimulation, while information-theoretic predictability decreases. Moreover, intrinsic timescales for spontaneous activity displayed a similar hierarchy, whereas the hierarchy of predictability was stimulus-dependent. We could reproduce these observations in a basic recurrent network model with correlated sensory input. Our findings suggest that the rodent visual system employs intrinsic mechanisms to achieve longer integration for higher cortical areas, while simultaneously reducing predictability for an efficient neural code.

                <p>by Zonglai Liang, Daniel Christiaan Dondorp, Marios Chatzigeorgiou</p>

During embryonic development, tissues and organs are gradually shaped into their functional morphologies through a series of spatiotemporally tightly orchestrated cell behaviors. A highly conserved organ shape across metazoans is the epithelial tube. Tube morphogenesis is a complex multistep process of carefully choreographed cell behaviors such as convergent extension, cell elongation, and lumen formation. The identity of the signaling molecules that coordinate these intricate morphogenetic steps remains elusive. The notochord is an essential tubular organ present in the embryonic midline region of all members of the chordate phylum. Here, using genome editing, pharmacology and quantitative imaging in the early chordate <i>Ciona intestinalis</i> we show that Ano10/Tmem16k, a member of the evolutionarily ancient family of transmembrane proteins called Anoctamin/TMEM16 is essential for convergent extension, lumen expansion, and connection during notochord morphogenesis. We find that Ano10/Tmem16k works in concert with the plasma membrane (PM) localized Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger (NCX) and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) residing SERCA, RyR, and IP3R proteins to establish developmental stage specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling molecular modules that regulate notochord morphogenesis and Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics. In addition, we find that the highly conserved Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors calmodulin (CaM) and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) show an Ano10/Tmem16k-dependent subcellular localization. Their pharmacological inhibition leads to convergent extension, tubulogenesis defects, and deranged Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics, suggesting that Ano10/Tmem16k is involved in both the “encoding” and “decoding” of developmental Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. Furthermore, Ano10/Tmem16k mediates cytoskeletal reorganization during notochord morphogenesis, likely by altering the localization of 2 important cytoskeletal regulators, the small GTPase Ras homolog family member A (RhoA) and the actin binding protein Cofilin. Finally, we use electrophysiological recordings and a scramblase assay in tissue culture to demonstrate that Ano10/Tmem16k likely acts as an ion channel but not as a phospholipid scramblase. Our results establish Ano10/Tmem16k as a novel player in the prevertebrate molecular toolkit that controls organ morphogenesis across scales.

                <p>by Weichen Zhou, Kalpita R. Karan, Wenjin Gu, Hans-Ulrich Klein, Gabriel Sturm, Philip L. De Jager, David A. Bennett, Michio Hirano, Martin Picard, Ryan E. Mills</p>

The transfer of mitochondrial DNA into the nuclear genomes of eukaryotes (Numts) has been linked to lifespan in nonhuman species and recently demonstrated to occur in rare instances from one human generation to the next. Here, we investigated numtogenesis dynamics in humans in 2 ways. First, we quantified Numts in 1,187 postmortem brain and blood samples from different individuals. Compared to circulating immune cells (<i>n</i> = 389), postmitotic brain tissue (<i>n</i> = 798) contained more Numts, consistent with their potential somatic accumulation. Within brain samples, we observed a 5.5-fold enrichment of somatic Numt insertions in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) compared to cerebellum samples, suggesting that brain Numts arose spontaneously during development or across the lifespan. Moreover, an increase in the number of brain Numts was linked to earlier mortality. The brains of individuals with no cognitive impairment (NCI) who died at younger ages carried approximately 2 more Numts per decade of life lost than those who lived longer. Second, we tested the dynamic transfer of Numts using a repeated-measures whole-genome sequencing design in a human fibroblast model that recapitulates several molecular hallmarks of aging. These longitudinal experiments revealed a gradual accumulation of 1 Numt every ~13 days. Numtogenesis was independent of large-scale genomic instability and unlikely driven by cell clonality. Targeted pharmacological perturbations including chronic glucocorticoid signaling or impairing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) only modestly increased the rate of numtogenesis, whereas patient-derived <i>SURF1</i>-mutant cells exhibiting mtDNA instability accumulated Numts 4.7-fold faster than healthy donors. Combined, our data document spontaneous numtogenesis in human cells and demonstrate an association between brain cortical somatic Numts and human lifespan. These findings open the possibility that mito-nuclear horizontal gene transfer among human postmitotic tissues produces functionally relevant human Numts over timescales shorter than previously assumed.

Research articles published by the journal eLife are accompanied by short evaluation statements that use phrases from a prescribed vocabulary to evaluate research on 2 dimensions: importance and strength of support. Intuitively, the prescribed phrases appear to be highly synonymous (e.g., important/valuable, compelling/convincing) and the vocabulary’s ordinal structure may not be obvious to readers. We conducted an online repeated-measures experiment to gauge whether the phrases were interpreted as intended. We also tested an alternative vocabulary with (in our view) a less ambiguous structure. A total of 301 participants with a doctoral or graduate degree used a 0% to 100% scale to rate the importance and strength of support of hypothetical studies described using phrases from both vocabularies. For the eLife vocabulary, most participants’ implied ranking did not match the intended ranking on both the importance (<i>n</i> = 59, 20% matched, 95% confidence interval [15% to 24%]) and strength of support dimensions (<i>n</i> = 45, 15% matched [11% to 20%]). By contrast, for the alternative vocabulary, most participants’ implied ranking did match the intended ranking on both the importance (<i>n</i> = 188, 62% matched [57% to 68%]) and strength of support dimensions (<i>n</i> = 201, 67% matched [62% to 72%]). eLife’s vocabulary tended to produce less consistent between-person interpretations, though the alternative vocabulary still elicited some overlapping interpretations away from the middle of the scale. We speculate that explicit presentation of a vocabulary’s intended ordinal structure could improve interpretation. Overall, these findings suggest that more structured and less ambiguous language can improve communication of research evaluations.

                Background Melasma is a common dyschromia, mainly found in women with darker skin types. Although asymptomatic, melasma significantly impacts patients’ quality of life. Due to this complex pathogenesis, melasma is difficult to treat. Plant and plant-derived products have been explored as alternatives for the treatment of melasma. Methods This study utilized network pharmacology coupled with molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the molecular mechanisms of three selected Cassipourea metabolites in the treatment of melasma. Results Of the 202 genes obtained from the 14 profiled metabolites, only PTGS2, TYR, ESR2, and ESR1 were common among metabolites and targets implicated in melasma. From this, The gene ontology highlighted the intracellular steroid hormone receptor, signalling pathway, macromolecular complex, and estrogen receptor activity as the top enriched functional annotations, while the KEGG pathway analysis identified five signalling pathways, from which the prolactin signalling pathway, endocrine resistance, and estrogen signalling pathway were implicated in the pathogenesis of melasma. These pathways were further connected by their linkage to ESR2 and ESR1., Of all Cassipourea metabolites and standards, with afzelechin having the highest docking score for both gens. Further binding interaction analysis showed that ESR2-bound tamoxifen had the highest binding free energy of -47.68 kcal/mol, however, among the interacting Cassipourea metabolites, sitosterol-glycoside exhibited the highest negative binding affinity for both ESR2 (-40.50 kcal/mol) and ESR1 (-78.97 kcal/mol) over 150 ns simulation, suggesting its potential as a dual modulator. Altogether, the metabolites presented remarkable binding stability and thermodynamic compactness with the apo-genes. Conclusion The finding that the selected Cassipourea metabolites are associated with the genes and enzymes implicated in melasma pathogenesis, together with their significant binding effects on the enriched genes, suggests their regulatory potential on the profiled targets and, consequently, in the treatment of melasma.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-951/v1?src=rss">The effect of surface treatments on the bond strength of polyetheretherketone posts: a systematic review protocol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract* Background Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) is widely used in the biomedical field due to its outstanding biological and mechanical properties. Originally employed as a temporary abutment in implantology, recent research has expanded its indications for more definitive applications, such as frameworks and dental post and core. This shift requires a thorough assessment of PEEK’s adhesion and mechanical characteristics. However, PEEK’s inert properties and intricate chemistry create difficulties in surface treatment, resulting in reduced surface energy and inadequate adhesion. Inducing specific physical and chemical changes aims to overcome these challenges and enhance adhesion for PEEK. Despite its numerous clinical trials, standardized protocols remain lacking. This systematic review aims to assess the impact of surface treatments on the bonding performance of PEEK posts. Methods A detailed search of the literature will be conducted across several databases including PubMed, Scopus and clinical trial registries. Additional databases such as Cochrane Central, EMBASE, Web of Science and EBSCO will also be included. The search strategy will target controlled randomized studies and non-randomized clinical trials evaluating the impact of surface treatments on PEEK post adhesion strength. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) will be used to assess bias in non-randomized studies, while the Cochrane Risk of Bias (ROB II) tool will be employed for evaluating randomized controlled trials. Data extraction will focus on study design, treatment methods, outcomes and results. This systematic review protocol will adhere to the guidelines for systematic reviews outlined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Discussion The discussion will explore the implications of findings on clinical practice, highlighting the importance of enhancing PEEK’s bioactivity and surface energy to improve bonding efficacy in dental procedures. Moreover, it will suggest areas for future research to advance dental materials science, aiming to optimize the utilization of PEEK in dental applications Systematic review registration PROSPERO: CRD42024529783 (Registered on 08/04/2024).
