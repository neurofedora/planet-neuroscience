Abstract
<p>Dynamical changes in the environment strongly impact our perception. Likewise, sensory systems preferentially represent stimulus changes, enhancing temporal contrast. In olfaction, odor concentration changes across consecutive inhalations (<i>C<sub>t</sub></i>) can guide odor source localization, yet the neural representation of <i>C<sub>t</sub></i> has not been studied in vertebrates. We have found that, in the mouse olfactory bulb, a subset of mitral/tufted (M/T) cells represents <i>C<sub>t</sub></i>, enhancing the contrast between different concentrations. These concentration change responses are direction selective: they respond either to increments or decrements of concentration, reminiscent of ON and OFF selectivity in the retina. This contrast enhancement scales with the magnitude, but not the duration of the concentration step. Further, <i>C<sub>t</sub></i> can be read out from the total spike count per sniff, unlike odor identity and intensity, which are represented by fast temporal spike patterns. Our results demonstrate that a subset of M/T cells represents <i>C<sub>t</sub></i>, providing a signal that may instruct navigational decisions in downstream olfactory circuits.</p>

Abstract
<p>Odor information is transmitted from olfactory sensory neurons to principal neurons at the glomeruli of the olfactory bulb. The intraglomerular neuronal circuit also includes hundreds of interneurons referred to as juxtaglomerular (JG) cells. Stimulus selectivity is well correlated among many JG cells that are associated with the same glomerulus, consistent with their highly homogeneous sensory inputs. However, much less is known about the temporal aspects of their activity, including the temporal coordination of their odor-evoked responses. As many JG cells within a glomerular module respond to the same stimulus, the extent to which their activity is temporally aligned will affect the temporal profile of their population inhibitory inputs. Using random-access high-speed two-photon microscopy, we recorded the odor-evoked calcium transients of mouse JG cells and compared the onset latency and rise time among neurons putatively associated with the same and different glomeruli. Whereas the overall onset latencies of odor-evoked transients were distributed across a ~150 ms time window, those from cells putatively associated with the same glomerulus were confined to a much narrower window of several tens of milliseconds. This result suggests that onset latency primarily depends on the associated glomerulus. We also observed glomerular specificity in the rise time. The glomerulus-specific temporal pattern of odor-evoked activity implies that the temporal patterns of inputs from the intraglomerular circuit are unique to individual glomerulus–odor pairs, which may contribute to efficient shaping of the temporal pattern of activity in the principal neurons.</p>

Abstract
<p>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by the repeated rise of concerns (obsessions) and repetitive unwanted behavior (compulsions). Although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is the first-choice drug, response rates to SSRI treatment vary between symptom dimensions. In this study, to find a therapeutic target for SSRI-resilient OCD symptoms, we evaluated treatment responses of quinpirole (QNP) sensitization-induced OCD-related behaviors in mice. SSRI administration rescued the cognitive inflexibility, as well as hyperactivity in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC), while no improvement was observed for the repetitive behavior. D<sub>2</sub> receptor signaling in the central striatum (CS) was involved in SSRI-resistant repetitive behavior. An adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> antagonist, istradefylline, which rescued abnormal excitatory synaptic function in the CS indirect pathway medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of sensitized mice, alleviated both of the QNP-induced abnormal behaviors with only short-term administration. These results provide a new insight into therapeutic strategies for SSRI-resistant OCD symptoms and indicate the potential of A<sub>2A</sub> antagonists as a rapid-acting anti-OCD drug.</p>

Abstract
<p>Cholecystokinin-expressing GABAergic (CCK-GABA) neurons are perisomatic inhibitory cells that have been argued to regulate emotion and sculpt the network oscillations associated with cognition. However, no study has selectively manipulated CCK-GABA neuron activity during behavior in freely-moving animals. To explore the behavioral effects of activating CCK-GABA neurons on emotion and cognition, we utilized a novel intersectional genetic mouse model coupled with a chemogenetic approach. Specifically, we generated triple transgenic <i>CCK-Cre;Dlx5/6-Flpe;RC::FL-hM3Dq</i> (CCK-GABA/hM3Dq) mice that expressed the synthetic excitatory hM3Dq receptor in CCK-GABA neurons. Results showed that clozapine-N-oxide (CNO)-mediated activation of CCK-GABA neurons did not alter open field (OF) or tail suspension (TS) performance and only slightly increased anxiety in the elevated plus maze (EPM). Although CNO treatment had only modestly affected emotional behavior, it significantly enhanced multiple cognitive and memory behaviors including social recognition, contextual fear conditioning, contextual discrimination, object recognition, and problem-solving in the puzzle box. Collectively, these findings suggest that systemic activation of CCK-GABA neurons minimally affects emotion but significantly enhances cognition and memory. Our results imply that CCK-GABA neurons are more functionally diverse than originally expected and could serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of cognitive/memory disorders.</p>

<p>Automatic mimicry is a critical element of social interaction. A salient type of automatic mimicry is eye contact characterized by sharing of affective and mental states among individuals. We conducted a hyperscanning functional magnetic resonance imaging study involving on-line (LIVE) and delayed off-line (REPLAY) conditions to test our hypothesis that recurrent interaction through eye contact activates the limbic mirror system, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and anterior insular cortex (AIC), both of which are critical for self-awareness. Sixteen pairs of human adults participated in the experiment. Given that an eye-blink represents an individual’s attentional window toward the partner, we analyzed pairwise time-series data for eye-blinks. We used multivariate autoregression analysis to calculate the noise contribution ratio (NCR) as an index of how a participant’s directional attention was influenced by that of their partner. NCR was greater in the LIVE than in the REPLAY condition, indicating mutual perceptual–motor interaction during real-time eye contact. Relative to the REPLAY condition, the LIVE condition was associated with greater activation in the left cerebellar hemisphere, vermis, and ACC, accompanied by enhanced functional connectivity between ACC and right AIC. Given the roles of the cerebellum in sensorimotor prediction and ACC in movement initiation, ACC–cerebellar activation may represent their involvement in modulating visual input related to the partner’s movement, which may, in turn, involve the limbic mirror system. Our findings indicate that mutual interaction during eye contact is mediated by the cerebellum and limbic mirror system.</p>

<p>Publication date: June 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 56</p><p>Author(s): Lalanti Venkatasubramanian, Richard S Mann</p><div><p>In order to generate complex motor outputs, the nervous system integrates multiple sources of sensory information that ultimately controls motor neurons to generate coordinated movements. The neural circuits that integrate higher order commands from the brain and generate motor outputs are located in the nerve cord of the central nervous system. Recently, genetic access to distinct functional subtypes that make up the <em>Drosophila</em> adult ventral nerve cord has significantly begun to advance our understanding of the structural organization and functions of the neural circuits coordinating motor outputs. Moreover, lineage-tracing and genetic intersection tools have been instrumental in deciphering the developmental mechanisms that generate and assemble the functional units of the adult nerve cord. Together, the <em>Drosophila</em> adult ventral nerve cord is emerging as a powerful system to understand the development and function of neural circuits that are responsible for coordinating complex motor outputs.</p></div>

<p>This article introduces a model-agnostic approach to study statistical
synergy, a form of emergence in which patterns at large scales are not
traceable from lower scales. Our framework leverages various multivariate
extensions of Shannon's mutual information, and introduces the O-information as
a metric capable of characterising synergy- and redundancy-dominated systems.
We develop key analytical properties of the O-information, and study how it
relates to other metrics of high-order interactions from the statistical
mechanics and neuroscience literature. Finally, as a proof of concept, we use
the proposed framework to explore the relevance of statistical synergy in
Baroque music scores.

<p>A large variety of methods has been proposed for automatic seizure detection
in EEG signals. Those achieving maximal performance are based on
machine-learning techniques, which require long training sessions with large
labelled databases, and produce a verdict with no intuitive justification. As
an alternative, we here explore an unsupervised algorithm applicable to
intra-cranial EEG recordings that requires good sampling of the non-ictal
periods, but imposes no demands on the amount of data during ictal activity.
The algorithm analyses how the amount of power in each frequency band
fluctuates ( an evaluation physicians are familiar with ) and can be
implemented online. The analysis is performed electrode by electrode, thus
providing the spatio-temporal sequence in which the affected regions are
recruited into the crisis. We test it with 32 crisis registered in 5 patients,
for which we also have the degree of loss of consciousness as determined from a
behavioural analysis. The method can achieve a precision of 85% and a recall of
88% in the identification of seizures, and 77% and 88% in the identification of
recruited electrodes. The intuitive nature of the analysis allows us to
identify certain physiological features that are correlated with the degree of
loss of consciousness. For example, epileptic crisis in which the variance of
the power in the alpha band increases at around seizure onset are particularly
likely to impair consciousness. We conclude that the PCA of the distribution of
power in different frequency bands provides information both about the
detection and the characterization of epileptic seizures.

learning, information-theoretic, and thermodynamic perspectives. We start with
constructing a hierarchical model of the world as an internal model in the
brain, and review standard machine learning methods to infer causes by
approximately learning the model under the maximum likelihood principle. This
in turn provides an overview of the free energy principle for an organism, a
hypothesis to explain perception and action from the principle of least
surprise. Treating this statistical learning as communication between the world
and brain, learning is interpreted as a process to maximize information about
the world. We investigate how the classical theories of perception such as the
infomax principle relates to learning the hierarchical model. We then present
an approach to the recognition and learning based on thermodynamics, showing
that adaptation by causal learning results in the second law of thermodynamics
whereas inference dynamics that fuses observation with prior knowledge forms a
thermodynamic process. These provide a unified view on the adaptation of
organisms to the environment.

<p>We introduce a probabilistic generative model for disentangling
spatio-temporal disease trajectories from series of high-dimensional brain
images. The model is based on spatio-temporal matrix factorization, where
inference on the sources is constrained by anatomically plausible statistical
priors. To model realistic trajectories, the temporal sources are defined as
monotonic and time-reparametrized Gaussian Processes. To account for the
non-stationarity of brain images, we model the spatial sources as sparse codes
convolved at multiple scales. The method was tested on synthetic data
favourably comparing with standard blind source separation approaches. The
application on large-scale imaging data from a clinical study allows to
disentangle differential temporal progression patterns mapping brain regions
key to neurodegeneration, while revealing a disease-specific time scale
associated to the clinical diagnosis.

<p>Fluctuation-based dispersion entropy (FDispEn) is a new approach to estimate
the dynamical variability of the fluctuations of signals. It is based on
Shannon entropy and fluctuation-based dispersion patterns. To quantify the
physiological dynamics over multiple time scales, multiscale FDispEn (MFDE) is
developed in this article. MFDE is robust to the presence of baseline wanders,
or trends, in the data. We evaluate MFDE, compared with popular multiscale
sample entropy (MSE), and the recently introduced multiscale dispersion entropy
(MDE), on selected synthetic data and five neurological diseases' datasets: 1)
focal and non-focal electroencephalograms (EEGs); 2) walking stride interval
signals for young, elderly, and Parkinson's subjects; 3) stride interval
fluctuations for Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; 4)
EEGs for controls and Alzheimer's disease patients; and 5) eye movement data
for Parkinson's disease and ataxia. MFDE dealt with the problem of undefined
MSE values and, compared with MDE, led to more stable entropy values over the
scale factors for pink noise. Overall, MFDE was the fastest and most consistent
method for the discrimination of different states of neurological data,
especially where the mean value of a time series considerably changes along the
signal (e.g., eye movement data). This study shows that MFDE is a relevant new
metric to gain further insights into the dynamics of neurological diseases
recordings.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/44487">Dynamic control of hippocampal spatial coding resolution by local visual cues</a></h4>

The ability to flexibly navigate an environment relies on a hippocampal-dependent cognitive map. External space can be internally mapped at different spatial resolutions. However, whether hippocampal spatial coding resolution can rapidly adapt to local features of an environment remains unclear. To explore this possibility, we recorded the firing of hippocampal neurons in mice navigating virtual reality environments, embedding or not local visual cues (virtual 3D objects) in specific locations. Virtual objects enhanced spatial coding resolution in their vicinity with a higher proportion of place cells, smaller place fields, increased spatial selectivity and stability. This effect was highly dynamic upon objects manipulations. Objects also improved temporal coding resolution through improved theta phase precession and theta timescale spike coordination. We propose that the fast adaptation of hippocampal spatial coding resolution to local features of an environment could be relevant for large-scale navigation.

Elevated glucose increases vascular reactivity by promoting L-type Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel (LTCC) activity by protein kinase A (PKA). Yet, how glucose activates PKA is unknown. We hypothesized that a G<sub>s</sub>-coupled P2Y receptor is an upstream activator of PKA mediating LTCC potentiation during diabetic hyperglycemia. Experiments in apyrase-treated cells suggested involvement of a P2Y receptor underlying the glucose effects on LTTCs. Using human tissue, expression for P2Y<sub>11</sub>, the only G<sub>s</sub>-coupled P2Y receptor, was detected in nanometer proximity to Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 and PKA. FRET-based experiments revealed that the selective P2Y<sub>11</sub> agonist NF546 and elevated glucose stimulate cAMP production resulting in enhanced PKA-dependent LTCC activity. These changes were blocked by the selective P2Y<sub>11</sub> inhibitor NF340. Comparable results were observed in mouse tissue, suggesting that a P2Y<sub>11</sub>-like receptor is mediating the glucose response in these cells. These findings established a key role for P2Y<sub>11</sub> in regulating PKA-dependent LTCC function and vascular reactivity during diabetic hyperglycemia.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Neocortical astrogenesis follows neuronogenesis and precedes oligogenesis. Among key factors dictating its temporal articulation, there are progression rates of pallial stem cells (SCs) towards astroglial lineages as well as activation rates of astrocyte differentiation programs in response to extrinsic gliogenic cues. In this study, we showed that high Foxg1 SC expression antagonizes astrocyte generation, while stimulating SC self-renewal and committing SCs to neuronogenesis. We found that mechanisms underlying this activity are mainly cell autonomous and highly pleiotropic. They include a concerted downregulation of 4 key effectors channeling neural SCs to astroglial fates, as well as defective activation of core molecular machineries implementing astroglial differentiation programs. Next, we found that SC Foxg1 levels specifically decline during the neuronogenic-to-gliogenic transition, pointing to a pivotal Foxg1 role in temporal modulation of astrogenesis. Finally, we showed that Foxg1 inhibits astrogenesis from human neocortical precursors, suggesting that this is an evolutionarily ancient trait.</span>

The revolutionary discovery of the rapid antidepressant ketamine has been a milestone in psychiatry field in the last half century. Unlike conventional antidepressants that often take weeks to months to show efficacy, ketamine causes rapid antidepressant effects, emerging as early as within 1h after administration. However, how ketamine improves mood symptoms so quickly has remained elusive. Here, we first introduce the historical background of ketamine as a rapid antidepressant. We then discuss current hypotheses underlying ketamine’s rapid antidepressant effects, with a focus on our latest discovery that ketamine silences NMDAR-dependent burst firing in the ‘anti-reward center’, the lateral habenula.

Communicating with the public after corporate crises is often necessary, yet little evidence provides guidance. To address this, our theoretical and content analyses of public apologies revealed 12 key content elements. From these, we developed a basic apology, and tested its effectiveness alone, and with additional content. In two experiments involving river contamination, the basic apology was effective and improved with additional content. In Experiment 1, effectiveness involved actions taken to reduce harm and reoccurrence. Experiment 2 increased the hazard to carcinogenic chemicals, and one apology was superior: the basic apology plus statements of recovery efforts and defense of company actions. The two experiments show that crisis severity influences apology effectiveness. Experiment 3 found that clarifying causality helps convince people that the crisis source is identified and the problem resolved. Our findings show that an optimal public apology is comprehensive, and details the causes and actions taken to prevent reoccurrence.

While an increased impact of cues on decision-making has been associated with substance dependence, it is yet unclear whether this is also a phenotype of non-substance related addictive disorders, such as gambling disorder. To better understand the basic mechanisms of impaired decision-making in addiction, we investigated whether cue-induced changes in decision-making could distinguish gambling disorder (GD) from healthy control (HC) subjects. We expected that cue-induced changes in gamble acceptance and specifically in loss aversion would distinguish GD from HC subjects. 30 GD subjects and 30 matched HC subjects completed a mixed gambles task where gambling and other emotional cues were shown in the background. We used machine learning and classification to carve out the importance of cue-dependency of decision-making and of loss aversion for distinguishing GD from HC subjects. Cross-validated classification yielded an area under the receiver operating curve (AUC-ROC) of 68.9% (p=0.002). Applying the classifier to an independent sample yielded an AUC-ROC of 65.0% (p=0.047). As expected, the classifier used cue-induced changes in gamble acceptance to distinguish GD from HC. Especially increased gambling during the presentation of gambling cues was characteristic of GD subjects. However, unexpectedly, cue-induced changes in loss aversion were irrelevant for distinguishing GD from HC subjects. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the classificatory power of addiction-relevant behavioral task parameters when distinguishing GD from HC subjects. The results indicate that cue-induced changes in decision-making are a characteristic feature of addictive disorders, independent of a substance of abuse.

Most modeling in systems neuroscience has been descriptive where neural representations, that is, 'receptive fields', have been found by statistically correlating neural activity to sensory input. In the traditional physics approach to modelling, hypotheses are represented by mechanistic models based on the underlying building blocks of the system, and candidate models are validated by comparing with experiments. Until now validation of mechanistic cortical network models has been based on comparison with neuronal spikes, found from the high-frequency part of extracellular electrical potentials. In this computational study we investigated to what extent the low-frequency part of the signal, the local field potential (LFP), can be used to infer properties of the neuronal network. In particular, we asked the question whether the LFP can be used to accurately estimate synaptic connection weights in the underlying network. We considered the thoroughly analysed Brunel network comprising an excitatory and an inhibitory population of recurrently connected integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons. This model exhibits a high diversity of spiking network dynamics depending on the values of only three synaptic weight parameters. The LFP generated by the network was computed using a hybrid scheme where spikes computed from the point-neuron network were replayed on biophysically detailed multicompartmental neurons. We assessed how accurately the three model parameters could be estimated from power spectra of stationary 'background' LFP signals by application of convolutional neural nets (CNNs). All network parameters could be very accurately estimated, suggesting that LFPs indeed can be used for network model validation.

There is evidence for a hippocampal long axis anterior-posterior (AP) differentiation in memory processing, which may have implications for the changes in episodic memory performance typically seen across development and aging. The hippocampal formation shows substantial structural changes with age, but the lifespan trajectories of hippocampal sub-regions along the AP axis are not established. The aim of the present study was to test whether the micro- and macro-structural age-trajectories of the anterior (aHC) and posterior (pHC) hippocampus are different. In a single-center longitudinal study, 1790 cognitively healthy participants, 4.1-93.4 years of age, underwent a total of 3367 MRI examinations and 3033 memory tests sessions over 1-6 time points, spanning an interval up to 11.1 years. T1-weighted scans were used to estimate the volume of aHC and pHC, and diffusion tensor imaging to measure mean diffusion (MD) within each region. We found that the macro- and microstructural lifespan-trajectories of aHC and pHC were clearly distinguishable, with partly common and partly unique variance shared with age. aHC showed a protracted period of microstructural development, while pHC microstructural development as indexed by MD was more or less completed in early childhood. In contrast, pHC showed larger unique aging-related changes. A similar aHC - pHC difference was observed for volume, although not as evident as for microstructure. All sub-regions showed age-dependent relationships to episodic memory function. For aHC micro- and macrostructure, the relationships to verbal memory performance varied significantly with age, being stronger among the older participants. Future research should disentangle the relationship between these structural properties and different memory processes - encoding vs. retrieval in particular - across the lifespan.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/564716v1?rss=1">A Novel Ensemble-Based Machine Learning Algorithm To Predict The Conversion From Mild Cognitive Impairment To Alzheimer\'s Disease Using Socio-demographic Characteristics, Clinical Information And Neuropsychological Measures</a></h4>

Background: Despite the increasing availability in brain health related data, clinically translatable methods to predict the conversion from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD) are still lacking. Although MCI typically precedes AD, only a fraction of 20-40% of MCI individuals will progress to dementia within 3 years following the initial diagnosis. As currently available and emerging therapies likely have the greatest impact when provided at the earliest disease stage, the prompt identification of subjects at high risk for conversion to full AD is of great importance in the fight against this disease. In this work, we propose a highly predictive machine learning algorithm, based only on non-invasively and easily in-the-clinic collectable predictors, to identify MCI subjects at risk for conversion to full AD. Methods: The algorithm was developed using the open dataset from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), employing a sample of 550 MCI subjects whose diagnostic follow-up is available for at least 3 years after the baseline assessment. A restricted set of information regarding sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, neuropsychological test scores was used as predictors and several different supervised machine learning algorithms were developed and ensembled in final algorithm. A site-independent stratified train/test split protocol was used to provide an estimate of the generalized performance of the algorithm. Results: The final algorithm demonstrated an AUROC of 0.88, sensitivity of 77.7%, and a specificity of 79.9% on excluded test data. The specificity of the algorithm was 40.2% for 100% sensitivity. Discussion: The algorithm we developed achieved sound and high prognostic performance to predict AD conversion using easily clinically derived information that makes the algorithm easy to be translated into practice. This indicates beneficial application to improve recruitment in clinical trials and to more selectively prescribe new and newly emerging early interventions to high AD risk patients.

Pharmacological targeting of memory reconsolidation is a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of fear memory-related disorders. However, the success of reconsolidation-based approaches depends upon the effective destabilisation of the fear memory by memory reactivation. Here, we show that the nootropic nefiracetam stimulates tone fear memory destabilisation to facilitate reconsolidation disruption by the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist mifepristone. Moreover, the enhancing effect of nefiracetam was dependent upon dopamine D1 receptor activation, although direct D1 receptor agonism was not sufficient to facilitate destabilisation. Finally, while the combined treatment with nefiracetam and mifepristone did not confer fear-reducing effects under conditions of extinction learning, there was some evidence that mifepristone reduces fear expression irrespective of memory reactivation parameters. Therefore, the use of combination pharmacological treatment to stimulate memory destabilisation and impair reconsolidation has potential therapeutic benefits, without risking a maladaptive increase of fear.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/564633v1?rss=1">Emotion Modulation of the Body-Selective Areas in the Developing Brain</a></h4>

Emotions are strongly conveyed by the human body and the ability to recognize emotions from body posture or movement is still developing through childhood and adolescence. To date, there are very few studies exploring how these behavioural observations are paralleled by functional brain development. Furthermore, there are currently no studies exploring the development of emotion modulation in these areas. In the current study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare the brain activity of 25 children (age 6-11), 18 adolescents (age 12-17) and 26 adults while they passively viewed short videos of angry, happy or neutral body movements. We observed that when viewing bodies generally, adults showed higher activity than children bilaterally in the body-selective areas; namely the extra-striate body area (EBA), fusiform body area (FBA), posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) and amygdala (AMY). Adults also showed higher activity than adolescents, but only in right hemisphere body-selective areas. Crucially, however, we found that there were no age differences in the emotion modulation of activity in these areas. These results indicate, for the first time, that despite activity selective to body perception increasing across childhood and adolescence, emotion modulation of these areas in adult-like from 7 years of age.

Accurate control of the trunk is essential for maintaining balance in an upright subject. Most studies addressing vestibulo-spinal reflexes have investigated the role of the lower limbs, while limited attention has been paid to the back muscles. To address this issue, we challenged the persistence of vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs) in back muscles in situations in which the leg muscle responses were modulated. Nineteen subjects were submitted to galvanic vestibular stimulations (GVS). Body sway and VEMPs were recorded in the paraspinal and limb muscles. During treadmill locomotion, the VEMPS in the lower limbs were observed only during the stance phase, whereas the axial VEMPs were observed during all phases. In upright standing subjects, slight head contact was sufficient to abolish the VEMPs in the lower limbs, while the VEMPs remained present in the paraspinal muscles. Similarly, during parabolic flight-induced microgravity, the VEMPs in the lower limb muscles were suppressed, while those in the axial muscles persisted despite the absence of gravitational information from the otolithic system. Our results depict a differentiated control mechanism of axial and appendicular muscles when a perturbation is detected by vestibular inputs. The persistent feature of axial myogenic adjustments suggests that a hard-wired reflex is functionally efficient to maintain posture. By contrast, the ankle responses to perturbations occur only when the accompanying sensory feedback is congruent, challenging the balance task and gravity. Overall, this study using GVS in microgravity is the first to present an approach delineating feed-forward vestibular control in the absence of all feedback.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/564476v1?rss=1">Dynamic compression and expansion in a classifying recurrent network</a></h4>

Recordings of neural circuits in the brain reveal extraordinary dynamical richness and high variability. At the same time, dimensionality reduction techniques generally uncover low-dimensional structures underlying these dynamics when tasks are performed. In general, it is still an open question what determines the dimensionality of activity in neural circuits, and what the functional role of this dimensionality in task learning is. In this work we probe these issues using a recurrent artificial neural network (RNN) model trained by stochastic gradient descent to discriminate inputs. The RNN family of models has recently shown promise in revealing principles behind brain function. Through simulations and mathematical analysis, we show how the dimensionality of RNN activity depends on the task parameters and evolves over time and over stages of learning. We find that common solutions produced by the network naturally compress dimensionality, while variability-inducing chaos can expand it. We show how chaotic networks balance these two factors to solve the discrimination task with high accuracy and good generalization properties. These findings shed light on mechanisms by which artificial neural networks solve tasks while forming compact representations that may generalize well.

Humans show striking limitations in information processing when multitasking, yet can modify these limits with practice. Such limitations have been attributed to the capacity of a frontal-parietal network, but recent models of decision-making implicate a striatal-cortical network. We adjudicated these accounts by implementing a dynamic causal modelling (DCM) analysis of a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) dataset, where 100 participants completed a multitasking paradigm in the scanner, before and after engaging in a multitasking (N=50) or an active control (N=50) practice regimen. We observed that multitasking costs, and their practice related remediation, are best explained by modulations in information transfer between the striatum and the cortical areas that represent stimulus-response mappings. Neither multitasking nor practice modulated direct frontal-parietal connectivity. Our results support the view that limits in cognitive capacity are striatally driven, and moderated by the interplay of information exchange from the putamen to the pre-supplementary motor area.

The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) plays an important role in dendritic translation, synaptic plasticity, and learning and memory. We previously showed that heavy alcohol use activates mTORC1 in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) of rodents. Here, we set out to determine the consequences of alcohol-dependent mTORC1 activation in the OFC. We found that although inhibition of mTORC1 in the OFC does not alter rat alcohol intake per se, it attenuates alcohol seeking. We then tested whether mTORC1 in the OFC is required for goal-directed or habitual alcohol seeking. To do so, rats were trained self-administer alcohol under a random ratio (RR) or a random interval (RI) schedule of reinforcement, which biases toward goal-directed or habitual responding, respectively, and tested whether mTORC1 inhibition alters lever presses following alcohol devaluation. We found that pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1 or knockdown of the adaptor protein, Raptor, did not affect goal-directed alcohol responding but restored sensitivity to devaluation in RI-trained rats. In contrast, habitual responding for sucrose was unaltered by mTORC1 inhibition. These data suggest that mTORC1 in the OFC drives alcohol habit. We then elucidate the mechanism by which mTORC1 is activated by alcohol, and found that the recruitment of GluN2B during alcohol withdrawal stimulates mTORC1 in OFC cFos-positive neurons. Finally, we show that inhibition of GluN2B in the OFC attenuates both alcohol seeking and habitual responding for alcohol. Together, our data suggest that alcohol withdrawal promotes an NMDAR-dependent activation of mTORC1 which in turn drives habitual alcohol seeking.

Aim: To analyse the association between early aEEG and cognitive outcome at early school-age in very preterm infants. Methods: Prospective cohort study including infants with gestational age (GA) &lt;32.0 weeks, undergoing continuous aEEG recording during first 4 days of life. Semiquantitative and quantitative (maximum/minimum amplitude) measures were averaged over the recording period. Cognitive outcome was assessed with the Kaufman-Assessment Battery for Children at 5 years of age. Uni- and multivariate logistic regressions were calculated between aEEG parameters and normal cognitive outcome (IQ[≥]85). Results: Among 118 monitored preterm children, 89 were assessed at median(IQR) corrected age of 68.6 months (65.5-71.2) [48% female, median(IQR) GA 29.9(28.2,30.9) weeks, mean(SD) birth weight 1235(363) grams]. Mean(SD) IQ was 97.8(12.7). IQ&lt;85 occurred in 21.3 %, cerebral palsy was found in 3.4%. Despite univariate associations of total maturity scores, cycling subscores, background pattern and minimum aEEG amplitude with normal cognitive outcome none of the associations remained significant after adjustment for confounders. Socioeconomic status was identified as independent predictor of neurodevelopmental outcome. Conclusion: In this cohort of very preterm infants, early short-term aEEG was not predictive of later cognitive outcome. Further research is needed to explore how aEEG could help to inform long-term prognosis in this population group.

<p>by Moritz Hoffmann, Christoph Fröhner, Frank Noé</p>

Interacting-particle reaction dynamics (iPRD) combines the simulation of dynamical trajectories of interacting particles as in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with reaction kinetics, in which particles appear, disappear, or change their type and interactions based on a set of reaction rules. This combination facilitates the simulation of reaction kinetics in crowded environments, involving complex molecular geometries such as polymers, and employing complex reaction mechanisms such as breaking and fusion of polymers. iPRD simulations are ideal to simulate the detailed spatiotemporal reaction mechanism in complex and dense environments, such as in signalling processes at cellular membranes, or in nano- to microscale chemical reactors. Here we introduce the iPRD software ReaDDy 2, which provides a Python interface in which the simulation environment, particle interactions and reaction rules can be conveniently defined and the simulation can be run, stored and analyzed. A C++ interface is available to enable deeper and more flexible interactions with the framework. The main computational work of ReaDDy 2 is done in hardware-specific simulation kernels. While the version introduced here provides single- and multi-threading CPU kernels, the architecture is ready to implement GPU and multi-node kernels. We demonstrate the efficiency and validity of ReaDDy 2 using several benchmark examples. ReaDDy 2 is available at the https://readdy.github.io/ website.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TKkTeOngpuQ" width="1" />

<p>by Alejandro Tabas, Martin Andermann, Valeria Schuberth, Helmut Riedel, Emili Balaguer-Ballester, André Rupp</p>

Pitch is a fundamental attribute of auditory perception. The interaction of concurrent pitches gives rise to a sensation that can be characterized by its degree of consonance or dissonance. In this work, we propose that human auditory cortex (AC) processes pitch and consonance through a common neural network mechanism operating at early cortical levels. First, we developed a new model of neural ensembles incorporating realistic neuronal and synaptic parameters to assess pitch processing mechanisms at early stages of AC. Next, we designed a magnetoencephalography (MEG) experiment to measure the neuromagnetic activity evoked by dyads with varying degrees of consonance or dissonance. MEG results show that dissonant dyads evoke a pitch onset response (POR) with a latency up to 36 ms longer than consonant dyads. Additionally, we used the model to predict the processing time of concurrent pitches; here, consonant pitch combinations were decoded faster than dissonant combinations, in line with the experimental observations. Specifically, we found a striking match between the predicted and the observed latency of the POR as elicited by the dyads.

<p>by Shayne M. Plourde, Prativa Amom, Michelle Tan, Adriana T. Dawes, Anna A. Dobritsa</p>

Pollen provides an excellent system to study pattern formation at the single-cell level. Pollen surface is covered by the pollen wall exine, whose deposition is excluded from certain surface areas, the apertures, which vary between the species in their numbers, positions, and morphology. What determines aperture patterns is not understood. <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> normally develops three apertures, equally spaced along the pollen equator. However, Arabidopsis mutants whose pollen has higher ploidy and larger volume develop four or more apertures. To explore possible mechanisms responsible for aperture patterning, we developed a mathematical model based on the Gierer-Meinhardt system of equations. This model was able to recapitulate aperture patterns observed in the wild-type and higher-ploidy pollen. We then used this model to further explore geometric and kinetic factors that may influence aperture patterns and found that pollen size, as well as certain kinetic parameters, like diffusion and decay of morphogens, could play a role in formation of aperture patterns. In conjunction with mathematical modeling, we also performed a forward genetic screen in Arabidopsis and discovered two mutants with aperture patterns that had not been previously observed in this species but were predicted by our model. The <i>macaron</i> mutant develops a single ring-like aperture, matching the unusual ring-like pattern produced by the model. The <i>doughnut</i> mutant forms two pore-like apertures at the poles of the pollen grain. Further tests on these novel mutants, motivated by the modeling results, suggested the existence of an area of inhibition around apertures that prevents formation of additional apertures in their vicinity. This work demonstrates the ability of the theoretical model to help focus experimental efforts and to provide fundamental insights into an important biological process.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-XSS-63H_Vw" width="1" />

<p>by Sen Pei, Mark A. Cane, Jeffrey Shaman</p>

Process-based models have been used to simulate and forecast a number of nonlinear dynamical systems, including influenza and other infectious diseases. In this work, we evaluate the effects of model initial condition error and stochastic fluctuation on forecast accuracy in a compartmental model of influenza transmission. These two types of errors are found to have qualitatively similar growth patterns during model integration, indicating that dynamic error growth, regardless of source, is a dominant component of forecast inaccuracy. We therefore examine the nonlinear growth of model initial error and compute the fastest growing directions using singular vector analysis. Using this information, we generate perturbations in an ensemble forecast system of influenza to obtain more optimal ensemble spread. In retrospective forecasts of historical outbreaks for 95 US cities from 2003 to 2014, this approach improves short-term forecast of incidence over the next one to four weeks.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Z3MCPHxJnME" width="1" />

Metabolic reprogramming is a general feature of cancer cells. Regrettably, the comprehensive quantification of metabolites in biological specimens does not promptly translate into knowledge on the utilization of metabolic pathways. By estimating fluxes across metabolic pathways, computational models hold the promise to bridge this gap between data and biological functionality. These models currently portray the average behavior of cell populations however, masking the inherent heterogeneity that is part and parcel of tumorigenesis as much as drug resistance. To remove this limitation, we propose single-cell Flux Balance Analysis (scFBA) as a computational framework to translate single-cell transcriptomes into single-cell fluxomes. We show that the integration of single-cell RNA-seq profiles of cells derived from lung adenocarcinoma and breast cancer patients into a multi-scale stoichiometric model of a cancer cell population: significantly 1) reduces the space of feasible single-cell fluxomes; 2) allows to identify clusters of cells with different growth rates within the population; 3) points out the possible metabolic interactions among cells via exchange of metabolites. The scFBA suite of MATLAB functions is available at https://github.com/BIMIB-DISCo/scFBA, as well as the case study datasets.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dHF-_ktVih0" width="1" />

<p>by Moritz Möller, Rafal Bogacz</p>

A set of sub-cortical nuclei called basal ganglia is critical for learning the values of actions. The basal ganglia include two pathways, which have been associated with approach and avoid behavior respectively and are differentially modulated by dopamine projections from the midbrain. Inspired by the influential opponent actor learning model, we demonstrate that, under certain circumstances, these pathways may represent learned estimates of the positive and negative consequences (payoffs and costs) of individual actions. In the model, the level of dopamine activity encodes the motivational state and controls to what extent payoffs and costs enter the overall evaluation of actions. We show that a set of previously proposed plasticity rules is suitable to extract payoffs and costs from a prediction error signal if they occur at different moments in time. For those plasticity rules, successful learning requires differential effects of positive and negative outcome prediction errors on the two pathways and a weak decay of synaptic weights over trials. We also confirm through simulations that the model reproduces drug-induced changes of willingness to work, as observed in classical experiments with the D2-antagonist haloperidol.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OuBZysQ44wM" width="1" />

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Central nervous system pathology in multiple sclerosis includes both focal inflammatory perivascular injury and injury to superficial structures, including the subpial region of the cortex, which reportedly exhibits a gradient of damage from the surface inward. We assessed how early in the multiple sclerosis course a "surface‐in" process of injury suggesting progressive biology may begin.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We focused on the thalamus, which notably has both a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) interface and a white matter interface. Thalamic volume trajectories were assessed in a prospectively followed cohort of children from initial presentation with either multiple sclerosis or monophasic acquired demyelination, and healthy controls. Voxelwise volume changes were calculated using deformation‐based morphometry, and analyzed in relation to distance from the CSF interface by mixed effects modeling and semiparametric smoothing methods.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Twenty‐seven children with multiple sclerosis and 73 children with monophasic demyelination were prospectively followed with yearly brain scans (mean follow‐up = 4.6 years, standard deviation = 1.9). A total of 282 healthy children with serial scans were included as controls. Relative to healthy controls, children with multiple sclerosis and children with monophasic demyelination demonstrated volume loss in thalamic regions adjacent to the white matter. However, only children with multiple sclerosis exhibited an additional surface‐in gradient of thalamic injury on the ventricular side, which was already notable in the first year of clinical disease (asymptote estimate = 3.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.44–4.58, <i>p</i> = 0.0002) and worsened over time (asymptote:time estimate = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.12–0.54, <i>p</i> = 0.0021).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results suggest that a multiple sclerosis disease‐specific surface‐in process of damage can manifest at the earliest stages of the disease. <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:340–351.</b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To explore the association of poststroke baseline blood pressure with cerebral collateral flow and functional outcome in acute ischemic patients with large vessel occlusion/stenosis.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients identified with large vessel occlusion/stenosis with baseline multimodal computed tomography, follow‐up imaging, and complete clinical profiles were included. A 90‐day modified Rankin Scale of 0–1 was defined as an excellent functional outcome. Cerebral collateral flow was quantified by the volume ratio of tissue within the delay time &gt;3 seconds perfusion lesion with severely delayed contrast transit (delay time &gt;3 seconds/delay time &gt;6 seconds).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>There were 306 patients included in this study. With every increase of 10 mmHg in baseline systolic blood pressure, the odds of achieving an excellent functional outcome decreased by 12% in multivariate analysis (odds ratio = 0.88, <i>p</i> = 0.048). Conversely, increased baseline blood pressure was associated with better collateral flow. In subgroup analysis of patients with major reperfusion, higher blood pressure was associated with decreased infarct growth and a better clinical outcome, and vice versa in patients without reperfusion.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Higher baseline blood pressure in acute ischemic stroke patients with large vessel occlusion/stenosis was associated with better collateral flow. However, for patients without reperfusion, higher baseline blood pressure was associated with increased infarct growth, leading to an unfavorable clinical outcome. The relationship between blood pressure and outcomes is highly dependent on reperfusion, and active blood pressure–lowering treatment may be inappropriate in acute ischemic stroke patients prior to reperfusion treatment. <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:331–339.</b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Genetic modifiers in rare disease have long been suspected to contribute to the considerable variance in disease expression, including Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A). To address this question, the Inherited Neuropathy Consortium collected a large standardized sample of such rare CMT1A patients over a period of 8 years. CMT1A is caused in most patients by a uniformly sized 1.5 Mb duplication event involving the gene <i>PMP22</i>.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We genotyped DNA samples from 971 CMT1A patients on Illumina BeadChips. Genome‐wide analysis was performed in a subset of 330 of these patients, who expressed the extremes of a hallmark symptom: mild and severe foot dorsiflexion strength impairment. <i>SIPA1L2</i> (signal‐induced proliferation‐associated 1 like 2), the top identified candidate modifier gene, was expressed in the peripheral nerve, and our functional studies identified and confirmed interacting proteins using coimmunoprecipitation analysis, mass spectrometry, and immunocytochemistry. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and in vitro siRNA experiments were used to analyze gene regulation.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified significant association of 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs10910527, rs7536385, rs4649265, rs1547740) in <i>SIPA1L2</i> with foot dorsiflexion strength (<i>p</i> &lt; 1 × 10<sup>−7</sup>). Coimmunoprecipitation and mass spectroscopy studies identified β‐actin and MYH9 as SIPA1L2 binding partners. Furthermore, we show that <i>SIPA1L2</i> is part of a myelination‐associated coexpressed network regulated by the master transcription factor SOX10. Importantly, in vitro knockdown of <i>SIPA1L2</i> in Schwannoma cells led to a significant reduction of <i>PMP22</i> expression, hinting at a potential strategy for drug development.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>
<i>SIPA1L2</i> is a potential genetic modifier of CMT1A phenotypic expressions and offers a new pathway to therapeutic interventions. <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:316–330.</b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Solriamfetol (JZP‐110) is a selective dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor with wake‐promoting effects. This phase 3 study (NCT02348593) evaluated the safety and efficacy of solriamfetol in narcolepsy.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients with narcolepsy with mean sleep latency &lt;25 minutes on the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score ≥10, and usual nightly sleep ≥6 hours were randomized to solriamfetol 75, 150, or 300 mg, or placebo for 12 weeks. Coprimary endpoints were change from baseline to week 12 in MWT and ESS. Improvement on the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI‐C) was the key secondary endpoint.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Safety and modified intention‐to‐treat populations included 236 and 231 patients, respectively. Solriamfetol 300 and 150 mg were positive on both coprimary endpoints. Least squares mean (standard error [SE]) changes from baseline were 12.3 (SE = 1.4) and 9.8 (SE = 1.3) minutes for solriamfetol 300 and 150 mg on the MWT, respectively, versus 2.1 (SE = 1.3) minutes for placebo, and −6.4 (SE = 0.7) for 300 mg and −5.4 (SE = 0.7) for 150 mg on the ESS versus −1.6 (SE = 0.7) for placebo (all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). At week 12, higher percentages of patients treated with solriamfetol 150 mg (78.2%) and 300 mg (84.7%) reported PGI‐C improvement relative to placebo (39.7%; both <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). Adverse events ≥5% across all solriamfetol doses included headache (21.5%), nausea (10.7%), decreased appetite (10.7%), nasopharyngitis (9.0%), dry mouth (7.3%), and anxiety (5.1%).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Solriamfetol has the potential to be an important therapeutic option for the treatment of impaired wakefulness and excessive sleepiness in patients with narcolepsy. <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:359–370.</b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>There is no scale for rating the severity of autoimmune encephalitis (AE). In this study, we aimed to develop a novel scale for rating severity in patients with diverse AE syndromes and to verify the reliability and validity of the developed scale.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The key items were generated by a panel of experts and selected according to content validity ratios. The developed scale was initially applied to 50 patients with AE (development cohort) to evaluate its acceptability, reproducibility, internal consistency, and construct validity. Then, the scale was applied to another independent cohort (validation cohort, n = 38).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A new scale consisting of 9 items (seizure, memory dysfunction, psychiatric symptoms, consciousness, language problems, dyskinesia/dystonia, gait instability and ataxia, brainstem dysfunction, and weakness) was developed. Each item was assigned a value of up to 3 points. The total score could therefore range from 0 to 27. We named the scale the Clinical Assessment Scale in Autoimmune Encephalitis (CASE). The new scale showed excellent interobserver (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.97) and intraobserver (ICC = 0.96) reliability for total scores, was highly correlated with modified Rankin scale (<i>r</i> = 0.86, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and had acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach α = 0.88). Additionally, in the validation cohort, the scale showed high interobserver reliability (ICC = 0.99) and internal consistency (Cronbach α = 0.92).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>CASE is a novel clinical scale for AE with a high level of clinimetric properties. It would be suitable for application in clinical practice and might help overcome the limitations of current outcome scales for AE. <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:352–358.</b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Recently identified mutations of the axon guidance molecule receptor gene, <i>DCC,</i> present an opportunity to investigate, in living human brain, mechanisms affecting neural connectivity and the basis of mirror movements, involuntary contralateral responses that mirror voluntary unilateral actions. We hypothesized that haploinsufficient <i>DCC</i>
<sup>+/−</sup> mutation carriers with mirror movements would exhibit decreased <i>DCC</i> mRNA expression, a functional ipsilateral corticospinal tract, greater “mirroring” motor representations, and reduced interhemispheric inhibition. <i>DCC</i>
<sup>+/−</sup> mutation carriers without mirror movements might exhibit some of these features.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The participants (n = 52) included 13 <i>DCC</i>
<sup>+/−</sup> mutation carriers with mirror movements, 7 <i>DCC</i>
<sup>+/−</sup> mutation carriers without mirror movements, 13 relatives without the mutation or mirror movements, and 19 unrelated healthy volunteers. The multimodal approach comprised quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) under resting and task conditions, and measures of white matter integrity.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Mirror movements were associated with reduced <i>DCC</i> mRNA expression, increased ipsilateral TMS‐induced motor evoked potentials, increased fMRI responses in the mirroring M1 and cerebellum, and markedly reduced interhemispheric inhibition. The <i>DCC</i>
<sup>+/−</sup> mutation, irrespective of mirror movements, was associated with reduced functional connectivity and white matter integrity.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Diverse connectivity abnormalities were identified in mutation carriers with and without mirror movements, but corticospinal effects and decreased peripheral <i>DCC</i> mRNA appeared driven by the mirror movement phenotype. <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:433–442.</b></p>

<p>Disorders of consciousness (DOC) are a common consequence of severe brain injuries, and clinical evaluation is critical to provide a correct diagnosis and prognosis.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate the initial termination rate of status epilepticus (SE) in a large observational study and explore associated variables.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Data of adults treated for SE were collected prospectively in centers in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, during 4.5 years. Incident episodes of 1,049 patients were analyzed using uni‐ and multivariate statistics to determine factors predicting cessation of SE within 1 hour (for generalized convulsive SE [GCSE]) and 12 hours (for non‐GCSE) of initiating treatment.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Median age at SE onset was 70 years; most frequent etiologies were remote (32%) and acute (31%). GCSE was documented in 43%. Median latency between SE onset and first treatment was 30 minutes in GCSE and 150 minutes in non‐GCSE. The first intravenous compound was a benzodiazepine in 86% in GCSE and 73% in non‐GCSE. Bolus doses of the first treatment step were lower than recommended by current guidelines in 76% of GCSE patients and 78% of non‐GCSE patients. In 319 GCSE patients (70%), SE was ongoing 1 hour after initiating treatment and in 342 non‐GCSE patients (58%) 12 hours after initiating treatment. Multivariate Cox regression demonstrated that use of benzodiazepines as first treatment step and a higher cumulative dose of anticonvulsants within the first period of treatment were associated with shorter time to cessation of SE for both groups.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In clinical practice, treatment guidelines were not followed in a substantial proportion of patients. This underdosing correlated with lack of cessation of SE. Our data suggest that sufficiently dosed benzodiazepines should be used as a first treatment step. <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:421–432.</b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The two related tumor necrosis factor members a proliferation‐inducing ligand (APRIL) and B‐cell activation factor (BAFF) are currently targeted in autoimmune diseases as B‐cell regulators. In multiple sclerosis (MS), combined APRIL/BAFF blockade led to unexpected exacerbated inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS) of patients. Here, we investigate the role of the APRIL/BAFF axis in the CNS.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>APRIL expression was analyzed in MS lesions by immunohistochemistry. The <i>in vivo</i> role of APRIL was assessed in the murine MS model, experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE). Functional <i>in vitro</i> studies were performed with human and mouse astrocytes.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>APRIL was expressed in lesions from EAE. In its absence, the disease was worst. Lesions from MS patients also showed APRIL expression upon infiltration of macrophages. Notably, all the APRIL secreted by these macrophages specifically targeted astrocytes. The upregulation of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, sometimes bearing chondroitin sulfate of type E sugar moieties, binding APRIL, in reactive astrocytes explained the latter selectivity. Astrocytes responded to APRIL by producing a sufficient amount of IL‐10 to dampen antigen‐specific T‐cell proliferation and pathogenic cytokine secretion. Finally, an intraspinal delivery of recombinant APRIL before disease onset, shortly reduced EAE symptoms. Repeated intravenous injections of recombinant APRIL before and even at disease onset also had an effect.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our data show that APRIL mediates an anti‐inflammatory response from astrocytes in MS lesions. This protective activity is not shared with BAFF. <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:406–420.</b></p>

<p>High levels of antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) are observed in patients with different neurological disorders, but cells producing these autoantibodies are largely unexplored. We detect circulating GAD‐reactive B cells in peripheral blood that readily differentiate into antibody‐producing cells. These cells are highly elevated in most patients with GAD‐antibody–associated disorders (n = 15) compared to controls (n = 19). They mainly produce GAD65 antibodies of the IgG1 and IgG4 subclasses and are as abundant as B cells reactive for common recall antigens. Bone marrow cells represent an additional source of GAD antibodies. The identification of GAD‐antibody–producing cells has implications for the selection of cell‐specific biologics. <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:448–454.</b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by variable motor and behavioral symptoms attributed to major neuropathology of mainly the basal ganglia and cerebral cortex. The role of the cerebellum, a brain region involved in the coordination of movements, in HD neuropathology has been controversial. This study utilizes postmortem human brain tissue to investigate whether Purkinje cell degeneration in the neocerebellum is present in HD, and how this relates to disease symptom profiles.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Unbiased stereological counting methods were used to quantify the total number of Purkinje cells in 15 HD cases and 8 neurologically normal control cases. Based on their predominant symptoms, the HD cases were categorized into 2 groups: “motor” or “mood.”</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The results demonstrated a significant 43% loss of Purkinje cells in HD cases with predominantly motor symptoms, and no cell loss in cases showing a major mood phenotype. There was no significant correlation between Purkinje cell loss and striatal neuropathological grade, postmortem delay, CAG repeat in the <i>IT15</i> gene, or age at death.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study shows a compelling relationship between Purkinje cell loss in the HD neocerebellum and the HD motor symptom phenotype, which, together with our previous human brain studies on the same HD cases, provides novel perspectives interrelating and correlating the variable cerebellar, basal ganglia, and neocortical neuropathology with the variability of motor/mood symptom profiles in the human HD brain. <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:396–405.</b></p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p><i>SLC13A3</i> encodes the plasma membrane Na<sup>+</sup>/dicarboxylate cotransporter 3, which imports inside the cell 4 to 6 carbon dicarboxylates as well as N‐acetylaspartate (NAA). SLC13A3 is mainly expressed in kidney, in astrocytes, and in the choroid plexus. We describe two unrelated patients presenting with acute, reversible (and recurrent in one) neurological deterioration during a febrile illness. Both patients exhibited a reversible leukoencephalopathy and a urinary excretion of α‐ketoglutarate (αKG) that was markedly increased and persisted over time. In one patient, increased concentrations of cerebrospinal fluid NAA and dicarboxylates (including αKG) were observed. Extensive workup was unsuccessful, and a genetic cause was suspected.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed. Our teams were connected through GeneMatcher.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>WES analysis revealed variants in <i>SLC13A3</i>. A homozygous missense mutation (p.Ala254Asp) was found in the first patient. The second patient was heterozygous for another missense mutation (p.Gly548Ser) and an intronic mutation affecting splicing as demonstrated by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction performed in muscle tissue (c.1016 + 3A &gt; G). Mutations and segregation were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Functional studies performed on HEK293T cells transiently transfected with wild‐type and mutant SLC13A3 indicated that the missense mutations caused a marked reduction in the capacity to transport αKG, succinate, and NAA.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>SLC13A3 deficiency causes acute and reversible leukoencephalopathy with marked accumulation of αKG. Urine organic acids (especially αKG and NAA) and <i>SLC13A3</i> mutations should be screened in patients presenting with unexplained reversible leukoencephalopathy, for which SLC13A3 deficiency is a novel differential diagnosis. <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:385–395.</b></p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>To validate imaging features able to discriminate neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders from multiple sclerosis with conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this cross‐sectional study, brain and spinal cord scans were evaluated from 116 neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder patients (98 seropositive and 18 seronegative) in chronic disease phase and 65 age‐, sex‐, and disease duration–matched multiple sclerosis patients. To identify independent predictors of neuromyelitis optica diagnosis, after assessing the prevalence of typical/atypical findings, the original cohort was 2:1 randomized in a training sample (where a multivariate logistic regression analysis was run) and a validation sample (where the performance of the selected variables was tested and validated).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Typical brain lesions occurred in 50.9% of neuromyelitis optica patients (18.1% brainstem periventricular/periaqueductal, 32.7% periependymal along lateral ventricles, 3.4% large hemispheric, 6.0% diencephalic, 4.3% corticospinal tract), 72.2% had spinal cord lesions (46.3% long transverse myelitis, 36.1% short transverse myelitis), 37.1% satisfied 2010 McDonald criteria, and none had cortical lesions. Fulfillment of at least 2 of 5 of absence of juxtacortical/cortical lesions, absence of periventricular lesions, absence of Dawson fingers, presence of long transverse myelitis, and presence of periependymal lesions along lateral ventricles discriminated neuromyelitis optica patients in both training (sensitivity = 0.92, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.84–0.97; specificity = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.78–0.97) and validation samples (sensitivity = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.66–0.92; specificity = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.71–0.99). MRI findings and criteria performance were similar irrespective of serostatus.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Although up to 50% of neuromyelitis optica patients have no typical lesions and a relatively high percentage of them satisfy multiple sclerosis criteria, several easily applicable imaging features can help to distinguish neuromyelitis optica from multiple sclerosis. <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:371–384.</b></p>

<p>The amyloid‐β (Aβ) cascade hypothesis of Alzheimer disease (AD) holds that brain accumulation of Aβ initiates the disease process. Accordingly, drug research has targeted Aβ production, clearance, and deposition as therapeutic strategies. Unfortunately, candidate drugs have failed to show clinical benefit in established, early, or prodromal disease, or in those with high AD risk. Currently, monoclonal antibodies specifically directed against the most neurotoxic Aβ forms are undergoing large‐scale trials to confirm initially encouraging results. However, recent findings on the normal physiology of Aβ suggest that accumulation may be compensatory rather than the pathological initiator. If this is true, alternative strategies will be needed to defeat this devastating disease. <b>ANN NEUROL 2019;85:303–315.</b></p>

Abstract
<p>Several influential theories of consciousness attempt to explain how, when and where conscious perception arises in the brain. The extent of conscious perception of a stimulus is often probed by asking subjects to provide confidence estimations in their choices in challenging perceptual decision-making tasks. Here, we aimed to dissociate neural patterns of "cognitive" and "sensory" information maintenance by linking category selective visual processes to decision confidence using multivariate decoding techniques on human EEG data. Participants discriminated at-threshold masked face versus house stimuli and reported confidence in their discrimination performance. Three distinct types of category-selective neural activity patterns were observed, dissociable by their timing, scalp topography, relationship with decision confidence, and generalization profile. An early (~150–200 ms) decoding profile was unrelated to confidence and quickly followed by two distinct decodable patterns of late neural activity (350–500 ms). One pattern was on<i>-</i>diagonal, global and highly related to decision confidence, likely indicating cognitive maintenance of consciously reportable stimulus representations. The other pattern however was off-diagonal, restricted to posterior electrode sites (local), and independent of decision confidence, and therefore may reflect sensory maintenance of category-specific information, possibly operating via recurrent processes within visual cortices. These results highlight that two functionally independent neural processes are operating in parallel, only one of which is related to decision confidence and conscious access.</p>

Abstract
<p>The periaqueductal gray (PAG) is a significant modulator of both analgesic and fear behaviors in both humans and rodents, but the underlying circuitry responsible for these two phenotypes is incompletely understood. Importantly, it is not known if there is a way to produce analgesia without anxiety by targeting the PAG, as modulation of glutamate or GABA neurons in this area initiates both antinociceptive and anxiogenic behavior. While dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventrolateral PAG (vlPAG)/dorsal raphe display a supraspinal antinociceptive effect, their influence on anxiety and fear are unknown. Using DAT-cre and Vglut2-cre male mice, we introduced designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD) to DA and glutamate neurons within the vlPAG using viral-mediated delivery and found that levels of analgesia were significant and quantitatively similar when DA and glutamate neurons were selectively stimulated. Activation of glutamatergic neurons, however, reliably produced higher indices of anxiety, with increased freezing time and more time spent in the safety of a dark enclosure. In contrast, animals in which PAG/dorsal raphe DA neurons were stimulated failed to show fear behaviors. DA-mediated antinociception was inhibitable by haloperidol and was sufficient to prevent persistent inflammatory pain induced by carrageenan. In summary, only activation of DA neurons in the PAG/dorsal raphe produced profound analgesia without signs of anxiety, indicating that PAG/dorsal raphe DA neurons are an important target involved in analgesia that may lead to new treatments for pain.</p>

<p>Inspired by the adaptation phenomenon of biological neuronal firing rate, we
propose regularity normalization: a reparameterization of the activation in the
neural network that take into account the statistical regularity in the
implicit space. By considering the neural network optimization process as a
model selection problem, the implicit space is constrained by the normalizing
factor, the minimum description length of the optimal universal code. We
introduce an incremental version of computing this universal code as normalized
maximum likelihood and demonstrated its flexibility to include data prior such
as top-down attention and other oracle information and its compatibility to be
incorporated into batch normalization and layer normalization. The preliminary
empirical results are inconclusive regarding its advantages in tackling the
limited and imbalanced data from a non-stationary distribution benchmarked on
computer vision task. This biologically plausible normalization, however, has
the potential to deal with other complicated real-world scenarios - further
research are proposed to discover these scenarios and explore the behaviors
among different variants.

<p>Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) is the predominant method for inferring
effective connectivity from neuroimaging data. In the 15 years since its
introduction, the neural models and statistical routines in DCM have developed
in parallel, driven by the needs of researchers in cognitive and clinical
neuroscience. In this tutorial, we step through an exemplar fMRI analysis in
detail, reviewing the current implementation of DCM and demonstrating recent
developments in group-level connectivity analysis. In the first part of the
tutorial (current paper), we focus on issues specific to DCM for fMRI,
unpacking the relevant theory and highlighting practical considerations. In
particular, we clarify the assumptions (i.e., priors) used in DCM for fMRI and
how to interpret the model parameters. This tutorial is accompanied by all the
necessary data and instructions to reproduce the analyses using the SPM
software. In the second part (in a companion paper), we move from subject-level
to group-level modelling using the Parametric Empirical Bayes framework, and
illustrate how to test for commonalities and differences in effective
connectivity across subjects, based on imaging data from any modality.

<p>Avalanches whose sizes and durations are distributed as power laws appear in
many contexts. Here, we show that there is a hidden peril in thresholding
continuous times series --either from empirical or synthetic data-- for the
detection of avalanches. In particular, we consider two possible alternative
definitions of avalanche size used e.g. in the empirical determination of
avalanche exponents in the analysis of neural-activity data. By performing
analytical and computational studies of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process (taken as
a guiding example) we show that if (i) relatively large threshold values are
employed to determine the beginning and ending of avalanches and if (ii) --as
sometimes done in the literature-- avalanche sizes are defined as the total
area (above zero) of the avalanche, then true asymptotic scaling behavior is
not seen, instead the observations are dominated by transient effects. These
can induce misinterpretations of the resulting scaling regimes as well as to a
wrong assignation of universality classes.

<p>Maintaining upright posture is a complex task governed by the integration of
afferent sensorimotor and visual information with compensatory neuromuscular
reactions. The objective of this work was to characterize the visual dependency
and functional dynamics of cortical activation during postural control.
Proprioceptic vibratory stimulation of calf muscles at 85 Hz was performed to
evoke postural perturbation in open-eye (OE) and closed-eye (CE) experimental
trials, with pseudorandom binary stimulation phases divided into four segments
of 16 stimuli. 64-channel EEG was recorded; with perturbation epochs defined
using bipolar electrodes placed proximal to each vibrator. Finally, functional
connectivity assessment was explored via network segregation and integration
analyses. Spectra variation showed waveform and vision-dependent activation
within cortical regions specific to both postural adaptation and habituation.
Generalized spectral variation yielded significant shifts from low to high
frequencies in CE adaptation trials, with overall activity suppressed in
habituation; OE trials showed the opposite phenomenon, with both adaptation and
habituation yielding increases in spectral power. Finally, our analysis of
functional dynamics reveals novel cortical networks implicated in postural
control using EEG source-space brain networks. In particular, our reported
significant increase in local theta connectivity may signify the planning of
corrective steps and/or the analysis of falling consequences, while alpha band
network integration results reflect an inhibition of error detection within the
cingulate cortex, likely due to habituation. Our findings suggest that specific
cortical waveforms are dependent upon the availability of visual feedback, and
we present the first evidence that local and global brain networks undergo
characteristic modification during postural control.

<p>Echolocating bats locate the targets by echolocation. Many theoretical
frameworks have been suggested the abilities of bats are related to the shapes
of bats ears, but few artificial bat-like ears have been made to mimic the
abilities, the difficulty of which lies in the determination of the elevation
angle of the target. In this study, we present a device with artificial bat
pinnae modeling by the ears of brown long-eared bat (Plecotus auritus) which
can accurately estimate the elevation angle of the aerial target by virtue of
active sonar. An artificial neural-network with the labeled data obtained from
echoes as the trained and tested data is used and optimized by a tenfold
cross-validation technique. A decision method we named sliding window averaging
algorithm is designed for getting the estimation results of elevation. At last,
a right-angle pinnae construction is designed for determining direction of the
target. The results show a higher accuracy for the direction determination of
the single target. The results also demonstrate that for the Plecotus auritus
bat, not only the binaural shapes, but the binaural relative orientations also
play important roles in the target localization.

<p>Robust motifs are graphs associated to threshold-linear networks (TLNs) for
which the structure of fixed points is independent of the choice of
connectivity matrix $W$. In this work we describe infinite families of robust
motifs, and use them to completely characterize all robust motifs for networks

the associated TLNs, making them ideal candidates for constructing network
architectures whose dynamics are robust despite allowing great flexibility in
the choice of $W$.

<p>Movement experience and the coordination of perception and action are the
basis of developing body awareness, emotion, motivation and cognition and the
sense of self. The four limbs play a key role in the developing sense of body
ownership, agency and peripersonal space. Neonatal limb movements were
investigated respective processes of self-organization and developing body
awareness. Application of symbolic dynamics to kinematic data of radial
distance trajectories of the hands and feet determined 16 coordination patterns
according to the distance of the effectors to the body center. From time series
analysis of occurrence and recurrence of these configurations of 25 movement
episodes of 14 infants both characteristics of self-organization as well as
features assumed to provide neonates with experiences involved in the
development of body awareness were found. With increasing age a shift from
configurations with proximal to distal positions suggests a role of the
proximal-distal dimension in movement development. We conclude that
self-organization in spontaneous movements provides neonates with perceptual
body- and self-specifying stimuli involved in developing body awareness and
postulate the involvement of emotional and cognitive processes.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/42806">Membrane bridging by Munc13-1 is crucial for neurotransmitter release</a></h4>

Munc13-1 plays a crucial role in neurotransmitter release. We recently proposed that the C-terminal region encompassing the C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>B, MUN and C<sub>2</sub>C domains of Munc13-1 (C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C) bridges the synaptic vesicle and plasma membranes through interactions involving the C<sub>2</sub>C domain and the C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>2</sub>B region. However, the physiological relevance of this model has not been demonstrated. Here we show that C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C bridges membranes through opposite ends of its elongated structure. Mutations in putative membrane-binding sites of the C<sub>2</sub>C domain disrupt the ability of C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub>BMUNC<sub>2</sub>C to bridge liposomes and to mediate liposome fusion in vitro. These mutations lead to corresponding disruptive effects on synaptic vesicle docking, priming, and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered neurotransmitter release in mouse neurons. Remarkably, these effects include an almost complete abrogation of release by a single residue substitution in this 200 kDa protein. These results show that bridging the synaptic vesicle and plasma membranes is a central function of Munc13-1.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41535">Coding of whisker motion across the mouse face</a></h4>

Haptic perception synthesizes touch with proprioception, the sense of body position. Humans and mice alike experience rich active touch of the face. Because most facial muscles lack proprioceptor endings, the sensory basis of facial proprioception remains unsolved. Facial proprioception may instead rely on mechanoreceptors that encode both touch and self-motion. In rodents, whisker mechanoreceptors provide a signal that informs the brain about whisker position. Whisking involves coordinated orofacial movements, so mechanoreceptors innervating facial regions other than whiskers could also provide information about whisking. To define all sources of sensory information about whisking available to the brain, we recorded spikes from mechanoreceptors innervating diverse parts of the face. Whisker motion was encoded best by whisker mechanoreceptors, but also by those innervating whisker pad hairy skin and supraorbital vibrissae. Redundant self-motion responses may provide the brain with a stable proprioceptive signal despite mechanical perturbations during active touch.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/39404">Control of entropy in neural models of environmental state</a></h4>

Humans and animals construct internal models of their environment in order to select appropriate courses of action. The representation of uncertainty about the current state of the environment is a key feature of these models that controls the rate of learning as well as directly affecting choice behaviour. To maintain flexibility, given that uncertainty naturally decreases over time, most theoretical inference models include a dedicated mechanism to drive up model uncertainty. Here we probe the long-standing hypothesis that noradrenaline is involved in determining the uncertainty, or entropy, and thus flexibility, of neural models. Pupil diameter, which indexes neuromodulatory state including noradrenaline release, predicted increases (but not decreases) in entropy in a neural state model encoded in human medial orbitofrontal cortex, as measured using multivariate functional MRI. Activity in anterior cingulate cortex predicted pupil diameter. These results provide evidence for top-down, neuromodulatory control of entropy in neural state models.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/564211v1?rss=1">Differential effects of diet and weight on taste responses in diet-induced obese mice</a></h4>

The ever growing obesity epidemic has created a need to develop a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms responsible for this condition. Appetite and consumption are directly influenced by the taste system which determines if potential food items will be ingested or rejected. While previous studies have reported that obese individuals have reduced taste perception, the relationship between these processes is still poorly understood. Earlier work has demonstrated that diet-induced obesity (DIO) directly impairs taste responses, particularly for sweet stimuli. These deficits occurred in the cells located in the oral cavity as well as in the behavioral responses. However, it is not clear if these changes to the taste system are due to obesity or to the high fat diet exposure. The goal of the current study was to determine if diet or excess weight is responsible for the DIO induced taste deficits. Using a combination of live cell imaging, brief-access licking, immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR, we have found that diet and weight gain can each selectivity affect taste. Follow up experiments determined that two key signaling proteins, gustducin and phospholipase C{beta}2, are significantly reduced in the high fat diet without weight gain and obese mice, identifying a potential mechanism for the reduced taste responsiveness to some stimuli. Our data indicate that the relationship between obesity and taste is complex and reveal that for some stimuli, diet alone can cause taste deficits, even without the onset of obesity.

Ticks are second only to mosquitoes as vectors of disease to humans and animals. Commercial insect repellents reduce or prevent potentially infectious tick bites by disrupting tick host-seeking behavior. Tick host-seeking is mainly ascribed to the Haller's organ, a complex sensory structure on the tick foreleg that detects odors, carbon dioxide and heat, but these host-seeking mechanisms and the mechanism of their disruption by repellents are not well understood. There is anecdotal evidence that ticks and other ectoparasites are attracted to heat, but it has never been demonstrated that they use radiant heat to detect hosts at a distance. In fact, previous attempts to do this have concluded that radiant heat is not used by ticks. Here we show that Amblyomma americanum and Dermacentor variabilis ticks can sense and home in on a human from several meters away, guided by radiant heat sensed by the Haller's organ, and specifically the capsule, a covered spherical pit organ. An aperture in the capsule cover confers directionality and highly reflective interior surfaces of the capsule provide high sensitivity. Low concentrations of the insect repellents DEET, picaridin, 2-undecanone, citronellal and nootkatone eliminate thermotaxis without affecting olfactory-stimulated host-seeking behavior. Our results demonstrate that the tick Haller's organ capsule is a radiant heat sensor used in host-finding and that repellents disrupt this sense at concentrations that do not disrupt olfaction. We anticipate this discovery to significantly aid insect repellent research and development of innovative strategies for protection against ectoparasites and vector-borne disease.

The studies described in this paper for the first time characterize the acute and chronic performance of optically transparent thin-film ECoG grids implanted on a thinned skull as both an electrophysiological complement to existing thinned skull preparation for optical recordings/manipulations, and a less invasive alternative to epidural or subdurally placed ECoG arrays. In a longitudinal chronic study, ECoG grids placed on top of a thinned skull maintain impedances comparable to epidurally placed ECoG grids that are stable for periods of at least one month. Optogenetic activation of cortex is also reliably demonstrated through the optically transparent ECoG grids acutely placed on the thinned skull. Finally, spatially distinct electrophysiological recordings were evident on ECoG electrodes placed on a thinned skull separated by 500-750 micrometers, as assessed by stimulation evoked responses using optogenetic activation of cortex as well as invasive and epidermal stimulation of the sciatic and median nerve at chronic time points. Neural signals were collected through a thinned skull in multiple species, demonstrating potential utility in neuroscience research applications such as in vivo imaging, optogenetics, calcium imaging, and neurovascular coupling.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/563809v1?rss=1">Joint modelling of diffusion MRI and microscopy</a></h4>

The combination of diffusion MRI with microscopy provides unique opportunities to study microstructural features of tissue, particularly when acquired in the same sample. Microscopy is frequently used to validate diffusion MRI microstructure models, addressing the indirect nature of dMRI signals. Typically, these modalities are analysed separately, and microscopy is taken as a gold standard against which dMRI-derived parameters are validated. Here we propose an alternative approach in which we combine diffusion MRI and microscopy data obtained from the same tissue sample to drive a single, joint model. This simultaneous analysis allows us to take advantage of the breadth of information provided by complementary data acquired from different modalities. By applying this framework to a spherical-deconvolution analysis, we are able to overcome a known degeneracy between fibre dispersion and radial diffusion. Spherical-deconvolution based approaches typically estimate a global fibre response function to determine the fibre orientation distribution in each voxel. However, the assumption of a 'brain-wide' fibre response function may be challenged if the diffusion characteristics of white matter vary across the brain. Using a generative joint dMRI-histology model, we demonstrate that the fibre response function is dependent on local anatomy, and that current spherical-deconvolution based models may be overestimating dispersion and underestimating the number of distinct fibre populations per voxel.

People sometimes anticipate specific words during language comprehension. Consistent with word anticipation, pre-nominal articles elicit differential neural activity when they mismatch the gender of a predictable noun compared with when they match. However, the functional significance of this pre-nominal effect is unclear: Do people only predict the noun or do they predict the entire article-noun combination? We addressed this question in an event-related potential study (N=48) with pre-registered data acquisition and analyses, capitalizing on gender-marking on Dutch definite articles and the lack thereof on indefinite articles. Participants read mini-story contexts that strongly suggested either a definite or indefinite noun phrase (e.g., 'het/een boek', the/a book) as its best continuation, followed by a definite noun phrase with the expected noun or an unexpected, different gender noun ('het boek/de roman', the book/the novel). We observed an enhanced negativity (N400) for articles that were unexpectedly definite or mismatched the expected gender, with the former effect being strongest. Pre-registered analyses and exploratory Bayesian analyses did not yield convincing evidence that the effect of gender-mismatch depended on expected definiteness. While prediction of article form cannot be excluded, it may not be required to elicit pre-nominal effects.

Endogenous processes allow the maintenance of working memories. These processes presumably involve prefrontal networks with strong recurrent connections. Distractors evoke a morphing of the population code, even when memories are stable. But it is unclear whether these dynamic population responses contain stable memory information. Here we show that dynamic prefrontal activity contains stable memory information, and the stability depends on parallel movement of trajectories associated with different memories in state space. We used an optimization algorithm to find a subspace with stable memory information. In correct trials the stability extended to periods that were not used to find the subspace, but in error trials the information and the stability were reduced. A bump attractor model was able to replicate these behaviors. The model provided predictions that could be confirmed with the neural data. We conclude that downstream regions could read memory information from a stable subspace.

Background: Across the animal kingdom, responses in auditory cortex are dampened during vocalizing compared to passive listening, reflecting the action of the corollary discharge mechanism. In humans, it is seen as suppression of the EEG-based N1 event-related potential, with less N1-suppression seen in people with schizophrenia and those at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis. Because N1 is an admixture of theta (4-7Hz) power and phase synchrony, we asked which is responsible for N1 effects and if they outperform the sensitivity of N1 to corollary discharge and schizophrenia. Methods: Theta phase and power values were extracted from EEG data acquired from CHR youth (n=71), early illness schizophrenia patients (ESZ; n=84), and healthy controls (HC; n=103) as they said /ah/ (Talk) and then listened to the sounds played back (Listen). A principal components analysis extracted theta inter-trial coherence (ITC; phase consistency) and event related spectral power, peaking in the N1 latency range. Results: Theta ITC-suppression (Cohen d=1.46) was greater than N1-suppression in HC (Cohen d=.63). Both were both reduced in ESZ, but only N1-suppression was reduced in CHR. When deprived of the variance shared with theta-ITC suppression, N1-suppression was no longer sensitive to HC vs. ESZ or HC vs. CHR group differences. Deficits in theta ITC-suppression were correlated with delusions (p=.007) in ESZ. Suppression of theta power was not affected by Group. Conclusions: Theta ITC-suppression may provide a simpler assay of the corollary discharge mechanism than N1-suppression. Deficits in circuits that generate low frequency oscillations may be an important component of schizophrenia.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/563346v1?rss=1">The complexity dividend: when sophisticated inference matters</a></h4>

Animals continuously infer latent properties of the world from noisy and changing observations. Complex approaches to this challenge such as Bayesian inference are accurate but cognitively demanding, requiring extensive working memory and adaptive learning. Simple strategies such as always using a prior bias or following the last observation are easy to implement but may be less accurate. What is the appropriate balance between complexity and accuracy? We construct a hierarchy of strategies that vary in complexity between these limits and find a power law of diminishing returns: increasing complexity gives progressively smaller gains in accuracy. Moreover, the rate at which the gain decrements depends systematically on the statistical uncertainty in the world, such that complex strategies do not provide substantial benefits over simple ones when uncertainty is too high or too low. In between, when the world is neither too predictable nor too unpredictable, there is a complexity dividend.

<p>by Gao Wang, Bo Peng</p>

Computationally intensive disciplines such as computational biology often require use of a variety of tools implemented in different scripting languages and analysis of large data sets using high-performance computing systems. Although scientific workflow systems can powerfully organize and execute large-scale data-analysis processes, creating and maintaining such workflows usually comes with nontrivial learning curves and engineering overhead, making them cumbersome to use for everyday data exploration and prototyping. To bridge the gap between interactive analysis and workflow systems, we developed Script of Scripts (SoS), an interactive data-analysis platform and workflow system with a strong emphasis on readability, practicality, and reproducibility in daily computational research. For exploratory analysis, SoS has a multilanguage scripting format that centralizes otherwise-scattered scripts and creates dynamic reports for publication and sharing. As a workflow engine, SoS provides an intuitive syntax for creating workflows in process-oriented, outcome-oriented, and mixed styles, as well as a unified interface for executing and managing tasks on a variety of computing platforms with automatic synchronization of files among isolated file systems. As illustrated herein by real-world examples, SoS is both an interactive analysis tool and pipeline platform suitable for different stages of method development and data-analysis projects. In particular, SoS can be easily adopted in existing data analysis routines to substantially improve organization, readability, and cross-platform computation management of research projects.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_eq63JrmzU4" width="1" />

<p>by Jorge Fernandez-de-Cossio-Diaz, Roberto Mulet</p>

Continuous cultures of mammalian cells are complex systems displaying hallmark phenomena of nonlinear dynamics, such as multi-stability, hysteresis, as well as sharp transitions between different metabolic states. In this context mathematical models may suggest control strategies to steer the system towards desired states. Although even clonal populations are known to exhibit cell-to-cell variability, most of the currently studied models assume that the population is homogeneous. To overcome this limitation, we use the maximum entropy principle to model the phenotypic distribution of cells in a chemostat as a function of the dilution rate. We consider the coupling between cell metabolism and extracellular variables describing the state of the bioreactor and take into account the impact of toxic byproduct accumulation on cell viability. We present a formal solution for the stationary state of the chemostat and show how to apply it in two examples. First, a simplified model of cell metabolism where the exact solution is tractable, and then a genome-scale metabolic network of the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line. Along the way we discuss several consequences of heterogeneity, such as: qualitative changes in the dynamical landscape of the system, increasing concentrations of byproducts that vanish in the homogeneous case, and larger population sizes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YXzLvBRqBKs" width="1" />

<p>by Sarah C. Kramer, Jeffrey Shaman</p>

Accurate forecasts of influenza incidence can be used to inform medical and public health decision-making and response efforts. However, forecasting systems are uncommon in most countries, with a few notable exceptions. Here we use publicly available data from the World Health Organization to generate retrospective forecasts of influenza peak timing and peak intensity for 64 countries, including 18 tropical and subtropical countries. We find that accurate and well-calibrated forecasts can be generated for countries in temperate regions, with peak timing and intensity accuracy exceeding 50% at four and two weeks prior to the predicted epidemic peak, respectively. Forecasts are significantly less accurate in the tropics and subtropics for both peak timing and intensity. This work indicates that, in temperate regions around the world, forecasts can be generated with sufficient lead time to prepare for upcoming outbreak peak incidence.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fgxSpBSZBYY" width="1" />

<p>by Marzieh Ayati, Danica Wiredja, Daniela Schlatzer, Sean Maxwell, Ming Li, Mehmet Koyutürk, Mark R. Chance</p>

We present CoPhosK to predict kinase-substrate associations for phosphopeptide substrates detected by mass spectrometry (MS). The tool utilizes a Naïve Bayes framework with priors of known kinase-substrate associations (KSAs) to generate its predictions. Through the mining of MS data for the collective dynamic signatures of the kinases’ substrates revealed by correlation analysis of phosphopeptide intensity data, the tool infers KSAs in the data for the considerable body of substrates lacking such annotations. We benchmarked the tool against existing approaches for predicting KSAs that rely on static information (e.g. sequences, structures and interactions) using publically available MS data, including breast, colon, and ovarian cancer models. The benchmarking reveals that co-phosphorylation analysis can significantly improve prediction performance when static information is available (about 35% of sites) while providing reliable predictions for the remainder, thus tripling the KSAs available from the experimental MS data providing to a comprehensive and reliable characterization of the landscape of kinase-substrate interactions well beyond current limitations.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/P238-LP1vMA" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>Mutations in the <i>KCNV2</i> gene, which encodes the voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channel protein Kv8.2, cause a distinctive form of cone dystrophy with a supernormal rod response (CDSRR). Kv8.2 channel subunits only form functional channels when combined in a heterotetramer with Kv2.1 subunits encoded by the <i>KCNB1</i> gene. The CDSRR disease phenotype indicates that photoreceptor adaptation is disrupted. The electroretinogram (ERG) response of affected individuals shows depressed rod and cone activity, but what distinguishes this disease is the supernormal rod response to a bright flash of light. Here, we have utilized knock-out mutations of both genes in the mouse to study the pathophysiology of CDSRR. The Kv8.2 knock-out (KO) mice show many similarities to the human disorder, including a depressed a-wave and an elevated b-wave response with bright light stimulation. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging and immunohistochemistry indicate that the changes in six-month-old Kv8.2 KO retinae are largely limited to the outer nuclear layer (ONL), while outer segments appear intact. In addition, there is a significant increase in TUNEL<b>-</b>positive cells throughout the retina. The Kv2.1 KO and double KO mice also show a severely depressed a-wave, but the elevated b-wave response is absent. Interestingly, in all three KO genotypes, the c-wave is totally absent. The differential response shown here of these KO lines, that either possess homomeric channels or lack channels completely, has provided further insights into the role of K<sup>+</sup> channels in the generation of the a-, b-, and c-wave components of the ERG.</p>

<p>Stroke robustly stimulates adult neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. It is currently unknown whether this process induces beneficial or maladaptive effects, but morphological and behavioral studies have reported aberrant neurogenesis and impaired hippocampal-dependent memory following stroke. However, the intrinsic function and network incorporation of adult-born granule cells (ABGCs) after ischemia is unclear. Using patch-clamp electrophysiology, we evaluated doublecortin-positive (DCX<sup>+</sup>) ABGCs as well as DCX<sup>–</sup> dentate gyrus granule cells 2 weeks after a stroke or sham operation in DCX<i>/</i>DsRed transgenic mice of either sex. The developmental status, intrinsic excitability, and synaptic excitability of ABGCs were accelerated following stroke, while dendritic morphology was not aberrant. Regression analysis revealed uncoupled development of intrinsic and network excitability, resulting in young, intrinsically hyperexcitable ABGCs receiving disproportionately large glutamatergic inputs. This aberrant functional maturation in the subgroup of ABGCs in the hippocampus may contribute to defective hippocampal function and increased seizure susceptibility following stroke.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Stroke increases hippocampal neurogenesis but the functional consequences of the postlesional response is mostly unclear. Our findings provide novel evidence of aberrant functional maturation of newly generated neurons following stroke. We demonstrate that stroke not only causes an accelerated maturation of the intrinsic and synaptic parameters of doublecortin-positive, new granule cells in the hippocampus, but that this accelerated development does not follow physiological dynamics due to uncoupled intrinsic and synaptic maturation. Hyperexcitable immature neurons may contribute to disrupted network integration following stroke.</p>

<p>The acquisition of drug, including alcohol, use is associated with activation of the mesolimbic dopamine system. However, over the course of drug exposure the control over drug seeking progressively devolves to anterior dorsal striatum (aDLS) dopamine-dependent mechanisms. The causal importance of this functional recruitment of aDLS in the switch from controlled to compulsive drug use in vulnerable individuals remains to be established. Here we tested the hypothesis that individual differences in the susceptibility to aDLS dopamine-dependent control over alcohol seeking predicts and underlies the development of compulsive alcohol seeking. Male alcohol-preferring rats, the alcohol-preferring phenotype of which was confirmed in an intermittent two-bottle choice procedure, were implanted bilaterally with cannulae above the aDLS and trained instrumentally on a seeking–taking chained schedule of alcohol reinforcement until some individuals developed compulsive seeking behavior. The susceptibility to aDLS dopamine control over behavior was investigated before and after the development of compulsivity by measuring the extent to which bilateral aDLS infusions of the dopamine receptor antagonist α-flupenthixol (0, 5, 10, and 15 μg/side) decreased alcohol seeking at different stages of training, as follows: (1) after acquisition of instrumental taking responses for alcohol; (2) after alcohol-seeking behavior was well established; and (3) after the development of punishment-resistant alcohol seeking. Only alcohol-seeking, not alcohol-taking, responses became dependent on aDLS dopamine. Further, marked individual differences in the susceptibility of alcohol seeking to aDLS dopamine receptor blockade actually predicted the vulnerability to develop compulsive alcohol seeking, but only in subjects dependent on aDLS dopamine-dependent control.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Over the course of addictive drug exposure, there is a transition in the control over drug seeking from ventral to anterior dorsal striatum (aDLS) dopamine-dependent mechanisms, but it is unclear whether this is causally involved in the development of compulsive drug seeking. We tested the hypothesis that individual differences in the reliance of alcohol seeking on aDLS dopamine predicts and underlies the emergence of compulsive alcohol seeking. We identified individual differences in the reliance of well established alcohol seeking, but not taking behavior, on aDLS mechanisms and also showed that this predicted the subsequent development of compulsive alcohol-seeking behavior. Thus, those individuals in whom alcohol seeking depended on aDLS mechanisms were vulnerable subsequently to display compulsivity.</p>

<p>Many important situations require human observers to simultaneously search for more than one object. Despite a long history of research into visual search, the behavioral and neural mechanisms associated with multiple-target search are poorly understood. Here we test the novel theory that the efficiency of looking for multiple targets critically depends on the mode of cognitive control the environment affords to the observer. We used an innovative combination of electroencephalogram (EEG) and eye tracking while participants searched for two targets, within two different contexts: either both targets were present in the search display and observers were free to prioritize either one of them, thus enabling proactive control over selection; or only one of the two targets would be present in each search display, which requires reactive control to reconfigure selection when the wrong target has been prioritized. During proactive control, both univariate and multivariate signals of beta-band (15–35 Hz) power suppression before display onset predicted switches between target selections. This signal originated over midfrontal and sensorimotor regions and has previously been associated with endogenous state changes. In contrast, imposed target selections requiring reactive control elicited prefrontal power enhancements in the delta/theta band (2–8 Hz), but only after display onset. This signal predicted individual differences in associated oculomotor switch costs, reflecting reactive reconfiguration of target selection. The results provide compelling evidence that multiple target representations are differentially prioritized during visual search, and for the first time reveal distinct neural mechanisms underlying proactive and reactive control over multiple-target search.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Searching for more than one object in complex visual scenes can be detrimental for search performance. Although perhaps annoying in daily life, this can have severe consequences in professional settings such as medical and security screening. Previous research has not yet resolved whether multiple-target search involves changing priorities in what people attend to, and how such changes are controlled. We approached these questions by concurrently measuring cortical activity and eye movements using EEG and eye tracking while observers searched for multiple possible targets. Our findings provide the first unequivocal support for the existence of two modes of control during multiple-target search, which are expressed in qualitatively distinct time-frequency signatures of the EEG both before and after visual selection.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/9/1720?rss=1">Reduced Structural Connectivity Between Left Auditory Thalamus and the Motion-Sensitive Planum Temporale in Developmental Dyslexia</a></h4>

<p>Developmental dyslexia is characterized by the inability to acquire typical reading and writing skills. Dyslexia has been frequently linked to cerebral cortex alterations; however, recent evidence also points toward sensory thalamus dysfunctions: dyslexics showed reduced responses in the left auditory thalamus (medial geniculate body, MGB) during speech processing in contrast to neurotypical readers. In addition, in the visual modality, dyslexics have reduced structural connectivity between the left visual thalamus (lateral geniculate nucleus, LGN) and V5/MT, a cerebral cortex region involved in visual movement processing. Higher LGN-V5/MT connectivity in dyslexics was associated with the faster rapid naming of letters and numbers (RANln), a measure that is highly correlated with reading proficiency. Here, we tested two hypotheses that were directly derived from these previous findings. First, we tested the hypothesis that dyslexics have reduced structural connectivity between the left MGB and the auditory-motion-sensitive part of the left planum temporale (mPT). Second, we hypothesized that the amount of left mPT–MGB connectivity correlates with dyslexics RANln scores. Using diffusion tensor imaging-based probabilistic tracking, we show that male adults with developmental dyslexia have reduced structural connectivity between the left MGB and the left mPT, confirming the first hypothesis. Stronger left mPT–MGB connectivity was not associated with faster RANln scores in dyslexics, but was in neurotypical readers. Our findings provide the first evidence that reduced cortico-thalamic connectivity in the auditory modality is a feature of developmental dyslexia and it may also affect reading-related cognitive abilities in neurotypical readers.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Developmental dyslexia is one of the most widespread learning disabilities. Although previous neuroimaging research mainly focused on pathomechanisms of dyslexia at the cerebral cortex level, several lines of evidence suggest an atypical functioning of subcortical sensory structures. By means of diffusion tensor imaging, we here show that dyslexic male adults have reduced white matter connectivity in a cortico-thalamic auditory pathway between the left auditory motion-sensitive planum temporale and the left medial geniculate body. Connectivity strength of this pathway was associated with measures of reading fluency in neurotypical readers. This is novel evidence on the neurocognitive correlates of reading proficiency, highlighting the importance of cortico-subcortical interactions between regions involved in the processing of spectrotemporally complex sound.</p>

<p>The basal ganglia, especially the circuits originating from the putamen, are essential for controlling normal body movements. Notably, the putamen receives inputs not only from motor cortical areas but also from multiple sensory cortices. However, how these sensory signals are processed in the putamen remains unclear. We recorded the activity of tentative medium spiny neurons in the caudal part of the putamen when the monkey viewed many fractal objects. We found many neurons that responded to these objects, mostly in the ventral region. We called this region "putamen tail" (PUTt), as it is dorsally adjacent to "caudate tail" (CDt). Although PUTt and CDt are mostly separated by a thin layer of white matter, their neurons shared several features. Almost all of them had receptive fields in the contralateral hemifield. Moreover, their responses were object selective (i.e., variable across objects). The object selectivity was higher in the ventral region (i.e., CDt &gt; PUTt). Some neurons above PUTt, which we called the caudal–dorsal putamen (cdPUT), also responded to objects, but less selectively than PUTt. Next, we examined whether these visual neurons changed their responses based on the reward outcome. We found that many neurons encoded the values of many objects based on long-term memory, but not based on short-term memory. Such stable value responses were stronger in PUTt and CDt than in cdPUT. These results suggest that PUTt, together with CDt, controls saccade/attention among objects with different historical values, and may control other motor actions as well.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Although the putamen receives inputs not only from motor cortical areas but also from sensory cortical areas, how these sensory signals are processed remains unclear. Here we found that neurons in the caudal–ventral part of the putamen (putamen tail) process visual information including spatial and object features. These neurons discriminate many objects, first by their visual features and later by their reward values as well. Importantly, the value discrimination was based on long-term memory, but not on short-term memory. These results suggest that the putamen tail controls saccade/attention among objects with different historical values and might control other motor actions as well.</p>

<p>Figure-ground segregation is fundamental to listening in complex acoustic environments. An ongoing debate pertains to whether segregation requires attention or is "automatic" and preattentive. In this magnetoencephalography study, we tested a prediction derived from load theory of attention (e.g., Lavie, 1995) that segregation requires attention but can benefit from the automatic allocation of any "leftover" capacity under low load. Complex auditory scenes were modeled with stochastic figure-ground stimuli (Teki et al., 2013), which occasionally contained repeated frequency component "figures." Naive human participants (both sexes) passively listened to these signals while performing a visual attention task of either low or high load. While clear figure-related neural responses were observed under conditions of low load, high visual load substantially reduced the neural response to the figure in auditory cortex (planum temporale, Heschl's gyrus). We conclude that fundamental figure-ground segregation in hearing is not automatic but draws on resources that are shared across vision and audition.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This work resolves a long-standing question of whether figure-ground segregation, a fundamental process of auditory scene analysis, requires attention or is underpinned by automatic, encapsulated computations. Task-irrelevant sounds were presented during performance of a visual search task. We revealed a clear magnetoencephalography neural signature of figure-ground segregation in conditions of low visual load, which was substantially reduced in conditions of high visual load. This demonstrates that, although attention does not need to be actively allocated to sound for auditory segregation to occur, segregation depends on shared computational resources across vision and hearing. The findings further highlight that visual load can impair the computational capacity of the auditory system, even when it does not simply dampen auditory responses as a whole.</p>

<p>Environmental change can lead decision makers to shift rapidly among different behavioral regimes. These behavioral shifts can be accompanied by rapid changes in the firing pattern of neural networks. However, it is unknown what the populations of neurons that participate in such "network reset" phenomena are representing. Here, we investigated the following: (1) whether and where rapid changes in multivariate activity patterns are observable with fMRI during periods of rapid behavioral change and (2) what types of representations give rise to these phenomena. We did so by examining fluctuations in multivoxel patterns of BOLD activity from male and female human subjects making sequential inferences about the state of a partially observable and discontinuously changing variable. We found that, within the context of this sequential inference task, the multivariate patterns of activity in a number of cortical regions contain representations that change more rapidly during periods of uncertainty following a change in behavioral context. In motor cortex, this phenomenon was indicative of discontinuous change in behavioral outputs, whereas in visual regions, the same basic phenomenon was evoked by tracking of salient environmental changes. In most other cortical regions, including dorsolateral prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex, the phenomenon was most consistent with directly encoding the degree of uncertainty. However, in a few other regions, including orbitofrontal cortex, the phenomenon was best explained by representations of a shifting context that evolve more rapidly during periods of rapid learning. These representations may provide a dynamic substrate for learning that facilitates rapid disengagement from learned responses during periods of change.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Brain activity patterns tend to change more rapidly during periods of uncertainty and behavioral adjustment, yet the computational role of such rapid transitions is poorly understood. Here, we identify brain regions with fMRI BOLD activity patterns that change more rapidly during periods of behavioral adjustment and use computational modeling to attribute the phenomenon to specific causes. We demonstrate that the phenomenon emerges in different brain regions for different computational reasons, the most common being the representation of uncertainty itself, but that, in a selective subset of regions including orbitofrontal cortex, the phenomenon was best explained as a shifting latent state signal that may serve to control the degree to which recent temporal context affects ongoing expectations.</p>

<p>Neurons in primary visual cortex are strongly modulated both by stimulus contrast and by fluctuations of internal inputs. An important question is whether the population code is preserved under these conditions. Changes in stimulus contrast are thought to leave the population code invariant, whereas the effect of internal gain modulations remains unknown. To address these questions we studied how the direction-of-motion of oriented gratings is encoded in layer 2/3 primary visual cortex of mouse (with C57BL/6 background, of either sex). We found that, because contrast gain responses across cells are heterogeneous, a change in contrast alters the information distribution profile across cells leading to a violation of contrast invariance. Remarkably, internal input fluctuations that cause commensurate firing rate modulations at the single-cell level result in more homogeneous gain responses, respecting population code invariance. These observations argue that the brain strives to maintain the stability of the neural code in the face of fluctuating internal inputs.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neuronal responses are modulated both by stimulus contrast and by the spontaneous fluctuation of internal inputs. It is not well understood how these different types of input impact the population code. Specifically, it is important to understand whether the neural code stays invariant in the face of significant internal input modulations. Here, we show that changes in stimulus contrast lead to different optimal population codes, whereas spontaneous internal input fluctuations leave the population code invariant. This is because spontaneous internal input fluctuations modulate the gain of neuronal responses more homogeneously across cells compared to changes in stimulus contrast.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/9/1649?rss=1">Nonlinear Processing of Shape Information in Rat Lateral Extrastriate Cortex</a></h4>

<p>In rodents, the progression of extrastriate areas located laterally to primary visual cortex (V1) has been assigned to a putative object-processing pathway (homologous to the primate ventral stream), based on anatomical considerations. Recently, we found functional support for such attribution (Tafazoli et al., 2017), by showing that this cortical progression is specialized for coding object identity despite view changes, the hallmark property of a ventral-like pathway. Here, we sought to clarify what computations are at the base of such specialization. To this aim, we performed multielectrode recordings from V1 and laterolateral area LL (at the apex of the putative ventral-like hierarchy) of male adult rats, during the presentation of drifting gratings and noise movies. We found that the extent to which neuronal responses were entrained to the phase of the gratings sharply dropped from V1 to LL, along with the quality of the receptive fields inferred through reverse correlation. Concomitantly, the tendency of neurons to respond to different oriented gratings increased, whereas the sharpness of orientation tuning declined. Critically, these trends are consistent with the nonlinear summation of visual inputs that is expected to take place along the ventral stream, according to the predictions of hierarchical models of ventral computations and a meta-analysis of the monkey literature. This suggests an intriguing homology between the mechanisms responsible for building up shape selectivity and transformation tolerance in the visual cortex of primates and rodents, reasserting the potential of the latter as models to investigate ventral stream functions at the circuitry level.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Despite the growing popularity of rodents as models of visual functions, it remains unclear whether their visual cortex contains specialized modules for processing shape information. To addresses this question, we compared how neuronal tuning evolves from rat primary visual cortex (V1) to a downstream visual cortical region (area LL) that previous work has implicated in shape processing. In our experiments, LL neurons displayed a stronger tendency to respond to drifting gratings with different orientations while maintaining a sustained response across the whole duration of the drift cycle. These trends match the increased complexity of pattern selectivity and the augmented tolerance to stimulus translation found in monkey visual temporal cortex, thus revealing a homology between shape processing in rodents and primates.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/9/1631?rss=1">Mouse Parabrachial Neurons Signal a Relationship between Bitter Taste and Nociceptive Stimuli</a></h4>

<p>Taste and somatosensation both mediate protective behaviors. Bitter taste guides avoidance of ingestion of toxins while pain sensations, such as noxious heat, signal adverse conditions to ward off harm. Although brain pathways for taste and somatosensation are typically studied independently, prior data suggest that they intersect, potentially reflecting their common protective role. To investigate this, we applied electrophysiologic and optogenetic techniques in anesthetized mice of both sexes to evaluate relationships between oral somatosensory and taste activity in the parabrachial nucleus (PbN), implicated for roles in gustation and pain. Spikes were recorded from taste-active PbN neurons tested with oral delivery of thermal and chemesthetic stimuli, including agonists of nocisensitive transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels on somatosensory fibers. Gustatory neurons were also tested to follow electrical pulse stimulation of an oral somatosensory region of the spinal trigeminal subnucleus caudalis (Vc), which projects to the PbN. Neurons composed classic taste groups, including sodium, electrolyte, appetitive, or bitter cells. Across groups, most neurons spiked to Vc pulse stimulation, implying that trigeminal projections reach PbN gustatory neurons. Among such cells, a subpopulation responsive to the bitter taste stimuli quinine and cycloheximide, and aversive concentrations of sodium, cofired to agonists of nocisensitive TRP channels, including capsaicin, mustard oil, and noxious heat. Such neurons populated the lateral PbN. Further, nociceptive activity in PbN bitter taste neurons was suppressed during optogenetic-assisted inhibition of the Vc, implying convergent trigeminal input contributed to such activity. Our results reveal a novel role for PbN gustatory cells in cross-system signaling related to protection.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Prior data suggest that gustatory and trigeminal neural pathways intersect and overlap in the parabrachial area. However, no study has directly examined such overlap and why it may exist. Here we found that parabrachial gustatory neurons can receive afferent projections from trigeminal nuclei and fire to oral nociceptive stimuli that excite somatosensory receptors and fibers. Activation to aversive nociceptive stimuli in gustatory cells was associated with responding to behaviorally avoided bitter tastants. We were further able to show that silencing trigeminal projections inhibited nociceptive activity in parabrachial bitter taste neurons. Our results imply that in the parabrachial area, there is predictable overlap between taste and somatosensory processing related to protective coding and that classically defined taste neurons contribute to this process.</p>

<p>To provide organisms with a fitness advantage, circadian clocks have to react appropriately to changes in their environment. High-intensity (HI) light plays an essential role in the adaptation to hot summer days, which especially endanger insects of desiccation or prey visibility. Here, we show that solely increasing light intensity leads to an increased midday siesta in <i>Drosophila</i> behavior. Interestingly, this change is independent of the fly's circadian photoreceptor cryptochrome and is solely caused by a small visual organ, the Hofbauer–Buchner eyelets. Using receptor knock-downs, immunostaining, and recently developed calcium tools, we show that the eyelets activate key core clock neurons, namely the s-LN<sub>v</sub>s, at HI. This activation delays the decrease of PERIOD (PER) in the middle of the day and propagates to downstream target clock neurons that prolong the siesta. We show a new pathway for integrating light-intensity information into the clock network, suggesting new network properties and surprising parallels between <i>Drosophila</i> and the mammalian system.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The ability of animals to adapt to their ever-changing environment plays an important role in their fitness. A key player in this adaptation is the circadian clock. For animals to predict the changes of day and night, they must constantly monitor, detect and incorporate changes in the environment. The appropriate incorporation and reaction to high-intensity (HI) light is of special importance for insects because they might suffer from desiccation during hot summer days. We show here that different photoreceptors have specialized functions to integrate low-intensity, medium-intensity, or HI light into the circadian system in <i>Drosophila</i>. These results show surprising parallels to mammalian mechanisms, which also use different photoreceptor subtypes to respond to different light intensities.</p>

<p>Newborn dentate granule cells (DGCs) are generated in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) of rodents through a process called adult hippocampal neurogenesis, which is subjected to tight intrinsic and extrinsic regulation. The use of retroviruses encoding fluorescent proteins has allowed the characterization of the maturation dynamics of newborn DGCs, including their morphological development and the establishment and maturation of their afferent and efferent synaptic connections. However, the study of a crucial cellular compartment of these cells, namely, the axon initial segment (AIS), has remained unexplored to date. The AIS is not only the site of action potential initiation, but it also has a unique molecular identity that makes it one of the master regulators of neural plasticity and excitability. Here we examined the dynamics of AIS formation in newborn DGCs of young female adult C57BL/6J mice <i>in vivo</i>. Our data reveal notable changes in AIS length and thickness throughout cell maturation under physiological conditions and show that the most remarkable structural changes coincide with periods of intense morphological and functional remodeling. Moreover, we demonstrate that AIS development can be modulated extrinsically by both neuroprotective (environmental enrichment) and detrimental (lipopolysaccharide from <i>Escherichia coli</i>) stimuli.</p>

<p>Neurons have high plasticity in developmental and juvenile stages that decreases in adulthood. Mitochondrial dynamics are highly important in neurons to maintain normal function. To compare dependency on mitochondrial dynamics in juvenile and adult stages, we generated a mouse model capable of selective timing of the expression of a mutant of the mitochondrial fusion factor <i>Mitofusin 2</i> (<i>MFN2</i>). Mutant expression in the juvenile stage had lethal effects. Contrastingly, abnormalities did not manifest until 150 d after mutant expression during adulthood. After this silent 150 d period, progressive neurodegeneration, abnormal behaviors, and learning and memory deficits similar to those seen in human neurodegenerative diseases were observed. This indicates that abnormal neuronal mitochondrial dynamics seriously affect survival during early life stages and can also significantly damage brain function after maturation. Our findings highlight the need to consider the timing of disease onset in mimicking human neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> To compare the dependency on mitochondrial dynamics in neurons in juvenile and adult stages, we generated a mouse model expressing a mutant of the mitochondrial fusion factor <i>MFN2</i> in an arbitrary timing. Juvenile expression of the mutant showed acute and severe phenotypes and had lethal effects; however, post-adult expression induced delayed but progressive phenotypes resembling those found in human neurodegenerative diseases. Our results indicate that abnormal neuronal mitochondrial dynamics seriously affect survival during early life stages and can also significantly damage brain function after maturation. This strongly suggests that the timing of expression should be considered when establishing an animal model that closely resembles human neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/9/1566?rss=1">Gq-Coupled Muscarinic Receptor Enhancement of KCNQ2/3 Channels and Activation of TRPC Channels in Multimodal Control of Excitability in Dentate Gyrus Granule Cells</a></h4>

<p>KCNQ (Kv7, "M-type") K<sup>+</sup> channels and TRPC (transient receptor potential, "canonical") cation channels are coupled to neuronal discharge properties and are regulated via G<sub>q/11</sub>-protein-mediated signals. Stimulation of G<sub>q/11</sub>-coupled receptors both consumes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) via phosphalipase Cβ hydrolysis and stimulates PIP<sub>2</sub> synthesis via rises in Ca<sup>2+</sup><sub>i</sub> and other signals. Using brain-slice electrophysiology and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging from male and female mice, we characterized threshold K<sup>+</sup> currents in dentate gyrus granule cells (DGGCs) and CA1 pyramidal cells, the effects of G<sub>q/11</sub>-coupled muscarinic M<sub>1</sub> acetylcholine (M<sub>1</sub>R) stimulation on M current and on neuronal discharge properties, and elucidated the intracellular signaling mechanisms involved. We observed disparate signaling cascades between DGGCs and CA1 neurons. DGGCs displayed M<sub>1</sub>R enhancement of M-current, rather than suppression, due to stimulation of PIP<sub>2</sub> synthesis, which was paralleled by increased PIP<sub>2</sub>-gated G-protein coupled inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> currents as well. Deficiency of KCNQ2-containing M-channels ablated the M<sub>1</sub>R-induced enhancement of M-current in DGGCs. Simultaneously, M<sub>1</sub>R stimulation in DGGCs induced robust increases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, mostly due to TRPC currents, consistent with, and contributing to, neuronal depolarization and hyperexcitability. CA1 neurons did not display such multimodal signaling, but rather M current was suppressed by M<sub>1</sub>R stimulation in these cells, similar to the previously described actions of M<sub>1</sub>R stimulation on M-current in peripheral ganglia that mostly involves PIP<sub>2</sub> depletion. Therefore, these results point to a pleiotropic network of cholinergic signals that direct cell-type-specific, precise control of hippocampal function with strong implications for hyperexcitability and epilepsy.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> At the neuronal membrane, protein signaling cascades consisting of ion channels and metabotropic receptors govern the electrical properties and neurotransmission of neuronal networks. Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are G-protein-coupled metabotropic receptors that control the excitability of neurons through regulating ion channels, intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, and other second-messenger cascades. We have illuminated previously unknown actions of muscarinic stimulation on the excitability of hippocampal principal neurons that include M channels, TRPC (transient receptor potential, "canonical") cation channels, and powerful regulation of lipid metabolism. Our results show that these signaling pathways, and mechanisms of excitability, are starkly distinct between peripheral ganglia and brain, and even between different principal neurons in the hippocampus.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/9/1552?rss=1">Latent Sex Differences in Molecular Signaling That Underlies Excitatory Synaptic Potentiation in the Hippocampus</a></h4>

<p>Excitatory synapses can be potentiated by chemical neuromodulators, including 17β-estradiol (E2), or patterns of synaptic activation, as in long-term potentiation (LTP). Here, we investigated kinases and calcium sources required for acute E2-induced synaptic potentiation in the hippocampus of each sex and tested whether sex differences in kinase signaling extend to LTP. We recorded EPSCs from CA1 pyramidal cells in hippocampal slices from adult rats and used specific inhibitors of kinases and calcium sources. This revealed that, although E2 potentiates synapses to the same degree in each sex, cAMP-activated protein kinase (PKA) is required to initiate potentiation only in females. In contrast, mitogen-activated protein kinase, Src tyrosine kinase, and rho-associated kinase are required for initiation in both sexes; similarly, Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-activated kinase II is required for expression/maintenance of E2-induced potentiation in both sexes. Calcium source experiments showed that L-type calcium channels and calcium release from internal stores are both required for E2-induced potentiation in females, whereas in males, either L-type calcium channel activation or calcium release from stores is sufficient to permit potentiation. To investigate the generalizability of a sex difference in the requirement for PKA in synaptic potentiation, we tested how PKA inhibition affects LTP. This showed that, although the magnitude of both high-frequency stimulation-induced and pairing-induced LTP is the same between sexes, PKA is required for LTP in females but not males. These results demonstrate latent sex differences in mechanisms of synaptic potentiation in which distinct molecular signaling converges to common functional endpoints in males and females.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Chemical- and activity-dependent neuromodulation alters synaptic strength in both male and female brains, yet few studies have compared mechanisms of neuromodulation between the sexes. Here, we studied molecular signaling that underlies estrogen-induced and activity-dependent potentiation of excitatory synapses in the hippocampus. We found that, despite similar magnitude increases in synaptic strength in males and females, the roles of cAMP-regulated protein kinase, internal calcium stores, and L-type calcium channels differ between the sexes. Therefore, latent sex differences in which the same outcome is achieved through distinct underlying mechanisms in males and females include kinase and calcium signaling involved in synaptic potentiation, demonstrating that sex is an important factor in identification of molecular targets for therapeutic development based on mechanisms of neuromodulation.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10073">Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder by Causal Influence Strength Learned from Resting-State fMRI Data. (arXiv:1902.10073v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is one of the major developmental disorders
affecting children. Recently, it has been hypothesized that ASD is associated
with atypical brain connectivities. A substantial body of researches use
Pearson's correlation coefficients, mutual information, or partial correlation
to investigate the differences in brain connectivities between ASD and typical
controls from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). However,
correlation or partial correlation does not directly reveal causal influences -
the information flow - between brain regions. Comparing to correlation,
causality pinpoints the key connectivity characteristics and removes redundant
features for diagnosis.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we propose a two-step method for large-scale and cyclic causal
discovery from fMRI. It can identify brain causal structures without doing
interventional experiments. The learned causal structure, as well as the causal
influence strength, provides us the path and effectiveness of information flow.
With the recovered causal influence strength as candidate features, we then
perform ASD diagnosis by further doing feature selection and classification. We
apply our methods to three datasets from Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange
(ABIDE).
</p>
<p>From experimental results, it shows that with causal connectivities, the
diagnostic accuracy largely improves. A closer examination shows that
information flows starting from the superior front gyrus to default mode
network and posterior areas are largely reduced. Moreover, all enhanced
information flows are from posterior to anterior or in local areas. Overall, it
shows that long-range influences have a larger proportion of reductions than
local ones, while local influences have a larger proportion of increases than
long-range ones. By examining the graph properties of brain causal structure,
the group of ASD shows reduced small-worldness.

<p>The entrainment between weakly-coupled nonlinear oscillators, as well as
between complex signals such as those representing physiological activity, is
frequently assessed in terms of whether a stable relationship is detectable
between the instantaneous phases extracted from the measured or simulated
time-series via the analytic signal. Here, we demonstrate that adding a
possibly complex constant value to this normally null-mean signal has a
non-trivial warping effect. Among other consequences, this introduces a level
of sensitivity to the amplitude fluctuations and average relative phase. By
means of simulations of Roessler systems and experiments on single-transistor
oscillator networks, it is shown that the resulting coherence measure may have
an empirical value in improving the inference of the structural couplings from
the dynamics. When tentatively applied to the electroencephalogram recorded
while performing imaginary and real movements, this straightforward
modification of the phase locking value substantially improved the
classification accuracy. Hence, its possible practical relevance in
brain-computer and brain-machine interfaces deserves consideration.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/43738">Amplification of a broad transcriptional program by a common factor triggers the meiotic cell cycle in mice</a></h4>

The germ line provides the cellular link between generations of multicellular organisms, its cells entering the meiotic cell cycle only once each generation. However, the mechanisms governing this initiation of meiosis remain poorly understood. Here, we examined cells undergoing meiotic initiation in mice, and we found that initiation involves the dramatic upregulation of a transcriptional network of thousands of genes whose expression is not limited to meiosis. This broad gene expression program is directly upregulated by STRA8, encoded by a germ cell-specific gene required for meiotic initiation. STRA8 binds its own promoter and those of thousands of other genes, including meiotic prophase genes, factors mediating DNA replication and the G1-S cell-cycle transition, and genes that promote the lengthy prophase unique to meiosis I. We conclude that, in mice, the robust amplification of this extraordinarily broad transcription program by a common factor triggers initiation of meiosis.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/43088">Two distinct mechanisms target the autophagy-related E3 complex to the pre-autophagosomal structure</a></h4>

In autophagy, Atg proteins organize the pre-autophagosomal structure (PAS) to initiate autophagosome formation. Previous studies in yeast revealed that the autophagy-related E3 complex Atg12-Atg5-Atg16 is recruited to the PAS via Atg16 interaction with Atg21, which binds phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) produced at the PAS, to stimulate conjugation of the ubiquitin-like protein Atg8 to phosphatidylethanolamine. Here, we discover a novel mechanism for the PAS targeting of Atg12-Atg5-Atg16, which is mediated by the interaction of Atg12 with the Atg1 kinase complex that serves as a scaffold for PAS organization. While autophagy is partially defective without one of these mechanisms, cells lacking both completely lose the PAS localization of Atg12-Atg5-Atg16 and show no autophagic activity. As with the PI3P-dependent mechanism, Atg12-Atg5-Atg16 recruited via the Atg12-dependent mechanism stimulates Atg8 lipidation, but also has the specific function of facilitating PAS scaffold assembly. Thus, this study significantly advances our understanding of the nucleation step in autophagosome formation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/42372">TMEM266 is a functional voltage sensor regulated by extracellular Zn<sup>2+</sup></a></h4>

Voltage-activated ion channels contain S1-S4 domains that sense membrane voltage and control opening of ion-selective pores, a mechanism that is crucial for electrical signaling. Related S1-S4 domains have been identified in voltage-sensitive phosphatases and voltage-activated proton channels, both of which lack associated pore domains. hTMEM266 is a protein of unknown function that is predicted to contain an S1-S4 domain, along with partially structured cytoplasmic termini. Here we show that hTMEM266 forms oligomers, undergoes both rapid (µs) and slow (ms) structural rearrangements in response to changes in voltage, and contains a Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding site that can regulate the slow conformational transition. Our results demonstrate that the S1-S4 domain in hTMEM266 is a functional voltage sensor, motivating future studies to identify cellular processes that may be regulated by the protein. The ability of hTMEM266 to respond to voltage on the µs timescale may be advantageous for designing new genetically encoded voltage indicators.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/42282">Basalin is an evolutionarily unconstrained protein revealed via a conserved role in flagellum basal plate function</a></h4>

Most motile flagella have an axoneme that contains nine outer microtubule doublets and a central pair (CP) of microtubules. The CP coordinates the flagellar beat and defects in CP projections are associated with motility defects and human disease. The CP nucleate near a ‘basal plate’ at the distal end of the transition zone (TZ). Here, we show that the trypanosome TZ protein ‘basalin’ is essential for building the basal plate, and its loss is associated with CP nucleation defects, inefficient recruitment of CP assembly factors to the TZ, and flagellum paralysis. Guided by synteny, we identified a highly divergent basalin ortholog in the related Leishmania species. Basalins are predicted to be highly unstructured, suggesting they may act as ‘hubs’ facilitating many protein-protein interactions. This raises the general concept that proteins involved in cytoskeletal functions and appearing organism-specific, may have highly divergent and cryptic orthologs in other species.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38298">Functional instability allows access to DNA in longer Transcription Activator-Like Effector (TALE) arrays</a></h4>

Transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) bind DNA through an array of tandem 34-residue repeats. How TALE repeat domains wrap around DNA, often extending more than 1.5 helical turns, without using external energy is not well understood. Here, we examine the kinetics of DNA binding of TALE arrays with varying numbers of identical repeats. Single molecule fluorescence analysis and deterministic modeling reveal conformational heterogeneity in both the free- and DNA-bound TALE arrays. Our findings, combined with previously identified partly folded states, indicate a TALE instability that is functionally important for DNA binding. For TALEs forming less than one superhelical turn around DNA, partly folded states inhibit DNA binding. In contrast, for TALEs forming more than one turn, partly folded states facilitate DNA binding, demonstrating a mode of 'functional instability' that facilitates macromolecular assembly. Increasing repeat number slows down interconversion between the various DNA-free and DNA-bound states.

Neurons throughout the mammalian brain possess non-motile cilia, organelles with varied functions in sensory physiology and cellular signaling. Yet, the roles of cilia in these neurons are poorly understood. To shed light into their functions, we studied EFHC1, an evolutionarily conserved protein required for motile cilia function and linked to a common form of inherited epilepsy in humans, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). We demonstrate that <i>C. elegans</i> EFHC-1 functions within specialized non-motile mechanosensory cilia, where it regulates neuronal activation and dopamine signaling. EFHC-1 also localizes at the synapse, where it further modulates dopamine signaling in cooperation with the orthologue of an R-type voltage-gated calcium channel. Our findings unveil a previously undescribed dual-regulation of neuronal excitability at sites of neuronal sensory input (cilium) and neuronal output (synapse). Such a distributed regulatory mechanism may be essential for establishing neuronal activation thresholds under physiological conditions, and when impaired, may represent a novel pathomechanism for epilepsy.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Structural and functional differences in brain hemispheric asymmetry have been well documented between female and male adults. However, potential differences in the connectivity patterns of the rich-club organization of hemispheric structural networks in females and males remain to be determined. In this study, diffusion tensor imaging was used to construct hemispheric structural networks in healthy subjects, and graph theoretical analysis approaches were applied to quantify hemisphere and gender differences in rich-club organization. The results showed that rich-club organization was consistently observed in both hemispheres of female and male adults. Moreover, a reduced level of connectivity was found in the left hemisphere. Notably, rightward asymmetries were mainly observed in feeder and local connections among one hub region and peripheral regions, many of which are implicated in visual processing and spatial attention functions. Additionally, significant gender differences were revealed in the rich-club, feeder, and local connections in rich-club organization. These gender-related hub and peripheral regions are involved in emotional, sensory, and cognitive control functions. The topological changes in rich-club organization provide novel insight into the hemisphere and gender effects on white matter connections and underlie a potential network mechanism of hemisphere- and gender-based differences in visual processing, spatial attention and cognitive control.</span>

<p>by Cornelia Metzig, Oliver Ratmann, Daniela Bezemer, Caroline Colijn</p>

The relationship between the underlying contact network over which a pathogen spreads and the pathogen phylogenetic trees that are obtained presents an opportunity to use sequence data to learn about contact networks that are difficult to study empirically. However, this relationship is not explicitly known and is usually studied in simulations, often with the simplifying assumption that the contact network is static in time, though human contact networks are dynamic. We simulate pathogen phylogenetic trees on dynamic Erdős-Renyi random networks and on two dynamic networks with skewed degree distribution, of which one is additionally clustered. We use tree shape features to explore how adding dynamics changes the relationships between the overall network structure and phylogenies. Our tree features include the number of small substructures (cherries, pitchforks) in the trees, measures of tree imbalance (Sackin index, Colless index), features derived from network science (diameter, closeness), as well as features using the internal branch lengths from the tip to the root. Using principal component analysis we find that the network dynamics influence the shapes of phylogenies, as does the network type. We also compare dynamic and time-integrated static networks. We find, in particular, that static network models like the widely used Barabasi-Albert model can be poor approximations for dynamic networks. We explore the effects of mis-specifying the network on the performance of classifiers trained identify the transmission rate (using supervised learning methods). We find that both mis-specification of the underlying network and its parameters (mean degree, turnover rate) have a strong adverse effect on the ability to estimate the transmission parameter. We illustrate these results by classifying HIV trees with a classifier that we trained on simulated trees from different networks, infection rates and turnover rates. Our results point to the importance of correctly estimating and modelling contact networks with dynamics when using phylodynamic tools to estimate epidemiological parameters.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rV4sMhN-YuU" width="1" />

<p>by Stephen Woloszynek, Zhengqiao Zhao, Jian Chen, Gail L. Rosen</p>

Advances in high-throughput sequencing have increased the availability of microbiome sequencing data that can be exploited to characterize microbiome community structure <i>in situ</i>. We explore using word and sentence embedding approaches for nucleotide sequences since they may be a suitable numerical representation for downstream machine learning applications (especially deep learning). This work involves first encoding (“embedding”) each sequence into a dense, low-dimensional, numeric vector space. Here, we use Skip-Gram word2vec to embed <i>k</i>-mers, obtained from 16S rRNA amplicon surveys, and then leverage an existing sentence embedding technique to embed all sequences belonging to specific body sites or samples. We demonstrate that these representations are meaningful, and hence the embedding space can be exploited as a form of feature extraction for exploratory analysis. We show that sequence embeddings preserve relevant information about the sequencing data such as <i>k</i>-mer context, sequence taxonomy, and sample class. Specifically, the sequence embedding space resolved differences among phyla, as well as differences among genera within the same family. Distances between sequence embeddings had similar qualities to distances between alignment identities, and embedding multiple sequences can be thought of as generating a consensus sequence. In addition, embeddings are versatile features that can be used for many downstream tasks, such as taxonomic and sample classification. Using sample embeddings for body site classification resulted in negligible performance loss compared to using OTU abundance data, and clustering embeddings yielded high fidelity species clusters. Lastly, the <i>k</i>-mer embedding space captured distinct <i>k</i>-mer profiles that mapped to specific regions of the 16S rRNA gene and corresponded with particular body sites. Together, our results show that embedding sequences results in meaningful representations that can be used for exploratory analyses or for downstream machine learning applications that require numeric data. Moreover, because the embeddings are trained in an unsupervised manner, unlabeled data can be embedded and used to bolster supervised machine learning tasks.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/R28Evhi6UHc" width="1" />

Abstract<p>LDB1 is a protein cofactor that participates in several multiprotein complexes with transcription factors that regulate mouse forebrain development. Since <i>Ldb1</i> null mutants display early embryonic lethality, we used a conditional knockout strategy to examine the role of LDB1 in early forebrain development using multiple Cre lines. Loss of <i>Ldb1</i> from E8.75 using Foxg1Cre caused a disruption of midline boundary structures in the dorsal telencephalon. While this Cre line gave the expected pattern of recombination of the floxed <i>Ldb1</i> locus, unexpectedly, standard Cre lines that act from E10.5 (Emx1Cre) and E11.5 (NesCre) did not show efficient or complete recombination in the dorsal telencephalon by E12.5. Intriguingly, this effect was specific to the <i>Ldb1</i> floxed allele, since three other lines including floxed Ai9 and mTmG reporters, and a floxed <i>Lhx2</i> line, each displayed the expected spatial patterns of recombination. Furthermore, the incomplete recombination of the floxed <i>Ldb1</i> locus using NesCre was limited to the dorsal telencephalon, while the ventral telencephalon and the diencephalon displayed the expected loss of <i>Ldb1</i>. This permitted us to examine the requirement for LDB1 in the development of the thalamus in a context wherein the cortex continued to express <i>Ldb1</i>. We report that the somatosensory VB nucleus is profoundly shrunken upon loss of LDB1. Our findings highlight the unusual nature of the <i>Ldb1</i> locus in terms of recombination efficiency, and also report a novel role for LDB1 during the development of the thalamus.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> The role of transcriptional co-factor LDB1 in mouse forebrain development was examined using a floxed <i>Ldb1</i> line and standard Cre driver lines Foxg1Cre, Emx1Cre, and NesCre. Foxg1Cre revealed that LDB1 is a key regulator of early telencephalic midline development. Curiously, the floxed <i>Ldb1</i> locus appeared to be selectively resistant to Cre-mediated recombination in the dorsal telencephalon using Emx1Cre and NesCre. Recombination improved with time in the case of Emx1Cre. NesCre recombined the floxed Ldb1 locus efficiently in the ventral telencephalon and in the diencephalon, where a critical requirement for this factor in the development of the somatosensory VB nucleus of the thalamus was revealed. Our findings highlight the importance of assessing the extent of recombination when interpreting conditional loss-of-function phenotypes.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0337-18.2019v1?rss=1">Different inhibitory interneuron cell classes make distinct contributions to visual contrast perception</a></h4>

Abstract<p>While recent work has revealed how different inhibitory interneurons influence responses of cortical neurons to sensory stimuli, little is known about their distinct contributions to sensory perception. Here, we optogenetically activated different genetically defined interneurons (parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SST), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)) in visual cortex (V1) of mice working at threshold in a contrast increment detection task. The visual stimulus was paired with optogenetic stimulation to assess how enhancing V1 inhibitory neuron activity during visual processing altered task performance. PV or SST activation impaired, while VIP stimulation improved, contrast increment detection. The impairment produced by PV or SST activation persisted over several weeks of testing. In contrast, mice learned to reliably detect VIP activation in the absence of any natural visual stimulus. Thus, different inhibitory signals make distinct contributions to visual contrast perception.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Inhibitory interneurons are diverse and influence sensory responses through multiple mechanisms. Currently there is little consensus on how different inhibitory signals affect sensory perception. Here, we investigated how genetically defined interneuron subclasses (parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SST), and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)) influence visual contrast perception. Mice were trained to work at threshold in a visual contrast detection task and interneuron activity was enhanced using ChannelRhodopsin-2 on a subset of trials. Different interneuron classes influenced perception in distinct ways. PV and SST stimulation impaired, whereas VIP stimulation improved visual contrast perception. With training, mice learned to perceive VIP activation in the absence of natural visual stimulation. These data highlight how different inhibitory signals affect the transformation of sensory-evoked responses into percepts.</p>

<p>Analogous to the mirror neuron system repeatedly described in monkeys as a
possible substrate for imitation learning and/or action understanding, a
neuronal execution/observation matching system (OEMS) is assumed in humans, but
little is known to what extent this system is activated in non-experimental,
real-life conditions. In the present case study, we investigated brain activity
of this system during natural, non-experimental motor behavior as it occurred
during playing of the board game "Malefiz". We compared spectral modulations of
the high-gamma band related to ipsilateral reaching movement execution and
observation of the same kind of movement using electrocorticography (ECoG) in
one participant. Spatially coincident activity during both conditions execution
and observation was recorded at electrode contacts over the premotor/primary
motor cortex. The topography and amplitude of the high-gamma modulations
related to both, movement observation and execution were clearly spatially
correlated over several fronto-parietal brain areas. Thus, our findings
indicate that a network of cortical areas contributes to the human OEMS, beyond
primary/premotor cortex including Brocas area and the temporo-parieto-occipital
junction area, in real-life conditions.

<p>Background: Building visual encoding models to accurately predict visual
responses is a central challenge for current vision-based brain-machine
interface techniques. To achieve high prediction accuracy on neural signals,
visual encoding models should include precise visual features and appropriate
prediction algorithms. Most existing visual encoding models employ hand-craft
visual features (e.g., Gabor wavelets or semantic labels) or data-driven
features (e.g., features extracted from deep neural networks (DNN)). They also
assume a linear mapping between feature representation to brain activity.
However, it remains unknown whether such linear mapping is sufficient for
maximizing prediction accuracy. New Method: We construct a new visual encoding
framework to predict cortical responses in a benchmark functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) dataset. In this framework, we employ the transfer
learning technique to incorporate a pre-trained DNN (i.e., AlexNet) and train a
nonlinear mapping from visual features to brain activity. This nonlinear
mapping replaces the conventional linear mapping and is supposed to improve
prediction accuracy on brain activity. Results: The proposed framework can
significantly predict responses of over 20% voxels in early visual areas (i.e.,
V1-lateral occipital region, LO) and achieve unprecedented prediction accuracy.
Comparison with Existing Methods: Comparing to two conventional visual encoding
models, we find that the proposed encoding model shows consistent higher
prediction accuracy in all early visual areas, especially in relatively
anterior visual areas (i.e., V4 and LO). Conclusions: Our work proposes a new
framework to utilize pre-trained visual features and train non-linear mappings
from visual features to brain activity.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/44341">Synergy and remarkable specificity of antimicrobial peptides <i>in vivo</i> using a systematic knockout approach</a></h4>

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are host-encoded antibiotics that combat invading microorganisms. These short, cationic peptides have been implicated in many biological processes, primarily involving innate immunity. <i>In vitro</i> studies have shown AMPs kill bacteria and fungi at physiological concentrations, but little validation has been done <i>in vivo</i>. We utilised CRISPR gene editing to delete all known immune inducible AMPs of <i>Drosophila,</i> namely: 4 Attacins, 4 Cecropins, 2 Diptericins, Drosocin, Drosomycin, Metchnikowin and Defensin. Using individual and multiple knockouts, including flies lacking all 14 AMP genes, we characterize the <i>in vivo</i> function of individual and groups of AMPs against diverse bacterial and fungal pathogens. We found that <i>Drosophila</i> AMPs act primarily against Gram-negative bacteria and fungi, contributing either additively or synergistically. We also describe remarkable specificity wherein certain AMPs contribute the bulk of microbicidal activity against specific pathogens, providing functional demonstrations of highly specific AMP-pathogen interactions in an <i>in vivo</i> setting.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/43606">Long-term balancing selection drives evolution of immunity genes in <i>Capsella</i></a></h4>

Genetic drift is expected to remove polymorphism from populations over long periods of time, with the rate of polymorphism loss being accelerated when species experience strong reductions in population size. Adaptive forces that maintain genetic variation in populations, or balancing selection, might counteract this process. To understand the extent to which natural selection can drive the retention of genetic diversity, we document genomic variability after two parallel species-wide bottlenecks in the genus <i>Capsella</i>. We find that ancestral variation preferentially persists at immunity related loci, and that the same collection of alleles has been maintained in different lineages that have been separated for several million years. By reconstructing the evolution of the disease related locus <i>MLO2b</i>, we find that divergence between ancient haplotypes can be obscured by referenced based re-sequencing methods, and that trans-specific alleles can encode substantially diverged protein sequences. Our data point to long term balancing selection as an important factor shaping the genetics of immune systems in plants and as the predominant driver of genomic variability after a population bottleneck.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/42182">Kinesin-6 regulates cell-size-dependent spindle elongation velocity to keep mitosis duration constant in fission yeast</a></h4>

The length of the mitotic spindle scales with cell size in a wide range of organisms during embryonic development. Interestingly, in <i>C. elegans</i> embryos, this goes along with temporal regulation: larger cells speed up spindle assembly and elongation. We demonstrate that, similarly in fission yeast, spindle length and spindle dynamics adjust to cell size, which allows to keep mitosis duration constant. Since prolongation of mitosis was shown to affect cell viability, this may resemble a mechanism to regulate mitosis duration. We further reveal how the velocity of spindle elongation is regulated: coupled to cell size, the amount of kinesin-6 Klp9 molecules increases, resulting in an acceleration of spindle elongation in anaphase B. In addition, the number of Klp9 binding sites to microtubules increases overproportionally to Klp9 molecules, suggesting that molecular crowding inversely correlates to cell size and might have an impact on spindle elongation velocity control.

Extensive transcriptional alterations are observed in cancer, many of which activate core biological processes established in unicellular organisms or suppress differentiation pathways formed in metazoans. Through rigorous, integrative analysis of genomics data from a range of solid tumours, we show many transcriptional changes in tumours are tied to mutations disrupting regulatory interactions between unicellular and multicellular genes within human gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Recurrent point mutations were enriched in regulator genes linking unicellular and multicellular subnetworks, while copy-number alterations affected downstream target genes in distinctly unicellular and multicellular regions of the GRN. Our results depict drivers of tumourigenesis as genes that created key regulatory links during the evolution of early multicellular life, whose dysfunction creates widespread dysregulation of primitive elements of the GRN. Several genes we identified as important in this process were associated with drug response, demonstrating the potential clinical value of our approach.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40613">Bumblebee visual allometry results in locally improved resolution and globally improved sensitivity</a></h4>

The quality of visual information that is available to an animal is limited by the size of its eyes. Differences in eye size can be observed even between closely related individuals, yet we understand little about how this affects vision. Insects are good models for exploring the effects of size on visual systems because many insect species exhibit size polymorphism. Previous work has been limited by difficulties in determining the 3D structure of eyes. We have developed a novel method based on x-ray microtomography to measure the 3D structure of insect eyes and to calculate predictions of their visual capabilities. We used our method to investigate visual allometry in the bumblebee <i>Bombus terrestris</i> and found that size affects specific aspects of vision, including binocular overlap, optical sensitivity, and dorsofrontal visual resolution. This reveals that differential scaling between eye areas provides flexibility that improves the visual capabilities of larger bumblebees.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40162">Motion sensing superpixels (MOSES) is a systematic computational framework to quantify and discover cellular motion phenotypes</a></h4>

Correct cell/cell interactions and motion dynamics are fundamental in tissue homeostasis, and defects in these cellular processes cause diseases. Therefore, there is strong interest in identifying factors, including drug candidates that affect cell/cell interactions and motion dynamics. However, existing quantitative tools for systematically interrogating complex motion phenotypes in timelapse datasets are limited. We present Motion Sensing Superpixels (MOSES), a computational framework that measures and characterises biological motion with a unique superpixel ‘mesh’ formulation. Using published datasets, MOSES demonstrates single-cell tracking capability and more advanced population quantification than Particle Image Velocimetry approaches. From &gt; 190 co-culture videos, MOSES motion-mapped the interactions between human esophageal squamous epithelial and columnar cells mimicking the esophageal squamous-columnar junction, a site where Barrett’s esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma often arise clinically. MOSES is a powerful tool that will facilitate unbiased, systematic analysis of cellular dynamics from high-content time-lapse imaging screens with little prior knowledge and few assumptions.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/39906">Impaired voice processing in reward and salience circuits predicts social communication in children with autism</a></h4>

Engaging with vocal sounds is critical for children’s social-emotional learning, and children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often ‘tune out’ voices in their environment. Little is known regarding the neurobiological basis of voice processing and its link to social impairments in ASD. Here, we perform the first comprehensive brain network analysis of voice processing in children with ASD. We examined neural responses elicited by unfamiliar voices and mother’s voice, a biologically salient voice for social learning, and identified a striking relationship between social communication abilities in children with ASD and activation in key structures of reward and salience processing regions. Functional connectivity between voice-selective and reward regions during voice processing predicted social communication in children with ASD and distinguished them from typically developing children. Results support the Social Motivation Theory of ASD by showing reward system deficits associated with the processing of a critical social stimulus, mother’s voice, in children with ASD.

Two-pore-domain potassium (K<sub>2P</sub>) channels are key regulators of many physiological and pathophysiological processes and thus emerged as promising drug targets. As for other potassium channels, there is a lack of selective blockers, since drugs preferentially bind to a conserved binding site located in the central cavity. Thus, there is a high medical need to identify novel drug-binding sites outside the conserved lipophilic central cavity and to identify new allosteric mechanisms of channel inhibition. Here, we identified a novel binding site and allosteric inhibition mechanism, disrupting the recently proposed K<sup>+</sup>-flux gating mechanism of K<sub>2P</sub> channels, which results in an unusual voltage-dependent block of leak channels belonging to the TASK subfamily. The new binding site and allosteric mechanism of inhibition provide structural and mechanistic insights into the gating of TASK channels and the basis for the drug design of a new class of potent blockers targeting specific types of K<sub>2P</sub> channels.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>In the stop-signal task, an electrophysiological signature of action-stopping is increased early right frontal beta band power for successful vs. failed stop trials. Here we tested whether the requirement to stop an unwanted thought from coming to mind also elicits this signature. We recorded scalp EEG during a Think/No-Think task and a subsequent stop signal task in 42 participants. In the Think/No-Think task, participants first learned word pairs. In a second phase, they received the left-hand word as a reminder and were cued either to retrieve the associated right-hand word (“Think”) or to stop retrieval (“No-Think”). At the end of each trial, participants reported whether they had experienced an intrusion of the associated memory. Finally, they received the left-hand reminder word and were asked to recall its associated target. Behaviorally, there was worse final recall for items in the No-Think condition, and decreased intrusions with practice for No-Think trials. For EEG, we reproduced increased early right frontal beta power for successful vs. failed action stopping. Critically, No-Think trials also elicited increased early right frontal beta power and this was stronger for trials without intrusion. These results suggest that preventing a thought from coming to mind also recruits fast prefrontal stopping.</span>

<p>by Simona Olmi, Spase Petkoski, Maxime Guye, Fabrice Bartolomei, Viktor Jirsa</p>

Information transmission in the human brain is a fundamentally dynamic network process. In partial epilepsy, this process is perturbed and highly synchronous seizures originate in a local network, the so-called epileptogenic zone (EZ), before recruiting other close or distant brain regions. We studied patient-specific brain network models of 15 drug-resistant epilepsy patients with implanted stereotactic electroencephalography (SEEG) electrodes. Each personalized brain model was derived from structural data of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor weighted imaging (DTI), comprising 88 nodes equipped with region specific neural mass models capable of demonstrating a range of epileptiform discharges. Each patient’s virtual brain was further personalized through the integration of the clinically hypothesized EZ. Subsequent simulations and connectivity modulations were performed and uncovered a finite repertoire of seizure propagation patterns. Across patients, we found that (i) patient-specific network connectivity is predictive for the subsequent seizure propagation pattern; (ii) seizure propagation is characterized by a systematic sequence of brain states; (iii) propagation can be controlled by an optimal intervention on the connectivity matrix; (iv) the degree of invasiveness can be significantly reduced via the proposed seizure control as compared to traditional resective surgery. To stop seizures, neurosurgeons typically resect the EZ completely. We showed that stability analysis of the network dynamics, employing structural and dynamical information, estimates reliably the spatiotemporal properties of seizure propagation. This suggests novel less invasive paradigms of surgical interventions to treat and manage partial epilepsy.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6Abc4T-wF5M" width="1" />

<p>by Tuan Pham, Julie S. Haas</p>

As information about the world traverses the brain, the signals exchanged between neurons are passed and modulated by synapses, or specialized contacts between neurons. While neurotransmitter-based synapses tend to exert either excitatory or inhibitory pulses of influence on the postsynaptic neuron, electrical synapses, composed of plaques of gap junction channels, continuously transmit signals that can either excite or inhibit a coupled neighbor. A growing body of evidence indicates that electrical synapses, similar to their chemical counterparts, are modified in strength during physiological neuronal activity. The synchronizing role of electrical synapses in neuronal oscillations has been well established, but their impact on transient signal processing in the brain is much less understood. Here we constructed computational models based on the canonical feedforward neuronal circuit, and included electrical synapses between inhibitory interneurons. We provided discrete closely-timed inputs to the circuits, and characterize the influence of electrical synapse strength on both subthreshold summation and spike trains in the output neuron. Our simulations highlight the diverse and powerful roles that electrical synapses play even in simple circuits. Because these canonical circuits are represented widely throughout the brain, we expect that these are general principles for the influence of electrical synapses on transient signal processing across the brain.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zdK2qO6vsyc" width="1" />

<p>by Anita T. Layton, Harold E. Layton</p>

We have developed the first computational model of solute and water transport from Bowman space to the papillary tip of the nephron of a human kidney. The nephron is represented as a tubule lined by a layer of epithelial cells, with apical and basolateral transporters that vary according to cell type. The model is formulated for steady state, and consists of a large system of coupled ordinary differential equations and algebraic equations. Model solution describes luminal fluid flow, hydrostatic pressure, luminal fluid solute concentrations, cytosolic solute concentrations, epithelial membrane potential, and transcellular and paracellular fluxes. We found that if we assume that the transporter density and permeabilities are taken to be the same between the human and rat nephrons (with the exception of a glucose transporter along the proximal tubule and the H<sup>+</sup>-pump along the collecting duct), the model yields segmental deliveries and urinary excretion of volume and key solutes that are consistent with human data. The model predicted that the human nephron exhibits glomerulotubular balance, such that proximal tubular Na<sup>+</sup> reabsorption varies proportionally to the single-nephron glomerular filtration rate. To simulate the action of a novel diabetic treatment, we inhibited the Na<sup>+</sup>-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) along the proximal convoluted tubule. Simulation results predicted that the segment’s Na<sup>+</sup> reabsorption decreased significantly, resulting in natriuresis and osmotic diuresis.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9-J5UiBBRPs" width="1" />

Abstract<p>CRISPR-based technology has provided new avenues to interrogate gene function, but difficulties in transgene expression in post-mitotic neurons has delayed incorporation of these tools in the central nervous system. Here, we demonstrate a highly efficient, neuron-optimized dual lentiviral CRISPR-based transcriptional activation (CRISPRa) system capable of robust, modular, and tunable gene induction and multiplexed gene regulation across several primary rodent neuron culture systems. CRISPRa targeting unique promoters in the complex multi-transcript gene <i>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor</i> (<i>Bdnf</i>) revealed both transcript- and genome-level selectivity of this approach, in addition to highlighting downstream transcriptional and physiological consequences of <i>Bdnf</i> regulation. Finally, we illustrate that CRISPRa is highly efficient <i>in vivo</i>, resulting in increased protein levels of a target gene in diverse brain structures. Taken together, these results demonstrate that CRISPRa is an efficient and selective method to study gene expression programs in brain health and disease.</p><p><b>Significance</b> We report a neuron-optimized CRISPR/dCas9 activation (CRISPRa) system that produces robust and specific upregulation of targeted genes in neurons both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. This system effectively drives expression at many gene targets, provides titratable gene expression, is capable of simultaneously targeting multiple genes at once, and successfully targets individual transcript variants arising from a complex, multi-promoter gene. This molecular tool enables advances in our ability to control gene expression profiles in the brain and will enable expansion of gene regulatory investigations to model systems that have not typically been used to explore genetic control of neuronal function.</p>

Abstract<p>Methylphenidate (MPH), commonly known as Ritalin, is the most widely prescribed drug worldwide to treat patients with attention deficit disorders. Although MPH is thought to modulate catecholamine neurotransmission in the brain, it remains unclear how these neurochemical effects influence neuronal activity and lead to attentional enhancements. Studies in rodents overwhelmingly point to the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) as a main site of action of MPH. To understand the mechanism of action of MPH in a primate brain, we recorded the responses of neuronal populations using chronic multielectrode arrays implanted in the caudal LPFC of two macaque monkeys while the animals performed an attention task (N = 2811 neuronal recordings). Over different recording sessions (N=55), we orally administered either various doses of MPH or a placebo to the animals. Behavioral analyses revealed positive effects of MPH on task performance at specific doses. However, analyses of individual neurons activity, noise correlations, and neuronal ensemble activity using machine learning algorithms revealed no effects of MPH. Our results suggest that the positive behavioral effects of MPH observed in primates (including humans) may not be mediated by changes in the activity of caudal LPFC neurons. MPH may enhance cognitive performance by modulating neuronal activity in other regions of the attentional network in the primate brain.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Methylphenidate (MPH), widely known as Ritalin, is the most prescribed drug to treat patients with attention deficits. Nonetheless, it is still unclear how and why the drug improves attention in humans. Studies in rodents point to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) as the main target of MPH. To validate these findings in primates, we trained macaque monkeys to perform an attention task while under various doses of MPH. We also chronically implanted multielectrode arrays in the posterior PFC of these monkeys to record neuronal ensemble activity during the task. Surprisingly, we found no effect of the drug on neuronal activity, even at cognitive-enhancing doses of MPH. The caudal prefrontal cortex might not be the site of action of MPH in the primate brain.</p>

Abstract<p>Automatic mimicry is a critical element of social interaction. A salient type of automatic mimicry is eye contact characterized by sharing of affective and mental states among individuals. We conducted a hyperscanning functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study involving online (LIVE) and delayed off-line (REPLAY) conditions to test our hypothesis that recurrent interaction through eye contact activates the limbic mirror system, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and anterior insula (AIC), both of which are critical for self-awareness. Sixteen pairs of human adults participated in the experiment. Given that an eye-blink represents an individual’s attentional window toward the partner, we analyzed pairwise time-series data for eye-blinks. We used multivariate autoregression analysis to calculate the noise contribution ratio (NCR) as an index of how a participant’s directional attention was influenced by that of their partner. NCR was greater in the LIVE than in the REPLAY condition, indicating mutual perceptual–motor interaction during real-time eye contact. Relative to the REPLAY condition, the LIVE condition was associated with greater activation in the left cerebellar hemisphere, vermis, and ACC, accompanied by enhanced functional connectivity between ACC and right AIC. Given the roles of the cerebellum in sensorimotor prediction and ACC in movement initiation, ACC–cerebellar activation may represent their involvement in modulating visual input related to the partner’s movement, which may, in turn, involve the limbic mirror system. Our findings indicate that mutual interaction during eye contact is mediated by the cerebellum and limbic mirror system.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Eye contact is a key element that connects humans during social communication. We focused on a previously unaddressed characteristic of eye contact: real-time mutual interaction as a form of automatic mimicry. Our results indicate that real-time interaction during eye contact is mediated by the cerebellum and limbic mirror system. These findings underscore the importance of the mirror system and cerebellum in real-time unconscious social interaction.</p>

Abstract<p>Seizures are characterized by hypersynchronization of neuronal networks. Understanding these networks could provide a critical window for therapeutic control of recurrent seizure activity i.e., epilepsy. However, imaging seizure networks has largely been limited to microcircuits <i>in vitro</i> or small "windows" <i>in vivo</i>. Here we combine fast confocal imaging of GCaMP-expressing larval zebrafish with local field potential (LFP) recordings to study epileptiform events at whole-brain and single-neuron levels <i>in vivo</i>. Using an acute seizure model (pentylenetetrazole, PTZ), we reliably observed recurrent electrographic ictal-like events associated with generalized activation of all major brain regions and uncovered a well-preserved anterior-to-posterior seizure propagation pattern. We also examined brain-wide network synchronization and spatiotemporal patterns of neuronal activity in the optic tectum microcircuit. Brain-wide and single-neuronal level analysis of PTZ- and 4-aminopyridine (4-AP)-exposed zebrafish revealed distinct network dynamics associated with seizure and non-seizure hyperexcitable states, respectively. Neuronal ensembles, comprised of coactive neurons, were also uncovered during interictal-like periods. Taken together, these results demonstrate that macro- and micro-network calcium motifs in zebrafish may provide a greater understanding of epilepsy.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Monitoring the dynamic activities in large-scale neuronal networks is critical to understanding seizure initiation and propagation. Here, we utilized well-established larval zebrafish seizure protocols and fast confocal imaging of GCaMP-expressing fish to investigate the epileptic network properties at brain-wide and single-cell levels. We revealed the rapid propagation of seizure activity from anterior-to-posterior brain regions in zebrafish central nervous system. We also showed that micro-ensembles of neuronal subpopulations are active during interictal-like periods in a manner similar to that seen in human electrophysiology data sets. Our findings demonstrate that these non-invasive optical imaging approaches will advance our understanding of the network basis underlying seizures and facilitate the development of methods to suppress these events.</p>

Abstract
<p>The hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (EC) are areas affected early and severely in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and this is associated with deficits in episodic memory. Amyloid-β (Aβ), the main protein found in amyloid plaques, can affect neuronal physiology and excitability, and several AD mouse models with memory impairments display aberrant network activity, including hyperexcitability and seizures. In this study, we investigated single cell physiology in EC and network activity in EC and dentate gyrus (DG) in the McGill-R-Thy1-APP transgenic rat model, using whole-cell patch clamp recordings and voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDI) in acute slices. In slices from transgenic animals up to 4 months of age, the majority of the principal neurons in Layer II of EC, fan cells and stellate cells, expressed intracellular Aβ (iAβ). Whereas the electrophysiological properties of fan cells were unaltered, stellate cells were more excitable in transgenic than in control rats. Stimulation in the DG resulted in comparable patterns in both groups at three and nine months, but at 12 months, the elicited responses in the transgenic group showed a significant preference for the enclosed blade, without any change in overall excitability. Only transient changes in the local network activity were seen in the medial EC (MEC). Although the observed changes in the McGill rat model are subtle, they are specific, pointing to a differential and selective involvement of specific parts of the hippocampal circuitry in Aβ pathology.</p>

Abstract
<p>The consolidation of newly formed memories and their retrieval are energetically demanding processes. Aerobic glycolysis (AG), also known as the Warburg effect, consists of the production of lactate from glucose in the presence of oxygen. The astrocyte neuron lactate shuttle hypothesis posits that astrocytes process glucose by AG to generate lactate, which is used as a fuel source within neurons to maintain synaptic activity. Studies in mice have demonstrated that lactate transport between astrocytes and neurons is required for long-term memory formation, yet the role of lactate production in memory acquisition and retrieval has not previously been explored. Here, we examined the effect of dichloroacetate (DCA), a chemical inhibitor of lactate production, on spatial learning and memory in mice using the Morris water maze (MWM). <i>In vivo</i> hyperpolarized <sup>13</sup>C-pyruvate magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed decreased conversion of pyruvate to lactate in the mouse brain following DCA administration, concomitant with a reduction in the phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase. DCA exposure before each training session in the MWM impaired learning, which subsequently resulted in impaired memory during the probe trial. In contrast, mice that underwent training without DCA exposure, but received a single DCA injection before the probe trial exhibited normal memory. Our findings indicate that AG plays a key role during memory acquisition but is less important for the retrieval of established memories. Thus, the activation of AG may be important for learning-dependent synaptic plasticity rather than the activation of signaling cascades required for memory retrieval.</p>

Abstract
<p>Prematurity is associated with significantly increased risk of neurobehavioral pathologies, including autism and schizophrenia. A common feature of these psychiatric disorders is prefrontal cortex (PFC) inhibitory circuit disruption due to GABAergic interneuron alteration. Cortical interneurons are generated and migrate throughout late gestation and early infancy, making them highly susceptible to perinatal insults such as preterm birth. Term and preterm PFC pathology specimens were assessed using immunohistochemical markers for interneurons. Based on the changes seen, a new preterm encephalopathy mouse model was developed to produce similar PFC interneuron loss. Maternal immune activation (MIA; modeling chorioamnionitis, associated with 85% of extremely preterm births) was combined with chronic sublethal hypoxia (CSH; modeling preterm respiratory failure), with offspring of both sexes assessed anatomically, molecularly and neurobehaviorally. In the PFC examined from the human preterm samples compared to matched term samples at corrected age, a decrease in somatostatin (SST) and calbindin (CLB) interneurons was seen in upper cortical layers. This pattern of interneuron loss in upper cortical layers was mimicked in the mouse PFC following the combination of MIA and CSH, but not after either insult alone. This persistent interneuron loss is associated with postnatal microglial activation that occurs during CSH only after MIA. The combined insults lead to long-term neurobehavioral deficits which parallel human psychopathologies that may be seen after extremely preterm birth. This new preclinical model supports a paradigm in which specific cellular alterations seen in preterm encephalopathy can be linked with a risk of neuropsychiatric sequela. Specific interneuron subtypes may provide therapeutic targets to prevent or ameliorate these neurodevelopmental risks.</p>

<p>Cortical slow oscillations are an emergent property of the cortical network,
hallmark of low complexity brain states like sleep, and representing a default
activity pattern. Here, we present a methodological approach for quantifying
the spatial and temporal properties of this emergent activity. We improved and
enriched a robust analysis procedure that has already been successfully applied
to both in vitro and in vivo data acquisitions. We tested the new tools of the
methodology by analyzing the electrocorticography (ECoG) traces recorded from a
custom 32-channel multi-electrode array in wild-type isoflurane-anesthetized
mice. The enhanced analysis pipeline, named SWAP (Slow Waves Analysis
Pipeline), detects Up and Down states, enables the characterization of the
spatial dependency of their statistical properties, and supports the comparison
of different subjects. The SWAP is implemented in a data-independent way,
allowing its application to other data sets (acquired from different subjects,
or with different recording tools), as well as to the outcome of numerical
simulations. By using SWAP, we report statistically significant differences in
the observed slow oscillations (SO) across cortical areas and cortical sites.
Computing cortical maps by interpolating the features of SO acquired at the
electrode positions, we give evidence of gradients at the global scale along an
oblique axis directed from fronto-lateral towards occipito-medial regions,
further highlighting some heterogeneity within cortical areas. The results
obtained on spatial characterization of slow oscillations will be essential for
producing data-driven brain simulations and for triggering a discussion on the
role of, and the interplay between, the different regions in the cortex,
improving our understanding of the mechanisms of generation and propagation of
delta rhythms and, more generally, of cortical properties.

<p>Standard neuroimaging techniques provide non-invasive access not only to
human brain anatomy but also to its physiology. The activity recorded with
these techniques is generally called functional imaging, but what is observed
per se is an instance of dynamics, from which functional brain activity should
be extracted. Distinguishing between bare dynamics and genuine function is a
highly non-trivial task, but a crucially important one when comparing
experimental observations and interpreting their significance. Here we
illustrate how the ability of neuroimaging to extract genuine functional brain
activity is bounded by the structure of functional representations. To do so,
we first provide a simple definition of functional brain activity from a
system-level brain imaging perspective. We then review how the properties of
the space on which brain activity is represented allow defining relations
ranging from distinguishability to accessibility of observed imaging data. We
show how these properties result from the structure defined on dynamical data
and dynamics-to-function projections, and consider some implications that the
way and extent to which these are defined have for the interpretation of
experimental data from standard system-level brain recording techniques.

<p>Recent studies have suggested that the cognitive process of the human brain
is realized as probabilistic inference and can be further modeled by
probabilistic graphical models like Markov random fields. Nevertheless, it
remains unclear how probabilistic inference can be implemented by a network of
spiking neurons in the brain. Previous studies tried to relate the inference
equation of binary Markov random fields to the dynamic equation of spiking
neural networks through belief propagation algorithm and reparameterization,
but they are valid only for Markov random fields with limited network
structure. In this paper, we propose a spiking neural network model that can
implement inference of arbitrary binary Markov random fields. Specifically, we
design a spiking recurrent neural network and prove that its neuronal dynamics
are mathematically equivalent to the inference process of Markov random fields
by adopting mean-field theory. Theoretical analysis and experimental results,

<p>Cortical synapse organization supports a range of dynamic states on multiple
spatial and temporal scales, from synchronous slow wave activity (SWA),
characteristic of deep sleep or anesthesia, to fluctuating, asynchronous
activity during wakefulness (AW). Such dynamic diversity poses a challenge for
producing efficient large-scale simulations that embody realistic metaphors of
short- and long-range synaptic connectivity. In fact, during SWA and AW
different spatial extents of the cortical tissue are active in a given timespan
and at different levels, which implies a wide variety of loads of local
computation and communication. A balanced evaluation of simulation performance
and robustness should therefore include tests of a variety of cortical dynamic
states. Here, we demonstrate performance scaling of our proprietary Distributed
and Plastic Spiking Neural Networks (DPSNN) simulation engine in both SWA and
AW for bidimensional grids of neural populations, which reflects the modular
organization of the cortex. We explored networks up to 192x192 modules, each
composed of 1250 integrate-and-fire neurons with spike-frequency adaptation,
and exponentially decaying inter-modular synaptic connectivity with varying
spatial decay constant. For the largest networks the total number of synapses
was over 70 billion. The execution platform included up to 64 dual-socket
nodes, each socket mounting 8 Intel Xeon Haswell processor cores @ 2.40GHz
clock. Network initialization time, memory usage, and execution time showed
good scaling performances from 1 to 1024 processes, implemented using the
standard Message Passing Interface (MPI) protocol. We achieved simulation
speeds of between 2.3x10^9 and 4.1x10^9 synaptic events per second for both
cortical states in the explored range of inter-modular interconnections.

Piezo is a mechanosensitive ion channel that transduces mechanical stimuli into cellular responses. Here, Song et al. show that Piezo is recruited after axon injury to inhibit axon regeneration via the CamKII-Nos-PKG pathway, a process that may be evolutionarily conserved.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Cortical activity is organized across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Most research on the dynamics of neuronal spiking is concerned with timescales of 1 ms–1 s, and little is known about spiking dynamics on timescales of tens of seconds and minutes. Here, we used frequency domain analyses to study the structure of individual neurons’ spiking activity and its coupling to local population rate and to arousal level across 0.01–100 Hz frequency range. In mouse medial prefrontal cortex, the spiking dynamics of individual neurons could be quantitatively captured by a combination of interspike interval and firing rate power spectrum distributions. The relative strength of coherence with local population often differed across timescales: a neuron strongly coupled to population rate on fast timescales could be weakly coupled on slow timescales, and vice versa. On slow but not fast timescales, a substantial proportion of neurons showed firing anticorrelated with the population. Infraslow firing rate changes were largely determined by arousal rather than by local factors, which could explain the timescale dependence of individual neurons’ population coupling strength. These observations demonstrate how neurons simultaneously partake in fast local dynamics, and slow brain-wide dynamics, extending our understanding of infraslow cortical activity beyond the mesoscale resolution of fMRI.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The hippocampus is functionally heterogeneous between the dorsal and ventral subfields with left–right asymmetry. To determine the possible location of contextual memory, we performed an inhibitory avoidance task to analyze synaptic plasticity using slice patch-clamp technique. The training bilaterally increased the AMPA/NMDA ratio at dorsal CA3–CA1 synapses, whereas the training did not affect the ratio at ventral CA3–CA1 synapses regardless of the hemisphere. Moreover, sequential recording of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents from the same CA1 neuron clearly showed learning-induced synaptic plasticity. In dorsal CA1 neurons, the training dramatically strengthened both excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic responses in both hemispheres, whereas the training did not promote the plasticity in either hemisphere in ventral CA1 neurons. Nonstationary fluctuation analysis further revealed that the training bilaterally increased the number of AMPA or GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor channels at dorsal CA1 synapses, but not at ventral CA1 synapses, suggesting functional heterogeneity of learning-induced receptor mobility. Finally, the performance clearly impaired by the bilateral microinjection of plasticity blockers in dorsal, but not ventral CA1 subfields, suggesting a crucial role for contextual learning.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Affective disorders are associated with increased sensitivity to negative feedback that influences approach–avoidance decision making. Although neuroimaging studies of these disorders reveal dysregulation in primate cingulate areas 25 and 32 and the anterior hippocampus (aHipp), the causal involvement of these structures and their interaction in the primate brain is unknown. We therefore investigated the effects of localized pharmacological manipulations of areas 25 and 32 and/or the aHipp of the marmoset monkey on performance of an anxiolytic-sensitive instrumental decision-making task in which an approach–avoidance conflict is created by pairing a response with reward and punishment. During control infusions animals avoided punishment, but this bias was reduced by increasing glutamate release within the aHipp or area 32, and inactivation or 5-HT1a antagonism within area 25. Conversely, increasing glutamate release in area 25 enhanced punishment avoidance but, in contrast to previous reports, area 32 and aHipp inactivations had no effect. Simultaneous inactivation or 5-HT1a antagonism within area 25, but not area 32, abolished the reduced punishment avoidance seen after increasing aHipp glutamate. Besides providing causal evidence that these primate areas differentially regulate negative feedback sensitivity, this study links the decision-making deficits in affective disorders to aberrant aHipp–area 25 circuit activity.</span>

Recent decades have seen dramatic progress in brain research. These advances were often buttressed by probing single variables to make circumscribed discoveries, typically through null hypothesis significance testing. New ways for generating massive data fueled tension between the traditional methodology that is used to infer statistically relevant effects in carefully chosen variables, and pattern-learning algorithms that are used to identify predictive signatures by searching through abundant information.

<p>by Nir Even-Chen, Blue Sheffer, Saurabh Vyas, Stephen I. Ryu, Krishna V. Shenoy</p>

Voluntary movements are widely considered to be planned before they are executed. Recent studies have hypothesized that neural activity in motor cortex during preparation acts as an ‘initial condition’ which seeds the proceeding neural dynamics. Here, we studied these initial conditions in detail by investigating 1) the organization of neural states for different reaches and 2) the variance of these neural states from trial to trial. We examined population-level responses in macaque premotor cortex (PMd) during the preparatory stage of an instructed-delay center-out reaching task with dense target configurations. We found that after target onset the neural activity on single trials converges to neural states that have a clear low-dimensional structure which is organized by both the reach endpoint and maximum speed of the following reach. Further, we found that variability of the neural states during preparation resembles the spatial variability of reaches made in the absence of visual feedback: there is less variability in direction than distance in neural state space. We also used offline decoding to understand the implications of this neural population structure for brain-machine interfaces (BMIs). We found that decoding of angle between reaches is dependent on reach distance, while decoding of arc-length is independent. Thus, it might be more appropriate to quantify decoding performance for discrete BMIs by using arc-length between reach end-points rather than the angle between them. Lastly, we show that in contrast to the common notion that direction can better be decoded than distance, their decoding capabilities are comparable. These results provide new insights into the dynamical neural processes that underline motor control and can inform the design of BMIs.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/N3F6MvYWZS4" width="1" />

Mutation signatures in cancer genomes reflect endogenous and exogenous mutational processes, offering insights into tumour etiology, features for prognostic and biologic stratification and vulnerabilities to be exploited therapeutically. We present a novel machine learning formalism for improved signature inference, based on multi-modal correlated topic models (MMCTM) which can at once infer signatures from both single nucleotide and structural variation counts derived from cancer genome sequencing data. We exemplify the utility of our approach on two hormone driven, DNA repair deficient cancers: breast and ovary (n = 755 samples total). We show how introducing correlated structure both within and between modes of mutation can increase accuracy of signature discovery, particularly in the context of sparse data. Our study emphasizes the importance of integrating multiple mutation modes for signature discovery and patient stratification, and provides a statistical modeling framework to incorporate additional features of interest for future studies.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9-7X5eaEu-c" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/6/1/ENEURO.0308-18.2018?rss=1">Deletion of Ripk3 Prevents Motor Neuron Death In Vitro but not In Vivo</a></h4>

Abstract
<p>Increasing evidence suggests that necroptosis, a form of programmed cell death (PCD), contributes to neurodegeneration in several disorders, including ALS. Supporting this view, investigations in both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> models of ALS have implicated key molecular determinants of necroptosis in the death of spinal motor neurons (MNs). Consistent with a pathogenic role of necroptosis in ALS, we showed increased mRNA levels for the three main necroptosis effectors <i>Ripk1</i>, <i>Ripk3</i>, and <i>Mlkl</i> in the spinal cord of mutant superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1<sup>G93A</sup>) transgenic mice (Tg), an established model of ALS. In addition, protein levels of receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1; but not of RIPK3, MLKL or activated MLKL) were elevated in spinal cord extracts from these Tg SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice. In postmortem motor cortex samples from sporadic and familial ALS patients, no change in protein levels of RIPK1 were detected. Silencing of <i>Ripk3</i> in cultured MNs protected them from toxicity associated with SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> astrocytes. However, constitutive deletion of <i>Ripk3</i> in Tg SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice failed to provide behavioral or neuropathological improvement, demonstrating no similar benefit of <i>Ripk3</i> silencing <i>in vivo</i>. Lastly, we detected no genotype-specific myelin decompaction, proposed to be a proxy of necroptosis in ALS, in either Tg SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> or <i>Optineurin</i> knock-out mice, another ALS mouse model. These findings argue against a role for RIPK3 in Tg SOD1<sup>G93A</sup>-induced neurodegeneration and call for further preclinical investigations to determine if necroptosis plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of ALS.</p>

Visuospatial working memory enables us to maintain access to visual information for processing even when a stimulus is no longer present, due to occlusion, our own movements, or transience of the stimulus. Here we show that, when localizing remembered stimuli, the precision of spatial recall does not rely solely on memory for individual stimuli, but additionally depends on the relative distances between stimuli and visual landmarks in the surroundings. Across three separate experiments, we consistently observed a spatially selective improvement in the precision of recall for items located near a persistent landmark. While the results did not require that the landmark be visible throughout the memory delay period, it was essential that it was visible both during encoding and response. We present a simple model that can accurately capture human performance by considering relative (allocentric) spatial information as an independent localization estimate which degrades with distance and is optimally integrated with egocentric spatial information. Critically, allocentric information was encoded without cost to egocentric estimation, demonstrating independent storage of the two sources of information. Finally, when egocentric and allocentric estimates were put in conflict, the model successfully predicted the resulting localization errors. We suggest that the relative distance between stimuli represents an additional, independent spatial cue for memory recall. This cue information is likely to be critical for spatial localization in natural settings which contain an abundance of visual landmarks.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zTQCOc-GLrU" width="1" />

<p>Publication date: August 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 57</p><p>Author(s): Scott A Alpizar, In Ha Cho, Michael B Hoppa</p><div><p>Ion channels are microscopic pore proteins in the membrane that open and close in response to chemical and electrical stimuli. This simple concept underlies rapid electrical signaling in the brain as well as several important aspects of neural plasticity. Although the soma accounts for less than 1% of many neurons by membrane area, it has been the major site of measuring ion channel function. However, the axon is one of the longest processes found in cellular biology and hosts a multitude of critical signaling functions in the brain. Not only does the axon initiate and rapidly propagate action potentials (APs) across the brain but it also forms the presynaptic terminals that convert these electrical inputs into chemical outputs. Here, we review recent advances in the physiological role of ion channels within the diverse landscape of the axon and presynaptic terminals.</p></div>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/8/1539?rss=1">Increased Resurgent Sodium Currents in Nav1.8 Contribute to Nociceptive Sensory Neuron Hyperexcitability Associated with Peripheral Neuropathies</a></h4>

<p>Neuropathic pain is a significant public health challenge, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Painful small fiber neuropathy (SFN) may be caused by gain-of-function mutations in Nav1.8, a sodium channel subtype predominantly expressed in peripheral nociceptive neurons. However, it is not clear how Nav1.8 disease mutations induce sensory neuron hyperexcitability. Here we studied two mutations in Nav1.8 associated with hypersensitive sensory neurons: G1662S reported in painful SFN; and T790A, which underlies increased pain behaviors in the <i>Possum</i> transgenic mouse strain. We show that, in male DRG neurons, these mutations, which impair inactivation, significantly increase TTX-resistant resurgent sodium currents mediated by Nav1.8. The G1662S mutation doubled resurgent currents, and the T790A mutation increased them fourfold. These unusual currents are typically evoked during the repolarization phase of action potentials. We show that the T790A mutation greatly enhances DRG neuron excitability by reducing current threshold and increasing firing frequency. Interestingly, the mutation endows DRG neurons with multiple early afterdepolarizations and leads to substantial prolongation of action potential duration. In DRG neurons, siRNA knockdown of sodium channel β4 subunits fails to significantly alter T790A current density but reduces TTX-resistant resurgent currents by 56%. Furthermore, DRG neurons expressing T790A channels exhibited reduced excitability with fewer early afterdepolarizations and narrower action potentials after β4 knockdown. Together, our data demonstrate that open-channel block of TTX-resistant currents, enhanced by gain-of-function mutations in Nav1.8, can make major contributions to the hyperexcitability of nociceptive neurons, likely leading to altered sensory phenotypes including neuropathic pain in SFN.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This work demonstrates that two disease mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel Na<sub>v</sub>1.8 that induce nociceptor hyperexcitability increase resurgent currents. Nav1.8 is crucial for pain sensations. Because resurgent currents are evoked during action potential repolarization, they can be crucial regulators of action potential activity. Our data indicate that increased Nav1.8 resurgent currents in DRG neurons greatly prolong action potential duration and enhance repetitive firing. We propose that Nav1.8 open-channel block is a major factor in Nav1.8-associated pain mechanisms and that targeting the molecular mechanism underlying these unique resurgent currents represents a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of aberrant pain sensations.</p>

<p>Overreactivity and defensive behaviors in response to tactile stimuli are common symptoms in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients. Similarly, somatosensory hypersensitivity has also been described in mice lacking ASD-associated genes such as <i>Fmr1</i> (fragile X mental retardation protein 1). <i>Fmr1</i> knock-out mice also show reduced functional connectivity between sensory cortical areas, which may represent an endogenous biomarker for their hypersensitivity. Here, we measured whole-brain functional connectivity in <i>Engrailed-2</i> knock-out (<i>En2</i><sup>–/–</sup>) adult mice, which show a lower expression of <i>Fmr1</i> and anatomical defects common to <i>Fmr1</i> knock-outs. MRI-based resting-state functional connectivity in adult <i>En2</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice revealed significantly reduced synchronization in somatosensory-auditory/associative cortices and dorsal thalamus, suggesting the presence of aberrant somatosensory processing in these mutants. Accordingly, when tested in the whisker nuisance test, <i>En2</i><sup>–/–</sup> but not WT mice of both sexes showed fear behavior in response to repeated whisker stimulation. <i>En2</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice undergoing this test exhibited decreased c-Fos-positive neurons (a marker of neuronal activity) in layer IV of the primary somatosensory cortex and increased immunoreactive cells in the basolateral amygdala compared with WT littermates. Conversely, when tested in a sensory maze, <i>En2</i><sup>–/–</sup> and WT mice spent a comparable time in whisker-guided exploration, indicating that whisker-mediated behaviors are otherwise preserved in <i>En2</i> mutants. Therefore, fearful responses to somatosensory stimuli in <i>En2</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice are accompanied by reduced basal connectivity of sensory regions, reduced activation of somatosensory cortex, and increased activation of the basolateral amygdala, suggesting that impaired somatosensory processing is a common feature in mice lacking ASD-related genes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Overreactivity to tactile stimuli is a common symptom in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients. Recent studies performed in mice bearing ASD-related mutations confirmed these findings. Here, we evaluated the behavioral response to whisker stimulation in mice lacking the ASD-related gene <i>Engrailed-2</i> (<i>En2</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice). Compared with WT controls, <i>En2</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice showed reduced functional connectivity in the somatosensory cortex, which was paralleled by fear behavior, reduced activation of somatosensory cortex, and increased activation of the basolateral amygdala in response to repeated whisker stimulation. These results suggest that impaired somatosensory signal processing is a common feature in mice harboring ASD-related mutations.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/8/1505?rss=1">Degeneration of ipRGCs in Mouse Models of Huntington's Disease Disrupts Non-Image-Forming Behaviors Before Motor Impairment</a></h4>

<p>Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), which express the photopigment melanopsin, are photosensitive neurons in the retina and are essential for non-image-forming functions, circadian photoentrainment, and pupillary light reflexes. Five subtypes of ipRGCs (M1–M5) have been identified in mice. Although ipRGCs are spared in several forms of inherited blindness, they are affected in Alzheimer's disease and aging, which are associated with impaired circadian rhythms. Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal neurodegenerative disease caused by the expansion of a CAG repeat in the <i>huntingtin</i> gene. In addition to motor function impairment, HD mice also show impaired circadian rhythms and loss of ipRGC. Here, we found that, in HD mouse models (R6/2 and N171-82Q male mice), the expression of melanopsin was reduced before the onset of motor deficits. The expression of retinal T-box brain 2, a transcription factor essential for ipRGCs, was associated with the survival of ipRGCs. The number of M1 ipRGCs in R6/2 male mice was reduced due to apoptosis, whereas non-M1 ipRGCs were relatively resilient to HD progression. Most importantly, the reduced innervations of M1 ipRGCs, which was assessed by X-gal staining in R6/2-OPN4<sup>Lacz/+</sup> male mice, contributed to the diminished light-induced c-fos and vasoactive intestinal peptide in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), which may explain the impaired circadian photoentrainment in HD mice. Collectively, our results show that M1 ipRGCs were susceptible to the toxicity caused by mutant Huntingtin. The resultant impairment of M1 ipRGCs contributed to the early degeneration of the ipRGC–SCN pathway and disrupted circadian regulation during HD progression.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Circadian disruption is a common nonmotor symptom of Huntington's disease (HD). In addition to the molecular defects in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), the cause of circadian disruption in HD remains to be further explored. We hypothesized that ipRGCs, by integrating light input to the SCN, participate in the circadian regulation in HD mice. We report early reductions in melanopsin in two mouse models of HD, R6/2, and N171-82Q. Suppression of retinal T-box brain 2, a transcription factor essential for ipRGCs, by mutant Huntingtin might mediate the reduced number of ipRGCs. Importantly, M1 ipRGCs showed higher susceptibility than non-M1 ipRGCs in R6/2 mice. The resultant impairment of M1 ipRGCs contributed to the early degeneration of the ipRGC–SCN pathway and the circadian abnormality during HD progression.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/8/1484?rss=1">Activation of 5-HT1A Receptors Promotes Retinal Ganglion Cell Function by Inhibiting the cAMP-PKA Pathway to Modulate Presynaptic GABA Release in Chronic Glaucoma</a></h4>

<p>Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) receptor agonists are neuroprotective in CNS injury models. However, the neuroprotective functional implications and synaptic mechanism of 8-hydroxy-2- (di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), a serotonin receptor (5-HT1A) agonist, in an adult male Wistar rat model of chronic glaucoma model remain unknown. We found that ocular hypertension decreased 5-HT1A receptor expression in rat retinas because the number of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) was significantly reduced in rats with induced ocular hypertension relative to that in control retinas and 8-OH-DPAT enhanced the RGC viability. The protective effects of 8-OH-DPAT were blocked by intravitreal administration of the selective 5-HT1A antagonist WAY-100635 or the selective GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist SR95531. Using patch-clamp techniques, spontaneous and miniature GABAergic IPSCs (sIPSCs and mIPSCs, respectively) of RGCs in rat retinal slices were recorded. 8-OH-DPAT significantly increased the frequency and amplitude of GABAergic sIPSCs and mIPSCs in ON- and OFF-type RGCs. Among the signaling cascades mediated by the 5-HT1A receptor, the role of cAMP-protein kinase A (PKA) signaling was investigated. The 8-OH-DPAT-induced changes at the synaptic level were enhanced by PKA inhibition by H-89 and blocked by PKA activation with bucladesine. Furthermore, the density of phosphorylated PKA (p-PKA)/PKA was significantly increased in glaucomatous retinas and 8-OH-DPAT significantly decreased p-PKA/PKA expression, which led to the inhibition of PKA phosphorylation upon relieving neurotransmitter GABA release. These results showed that the activation of 5-HT1A receptors in retinas facilitated presynaptic GABA release functions by suppressing cAMP-PKA signaling and decreasing PKA phosphorylation, which could lead to the de-excitation of RGC circuits and suppress excitotoxic processes in glaucoma.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We found that serotonin (5-HT) receptors in the retina (5-HT1A receptors) were downregulated after intraocular pressure elevation. Patch-clamp recordings demonstrated differences in the frequencies of miniature GABAergic IPSCs (mIPSCs) in ON- and OFF-type retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and RGCs in normal and glaucomatous retinal slices. Therefore, phosphorylated protein kinase A (PKA) inhibition upon release of the neurotransmitter GABA was eliminated by 8-hydroxy-2- (di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), which led to increased levels of GABAergic mIPSCs in ON- and OFF-type RGCs, thus enhancing RGC viability and function. These protective effects were blocked by the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist SR95531 or the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY-100635. This study identified a novel mechanism by which activation of 5-HT1A receptors protects damaged RGCs via the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway that modulates GABAergic presynaptic activity.</p>

<p>Publication date: August 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 57</p><p>Author(s): Roeland Vanhauwaert, Vinita Bharat, Xinnan Wang</p><div><p>Neurons need to allocate and sustain mitochondria to provide adequate energy and sufficient Ca<sup>2+</sup>-buffering capacity in each sub specialization of their extensive arborizations. Damaged mitochondria, which are highly deleterious to the neuron, must be rapidly repaired or eliminated, even when they are left at terminals extremely far away from the soma. The unique shape of neurons complicates the tasks of both transporting and clearing mitochondria. Errors in the underlying molecular regulations cause detrimental neurodegeneration. Here, we review the molecular machinery and regulatory mechanisms employed to transport, distribute, and clear mitochondria in neurons, and how these fundamental regulations are compromised in neurological disorders.</p></div>

Synapse dysfunction is thought to contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. In this issue of Neuron, Tsai et al. (2019) uncover how membrane phospholipid biosynthesis regulates Drosophila photoreceptor (PR) degeneration and the synaptic vesicle pool through a transcriptional-translational feedback loop from the synaptic terminal to the nucleus.

The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is not only processed to the neurotoxic amyloid-β peptide but also to various types of secreted APP variants. In a recent issue of Science, Rice et al. (2019) now demonstrate that secreted APP functions as a modulator of synaptic transmission by binding to GABABR1a.

Accurate sensing of changes in environmental temperature is a fundamental process. Budelli et al. (2019) describe a specific type of phasic thermosensory neurons in the Drosophila arista, dubbed “cooling cells,” that rely on ionotropic receptors (IRs) for their function and mediate cold and warm avoidance.

Abstract<p>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by the repeated rise of concerns (obsessions) and repetitive unwanted behavior (compulsions). Although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is the first-choice drug, response rates to SSRI treatment vary between symptom dimensions. In this study, to find a therapeutic target for SSRI-resilient OCD symptoms, we evaluated treatment responses of quinpirole sensitization-induced OCD-related behaviors in mice. SSRI administration rescued the cognitive inflexibility, as well as hyperactivity in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC), while no improvement was observed for the repetitive behavior. D<sub>2</sub> receptor signaling in the central striatum (CS) was involved in SSRI-resistant repetitive behavior. An adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> antagonist, istradefylline, which rescued abnormal excitatory synaptic function in the CS indirect pathway medium spiny neurons of sensitized mice, alleviated both of the QNP-induced abnormal behaviors with only short-term administration. These results provide a new insight into therapeutic strategies for SSRI-resistant OCD symptoms and indicate the potential of A<sub>2A</sub> antagonists as a rapid-acting anti-OCD drug.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Clinical studies show distinct therapeutic efficacies for SSRIs between subtypes of OCD symptoms. While abnormal activity in the cortico-striatal pathway is critically involved in the pathophysiology of OCD, the neurological mechanisms and therapeutic strategies for SSRI-resistant symptoms remain unclear. In this study, we showed that repeated injection of dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptor agonist, quinpirole elicited two distinct OCD-related behaviors; cognitive inflexibility (SSRI-responsive) and repetitive behavior (SSRI-resistant). While SSRI treatment normalized hyperactivity of the orbitofrontal cortex, we also demonstrated the imbalanced excitatory inputs in the central striatum of quinpirole-treated mice and the therapeutic potential of an A<sub>2A</sub> antagonist as a modulator of indirect pathway medium spiny neurons (MSNs).</p>

Over a billion people worldwide are affected by vitamin D deficiency. Although vitamin D deficiency is associated with impaired cognition, the mechanisms mediating this link are poorly understood. The extracellular matrix (ECM) has now emerged as an important participant of synaptic plasticity and a new hypothesis is that vitamin D may interact with aggregates of the ECM, perineuronal nets (PNNs), to regulate brain plasticity. Dysregulation of PNNs caused by vitamin D deficiency may contribute to the presentation of cognitive deficits.

From an evolutionary perspective, the genes of enteric microbes transmitted reliably across generations are nearly as much a part of the human organism as our own genes. Disruption of the microbiome leading to extinction of key ‘heirloom’ taxa can deprive individuals of metabolic pathways that have been present in their ancestors for millennia. Some of these pathways support essential synthesis and toxin clearance processes, including the generation of blood–brain barrier-crossing metabolic products crucial for normal brain function.

Gene mutations associated with painless phenotypes offer great insight for analgesic development. Using a multi-modal approach, McDermott et al. show that mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.7 cause congenital insensitivity to pain due to a lack of functional nociceptors.

<p>Publication date: August 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 57</p><p>Author(s): Steven A Connor, Jonathan Elegheert, Yicheng Xie, Ann Marie Craig</p><div><p>Synapse development depends on a dynamic balance between synapse promoters and suppressors. MDGAs, immunoglobulin superfamily proteins, negatively regulate synapse development through blocking neuroligin–neurexin interactions. Recent analyses of MDGA–neuroligin complexes revealed the structural basis of this activity and indicate that MDGAs interact with all neuroligins with differential affinities. Surprisingly, analyses of mouse mutants revealed a functional divergence, with targeted mutation of <em>Mdga1</em> and <em>Mdga2</em> elevating inhibitory and excitatory synapses, respectively, on hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Further research is needed to determine the synapse-specific organizing properties of MDGAs in neural circuits, which may depend on relative levels and subcellular distributions of each MDGA, neuroligin and neurexin. Behavioral deficits in <em>Mdga</em> mutant mice support genetic links to schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders and raise the possibility of harnessing these interactions for therapeutic purposes.</p></div>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Synaptic dysfunction is widely proposed as an initial insult leading to the neurodegeneration observed in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We hypothesize that the initial insult originates in the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) due to deficits in key interneuronal functions and synaptic signaling mechanisms, in particular, Wnt (Wingless/integrated). To investigate this hypothesis, we utilized the first knock-in mouse model of AD (<span style="font-style: italic;">App</span><sup><span style="font-style: italic;">NL-F/NL-F</span></sup>), expressing a mutant form of human amyloid-β (Aβ) precursor protein. This model shows an age-dependent accumulation of Aβ, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration. Prior to the typical AD pathology, we showed a decrease in canonical Wnt signaling activity first affecting the LEC in combination with synaptic hyperexcitation and severely disrupted excitatory–inhibitory inputs onto principal cells. This synaptic imbalance was consistent with a reduction in the number of parvalbumin-containing (PV) interneurons, and a reduction in the somatic inhibitory axon terminals in the LEC compared with other cortical regions. However, targeting GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors on PV cells using allosteric modulators, diazepam, zolpidem, or a nonbenzodiazepine, L-838,417 (modulator of α2/3 subunit-containing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors), restored the excitatory–inhibitory imbalance observed at principal cells in the LEC. These data support our hypothesis, providing a rationale for targeting the synaptic imbalance in the LEC for early stage therapeutic intervention to prevent neurodegeneration in AD.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Current knowledge regarding the processing of observed manipulative actions (OMAs) (e.g., grasping, dragging, or dropping) is limited to grasping and underlying neural circuitry remains controversial. Here, we addressed these issues by combining chronic neuronal recordings along the anteroposterior extent of monkeys’ anterior intraparietal (AIP) area with tracer injections into the recorded sites. We found robust neural selectivity for 7 distinct OMAs, particularly in the posterior part of AIP (pAIP), where it was associated with motor coding of grip type and own-hand visual feedback. This cluster of functional properties appears to be specifically grounded in stronger direct connections of pAIP with the temporal regions of the ventral visual stream and the prefrontal cortex, as connections with skeletomotor related areas and regions of the dorsal visual stream exhibited opposite or no rostrocaudal gradients. Temporal and prefrontal areas may provide visual and contextual information relevant for manipulative action processing. These results revise existing models of the action observation network, suggesting that pAIP constitutes a parietal hub for routing information about OMA identity to the other nodes of the network.</span>

<p>Publication date: August 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 57</p><p>Author(s): Changliang Liu, Pascal S Kaeser</p><div><p>Dopamine controls motor functions, motivation, and reward-related learning through G-protein coupled receptor signaling. The current working model is that upon release, dopamine diffuses to influence many target cells via wide-spread receptors. Recent studies, however, suggest that dopamine release is fast and generates small signaling hotspots. In this review, we summarize progress on the understanding of the dopamine release apparatus and evaluate how its properties may shape dopamine signaling during firing. We discuss how mechanisms of regulation may act through this machinery and propose that striatal architecture for dopamine signaling may have evolved to support rapid dopamine coding.</p></div>
