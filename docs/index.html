     alt="Immunohistochemical characterization of bipolar cells in four distantly related avian species"/>
<p>In the vertebrate retina, bipolar cells are the only interneurons that project from the outer to the inner retina. Here, we systematically tested 12 antibodies for their ability to label individual bipolar cells in the bird retina and compared the eight most suitable antibodies across distantly related species, namely domestic chicken, domestic pigeon, common buzzard, and European robin. In addition, we also analyzed the photoreceptor connectivity of selected bipolar cell types in the European robin retina, which may not only process visual but also magnetic signals.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Visual (and probably also magnetic) signal processing starts at the first synapse, at which photoreceptors contact different types of bipolar cells, thereby feeding information into different processing channels. In the chicken retina, 15 and 22 different bipolar cell types have been identified based on serial electron microscopy and single-cell transcriptomics, respectively. However, immunohistochemical markers for avian bipolar cells were only anecdotally described so far. Here, we systematically tested 12 antibodies for their ability to label individual bipolar cells in the bird retina and compared the eight most suitable antibodies across distantly related species, namely domestic chicken, domestic pigeon, common buzzard, and European robin, and across retinal regions. While two markers (GNB3 and EGFR) labeled specifically ON bipolar cells, most markers labeled in addition to bipolar cells also other cell types in the avian retina. Staining pattern of four markers (CD15, PKCα, PKCβ, secretagogin) was species-specific. Two markers (calbindin and secretagogin) showed a different expression pattern in central and peripheral retina. For the chicken and European robin, we found slightly more ON bipolar cell somata in the inner nuclear layer than OFF bipolar cell somata. In contrast, OFF bipolar cells made more ribbon synapses than ON bipolar cells in the inner plexiform layer of these species. Finally, we also analyzed the photoreceptor connectivity of selected bipolar cell types in the European robin retina. In summary, we provide a catalog of bipolar cell markers for different bird species, which will greatly facilitate analyzing the retinal circuitry of birds on a larger scale.</p>

	<p>Previous studies have reported that stroke patients have difficulty recalling the motor imagery (MI) of a task, also known as MI vividness. Research on combining MI with action observation is gaining importance as a method to improve MI vividness. We enrolled 10 right-handed stroke patients and compared MI vividness and cortical activity under different presentation methods (no inverted image, inverted image of another individual&amp;amp;rsquo;s hand, and an inverted image of the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s nonparalyzed hand) using near-infrared spectroscopy. Images of the nonparalyzed upper limb were inverted to make the paralyzed upper limb appear as if it were moving. Three tasks (non inverted image, AO + MI (other hand), AO + MI (own hand)) were randomly performed on 10 stroke patients. MI vividness was significantly higher when the inverted image of the nonparalyzed upper limb was presented compared to the other conditions (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). The activity of the cortical regions was also significantly enhanced (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). Our study highlights the potential application of inverted images of a stroke patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s own nonparalyzed hand in mental practice to promote the motor recovery of stroke patients. This technique achieved higher levels of MI vividness and cortical activity when performing motor tasks.</p>

	<p>Many patients show poor outcomes following endovascular reperfusion therapy (ERT), and poor cortical venous outflow is a risk factor for these poor outcomes. We investigated the association between the outflow of the internal jugular vein (IJV) and baseline cortical venous outflow and the outcomes after ERT. We retrospectively enrolled 78 patients diagnosed with an acute anterior circulation stroke and successful ERT. Poor IJV outflow on the affected side was defined as stenosis &amp;amp;ge;50% or occlusion of ipsilateral IJV, and poor outflow of bilateral IJVs was defined as stenosis &amp;amp;ge;50% or occlusion of both IJVs. Poor cortical venous outflow was defined as a cortical vein opacification score (COVES) of 0 on admission. Multivariate analysis showed that poor outflow of IJV on the affected side was an independent predictor for hemorrhagic transformation. The poor outflow of bilateral IJVs was an independent risk factor for poor clinical outcomes. These patients also had numerical trends of a higher incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, midline shift &amp;amp;gt;10 mm, and in-hospital mortality; however, statistical significance was not observed. Additionally, poor IJV outflow was an independent determinant of poor cortical venous outflow. For acute large vessel occlusion patients, poor IJV outflow is associated with poor baseline cortical venous outflow and outcomes after successful ERT.</p>

	<p>There is currently no simple, widely available screening method for Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD), partly because the diagnosis of AD is complex and typically involves expensive and sometimes invasive tests not commonly available outside highly specialized clinical settings. Here, we developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered end-to-end system to detect AD and predict its severity directly from voice recordings. At the core of our system is the pre-trained data2vec model, the first high-performance self-supervised algorithm that works for speech, vision, and text. Our model was internally evaluated on the ADReSSo (Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s Dementia Recognition through Spontaneous Speech only) dataset containing voice recordings of subjects describing the Cookie Theft picture, and externally validated on a test dataset from DementiaBank. The AI model can detect AD with average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.846 and 0.835 on held-out and external test set, respectively. The model was well-calibrated (Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit p-value = 0.9616). Moreover, the model can reliably predict the subject&amp;amp;rsquo;s cognitive testing score solely based on raw voice recordings. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using the AI-powered end-to-end model for early AD diagnosis and severity prediction directly based on voice, showing its potential for screening Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease in a community setting.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Manipulating the activity of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons can drive nocifensive reflexes, and their firing rates are reduced following noxious stimuli. However, the pain-relevant inputs to the VTA remain incompletely understood. In this study, we used male and female mice in combination with identified dopamine and GABA neurons in the VTA that receive excitatory inputs from the periaqueductal gray (PAG), a nexus of ascending pain information. We tested whether PAG&ndash;VTA synapses undergo functional plasticity in response to a pain model using optical stimulation in conjunction with slice electrophysiology. We found that acute carrageenan inflammation does not significantly affect the strength of excitatory PAG synapses onto VTA DA neurons. However, at the PAG synapses on VTA GABA neurons, the subunit composition of NMDA receptors is altered; the complement of NR2D subunits at synaptic sites appears to be lost. Thus, our data support a model in which injury initially alters synapses on VTA GABA neurons. Over time, these alterations may increase tonic inhibition of VTA DA neurons leading to their reduced firing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Localization of TRP Channels in Healthy Oral Mucosa from Human Donors</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The oral cavity is exposed to a remarkable range of noxious and innocuous conditions, including temperature fluctuations, mechanical forces, inflammation, and environmental and endogenous chemicals. How such changes in the oral environment are sensed is not completely understood. Transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels are a diverse family of molecular receptors that are activated by chemicals, temperature changes, and tissue damage. In non-neuronal cells, TRP channels play roles in inflammation, tissue development, and maintenance. In somatosensory neurons, TRP channels mediate nociception, thermosensation, and chemosensation. To assess whether TRP channels might be involved in environmental sensing in the human oral cavity, we investigated their distribution in human tongue and hard palate biopsies. TRPV3 and TRPV4 were expressed in epithelial cells with inverse expression patterns where they likely contribute to epithelial development and integrity. TRPA1 immunoreactivity was present in fibroblasts, immune cells, and neuronal afferents, consistent with known roles of TRPA1 in sensory transduction and response to damage and inflammation. TRPM8 immunoreactivity was found in lamina propria and neuronal subpopulations including within the end bulbs of Krause, consistent with a role in thermal sensation. TRPV1 immunoreactivity was identified in intraepithelial nerve fibers and end bulbs of Krause, consistent with roles in nociception and thermosensation. TRPM8 and TRPV1 immunoreactivity in end bulbs of Krause suggest that these structures contain a variety of neuronal afferents, including those that mediate nociception, thermosensation, and mechanotransduction. Collectively, these studies support the role of TRP channels in oral environmental surveillance and response.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">SL-Cloud: A Cloud-based resource to support synthetic lethal interaction discovery [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Synthetic lethal interactions (SLIs), genetic interactions in which the simultaneous inactivation of two genes leads to a lethal phenotype, are promising targets for therapeutic intervention in cancer, as exemplified by the recent success of PARP inhibitors in treating BRCA1/2-deficient tumors. We present SL-Cloud, a new component of the Institute for Systems Biology Cancer Gateway in the Cloud (ISB-CGC), that provides an integrated framework of cloud-hosted data resources and curated workflows to enable facile prediction of SLIs. This resource addresses two main challenges related to SLI inference: the need to wrangle and preprocess large multi-omic datasets and the availability of multiple comparable prediction approaches. SL-Cloud enables customizable computational inference of SLIs and testing of prediction approaches across multiple datasets. We anticipate that cancer researchers will find utility in this tool for discovery of SLIs to support further investigation into potential drug targets for anticancer therapies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Perception of nurses, medical laboratory scientists, and midwives toward coronavirus vaccination in Khartoum State, 2021—a cross sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Nurses, medical laboratory scientists and midwives comprise a large portion of healthcare personnel. Healthcare personnel have an important role in guiding and encouraging patients and communities, and showing role modeling behavior. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate and explore the perception of nurses, medical laboratory scientists, and midwives toward coronavirus vaccination. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional facility-based study was conducted. Data were collected using an online Google form questionnaire. Demographic variables were analyzed using frequencies and percentages. The association between independent variables and the decision of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine were evaluated by binary logistic regression and Chi-square test. Results: In this study, 375 responses were collected, of which 324 (86.4%) were female. The majority of the participants (73.9%) were aged between 20 and 30 years. There were 160 (42.7%) medical laboratory scientists, 145 (38.7%) nurses, and 70 (18.7%) midwives. More than half of the participants (53.6%) accepted receiving vaccination against COVID-19. Results showed a positive correlation of vaccine acceptance with nurses, medical laboratory scientists, and midwives, suggesting that they are more likely to be vaccinated. Conclusion: There was a good perception towards COVID-19 vaccination, as 53.4% of the participants accepted receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, which is a good rate for acceptance. This finding has a positive impact on the whole vaccination process, as the recommendations of medical laboratory scientists, nurses, and midwives affect the behavior of the general population toward vaccination.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Functional tic-like presentations differ strikingly from Provisional Tic Disorder [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Recent years have seen a dramatic increase in new “tic” cases in teens and young adults. These individuals often present with fulminant onset of symptoms not commonly seen in Tourette syndrome (TS) and are often diagnosed with Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder (FND-tic). However, some authors have questioned whether this illness truly differs from typical Provisional Tic Disorder (PTD) and TS. Previous studies have compared FND-tic, usually a few months after symptom onset, to patients with TS, usually years after symptom onset. We sought to test whether the presenting symptoms of FND-tic differ substantially from those in patients at a similar duration of symptoms who are later diagnosed with TS. Methods: This comparative study examines clinical features summarized from published reports of FND-tic with novel data from a longitudinal study of PTD. This study came from a referral center for TS and tic disorders and included 89 children with tics whose first tic occurred a median of 3.6 months earlier, nearly all of whom were diagnosed with a chronic tic disorder at follow-up. Specifically, we examine clinical features identified in a recent literature review as supporting a diagnosis of FND-tic, including symptom characteristics, course, severity and comorbidity. Results: Several clinical features dramatically distinguish the patients diagnosed with FND-tic from those diagnosed with typical PTD. For example, coprophenomena are reported at or shortly after symptom onset in over half of FND-tic patients, whereas even several months after onset, coprophenomena had occurred in only 1 of 89 children with PTD. Six clinical features each have a positive predictive value over 90% for FND-tic diagnosis if prior probability is 50%. Conclusions: These new data provide strong evidence supporting the diagnostic validity of FND-tic as distinct from TS.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Investigating the circulating sphingolipidome response to a single high-intensity interval training session within healthy females and males in their twenties (SphingoHIIT): Protocol for a randomised controlled trial [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Growing scientific evidence indicates that sphingolipids predict cardiometabolic risk, independently of and beyond traditional biomarkers such as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. To date, it remains largely unknown if and how exercise, a simple, low-cost, and patient-empowering modality to optimise cardiometabolic health, influences sphingolipid levels. The SphingoHIIT study aims to assess the response of circulating sphingolipid species to a single session of high-intensity interval training (HIIT). Methods: This single-centre randomised controlled trial (RCT) will last 11 days per participant and aim to include 32 young and healthy individuals aged 20-29 (50% females). Participants will be randomly allocated to the HIIT (n= 16) or control groups (physical rest, n= 16). Participants will self-sample fasted dried blood spots for three consecutive days before the intervention (HIIT versus rest) to determine baseline sphingolipid levels. Dried blood spots will also be collected at five time points (2, 15, 30, 60min, and 24h) following the intervention (HIIT versus rest). To minimise the dietary influence, participants will receive a standardised diet for four days, starting 24 hours before the first dried blood sampling. For females, interventions will be timed to fall within the early follicular phase to minimise the menstrual cycle's influence on sphingolipid levels. Finally, physical activity will be monitored for the whole study duration using a wrist accelerometer. Ethics and dissemination: The Ethics Committee of Northwest and Central Switzerland approved this protocol (ID 2022–00513). Findings will be disseminated in scientific journals and meetings. Trial Registration The trial was registered on www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05390866, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05390866) on May 25, 2022.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Predictors of unwillingness or inaccessibility to receive the COVID-19 vaccination among persons with disabilities in Bangladesh [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Persons with disabilities (PWDs) are among the most vulnerable communities to suffer the serious consequences of COVID-19, and accepting COVID-19 vaccination is one of the recommended health advisories for them. Unwillingness to receive vaccines is a concerning issue, especially in the countries of Southeast Asia. The study aims to find out the COVID-19 vaccination rate of persons with disabilities (PWDs) in Bangladesh, the rate of unwillingness or inaccessibility of vaccination for PWDs, and predict the possible reasons for unwillingness. Methods A descriptive cross-sectional survey of PWDs aged 12 years or more was conducted in 12 rehabilitation centers in Bangladesh between February 2022 and May 2022. A self-developed structured questionnaire on socio-demographic, disability, and health indicators, acceptance and accessibility of COVID-19 vaccines, and knowledge and attitude towards vaccination was used for the survey. The study has been conducted according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines for a cross-sectional survey. Results With a 69% response rate, 241 PWDs participated in the study. PWDs with a spinal cord injury were the major respondents (62.7%). A total of 186 (77.2%) PWDs had taken one or more doses of COVID-19 vaccines of three doses supplied, and 55 (22.8%) were unwilling to have a vaccination. All vaccine recipients reported good accessibility to vaccination booths. The predictive factors of unwillingness were spinal cord injury type of disability (OR .36, P<.01), people coming to the rehabilitation center from rural areas (OR .44, P<.01), poor knowledge of COVID-19 vaccination (OR .78, P<.01), and dependency on mobility (OR.24, P<.001). Conclusion More than one-fifth of the persons with disabilities aged between 12 and 80 years were unwilling to receive the COVID-19 vaccination despite the accessibility of information and availability of the COVID-19 vaccine, mainly due to poor knowledge and mobility issues.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Goji berry (Lycium barbarum) inhibits the proliferation, adhesion, and migration of oral cancer cells by inhibiting the ERK, AKT, and CyclinD cell signaling pathways: an in-vitro study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Lycium barbarum (L. barbarum), popularly referred to as Goji berry, is a promising herb known for its powerful anti-antioxidant, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory properties. It is used in traditional Chinese medicine due to its powerful antioxidant, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory properties. It has also shown good anti-cancer properties and has been tested against liver, colon, prostate, breast, and cervical cancers. However, no study has yet evaluated the role of goji berries against oral cancer. Hence, the present paper aims to evaluate the anticancer properties of L. barbarum against oral squamous cell carcinoma. Method: Ethanolic extract of L. barbarum (EELB) was tested for its anticancer properties by performing the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, colony formation, cell proliferation, and scratch wound test. The impact of EELB on the signaling transduction pathways of Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), protein kinase (AKT1), cyclin D1 and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was also assessed by western blot. Results: The results showed that EELB can impede CAL-27 cell growth, proliferation and migration in-vitro.. It even reduced the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and AKT1 with concomitant downregulation of cyclin D1 (CCND1), cadherin 2 (CDH2), and vimentin (VIM) and upregulation of cadherin 1 (CDH1) expression suggesting its anti-proliferative and anti-EMT effects in oral cancer. Conclusion: Goji berry has good antiproliferative and anti-invasive properties. It affects potential EMT markers and signaling transduction pathways involved in oral cancers. Hence goji berry can be tried as a potential anticancer agent to manage oral squamous cell carcinoma.

                Background: People are more aware of halal products in commodity markets. Halal meat is an essential commodity for society in the Islamic commodity market in particular. The objective of this study was to analyze differences in research trends related to halal meat in published papers indexed by Scopus and Web of Science. The objective is to observe how was halal meat as commodity become the trend of research written by Indonesian authors, as well as what was the novelty of the research trend related to such tiopic. Methods: This study used purposive sampling with a bibliometric approach in collecting the samples. The samples were published papers from the Scopus and Web of Science (SCI) databases from 2006 to 25th October 2021. The were 154 samples found from cSopus and 50 samples in Web of Science (SCI). Analysis was performed by VOSviewer and biblioshiny. Results: Overall, 154 papers from Scopus and 50 from SCI were analyzed. Scopus and SCI exhibited different research trends. Moreover, papers from Scopus were dominated by Indonesian authors; those from SCI were not. The source growth of published papers in SCI was more dynamic than that in Scopus. The research trends in papers from SCI were more focused on the types of meat and the source itself. This was different to papers in Scopus, which placed greater emphasis on the supply chain. Conclusions: This paper can act as a reference for continued research into halal meat in commodity markets, especially in Islamic countries. This paper is the first to compare the research trends in halal meat in the commodity market by comparing the differences in two major indexes, Scopus and SCI.

                Background: The main factors that affect the success of an endodontic infection are effective cleaning and shaping of the root canal system including complete disinfection by using chemical irrigating solutions and obturation with an endodontic sealer to provide a fluid-tight seal. Using rotary and hand instruments for shaping and cleaning the root canal along with irrigants produces a smear layer on the surface of root dentin affecting the penetration of the endodontic sealer into the dentinal tubules. This smear is difficult to remove with the use of only endodontic irrigants, hence, chelating agents were introduced in adjunct with irrigating solutions for irrigation protocol for effective removal of smear layer which effect the penetration of endodontic sealers into the dentinal tubules. Methods: 32 mandibular premolar teeth were used. The biomechanical preparation was done till Protaper F3 size. Irrigation was done with 2.5 mL sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) solution after each instrumentation change for 1 min. Samples were then divided into 4 groups according to the irrigating solution used as the final rinse used with passive ultrasonic agitation. The groups were: Group I: 5 ml of saline, Group II: 5ml of 17% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, Group III: 5 ml of 10% citric acid, Group IV: 5 ml of 7% maleic acid each for one minute. All the canals were obturated with BioRoottmRCS with gutta-percha using the ultrasonic condensation technique. For staining the samples for Confocal LASER microscopy, BioRoottmRCS was mixed with Rhodamine B dye. Results: The maximum penetration of bio-ceramic sealer was observed in the coronal region. At the apical third, the maximum sealer penetration was seen with 7% maleic acid. Conclusions: Maximum sealer penetration was seen in the coronal section followed by the middle and apical section. Maximum sealer penetration was seen with 7 % maleic acid at the apical third.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Mesoscopic description of hippocampal replay and metastability in spiking neural networks with short-term plasticity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Bastian Pietras, Valentin Schmutz, Tilo Schwalger</p>

Bottom-up models of functionally relevant patterns of neural activity provide an explicit link between neuronal dynamics and computation. A prime example of functional activity patterns are propagating bursts of place-cell activities called hippocampal replay, which is critical for memory consolidation. The sudden and repeated occurrences of these burst states during ongoing neural activity suggest metastable neural circuit dynamics. As metastability has been attributed to noise and/or slow fatigue mechanisms, we propose a concise mesoscopic model which accounts for both. Crucially, our model is bottom-up: it is analytically derived from the dynamics of finite-size networks of Linear-Nonlinear Poisson neurons with short-term synaptic depression. As such, noise is explicitly linked to stochastic spiking and network size, and fatigue is explicitly linked to synaptic dynamics. To derive the mesoscopic model, we first consider a homogeneous spiking neural network and follow the temporal coarse-graining approach of Gillespie to obtain a “chemical Langevin equation”, which can be naturally interpreted as a stochastic neural mass model. The Langevin equation is computationally inexpensive to simulate and enables a thorough study of metastable dynamics in classical setups (population spikes and Up-Down-states dynamics) by means of phase-plane analysis. An extension of the Langevin equation for small network sizes is also presented. The stochastic neural mass model constitutes the basic component of our mesoscopic model for replay. We show that the mesoscopic model faithfully captures the statistical structure of individual replayed trajectories in microscopic simulations and in previously reported experimental data. Moreover, compared to the deterministic Romani-Tsodyks model of place-cell dynamics, it exhibits a higher level of variability regarding order, direction and timing of replayed trajectories, which seems biologically more plausible and could be functionally desirable. This variability is the product of a new dynamical regime where metastability emerges from a complex interplay between finite-size fluctuations and local fatigue.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Mechanistic model for human brain metabolism and its connection to the neurovascular coupling</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nicolas Sundqvist, Sebastian Sten, Peter Thompson, Benjamin Jan Andersson, Maria Engström, Gunnar Cedersund</p>

The neurovascular and neurometabolic couplings (NVC and NMC) connect cerebral activity, blood flow, and metabolism. This interconnection is used in for instance functional imaging, which analyses the blood-oxygen-dependent (BOLD) signal. The mechanisms underlying the NVC are complex, which warrants a model-based analysis of data. We have previously developed a mechanistically detailed model for the NVC, and others have proposed detailed models for cerebral metabolism. However, existing metabolic models are still not fully utilizing available magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) data and are not connected to detailed models for NVC. Therefore, we herein present a new model that integrates mechanistic modelling of both MRS and BOLD data. The metabolic model covers central metabolism, using a minimal set of interactions, and can describe time-series data for glucose, lactate, aspartate, and glutamate, measured after visual stimuli. Statistical tests confirm that the model can describe both estimation data and predict independent validation data, not used for model training. The interconnected NVC model can simultaneously describe BOLD data and can be used to predict expected metabolic responses in experiments where metabolism has not been measured. This model is a step towards a useful and mechanistically detailed model for cerebral blood flow and metabolism, with potential applications in both basic research and clinical applications.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The effects of base rate neglect on sequential belief updating and real-world beliefs</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Brandon K. Ashinoff, Justin Buck, Michael Woodford, Guillermo Horga</p>

Base-rate neglect is a pervasive bias in judgment that is conceptualized as underweighting of prior information and can have serious consequences in real-world scenarios. This bias is thought to reflect variability in inferential processes but empirical support for a cohesive theory of base-rate neglect with sufficient explanatory power to account for longer-term and real-world beliefs is lacking. A Bayesian formalization of base-rate neglect in the context of sequential belief updating predicts that belief trajectories should exhibit dynamic patterns of dependence on the order in which evidence is presented and its consistency with prior beliefs. To test this, we developed a novel ‘urn-and-beads’ task that systematically manipulated the order of colored bead sequences and elicited beliefs via an incentive-compatible procedure. Our results in two independent online studies confirmed the predictions of the sequential base-rate neglect model: people exhibited beliefs that are more influenced by recent evidence and by evidence inconsistent with prior beliefs. We further found support for a noisy-sampling inference model whereby base-rate neglect results from rational discounting of noisy internal representations of prior beliefs. Finally, we found that model-derived indices of base-rate neglect—including noisier prior representation—correlated with propensity for unusual beliefs outside the laboratory. Our work supports the relevance of Bayesian accounts of sequential base-rate neglect to real-world beliefs and hints at strategies to minimize deleterious consequences of this pervasive bias.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Integrating unsupervised language model with triplet neural networks for protein gene ontology prediction</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yi-Heng Zhu, Chengxin Zhang, Dong-Jun Yu, Yang Zhang</p>

Accurate identification of protein function is critical to elucidate life mechanisms and design new drugs. We proposed a novel deep-learning method, ATGO, to predict Gene Ontology (GO) attributes of proteins through a triplet neural-network architecture embedded with pre-trained language models from protein sequences. The method was systematically tested on 1068 non-redundant benchmarking proteins and 3328 targets from the third Critical Assessment of Protein Function Annotation (CAFA) challenge. Experimental results showed that ATGO achieved a significant increase of the GO prediction accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art approaches in all aspects of molecular function, biological process, and cellular component. Detailed data analyses showed that the major advantage of ATGO lies in the utilization of pre-trained transformer language models which can extract discriminative functional pattern from the feature embeddings. Meanwhile, the proposed triplet network helps enhance the association of functional similarity with feature similarity in the sequence embedding space. In addition, it was found that the combination of the network scores with the complementary homology-based inferences could further improve the accuracy of the predicted models. These results demonstrated a new avenue for high-accuracy deep-learning function prediction that is applicable to large-scale protein function annotations from sequence alone.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The catecholamine precursor Tyrosine reduces autonomic arousal and decreases decision thresholds in reinforcement learning and temporal discounting</a></h4>

              
                <p>by David Mathar, Mani Erfanian Abdoust, Tobias Marrenbach, Deniz Tuzsus, Jan Peters</p>

Supplementation with the catecholamine precursor L-Tyrosine might enhance cognitive performance, but overall findings are mixed. Here, we investigate the effect of a single dose of tyrosine (2g) vs. placebo on two catecholamine-dependent trans-diagnostic traits: model-based control during reinforcement learning (2-step task) and temporal discounting, using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject design (n = 28 healthy male participants). We leveraged drift diffusion models in a hierarchical Bayesian framework to jointly model participants’ choices and response times in both tasks. Furthermore, comprehensive autonomic monitoring (heart rate, heart rate variability, pupillometry, spontaneous eye-blink rate) was performed both pre- and post-supplementation, to explore potential physiological effects of supplementation. Across tasks, tyrosine consistently reduced participants’ RTs without deteriorating task-performance. Diffusion modeling linked this effect to attenuated decision-thresholds in both tasks and further revealed increased model-based control (2-step task) and (if anything) attenuated temporal discounting. On the physiological level, participants’ pupil dilation was predictive of the individual degree of temporal discounting. Tyrosine supplementation reduced physiological arousal as revealed by increases in pupil dilation variability and reductions in heart rate. Supplementation-related changes in physiological arousal predicted individual changes in temporal discounting. Our findings provide first evidence that tyrosine supplementation might impact psychophysiological parameters, and suggest that modeling approaches based on sequential sampling models can yield novel insights into latent cognitive processes modulated by amino-acid supplementation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">An individualized causal framework for learning intercellular communication networks that define microenvironments of individual tumors</a></h4>

Cells within a tumor microenvironment (TME) dynamically communicate and influence each other’s cellular states through an intercellular communication network (ICN). In cancers, intercellular communications underlie immune evasion mechanisms of individual tumors. We developed an individualized causal analysis framework for discovering tumor specific ICNs. Using head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tumors as a testbed, we first mined single-cell RNA-sequencing data to discover gene expression modules (GEMs) that reflect the states of transcriptomic processes within tumor and stromal single cells. By deconvoluting bulk transcriptomes of HNSCC tumors profiled by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we estimated the activation states of these transcriptomic processes in individual tumors. Finally, we applied individualized causal network learning to discover an ICN within each tumor. Our results show that cellular states of cells in TMEs are coordinated through ICNs that enable multi-way communications among epithelial, fibroblast, endothelial, and immune cells. Further analyses of individual ICNs revealed structural patterns that were shared across subsets of tumors, leading to the discovery of 4 different subtypes of networks that underlie disparate TMEs of HNSCC. Patients with distinct TMEs exhibited significantly different clinical outcomes. Our results show that the capability of estimating individual ICNs reveals heterogeneity of ICNs and sheds light on the importance of intercellular communication in impacting disease development and progression.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Threat management priorities for conserving Antarctic biodiversity</a></h4>

Antarctic terrestrial biodiversity faces multiple threats, from invasive species to climate change. Yet no large-scale assessments of threat management strategies exist. Applying a structured participatory approach, we demonstrate that existing conservation efforts are insufficient in a changing world, estimating that 65% (at best 37%, at worst 97%) of native terrestrial taxa and land-associated seabirds are likely to decline by 2100 under current trajectories. Emperor penguins are identified as the most vulnerable taxon, followed by other seabirds and dry soil nematodes. We find that implementing 10 key threat management strategies in parallel, at an estimated present-day equivalent annual cost of US$23 million, could benefit up to 84% of Antarctic taxa. Climate change is identified as the most pervasive threat to Antarctic biodiversity and influencing global policy to effectively limit climate change is the most beneficial conservation strategy. However, minimising impacts of human activities and improved planning and management of new infrastructure projects are cost-effective and will help to minimise regional threats. Simultaneous global and regional efforts are critical to secure Antarctic biodiversity for future generations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Multispecies biofilm architecture determines bacterial exposure to phages</a></h4>

              
                <p>by James B. Winans, Benjamin R. Wucher, Carey D. Nadell</p>

Numerous ecological interactions among microbes—for example, competition for space and resources, or interaction among phages and their bacterial hosts—are likely to occur simultaneously in multispecies biofilm communities. While biofilms formed by just a single species occur, multispecies biofilms are thought to be more typical of microbial communities in the natural environment. Previous work has shown that multispecies biofilms can increase, decrease, or have no measurable impact on phage exposure of a host bacterium living alongside another species that the phages cannot target. The reasons underlying this variability are not well understood, and how phage–host encounters change within multispecies biofilms remains mostly unexplored at the cellular spatial scale. Here, we study how the cellular scale architecture of model 2-species biofilms impacts cell–cell and cell–phage interactions controlling larger scale population and community dynamics. Our system consists of dual culture biofilms of <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Vibrio cholerae</i> under exposure to T7 phages, which we study using microfluidic culture, high-resolution confocal microscopy imaging, and detailed image analysis. As shown previously, sufficiently mature biofilms of <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> can protect themselves from phage exposure via their curli matrix. Before this stage of biofilm structural maturity, <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> is highly susceptible to phages; however, we show that these bacteria can gain lasting protection against phage exposure if they have become embedded in the bottom layers of highly packed groups of <i>V</i>. <i>cholerae</i> in co-culture. This protection, in turn, is dependent on the cell packing architecture controlled by <i>V</i>. <i>cholerae</i> biofilm matrix secretion. In this manner, <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> cells that are otherwise susceptible to phage-mediated killing can survive phage exposure in the absence of de novo resistance evolution. While co-culture biofilm formation with <i>V</i>. <i>cholerae</i> can confer phage protection to <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i>, it comes at the cost of competing with <i>V</i>. <i>cholerae</i> and a disruption of normal curli-mediated protection for <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> even in dual species biofilms grown over long time scales. This work highlights the critical importance of studying multispecies biofilm architecture and its influence on the community dynamics of bacteria and phages.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Recent evidence supports a link between increased TDP-43 burden and the presence of an <i>APOE4</i> gene allele in Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, it is difficult to conclude the direct effect of <i>APOE</i> on TDP-43 pathology due to the presence of mixed AD pathologies. The goal of this study is to address how APOE isoforms impact TDP-43 pathology and related neurodegeneration in the absence of typical AD pathologies.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We overexpressed human TDP-43 via viral transduction in humanized <i>APOE2</i>, <i>APOE3</i>, <i>APOE4</i> mice, and murine <i>Apoe</i>-knockout (<i>Apoe</i>-KO) mice. Behavior tests were performed across ages. Animals were harvested at 11 months of age and TDP-43 overexpression-related neurodegeneration and gliosis were assessed. To further address the human relevance, we analyzed the association of <i>APOE</i> with TDP-43 pathology in 160 postmortem brains from autopsy-confirmed amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with motor neuron disease (FTLD-MND) in the Mayo Clinic Brain Bank.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found that TDP-43 overexpression induced motor function deficits, neuronal loss, and gliosis in the motor cortex, especially in <i>APOE2</i> mice, with much milder or absent effects in <i>APOE3</i>, <i>APOE4</i>, or <i>Apoe</i>-KO mice. In the motor cortex of the ALS and FTLD-MND postmortem human brains, we found that the <i>APOE</i>2 allele was associated with more severe TDP-43-positive dystrophic neurites.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our data suggest a genotype-specific effect of <i>APOE</i> on TDP-43 proteinopathy and neurodegeneration in the absence of AD pathology, with the strongest association seen with <i>APOE2</i>.</p>

While there were no effects on the development of dystonic signs or locomotor behavior, genotype-related changes in neuronal activity indicate striatal malfunction and an abnormal response to optogenetic inhibition of Parv+ in DYT1 knock-in mice.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The pathophysiology of early-onset torsion dystonia (TOR1A/DYT1) remains unclear. Like 70% of human mutation carriers, rodent models with ΔGAG mutation such as DYT1 knock-in (KI) mice do not show overt dystonia but have subtle sensorimotor deficits and pattern of abnormal synaptic plasticity within the striatal microcircuits. There is evidence that dysfunction of striatal parvalbumin-reactive (Parv+) fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) can be involved in dystonic signs. To elucidate the relevance of these GABAergic interneurons in the pathophysiology of DYT1 dystonia, we used in vivo optogenetics to specifically inhibit Parv+ and to detect changes in motor behavior and neuronal activity. Optogenetic fibers were bilaterally implanted into the dorsal striatum of male DYT1 KI mice and wild-type (WT) littermates expressing halorhodopsin (eNpHR3.0) in Parv+ interneurons. While stimulations with yellow light pulses for up to 60 min at different pulse durations and interval lengths did not induce abnormal movements, such as dystonic signs, immunohistochemical examinations revealed genotype-dependent differences. In contrast to WT mice, stimulated DYT1 KI showed decreased striatal neuronal activity, that is, less c-Fos reactive neurons, and increased activation of cholinergic interneurons after optogenetic inhibition of Parv+ interneurons. These findings suggest an involvement of Parv+ interneurons in an impaired striatal network in DYT1 KI mice, but at least short-term inhibition of these GABAergic interneurons is not sufficient to trigger a dystonic phenotype, similar to previously shown optogenetic activation of cholinergic interneurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Modified recurrent equation-based cubic spline interpolation for missing data recovery in phasor measurement unit (PMU) [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Smart grid systems require high-quality phasor measurement unit (PMU) data for proper operation, control, and decision-making. Missing PMU data may lead to improper actions or even blackouts. While the conventional cubic interpolation methods based on the solution of a set of linear equations to solve for the cubic spline coefficients have been applied by many researchers for the interpolation of missing data, the computational complexity increases non-linearly with increasing data size. Methods: In this work, a modified recurrent equation-based cubic spline interpolation procedure for recovering missing PMU data is proposed. The recurrent equation-based method makes the computations of spline constants simpler. Using PMU data from the State Load Despatch Center (SLDC) in Madhya Pradesh, India, a comparison of the root mean square error (RMSE) values and time of calculation (ToC) is calculated for both methods. Results: The modified recurrent relation method could retrieve missing values 10 times faster when compared to the conventional cubic interpolation method based on the solution of a set of linear equations.  The RMSE values have shown the proposed method is effective even for special cases of missing values (edges, continuous missing values). Conclusions: The proposed method can retrieve any number of missing values at any location using observed data with a minimal number of calculations.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Circadian clock control of tRNA synthetases in Neurospora crassa [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In Neurospora crassa, the circadian clock controls rhythmic mRNA translation initiation through regulation of the eIF2α kinase CPC-3 (the homolog of yeast and mammalian GCN2). Active CPC-3 phosphorylates and inactivates eIF2α, leading to higher phosphorylated eIF2α (P-eIF2α) levels and reduced translation initiation during the subjective day. This daytime activation of CPC-3 is driven by its binding to uncharged tRNA, and uncharged tRNA levels peak during the day under control of the circadian clock. The daily rhythm in uncharged tRNA levels could arise from rhythmic amino acid levels or aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRSs) levels. Methods: To determine if and how the clock potentially controls rhythms in aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (AspRS) and glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (GlnRS), both observed to be rhythmic in circadian genomic datasets, transcriptional and translational fusions to luciferase were generated. These luciferase reporter fusions were examined in wild type (WT), clock mutant Δfrq, and clock-controlled transcription factor deletion strains. Results: Translational and transcriptional fusions of AspRS and GlnRS to luciferase confirmed that their protein levels are clock-controlled with peak levels at night. Moreover, clock-controlled transcription factors NCU00275 and ADV-1 drive robust rhythmic protein expression of AspRS and GlnRS, respectively. Conclusions: These data support a model whereby coordinate clock control of select aaRSs drives rhythms in uncharged tRNAs, leading to rhythmic CPC-3 activation, and rhythms in translation of specific mRNAs.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The relationship between climate change and malaria in South-East Asia: A systematic review of the evidence [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Climatic change is an inescapable fact that implies alterations in seasons where weather occurrences have their schedules shift from the regular and magnitudes intensify to more extreme variations over a multi-year period. Southeast Asia is one of the many regions experiencing changes in climate and concurrently still has endemicities of malaria. Given that previous studies have suggested the influence of climate on malaria’s vector the Anopheles mosquitoes and parasite the Plasmodium group, this study was conducted to review the evidence of associations made between malaria cases and climatic variables in Southeast Asia throughout a multi-year period. Methods: Our systematic literature review was informed by the PRISMA guidelines and registered in PROSPERO: CRD42022301826 on 5th February 2022. We searched for original articles in English and Indonesian that focused on the associations between climatic variables and malaria cases. Results: The initial identification stage resulted in 535 records of possible relevance and after abstract screening and eligibility assessment we included 19 research articles for the systematic review. Based on the reviewed articles, changing temperatures, precipitation, humidity and windspeed were considered for statistical association across a multi-year period and are correlated with malaria cases in various regions throughout Southeast Asia. Conclusions: According to the review of evidence, climatic variables that exhibited a statistically significant correlation with malaria cases include temperatures, precipitation, and humidity. The strength of each climatic variable varies across studies. Our systematic review of the limited evidence indicates that further research for the Southeast Asia region remains to be explored.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Molecular mechanism underlying desensitization of the proton-activated chloride channel PAC</a></h4>

              
                Desensitization is a common property of membrane receptors, including ion channels. The newly identified proton-activated chloride (PAC) channel plays an important role in regulating the pH and size of organelles in the endocytic pathway, and is also involved in acid-induced cell death. However, how the PAC channel desensitizes is largely unknown. Here, we show by patch-clamp electrophysiological studies that PAC (also known as TMEM206/ASOR) undergoes pH-dependent desensitization upon prolonged acid exposure. Through structure-guided and comprehensive mutagenesis, we identified several residues critical for PAC desensitization, including histidine (H) 98, glutamic acid (E) 94, and aspartic acid (D) 91 at the extracellular extension of the transmembrane helix 1 (TM1), as well as E107, D109, and E250 at the extracellular domain (ECD)–transmembrane domain (TMD) interface. Structural analysis and molecular dynamic simulations revealed extensive interactions between residues at the TM1 extension and those at the ECD–TMD interface. These interactions likely facilitate PAC desensitization by stabilizing the desensitized conformation of TM1, which undergoes a characteristic rotational movement from the resting and activated states to the desensitized state. Our studies establish a new paradigm of channel desensitization in this ubiquitously expressed ion channel and pave the way for future investigation of its relevance in cellular physiology and disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Adaptation dynamics between copy-numberand point mutations</a></h4>

              
                Together, copy-number and point mutations form the basis for most evolutionary novelty, through the process of gene duplication and divergence. While a plethora of genomic data reveals the long-term fate of diverging coding sequences and their <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements, little is known about the early dynamics around the duplication event itself. In microorganisms, selection for increased gene expression often drives the expansion of gene copy-number mutations, which serves as a crude adaptation, prior to divergence through refining point mutations. Using a simple synthetic genetic reporter system that can distinguish between copy-number and point mutations, we study their early and transient adaptive dynamics in real-time in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. We find two qualitatively different routes of adaptation, depending on the level of functional improvement needed. In conditions of high gene expression demand, the two mutation types occur as a combination. However, under low gene expression demand, copy-number and point mutations are mutually exclusive; here, owing to their higher frequency, adaptation is dominated by copy-number mutations, in a process we term Amplification Hindrance. Ultimately, due to high reversal rates and pleiotropic cost, copy-number mutations may not only serve as a crude and transient adaptation, but also constrain sequence divergence over evolutionary time scales.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A generalizable brain extraction net (BEN) for multimodal MRI data from rodents, nonhuman primates, and humans</a></h4>

              
                Accurate brain tissue extraction on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data is crucial for analyzing brain structure and function. While several conventional tools have been optimized to handle human brain data, there have been no generalizable methods to extract brain tissues for multimodal MRI data from rodents, nonhuman primates, and humans. Therefore, developing a flexible and generalizable method for extracting whole brain tissue across species would allow researchers to analyze and compare experiment results more efficiently. Here, we propose a domain-adaptive and semi-supervised deep neural network, named the Brain Extraction Net (BEN), to extract brain tissues across species, MRI modalities, and MR scanners. We have evaluated BEN on 18 independent datasets, including 783 rodent MRI scans, 246 nonhuman primate MRI scans, and 4,601 human MRI scans, covering five species, four modalities, and six MR scanners with various magnetic field strengths. Compared to conventional toolboxes, the superiority of BEN is illustrated by its robustness, accuracy, and generalizability. Our proposed method not only provides a generalized solution for extracting brain tissue across species but also significantly improves the accuracy of atlas registration, thereby benefiting the downstream processing tasks. As a novel fully automated deep-learning method, BEN is designed as an open-source software to enable high-throughput processing of neuroimaging data across species in preclinical and clinical applications.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Long non-coding RNA Neat1 and paraspeckle components are translational regulators in hypoxia</a></h4>

              
                Internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) drive translation initiation during stress. In response to hypoxia, (lymph)angiogenic factors responsible for tissue revascularization in ischemic diseases are induced by the IRES-dependent mechanism. Here we searched for IRES <i>trans</i>-acting factors (ITAFs) active in early hypoxia in mouse cardiomyocytes. Using knock-down and proteomics approaches, we show a link between a stressed-induced nuclear body, the paraspeckle, and IRES-dependent translation. Furthermore, smiFISH experiments demonstrate the recruitment of IRES-containing mRNA into paraspeckle during hypoxia. Our data reveal that the long non-coding RNA <i>Neat1</i>, an essential paraspeckle component, is a key translational regulator, active on IRESs of (lymph)angiogenic and cardioprotective factor mRNAs. In addition, paraspeckle proteins p54<sup>nrb</sup> and PSPC1 as well as nucleolin and RPS2, two p54<sup>nrb</sup>-interacting proteins identified by mass spectrometry, are ITAFs for IRES subgroups. Paraspeckle thus appears as a platform to recruit IRES-containing mRNAs and possibly host IRESome assembly. Polysome PCR array shows that <i>Neat1</i> isoforms regulate IRES-dependent translation and, more widely, translation of mRNAs involved in stress response.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Children Develop Adult-Like Visual Sensitivity to Image Memorability by the Age of Four</a></h4>

              
                Adults have been shown to consistently remember and forget certain images despite large individual differences, suggesting a population-wide sensitivity to an image's intrinsic memorability--a measure of how successfully an image is remembered. While a decade of research has focused on image memorability among adults, the developmental trajectory of these consistencies in memory is understudied. Here, we investigate by what age children gain adult-like sensitivity to the image memorability effect. We utilized data from Saragosa-Harris et al. (2021), where 137 children aged between 3 and 5 years old encoded animal-scene image pairs and then after a 5-minute, 24-hour, or 1-week delay performed a cued recognition task for each scene target given its animal cue. We tested adults' memory of the same scene images using ResMem (Needell & Bainbridge, 2022), a pre-trained deep neural network that predicts adult image memorability scores, and using an online behavioral continuous recognition task (N = 116). Results showed that ResMem predictions, as a proxy of adults' memory, predicted scene memory of children by the age of 4 and were the most predictive of children's memory across ages after a long, 1-week delay. Children at age 3 show non-adult-like consistent memory patterns, implying that the non-adult-like memory patterns were not due to poor memory performance. Instead, 3-year-olds may have consistently used certain visual memory strategies that become less optimal as they age. Our results suggest that adult-like sensitivity to image memorability emerges by the age of 4 through experience.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Intragastric administration of low-dose rotenone post-colitis exacerbates damage to the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system in Parkinson's disease: The pace accelerates even more</a></h4>

              
                Background: The contribution of gastrointestinal (GI) inflammation and local exposure to neurotoxins in the gut offers the most in-depth explanation of Parkinson's disease (PD) etiopathogenesis through abnormal accumulation and spreading of alpha-synuclein (-syn) aggregates from the gut to the brain. Objectives: This study was designed to investigate whether dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-mediated colitis may have lasting effects on dopaminergic pathways in the brain and whether or not colitis exacerbated susceptibility to later exposure to the neurotoxin rotenone. Methods: To induce chronic colitis, 10 months old C57BL/6 mice were pre-exposed to 3 cycles of 7 days of 1% (w/v) DSS administration in drinking water followed by 14 days of regular drinking water. After colitis-induction, animals received a low dose of intragastric rotenone for the next 8 weeks, followed by testing for Parkinsonian behavior and GI phenotypes of inflammation. At the end of the 8th week after colitis, colon, brain stem, and midbrain tissue were isolated and analyzed for -syn, inflammatory markers, and dopaminergic neuronal loss. Gut microbial composition was assessed by 16S rRNA sequencing analysis. Results: We found that local rotenone exposure for 8 weeks did not affect colitis severity and colonic tight junction (TJ) protein expression (ZO-1, Occludin, and Claudin-1). On the other hand, we found that while eight weeks of chronic rotenone administration led to an increase in inflammatory markers, the presence of pre-existing colitis resulted in a considerable change in gut microbiota composition and a decrease in TJ's protein expression. In addition, the administration of rotenone in mice post-colitis caused gastrointestinal function impairment and poor behavioral performances. Itworsened rotenone-induced -syn pathology in the colon, which extended upward and resulted in severe dopaminergic neuron loss and significant astroglia activation in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV), locus coeruleus, substantia nigra as well as in striatum. Interestingly, in the case of rotenone alone, we found that -syn induced ChAT+ neuronal death is restricted to the DMV. These findings indicate that long-term rotenone exposure in conjunction with early inflammatory intestinal milieu exacerbates the progression of -syn pathology and aggravates neurodegeneration in the intragastric mouse PD model. Conclusions: This work provides detailed insight into the involvement of GI inflammation triggered after a neurotoxic insult in the colon and explores their potential to impact central dopaminergic degeneration in PD. This way, we can identify potential therapeutic targets that stop the enteric inflammatory processes involved in progressing PD.

                The development of automatic methods for image and video quality assessment that correlate well with the perception of human observers is a very challenging open problem in vision science, with numerous practical applications in disciplines such as image processing and computer vision, as well as in the media industry. In the past two decades, the goal of image quality research has been to improve upon classical metrics by developing models that emulate some aspects of the visual system, and while the progress has been considerable, state-of-the-art quality assessment methods still share a number of shortcomings, like their performance dropping considerably when they are tested on a database that is quite different from the one used to train them, or their significant limitations in predicting observer scores for high framerate videos. In this work we propose a novel objective method for image and video quality assessment that is based on the recently introduced Intrinsically Non-linear Receptive Field (INRF) formulation, a neural summation model that has been shown to be better at predicting neural activity and visual perception phenomena than the classical linear receptive field. Here we start by optimizing, on a classic image quality database, the four parameters of a very simple INRF-based metric, and proceed to test this metric on three other databases, showing that its performance equals or surpasses that of the state-of-the-art methods, some of them having millions of parameters. Next, we extend to the temporal domain this INRF image quality metric, and test it on a very recent video dataset of high definition, high-quality videos, of standard as well as high framerate, processed at different compression levels, and with thousands of human quality scores. Our results show that the proposed INRF-based video quality metric consistently outperforms, often by a wide margin, the state-of-the-art in video quality metrics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">E/I unbalance and aberrant oscillation dynamics predict preclinical Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major cause of dementia linked with severe decrement of cognitive functions. Animal models and presence of epileptiform activity (subclinical/clinical) suggest that neuronal hyper-excitability could play a role in the continuum of AD. The prevalence of amyloid pathology is thought to impact GABAergic terminals potentially disrupting the excitatory-inhibitory (E/I) synaptic balance and causing network dysfunction and cognitive impairment. However, there is no direct neurophysiological evidence in humans of such mechanism throughout the different stages of the disease, nor reliable markers to predict its earliest manifestations (i.e., subjective cognitive decline, SCD). Here, we use novel metrics for directly testing the hypothesis that alterations in the brain temporal coordination and non-linear dynamics should reflect underlying changes in the E/I balance. To that aim, we measured brain activity with magnetoencephalography (MEG) in a cross-sectional cohort of 343 participants (116 neurotypical controls (NC), 85 SCD, and 142 MCI). We quantified non-linear dynamics as power-law long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs) in brain oscillations, a well-known proxy for brain criticality. We demonstrate that attenuations in LRTCs and changes in their spectral profile reliably dissociate NC, SCD, and MCI individuals and that such disrupted brain dynamics are caused by exacerbated excitation shifting the dynamical regime toward a supercritical phase. Additionally, we show that aberrant non-linear dynamics predict conversion from MCI to AD using data from a longitudinal cohort. Machine learning modeling with k-nearest neighbors classification demonstrated the ability of LRTCs and E/I estimates to discriminate early-stage AD patients with better accuracy than classical structural features, highlighting their potential role as early biomarkers of AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Functional genomic mechanisms of opioids: a systematic review of animal and human studies</a></h4>

              
                In the past two decades, over-prescription of opioids for pain management has driven a steep increase in opioid use disorder (OUD) and death by overdose, exerting a dramatic toll on western countries. OUD is a chronic relapsing disease associated with a lifetime struggle to control drug consumption, suggesting that opioids trigger long-lasting brain adaptations, notably through functional genomic and epigenomic mechanisms. Current understanding of these processes, however, remain scarce, and have not been previously reviewed systematically. To do so, the goal of the present work was to synthesize current knowledge on genome-wide transcriptomic and epigenetic mechanisms of opioid action, in primate and rodent species. Using a prospectively registered methodology, comprehensive literature searches were completed in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science. Of the 2705 articles identified, 69 met our inclusion criteria and were considered for qualitative analysis. Focusing on the 5 most studied nervous system structures (nucleus accumbens, frontal cortex, whole striatum, dorsal striatum, spinal cord; 44 articles), we also conducted a quantitative analysis of differentially expressed genes, in an effort to identify a putative core transcriptional signature of opioids. Only one gene, Cdkn1a, was replicated in six studies and, globally, our results unveil surprisingly low consistency across published work, even when considering most recent single-cell approaches. Analysis of putative sources for this poor reproducibility suggest contributions from species, brain structures, duration of opioid exposure, as well as batch effects. To go beyond those limitations, we leveraged threshold-free methods to illustrate how genome-wide comparisons may generate new findings and hypotheses. Finally, we discuss current methodological development in the field, and their implication for future research and, ultimately, better care.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Is short sleep bad for the brain? Brain structure and cognitive function in short sleepers</a></h4>

              
                Many sleep less than recommended without experiencing daytime tiredness. According to prevailing views, short sleep increases risk of lower brain health and cognitive function. Chronic mild sleep deprivation could cause undetected sleep debt, negatively affecting cognitive function and brain health. However, it is possible that some have less sleep needs and are more resistant to negative effects of sleep loss. We investigated this question using a combined cross-sectional and longitudinal sample of 47,029 participants (age 20-89 years) with measures of self-reported sleep, including 51,295 MRIs of the brain and cognitive tests. 701 participants who reported to sleep < 6 hours did not experience any daytime tiredness or sleep problems. These short sleepers showed on average larger regional brain volumes and only slightly lower general cognitive function compared to a group of 7-8 hours healthy sleepers (n = 3754). In contrast, short sleepers reporting excessive daytime tiredness and sleep problems (n = 1619) had smaller brain volumes and lower cognitive scores. Analyses using accelerometer-estimated sleep duration confirmed the findings, and the associations remained after controlling for body mass index, depression symptoms, income and education. The results suggest that some people can cope with less sleep without obvious negative consequences for brain health, in line with a view on sleep need as individualized. Tiredness and sleep problems seem to be more relevant for neurocognitive function than sleep duration per se.

                Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is associated with the accumulation of fibrillar A[beta]; peptides upon and within the cerebral vasculature, which leads to loss of vascular integrity and contributes to disease progression in Alzheimers disease (AD). We investigate the structure of human-derived A[beta]40 fibrils obtained from patients diagnosed with sporadic or familial Dutch-type (E22Q) CAA. Using cryo-EM, two primary structures are identified containing elements that have not been observed in in vitro A[beta]40 fibril structures. One population has an ordered N-terminal fold comprised of two [beta]-strands stabilized by electrostatic interactions involving D1, E22, D23 and K28. This charged cluster is disrupted in the second population, which exhibits a disordered N-terminus and is favored in fibrils derived from the familial Dutch-type CAA patient. These results illustrate differences between human-derived CAA and AD fibrils, and how familial CAA mutations guide fibril formation.

                Sign-tracking is a conditioned response where animals interact with reward-predictive cues and can be used as a means to approximate a cue's motivational value. The nucleus accumbens core (NAc) has been highly implicated in mediating the sign-tracking response. Additionally, acetylcholine (ACh) transmission throughout the striatum broadly has been attributed to both incentive motivation and behavioral flexibility. Here, we show that sign-tracking responses are indeed flexible in the face of a contingency changes in the form of an omission schedule, and that this flexibility is mediated by NAc ACh. Using behavioral and pharmacological methods, we show that blockade of NAc nicotinic receptors (nAChRs) augmented sign-tracking persistence, while blockade of muscarinic receptors (mAChRs) enhanced response flexibility following introduction of the omission schedule. Further, we detail how mAChR or nAChR antagonism impacted the microstructure of sign-tracking responses. These results indicate that NAc ACh receptors have opposing roles in the regulation of sign-tracking response flexibility without altering the motivational value of the cue.

                Canine cognitive dysfunction (CCD) syndrome is a well-recognized naturally occurring disease in aged dogs, with a remarkably similar disease course, both in its clinical presentation and neuropathological changes, as humans with Alzheimers disease (AD). Similar to human AD patients this naturally occurring disease is found in the aging canine population however, there is little understanding of how the canine brain ages pathologically. It is well known that in neurodegenerative diseases, there is an increase in inflamed glial cells as well as an accumulation of hyperphosphorylation of tau (P-tau) and amyloid beta (Amyloid beta 1-42). These pathologies increase neurotoxic signaling and eventual neuronal loss. We assessed these brain pathologies in aged canines and found an increase in the number of glial cells, both astrocytes and microglia, and the activation of astrocytes indicative of neuroinflammation. A rise in the aggregated protein Amyloid beta 1-42 and hyperphosphorylated tau, at Threonine 181 and 217, in the cortical brain regions of aging canines is seen. We then asked if any of these aged canines had CCD utilizing the only current diagnostic, owner questionnaires, verifying positive or severe CCD had pathologies of gliosis and accumulation of Amyloid beta1-42 like their aged matched controls. However uniquely the CCD dogs had P-tau at T217. Therefore, this phosphorylation site of tau at threonine 217 may be a predictor for CCD

                Cognitive impairments and psychiatric symptoms affect up to half of temporal lobe epilepsy patients and are often more detrimental to their quality of life than the seizures themselves. Evidence indicates that the neurobiology of epileptogenesis shares common pathophysiological mechanisms with psychiatric comorbidities. However, these mechanisms and how they relate to specific behavioral alterations are unclear. We hypothesized that a dysfunctional communication between the hippocampus (HPC) and the prefrontal cortex (PFC), as a consequence of epileptogenesis, would be linked to behavioral and cognitive symptoms observed in the comorbidities of temporal lobe epilepsy. Here, we performed a multilevel study to investigate behavioral, electrophysiological, histopathological, and neurochemical long-term consequences of early-life Status Epilepticus in male rats. We found that adult animals submitted to early-life seizure (ELS) presented behavioral alterations typically found in animal models of psychosis, such as hyperlocomotion, reduction in sensorimotor gating, working memory deficits, and sensitivity to psychostimulants. Noteworthy, ELS rats did not exhibit neuronal loss. Instead, sensorimotor alterations were associated with increased neuroinflammation, as verified by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression, and altered dopamine neurotransmission. Surprisingly, cognitive deficits were linked to an aberrant increase in HPC-PFC long-term potentiation (LTP). Furthermore, ELS rats displayed an abnormal brain state during active behavior characterized by oscillatory dynamics oddly similar to REM sleep. Our results point to impaired hippocampal-prefrontal network dynamics as a possible pathophysiological mechanism by which an epileptogenic insult can cause behavioral changes without neuronal loss. These convergent patterns of dysfunctional activity between epileptogenesis and psychosis bear translational implications for understanding psychiatric and cognitive comorbidities in epilepsy.

                The USP19 deubiquitinase is found in a locus associated with Parkinson's Disease (PD), interacts with heat shock proteins and promotes secretion of a-synuclein (a-syn) through the misfolding associated protein secretion (MAPS) pathway. Since these processes might modulate the processing of a-syn aggregates during the progression of PD, we tested the effect of USP19 knockout (KO) in mice expressing the A53T mutation of a-syn and in whom a-syn preformed fibrils (PFF) had been injected in the striatum. Compared to WT, KO brains showed decreased accumulation of phospho-synuclein (pSyn) positive aggregates. The improved pathology was associated with less activation of microglia, higher levels of synaptic marker proteins and improved performance in a tail suspension test. Exposure of primary neurons from WT and KO mice to PFF in vitro also led to decreased accumulation of pSyn aggregates. KO did not affect uptake of PFF in the cultured neurons. It also did not affect the propagation of aggregates as assessed by exposing WT or KO neurons to PFF and measuring pSyn positive aggregates in non-exposed adjacent neurons separated using a microfluidics device. We conclude that USP19 instead modulates intracellular dynamics of aggregates. Indeed, at the early time following PFF injection when the number of pSyn positive neurons were similar in WT and KO brains, the KO neurons contained less aggregates. KO brain aggregates stained more intensely with anti-ubiquitin antibodies. Immunoprecipitation of soluble proteins from primary neurons exposed to PFF with antibodies to ubiquitin or pSyn showed higher levels of ubiquitinated a-syn oligomeric species in the KO neurons. We propose that the improved pathology in USP19 KO brains may arise from decreased formation or enhanced clearance of the more ubiquitinated aggregates and/or enhanced disassembly towards more soluble oligomeric species. USP19 inhibition may represent a novel therapeutic approach that targets the intracellular dynamics of a-syn complexes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">How does perceptual discriminability relate to neuronal receptive fields?</a></h4>

              
                Perception is an outcome of neuronal computations. Our perception changes only when the underlying neuronal responses change. Because visual neurons preferentially respond to adjustments in some pixel values of an image more than others, our perception has greater sensitivity in detecting change to some pixel combinations more than others. Here, we examined how perceptual discriminability varies to arbitrary image perturbations assuming different models of neuronal responses. In particular, we investigated that under the assumption of different neuronal computations, how perceptual discriminability relates to neuronal receptive fields - the change in pixel combinations that invokes the largest increase in neuronal responses. We assumed that perceptual discriminability reflects the magnitude of change (the L2 norm) in neuronal responses, and the L2 norm assumption gained empirical support. We examined how perceptual discriminability relates to deterministic and stochastic neuronal computations. In the case of deterministic neuronal computations, perceptual discriminability is completely determined by neuronal receptive fields. For multiple layers of canonical linear-nonlinear (LN) computations in particular (which is a feed-forward neural network), neuronal receptive fields are linear transforms of the first-layer neurons' image filters. When one image is presented to the neural network, the first layer neurons' filters and the linear transform completely determine neuronal receptive fields across all layers, and perceptual discriminability to arbitrary distortions to the image. We expanded our analysis to examine stochastic neuronal computations, in which case perceptual discriminability can be summarized as the magnitude of change in stochastic neuronal responses, with the L2 norm being replaced by a Fisher-information computation. Using a practical lower bound on Fisher information, we showed that for stochastic neuronal computations, perceptual discriminability is completely determined by neuronal receptive fields, together with how responses co-variate across neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Category-induced global effects of feature-based attention in human visual system</a></h4>

              
                Global effects of FBA are generally limited to stimuli sharing the same or similar features, as hypothesized in the "feature-similarity gain model". Visual perception, however, often reflects categories acquired via experience; whether the global-FBA effect can be induced by the categorized features remains unclear. Here human subjects were trained to classify motion-directions into two discrete categories and performed a classical motion-based attention task. We found a category-induced global-FBA effect in both the MT+ and frontoparietal areas, where attention to a motion-direction globally spread to unattended motion-directions within the same category, but not to those in a different category. Effective connectivity analysis showed that the category-induced global-FBA effect in MT+ was derived by feedback from the IFJ. Altogether, our results reveal for the first time a category-induced global-FBA effect and identify a source for this effect in human prefrontal cortex, implying that FBA is of greater ecological significance than previously thought.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Combining Aperiodic 1/f Slopes and Brain Simulation: An EEG/MEG Proxy Marker of Excitation/Inhibition Imbalance in Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Accumulation and interaction of amyloid-beta (A{beta}) and tau proteins during progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are shown to tilt neuronal circuits away from balanced excitation/inhibition (E/I). Current available techniques for noninvasive interrogation of E/I in the intact human brain, e.g., magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), are highly restrictive (i.e., limited spatial extent), have low temporal and spatial resolution and suffer from the limited ability to distinguish accurately between different neurotransmitters complicating its interpretation. As such, these methods alone offer an incomplete explanation of E/I. Recently, the aperiodic component of neural power spectrum, often referred to in the literature as the '1/f slope', has been described as a promising and scalable biomarker that can track disruptions in E/I potentially underlying a spectrum of clinical conditions, such as autism, schizophrenia, or epilepsy, as well as developmental E/I changes as seen in aging. Using 1/f slopes from resting-state spectral data and computational modelling we developed a new method for inferring E/I alterations in AD. We tested our method on recent freely and publicly available electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) datasets of patients with AD or prodromal disease and demonstrated the method's potential for uncovering regional patterns of abnormal excitatory and inhibitory parameters. Our results provide a general framework for investigating circuit-level disorders in AD and developing therapeutic interventions that aim to restore the balance between excitation and inhibition.

                Background: The reproducible beneficial effect of constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) in hemiparetic stroke patients makes it a good model to study brain plasticity during rehabilitation procedures. Objective: Assess the functional brain reorganization induced by each of the two components of CIMT: (i) non-affected upper-limb constraint and (ii) intensive training of the paretic arm. Methods: Brain activity of a right hemiparetic chronic stroke patient and of 10 healthy controls was recorded with a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a finger opposition task. For the patient, a total of 8 assessments were performed, before and after each component of CIMT. At each time point, brain activity during movement was compared with rest. Patient's results were first compared to the control group and then correlated to motor performance across sessions. Results: Constraint-therapy-related improvement was correlated with a decrease of cerebral activity in sensory-motor regions of both the affected and the non-affected hemispheres. Intensive-therapy-related improvement was correlated with the recruitment of pre-motor cortices and cerebellum in both hemispheres. Conclusions: Two different patterns of brain activity underlie the effects of intensive training and constraint which could account for the respective effect of each component of the therapy.

                Hypocretins/Orexins (Hcrt/Ox) are hypothalamic neuropeptides implicated in diverse functions, including body temperature regulation through modulation of sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone. In the current study, we measured subcutaneous (Tsc) and core (Tb) body temperature as well as activity in a conditional transgenic mouse strain that allows the inducible ablation of Hcrt/Ox-containing neurons by removal of doxycycline (DOX) from their diet (orexin-DTA mice). Measurements were made during a baseline, when mice were being maintained on food containing DOX, and over 42 days while the mice were fed normal chow which resulted in Hcrt/Ox neuron degeneration. The home cages of the orexin-DTA mice were equipped with running wheels that were either locked or unlocked. In the presence of a locked running wheel, Tsc progressively decreased on days 28 and 42 in the DOX(-) condition, primarily during the dark phase (the major active period for rodents). This nocturnal reduction in Tsc was mitigated when mice had access to unlocked running wheels. In contrast to Tsc, Tb was largely maintained until day 42 in the DOX(-) condition even when the running wheel was locked. Acute changes in both Tsc and Tb were observed preceding, during, and following cataplexy. Our results suggest that ablation of Hcrt/Ox-containing neurons results in elevated heat loss, likely through reduced sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone, and that exercise may have some therapeutic benefit to patients with narcolepsy, a disorder caused by Hcrt/Ox deficiency. Acute changes in body temperature may facilitate prediction of cataplexy onset and lead to interventions to mitigate its occurrence.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Prenatal methadone exposure selectively alters protein expression in primary motor cortex: implications for synaptic function</a></h4>

              
                As problematic opioid use has reached epidemic levels over the past two decades, the annual prevalence of opioid use disorder (OUD) in pregnant women has also increased 333%. Yet, how opioids affect the developing brain of offspring from mothers experiencing OUD remains understudied and not fully understood. Animal models of prenatal opioid exposure have discovered many deficits in the offspring of prenatal opioid exposed mothers, such as delays in the development of sensorimotor function and long-term locomotive hyperactivity. In attempt to further understand these deficits and link them with protein changes driven by prenatal opioid exposure, we used a mouse model of prenatal methadone exposure (PME) and preformed an unbiased multi-omic analysis across many sensoriomotor brain regions known to interact with opioid exposure. The effects of PME exposure on the primary motor cortex (M1), primary somatosensory cortex (S1), the dorsomedial striatum (DMS), and dorsolateral striatum (DLS) were assessed using quantitative proteomics and phosphoproteomics. PME drove many changes in protein and phosphopeptide abundance across all brain regions sampled. Gene and gene ontology enrichments were used to assess how protein and phosphopeptide changes in each brain region were altered. Our findings showed that M1 was uniquely affected by PME in comparison to other brain regions. PME uniquely drove changes in M1 glutamatergic synapses and synaptic function. Immunohistochemical analysis also identified anatomical differences in M1 for upregulating the density of glutamatergic and downregulating the density of GABAergic synapses due to PME. Lastly, comparisons between M1 and non-M1 multi-omics revealed conserved brain wide changes in phosphopeptides associated with synaptic activity and assembly, but only specific protein changes in synapse activity and assembly were represented in M1. Together, our studies show that lasting changes in synaptic function driven by PME are largely represented by protein and anatomical changes in M1, which may serve as a starting point for future experimental and translational interventions that aim to reverse the adverse effects of PME on offspring.

                Recent advancements in network neuroscience are pointing in the direction of considering the brain as a small-world system with segregated regions integrated to facilitate different cognitive tasks and functions. In this context, community detection is a pivotal issue in computational neuroscience. In this paper we explore community detection within brain connectomes using the power of quantum annealers, and in particular the Leap's Hybrid Solver. Our results shows that quantum annealers can achieve higher modularity index compared to classical annealer while computing communities of brain connectomes. Those promising preliminary results points out that quantum annealers might be the better choice compared to classical computing optimization process.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Connectome-based predictive modeling shows sex differences in brain-based predictors of memory performance</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) takes a more aggressive course in women than men, with higher prevalence and faster progression. Amnestic AD specifically targets the default mode network (DMN), which subserves short-term memory; past research shows relative hyperconnectivity in the posterior DMN in aging women. Higher reliance on this network during memory tasks may contribute to women's elevated AD risk. Here, we applied connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM), a robust linear machine-learning approach, to the Lifespan Human Connectome Project-Aging (HCP-A) dataset (n=579). We sought to characterize sex-based predictors of memory performance in aging, with particular attention to the DMN. Models were evaluated using cross-validation both across the whole group and for each sex separately. Whole-group models predicted short-term memory performance with accuracies ranging from rho=0.21-0.45. The best-performing models were derived from an associative memory task-based scan. Sex-specific models revealed significant differences in connectome-based predictors for men and women. DMN activity contributed more to predicted memory scores in women, while within- and between- visual network activity contributed more to predicted memory scores in men. While men showed more segregation of visual networks, women showed more segregation of the DMN. We demonstrate that women and men recruit different circuitry when performing memory tasks, with women relying more on intra-DMN activity and men relying more on visual circuitry. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that women draw more heavily upon the DMN for recollective memory, potentially contributing to women's elevated risk of AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Physiologic and nanoscale distinctions define glutamatergic synapses in tonic vs phasic neurons</a></h4>

              
                Neurons exhibit a striking degree of functional diversity, each one tuned to the needs of the circuitry in which it is embedded. A fundamental functional dichotomy occurs in activity patterns, with some neurons firing at a relatively constant tonic rate, while others fire in bursts - a phasic pattern. Synapses formed by tonic vs phasic neurons are also functionally differentiated, yet the bases of their distinctive properties remain enigmatic. A major challenge towards illuminating the synaptic differences between tonic and phasic neurons is the difficulty in isolating their physiological properties. At the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ), most muscle fibers are co-innervated by two motor neurons, the tonic MN-Ib and phasic MN-Is. Here, we employed selective expression of a newly developed botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT-C) transgene to silence tonic or phasic motor neurons. This approach revealed major differences in their neurotransmitter release properties, including probability, short-term plasticity, and vesicle pools. Furthermore, calcium imaging demonstrated ~two-fold greater calcium influx at phasic neuron release sites relative to tonic, along with enhanced synaptic vesicle coupling. Finally, confocal and super resolution imaging revealed that phasic neuron release sites are organized in a more compact arrangement, with enhanced stoichiometry of voltage-gated calcium channels relative to other active zone scaffolds. These data suggest that distinctions in active zone nano-architecture and calcium influx collaborate to differentially tune glutamate release at synapses of tonic vs phasic neuronal subtypes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural circuit mechanisms for transforming learned olfactory valences into wind-oriented movement</a></h4>

              
                How memories are used by the brain to guide future action is poorly understood. In olfactory associative learning in Drosophila, multiple compartments of the mushroom body act in parallel to assign valence to a stimulus. Here, we show that appetitive memories stored in different compartments induce different levels of upwind locomotion. Using a photoactivation screen of a new collection of split-GAL4 drivers and EM connectomics, we identified a cluster of neurons postsynaptic to the mushroom body output neurons (MBONs) that can trigger robust upwind steering. These UpWind Neurons (UpWiNs) integrate inhibitory and excitatory synaptic inputs from MBONs of appetitive and aversive memory compartments, respectively. After training, disinhibition from the appetitive-memory MBONs enhances the response of UpWiNs to reward-predicting odors. Blocking UpWiNs impaired appetitive memory and reduced upwind locomotion during retrieval. Photoactivation of UpWiNs also increased the chance of returning to a location where activation was initiated, suggesting an additional role in olfactory navigation. Thus, our results provide insight into how learned abstract valences are gradually transformed into concrete memory-driven actions through divergent and convergent networks, a neuronal architecture that is commonly found in the vertebrate and invertebrate brains.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Plasma concentrations of anti-inflammatory cytokine TGF-β are associated with hippocampal structure related to explicit memory performance in older adults</a></h4>

              
                Human cognitive abilities, and particularly hippocampus-dependent memory performance typically decline with increasing age. Immunosenescence, the age-related disintegration of the immune system are increasingly coming into the focus of research as a considerable factor contributing to cognitive decline. In the present study, we investigated potential associations between plasma levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and learning and memory performance as well as hippocampal anatomy in young and older adults. Plasma concentrations of the inflammation marker CRP as well as the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF- and the anti-inflammatory cytokine TGF-{beta}1 were measured in 142 healthy adults (57 young, 24.47 +/- 4.48 years; 85 older, 63.66 +/- 7.32 years) who performed tests of explicit memory (Verbal Learning and Memory Test, VLMT; Wechsler Memory Scale, Logical Memory, WMS) with an additional delayed recall test after 24 hours. Hippocampal volumetry and hippocampal subfield segmentation were performed using FreeSurfer, based on T1-weighted and high-resolution T2-weighted MR images. When investigating the relationship between memory performance, hippocampal structure, and plasma cytokine levels, we found that TGF-{beta}1 concentrations were positively correlated with the volumes of the hippocampal CA4-dentate gyrus region in older adults. These volumes were in turn positively associated with better performance in the WMS, particularly in the delayed memory test. Our results support the notion that endogenous anti-inflammatory mechanisms may act as protective factor in neurocognitive aging.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">7-Tesla evidence for columnar and rostral--caudal organization of the human periaqueductal grey response in the absence of threat: a working memory study</a></h4>

              
                The periaqueductal grey (PAG) is a small midbrain structure that surrounds the cerebral aqueduct, regulates brain-body communication, and is often studied for its role in "fight-or-flight" defense responses. We used ultra-high field 7-Tesla fMRI to resolve the PAG in humans and distinguish it from the cerebral aqueduct, examining its in vivo function in humans during a working memory task (N = 87)--i.e., a setting that required physiological mobilization, but no "threat". During both low and moderate task-elicited cognitive demand, we observed BOLD signal intensity increases in bilateral ventrolateral PAG (vlPAG), consistent with the columnar organization of PAG function identified in non-human animal research. Changes in physiological activity during the task (phasic skin conductance response (SCR) amplitudes, cardiac interbeat interval, respiratory rate) were correlated with PAG BOLD estimates across subjects, and showed some evidence of spatial organization within the PAG, but no spatial organization overlapping with the task-elicited increase in bilateral vlPAG. These findings suggest that the PAG coordinates and regulates bodily activity, even in the absence of threat.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Differential ripple propagation along the hippocampal longitudinal axis</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal ripples are highly synchronous neural events critical for memory consolidation and retrieval. A minority of strong ripples has been shown to be of particular importance in situations of increased memory demands. The propagation dynamics of strong ripples inside the hippocampal formation are, however, still opaque. We analyzed ripple propagation within the hippocampal formation in a large open access dataset comprising 267 Neuropixel recordings in 49 awake, head-fixed mice. Surprisingly, strong ripples (top 10% in ripple strength) propagate differentially depending on their generation point along the hippocampal longitudinal axis. The septal hippocampal pole is able to generate longer ripples that engage more neurons and elicit spiking activity for an extended time even at considerable distances. Accordingly, a substantial portion of the variance in strong ripple duration (R2 = 0.463) is explained by the ripple generation location on the longitudinal axis. Our results are consistent with a possible distinctive role of the hippocampal septal pole in conditions of high memory demand.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Test-Retest Reliability of the Human Connectome: An OPM-MEG study</a></h4>

              
                Magnetoencephalography with optically pumped magnetometers (OPM-MEG) offers a new way to record electrophysiological brain function, with significant advantages over conventional MEG including adaptability to head shape/size, free movement during scanning, better spatial resolution, increased signal, and no reliance on cryogenics. However, OPM-MEG remains in its infancy, with significant questions to be answered regarding optimal system design and robustness. Here, we present an open-source dataset acquired using a newly constructed OPM-MEG system with a triaxial sensor design averaging 168 channels. Using OPM-optimised magnetic shielding and active background-field control, we measure the test-retest reliability of the human connectome. We employ amplitude envelope correlation to measure whole-brain functional connectivity in 10 individuals whilst they watch a 600 s move clip. Our results show high repeatability between experimental runs at the group level, with a correlation coefficient of 0.81 in the theta, 0.93 in alpha and 0.94 in beta frequency ranges. At the individual subject level, we found marked differences between individuals, but high within-subject robustness (correlations of 0.56 {+/-} 0.25, 0.72 {+/-} 0.15 and 0.78 {+/-} 0.13 in theta, alpha and beta respectively). These results compare well to previously reported findings using conventional MEG; they show that OPM-MEG is a viable way to characterise whole brain connectivity and add significant weight to a growing argument that OPMs can overtake cryogenic sensors as the fundamental building block of MEG systems.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Promoting Axon Regeneration By Inhibiting RNA N6-methyladenosine Demethylase ALKBH5</a></h4>

              
                A key limiting factor of successful axon regeneration is the intrinsic regenerative ability in both the peripheral (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS). Previous studies have identified axon regeneration regulators that act on gene expression in injured neurons. However, it is less known if RNA modifications play a role in this process. Here, we systematically screened the functions of all common m6A modification-related enzymes in axon regeneration and report ALKBH5, an evolutionarily conserved RNA m6A demethylase, as a regulator of axonal regeneration. In PNS, knockdown of ALKBH5 enhanced sensory axonal regeneration, whereas overexpressing ALKBH5 impaired axonal regeneration in an m6A-dependent manner. Mechanistically, ALKBH5 increased the stability of Lpin2 mRNA and thus limited regenerative growth associated lipid metabolism in DRG neurons. Moreover, in CNS, knockdown of ALKBH5 enhanced the survival and axonal regeneration of retinal ganglion cells after optic nerve injury. Together, our results suggest a novel mechanism regulating axon regeneration and point ALKBH5 as a potential target for promoting axon regeneration in both PNS and CNS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Large-scale unsupervised discovery of excitatory morphological cell types in mouse visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Neurons in the neocortex exhibit astonishing morphological diversity which is critical for properly wiring neural circuits and giving neurons their functional properties. The extent to which the morphological diversity of excitatory neurons forms a continuum or is built from distinct clusters of cell types remains an open question. Here we took a data-driven approach using graph-based machine learning methods to obtain a low-dimensional morphological "bar code" describing more than 30,000 excitatory neurons in mouse visual areas V1, AL and RL that were reconstructed from a millimeter scale serial-section electron microscopy volume. We found a set of principles that captured the morphological diversity of the dendrites of excitatory neurons. First, their morphologies varied with respect to three major axes: soma depth, total apical and basal skeletal length. Second, neurons in layer 2/3 showed a strong trend of a decreasing width of their dendritic arbor and a smaller tuft with increasing cortical depth. Third, in layer 4, atufted neurons were primarily located in the primary visual cortex, while tufted neurons were more abundant in higher visual areas. Fourth, we discovered layer 4 neurons in V1 on the border to layer 5 which showed a tendency towards avoiding deeper layers with their dendrites. In summary, excitatory neurons exhibited a substantial degree of dendritic morphological variation, both within and across cortical layers, but this variation mostly formed a continuum, with only a few notable exceptions in deeper layers.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reactivation of early-life stress-sensitive neuronal ensembles contributes to lifelong stress hypersensitivity</a></h4>

              
                Early-life stress (ELS) is one of the strongest lifetime risk factors for depression, anxiety, suicide, and other psychiatric disorders, particularly after facing additional stressful events later in life. Human and animal studies demonstrate that ELS sensitizes individuals to subsequent stress. However, the neurobiological basis of such stress sensitization remains largely unexplored. We hypothesized that ELS-induced stress sensitization would be detectable at the level of neuronal ensembles, such that cells activated by ELS would be more reactive to adult stress. To test this, we leveraged transgenic mice to genetically tag, track, and manipulate experience-activated neurons. We found that in both male and female mice, ELS-activated neurons within the nucleus accumbens (NAc), and to a lesser-extent the medial prefrontal cortex, were preferentially reactivated by adult stress. To test whether reactivation of ELS-activated ensembles in the NAc contributes to stress hypersensitivity, we expressed hM4Dis receptor in control or ELS-activated neurons of pups and chemogenetically inhibited their activity during experience of adult stress. Inhibition of ELS-activated NAc neurons, but not control-tagged neurons, ameliorated social avoidance behavior following chronic social defeat stress in males. These data provide evidence that ELS-induced stress hypersensitivity is encoded at the level of corticolimbic neuronal ensembles.

	<p>Prior evidence suggests domain-specific working memory (WM) buffers for maintaining phonological (i.e., speech sound) and semantic (i.e., meaning) information. The phonological WM buffer&amp;amp;rsquo;s proposed location is in the left supramarginal gyrus (SMG), whereas semantic WM has been related to the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), the middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and the angular gyrus (AG). However, less is known about the white matter correlates of phonological and semantic WM. We tested 45 individuals with left hemisphere brain damage on single word processing, phonological WM, and semantic WM tasks and obtained T1 and diffusion weighted neuroimaging. Virtual dissections were performed for each participants&amp;amp;rsquo; arcuate fasciculus (AF), inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), middle longitudinal fasciculus (MLF), and uncinate fasciculus (UF), which connect the proposed domain-specific WM buffers with perceptual or processing regions. The results showed that the left ILF, MLF, IFOF, and the direct segment of the AF were related to semantic WM performance. Phonological WM was related to both the left ILF and the MLF. This work informs our understanding of the white matter correlates of WM, especially semantic WM, which has not previously been investigated. In addition, this work helps to adjudicate between theories of verbal WM, providing some evidence for separate pathways supporting phonological and semantic WM.</p>

	<p>Early detection of autism provides access to early intervention and subsequently fewer lifelong challenges. However, disparities in screening have been associated with socioeconomic status (SES) and race, and disparities in surveillance have been associated with clinician knowledge and beliefs about autism identification. The present study examines associations between demographic variables and clinician beliefs, and agreement between screening results and clinician surveillance. Surveillance included activities used by the primary care clinicians (PCCs) to assess risk for autism. PCCs reported their beliefs about autism screening and identification, their sex, race, years in practice, and racial distribution of their patient population. Children&amp;amp;rsquo;s demographic information was also collected. PCCs identified children as having, or not having, an increased likelihood of autism, and parents of children completed an autism screener. Agreement between screening and surveillance results were examined across PCC, practice, and child demographics. Higher confidence in autism knowledge and screening resources, female PCC sex, and majority White practice patient demographics all predicted agreement between screening and surveillance. Female child sex and higher maternal education also predicted agreement between screening and surveillance. These findings highlight the importance of PCC screening beliefs and child and PCC demographics on the autism identification process.</p>

	<p>It is hypothesized that factors associated with bipolar disorder could, uer defined conditions, produce adaptive behaviors. The aim is to verify whether a genetic feature associated with bipolar disorder can be found in people without bipolar disorder but with hyperactivity/exploration traits. Healthy old adults (N = 40) recruited for a previous study on exercise were subdivided using a previously validated tool into those with and without hyperactivity/exploration traits and compared with a group of old patients with bipolar disorder (N = 21). The genetic variant RS1006737 of CACNA1C was analyzed using blood samples, DNA extraction, real-time PCR, FRET probes, and SANGER method sequencing. People with hyperactivity/exploration traits and without bipolar disorder were like people with bipolar disorder regarding the frequency of the genetic variant (OR = 0.79, CI95%: 0.21&amp;amp;ndash;2.95), but were different from people without either hyperactivity/exploration traits and bipolar disorder (OR = 4.75, CI95%: 1.19&amp;amp;ndash;18.91). The combined group of people with hyperactivity/exploration traits without bipolar disorder plus people with bipolar disorder had a higher frequency of the variant than people without either hyperactivity/exploration traits or bipolar disorder (OR = 4.25, CI95%: 1.24&amp;amp;ndash;14.4). To consider the genetic profile of bipolar disorder not an aberrant condition opens the way to a new approach in which the adaptive potential would be a central point in psychosocial treatment in addition to drug therapy. Future research can confirm the results of our study.</p>

	<p>A nine-year-old boy manifested with headache, progressive mild cognitive decline and hemiparesis, but without clinical epileptic seizures (with abnormal EEG waves). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed bilateral cortical lesions mainly on the right hemisphere, and new lesions developed in frontal, parietal, occipital and temporal lobes around the old lesions presenting as a lace-like or ring-like enhancement in T1 with contrast over a disease course of five years. A suspected diagnosis of primary angiitis of the central nervous system was initially considered. Treated with high-dose corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulins and monthly pulse cyclophosphamide, his symptoms worsened with the intracranial lesion progression. Brain biopsy of the right frontal lobe was performed nearly five years after onset; prominent neuronal loss, a microglial nodule, as well as parenchymal and perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate within the cortex were found, which coincided with RE pathology changes. Encouragingly, after a regimen of rituximab, lesions on the follow-up brain MRI tended to be stable. Apparently, it was immune-mediated, but did not strictly fit any known disease entity, although it was similar to RE. We summarize this unique case, including clinical characteristics, imaging and pathology findings. We also discuss the diagnosis and treatment, focusing on comparison to RE as well as other possible neurological diseases.</p>

	<p>Background: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is known to have a high degree of heritability. Diagnosis of ASD is difficult because of the high heterogeneity of the clinical symptoms. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can potentially be diagnostic biomarkers for ASD, and several studies have shown the relationship between miRNAs and ASD pathogenesis. In this study, we investigated ten miRNA and mRNA expression of target genes in peripheral blood to explore a diagnostic biomarker for ASD. Methods: We recruited control and ASD subjects for the discovery cohort (n = 6, each) and replication cohort (n = 20, each). Using qPCR, miRNA and mRNA expression was measured using the SYBR green and probe methods, respectively. In-silico prediction was used for identifying target genes of miRNAs. An in vitro experiment using HEK293 cells was conducted to investigate whether miR-15b-5p modulates the predicted target genes (TGFBR3 and MYBL1). Results: miR-15b-5p expression indicated an increased trend in the discovery cohort (P = 0.052) and a significant upregulation in the replication cohort (p = 0.021). In-silico analysis revealed that miR-15b-5p is relevant to cell development and Wnt signaling. The decreased trends of TGFBR3 and MYBL expression were the same as in previous RNA-seq data. MiR-15b-5p positively regulated TGFBR3 expression in in vitro experiments. Conclusions: Upregulated miR-15b-5p expression may represent a useful diagnostic marker of ASD subjects, and it may regulate TGFBR3 mRNA expression. These findings indicate a new perspective in the understanding of the pathogenesis of ASD.</p>

	<p>Neurological involvement is relatively common in Erdheim&amp;amp;ndash;Chester disease (ECD), a rare clonal disorder of histiocytic myeloid precursors characterized by multisystem involvement. In ECD patients, neurological symptoms can occur either at onset or during the disease course and may lead to various degrees of neurological disability or affect patients&amp;amp;rsquo; life expectancy. The clinical neurological presentation of ECD often consists of cerebellar symptoms, showing either a subacute or progressive course. In this latter case, patients manifest with a slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia, variably associated with other non-specific neurological signs, infratentorial leukoencephalopathy, and cerebellar atrophy, possibly mimicking either adult-onset degenerative or immune-mediated ataxia. In such cases, diagnosis of ECD may be particularly challenging, yet some peculiar features are helpful to address it. Here, we retrospectively describe four novel ECD patients, all manifesting cerebellar symptoms at onset. In two cases, slow disease progression and associated brain MRI features simulated a degenerative cerebellar ataxia. Three patients received a definite diagnosis of histiocytosis, whereas one case lacked histology confirmation, although clinical diagnostic features were strongly suggestive. Our findings regarding existing literature data focused on neurological ECD will be also discussed to highlight those diagnostic clues helpful to address diagnosis.</p>

	<p>Background: Postoperative delirium (POD) is associated with perioperative complications and mortality. Data on the risk factors for delirium after subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) surgery is not clarified in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) patients receiving total intravenous anesthesia. We aimed to investigate the risk factors for delirium after STN-DBS surgery in PD patients. Methods:The retrospective cohort study was conducted, including 131 PD patients who underwent STN-DBS for the first time under total intravenous anesthesia from January to December 2021. Delirium assessments were performed twice daily for 7 days after surgery or until hospital discharge using the confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine the risk factor of POD. Results: In total, 22 (16.8%) of 131 patients were in the POD group, while the other 109 patients were in the Non-POD group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that preoperative Mini-mental State Examination score [odds ratio = 0.855, 95% confidence interval = 0.768&amp;amp;ndash;0.951, p = 0.004] and unified Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease rating scale part 3 (on state) score (odds ratio = 1.061, 95% confidence interval = 1.02&amp;amp;ndash;1.104, p = 0.003) were independently associated with delirium after surgery. Conclusions: In this retrospective cohort study of PD patients, a lower Mini-mental State Examination score and a higher unified Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease rating scale part 3 (on state) score were the independent risk factors for delirium after STN-DBS surgery in PD patients under total intravenous anesthesia.</p>

	<p>Objective: To determine the predictors and the long-term outcomes of patients with seizures following surgery for dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (DNTs); Methods: Clinical data were collected from medical records of consecutive patients of the Department of Neurosurgery of Sanbo Brain Hospital of Capital Medical University with a pathological diagnosis of DNT and who underwent surgery from January 2008 to July 2021. All patients were followed up after surgery for at least one year. We estimated the cumulative rate of seizure recurrence-free and generated survival curves. A log-rank (Mantel&amp;amp;ndash;Cox) test and a Cox proportional hazard model were performed for univariate and multivariate analysis to analyze influential predictors; Results: 63 patients (33 males and 30 females) were included in this study. At the final follow-up, 49 patients (77.8%) were seizure-free. The cumulative rate of seizure recurrence-free was 82.5% (95% confidence interval (CI) 71.8&amp;amp;ndash;91.3%), 79.0% (95% CI 67.8&amp;amp;ndash;88.6%) and 76.5% (95% CI 64.8&amp;amp;ndash;87.0%) at 2, 5, and 10 years, respectively. The mean time for seizure recurrence-free was 6.892 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.501 years (95% CI 5.91&amp;amp;ndash;7.87). Gross total removal of the tumor and a short epilepsy duration were significant predictors of seizure freedom. Younger age of seizure onset, bilateral interictal epileptiform discharges, and MRI type 3 tumors were risk factors for poor prognosis; Conclusions: A favorable long-term seizure outcome was observed for patients with DNT after surgical resection. Predictor analysis could effectively guide the clinical work and evaluate the prognosis of patients with DNT associated with epilepsy.</p>

	<p>Background: Common long-term sequelae after COVID-19 include fatigue and cognitive impairment. Although symptoms interfere with daily living, the underlying pathology is largely unknown. Previous studies report relative hypometabolism in frontal, limbic and cerebellar regions suggesting focal brain involvement. We aimed to determine whether absolute hypometabolism was present and correlated to same day standardized neurocognitive testing. Methods: Fourteen patients included from a long COVID clinic had cognitive testing and quantitative dynamic [18F]FDG PET of the brain on the same day to correlate cognitive function to metabolic glucose rate. Results: We found no hypometabolism in frontal, limbic and cerebellar regions in cognitively impaired relative to cognitive intact patients. In contrast, the cognitive impaired patients showed higher cerebellar metabolism (p = 0.03), which correlated with more severe deficits in working memory and executive function (p = 0.03). Conclusions: Hypermetabolism in the cerebellum may reflect inefficient brain processing and play a role in cognitive impairments after COVID-19.</p>

	<p>Working memory (WM) plays a crucial role in the development of arithmetic ability. However, research findings related to which factors influence the relationship between WM and arithmetic skills are inconsistent. The present meta-analysis aimed to examine the links between WM and arithmetic in primary school children and investigate whether this is dependent on WM domains (i.e., verbal, visual, spatial), child age, arithmetic operation type, and arithmetic task type. A total of 11,224 participants with an age range of 6- to 12 years, from 55 independent samples were included in the meta-analysis. Analysis of 46 studies with 187 effect sizes revealed an overall significant and medium correlation between WM and arithmetic. Heterogeneity analyses indicated that verbal WM showed a stronger correlation with arithmetic than visuospatial WM, and that correlations between verbal WM and arithmetic declined with age, whereas correlations between spatial-sequential, and spatial-simultaneous WM and arithmetic remained stable throughout development. Addition and subtraction were more involved in verbal WM than multiplication and division. Moreover, mental and written arithmetic showed comparable correlations with WM in all domains. These findings suggest moderation effects of WM domains, age, and operation types in the WM-arithmetic relationship and highlight the significant role of verbal WM in arithmetic ability in primary school children.</p>

	<p>Features extracted from the wavelet transform coefficient matrix are widely used in the design of machine learning models to classify event-related potential (ERP) and electroencephalography (EEG) signals in a wide range of brain activity research and clinical studies. This novel study is aimed at dramatically improving the performance of such wavelet-based classifiers by exploiting information offered by the cone of influence (COI) of the continuous wavelet transform (CWT). The COI is a boundary that is superimposed on the wavelet scalogram to delineate the coefficients that are accurate from those that are inaccurate due to edge effects. The features derived from the inaccurate coefficients are, therefore, unreliable. In this study, it is hypothesized that the classifier performance would improve if unreliable features, which are outside the COI, are zeroed out, and the performance would improve even further if those features are cropped out completely. The entire, zeroed out, and cropped scalograms are referred to as the &amp;amp;ldquo;same&amp;amp;rdquo; (S)-scalogram, &amp;amp;ldquo;zeroed out&amp;amp;rdquo; (Z)-scalogram, and the &amp;amp;ldquo;valid&amp;amp;rdquo; (V)-scalogram, respectively. The strategy to validate the hypotheses is to formulate three classification approaches in which the feature vectors are extracted from the (a) S-scalogram in the standard manner, (b) Z-scalogram, and (c) V-scalogram. A subsampling strategy is developed to generate small-sample ERP ensembles to enable customized classifier design for single subjects, and a strategy is developed to select a subset of channels from multiple ERP channels. The three scalogram approaches are implemented using support vector machines, random forests, k-nearest neighbor, multilayer perceptron neural networks, and deep learning convolution neural networks. In order to validate the performance hypotheses, experiments are designed to classify the multi-channel ERPs of five subjects engaged in distinguishing between synonymous and non-synonymous word pairs. The results confirm that the classifiers using the Z-scalogram features outperform those using the S-scalogram features, and the classifiers using the V-scalogram features outperform those using the Z-scalogram features. Most importantly, the relative improvement of the V-scalogram classifiers over the standard S-scalogram classifiers is dramatic. Additionally, enabling the design of customized classifiers for individual subjects is an important contribution to ERP/EEG-based studies and diagnoses of patient-specific disorders.</p>

	<p>Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate the long-term effect of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) using clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin monotherapy after intravenous thrombolysis on functional outcomes in patients with minor stroke. Methods: Patients with acute ischemic stroke with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score &amp;amp;le; 5 who received either DAPT or aspirin monotherapy following recombinant tissue plasminogen activator intravenous thrombolysis were studied. Data recorded between January 2017 and December 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. The primary efficacy outcome was functional improvement at 1 year, measured by a 1-point decrease across modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores. Secondary outcomes included complete rehabilitation (mRS = 0), an excellent outcome (mRS = 0&amp;amp;ndash;1), and a favorable outcome (mRS = 0&amp;amp;ndash;2) at 1 year, as well as the rates of stroke recurrence and all-cause mortality within 1 year. Results: A total of 238 patients were included, and follow-up data were available for 205 patients (86.1%). The distribution of 1-year outcomes on the mRS favored DAPT over aspirin monotherapy (adjusted common odds ratio (OR), 2.19; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.12&amp;amp;ndash;4.28; p = 0.022). Patients who received DAPT, compared with those receiving aspirin alone, were more likely to achieve complete rehabilitation (adjusted OR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.21&amp;amp;ndash;4.95; p = 0.013) at the 1-year follow-up. Additionally, the percentages of an excellent outcome and a favorable outcome did not differ, and the rates of stroke recurrence and all-cause mortality were comparable during the 1-year follow-up. Conclusions: Clopidogrel with aspirin following intravenous thrombolysis was associated with improved functional outcome at the 1-year follow-up for patients with minor stroke, and it did not increase the stroke recurrence rate and mortality.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">How Characters Are Learned Leaves Its Mark on the Neural Substrates of Chinese Reading</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Understanding how the brain functions differently as one learns to read may shed light on the controversial nature of the reading ability of human being. Logographic writing system such as Chinese has been found to rely on specialized neural substrates beyond the reading network of alphabetic languages. The ability to read in Chinese has also been proposed to rely on writing skills. However, it was unclear whether the learning-related alteration of neural responses was language specific or resulted from the more reliance on writing practice during acquisition. This study investigated whether the emergence of typical logographic-specific regions relied on learning by writing. We taught proficient alphabetic language readers Chinese characters and used pre-test and post-test to identify changes in two critical stages of reading, namely, orthographic processing and orthographic-to-phonological mapping. Two typical left hemispheric areas for logographic reading showed increased responses to characters in the brains of proficient alphabetic readers after learning, regardless of whether the learning strategy involved writing practice. Moreover, learning strategy modulated the response magnitude or multivoxel patterns in the left superior parietal lobule, left middle frontal gyrus, and right fusiform gyrus, some of which were task dependent. The findings corroborated a limited role of writing in the emergence of logographic-specific reading network and suggested the heterogeneous nature of different brain regions in this network.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Head Orientation Influences Saccade Directions during Free Viewing</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>When looking around a visual scene, humans make saccadic eye movements to fixate objects of interest. While the extraocular muscles can execute saccades in any direction, not all saccade directions are equally likely: saccades in horizontal and vertical directions are most prevalent. Here, we asked whether head orientation plays a role in determining saccade direction biases. Study participants (<I>n</I> = 14) viewed natural scenes and abstract fractals (radially symmetric patterns) through a virtual reality headset equipped with eye tracking. Participants&rsquo; heads were stabilized and tilted at &ndash;30&deg;, 0&deg;, or 30&deg; while viewing the images, which could also be tilted by &ndash;30&deg;, 0&deg;, and 30&deg; relative to the head. To determine whether the biases in saccade direction changed with head tilt, we calculated polar histograms of saccade directions and cross-correlated pairs of histograms to find the angular displacement resulting in the maximum correlation. During free viewing of fractals, saccade biases largely followed the orientation of the head with an average displacement value of 24&deg; when comparing head upright to head tilt in world-referenced coordinates (<I>t</I><SUB>(13)</SUB> = 17.63, <I>p</I> &lt; 0.001). There was a systematic offset of 2.6&deg; in saccade directions, likely reflecting ocular counter roll (OCR; <I>t</I><SUB>(13)</SUB> = 3.13, <I>p</I> = 0.008). When participants viewed an Earth upright natural scene during head tilt, we found that the orientation of the head still influenced saccade directions (<I>t</I><SUB>(13)</SUB> = 3.7, <I>p</I> = 0.001). These results suggest that nonvisual information about head orientation, such as that acquired by vestibular sensors, likely plays a role in saccade generation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Bottlenecks and opportunities towards achieving the targeted 95-95-95 HIV services in a rural district in Eastern Uganda [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Uganda has made progress in reducing its HIV prevalence from 7.3% in 2011 to 6% in 2017, however, more needs to be done to meet the World Health Organization (WHO) target of 95% of the population knowing their HIV status, 95% enrolled on treatment and 95% achieving viral suppression. This study aimed to assess the bottlenecks and opportunities towards achieving the 95 95 95 targeted HIV services in the Bukedea district.  Methods: A mixed-methods cross-sectional study was conducted in the Bukedea district covering males and females aged 18-65 years who had consented to participate in the study. We used a purposive sampling procedure to select our study participants. Qualitative data was collected through focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and document reviews for quantitative data. Quantitative data were analyzed using STATA v 14 whereas qualitative data were analyzed using the thematic analysis approach.   Results: The challenges were grouped as patient-related, medication-related, and facility-related. The patient-related challenges were stigma, fear of taking the medication, poor nutrition, long distances, alcoholism, busy working schedules, and domestic violence. The medication-related challenges were side effects and pill burden. The facility-related challenges were inadequate pretest counseling and stock-outs. The use of anti-retroviral drugs (ART) was common in piggery and poultry and the sources of these drugs were reported to be the people on ART and the health workers.   The opportunities included home-based counseling, organizing more outreaches, counseling and health education, targeted testing, and strengthening the Village Health Teams (VHT) networks.  Conclusions: The study revealed that the major challenges towards achieving the targeted 95-95-95 HIV services were stigma, inadequate pre-test counseling, fear of disclosure, and poor adherence due to alcoholism, sharing of drugs with animals and partners. The use of anti-retroviral drugs in animal husbandry was common in the Bukedea District.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The effects of antiretroviral stockout on primary health care nurses in the Ethekwini and Ilembe districts, KwaZulu-Natal [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Nurses face challenges of antiretroviral therapy (ART) stock out when rolling out, leading to drug resistance, poor compliance and decreased viral suppression. Poor viral suppression leads to higher morbidity and mortality rates, hence a need to strengthen supply chain principles in order to achieve equal distribution of resources amongst clinics.  Nurses also need to have relevant guidelines available to prevent treatment failure. The study aimed to describe the effects of ART stockouts on primary health nurses rolling out ART in clinics in KwaZulu Natal. Methods: The study followed a qualitative approach, using a descriptive design. Two primary healthcare clinics in Ilembe and Ethekwini districts were selected for the study. The population comprised of 8 purposively selected participants. In-depth interviews and focus groups were conducted to describe the experiences of primary health care nurses rolling out antiretroviral therapy regarding stockout and how it was managed. Data collection and analysis followed Yates, Partridge and Bruce steps. Ethics and trustworthiness were maintained. Results: The singular theme of inconsistent availability of treatment emerged, as well as sub-themes of means used to manage treatment stockout and supply change management issues. Conclusions: An adequate supply of ART through an efficient supply chain management strategy, ongoing training in primary health care and nurse-initiated management of antiretroviral therapy and the availability of treatment guidelines should be enforced.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Barriers to compliance with evidence-based guidelines for ventilator-associated pneumonia among critical care nurses: A scoping review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Healthcare organizations provide evidence-based guidelines designed to support nurses in preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in intensive care units (ICUs), but there are barriers to compliance with such guidelines. This review explicitly explored evidence of compliance barriers among critical care nurses. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and EBSCO databases for relevant English-language studies published between January 2003 and June 2022, focused on barriers to nursing compliance with VAP prevention guidelines. Data was reported according to the Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMAScR) guidelines.  Results: 230 publications were screened, resulting in 53 full-text articles being retrieved after removing duplicates, of which 13 relevant to the aims of the review and meeting the inclusion criteria were included for data extraction. One was a qualitative study, while the remainder were quantitative. Simple descriptive content analysis identified the barriers to critical care nurses’ compliance with VAP prevention guidelines, and categorized them as: (1) work environment barriers (e.g., lack of equipment and supplies; lack of staff and time; lack of educational support; and ineffective supportive system); (2) nurse-related barriers (limited personal competencies); and (3) situation-related barriers (patient health, discomfort, and adverse events). Conclusions: This review revealed important evidence on barriers to VAP prevention guidelines compliance. Nurses are challenged mainly by work-environmental barriers along, with the presence of nurse and situational barriers. It is evident from the findings that further qualitative and mixed-methodology follow-up studies are recommended to further explore the issues in depth.  Healthcare leaders must be aware of these barriers and integrate work policies that assist in overcoming them, to increase compliance.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Anti-angiogenic effect of the combination of low-dose sorafenib and EGCG in HCC-induced Wistar rats [version 3; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background:  Sorafenib is a standard drug used for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma but is often resistant and toxic. Its combination with epigallo-3-catechin gallate leads to reduced resistance and toxicity but an equally effective anti-angiogenic effect.Therefore, this study aims to assess the anti-angiogenic effect of standard-dose Sorafenib compared to the combination of low-dose Sorafenib and epigallo-3-catechin gallate. Methods:  We conducted an animal study and double-blind, randomized controlled trials. A total of 25 male Wistar rats (7 weeks old) were randomly divided into four groups, namely Sham (K), Control (O), a combination of low-dose Sorafenib and epigallo-3-catechin gallate group (X1), and standard-dose Sorafenib group (X2). All groups were injected with N-Nitrosodiethylamine 70 mg/kg body weight (BW) intraperitoneally for ten weeks, except the Sham group. After the development of hepatocellular carcinoma, X1 and X2 were treated for two weeks. Subsequently, liver tissues and tumor masses were examined for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) level and microvascular density expression. Results: There was a significant difference (p=0.007) in the level of VEGF between group X1 (low dose Sorafenib + EGCG) and X2 (Standard dose Sorafenib). However, the differences in VEGF levels of group X1 and X2 compared to group O(Control) were significantly lower, with values p=0.000136 and p=0.019, respectively. The expression of microvascular density between groups X1 and X2  was not entirely different. Meanwhile, a significant difference (p<0.05) was discovered when both groups were compared with the control group. Conclusion: The combination of low-dose Sorafenib with epigallo-3-catechin gallate is superior in reducing the level of VEGF compared to standard-dose Sorafenib and is better than the control. Standard-dose Sorafenib and the combination of low-dose Sorafenib and epigallo-3-catechin gallate have similar effectivity in reducing the expression of microvascular density and could prevent resistance and lower toxicity effects.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Predictive factors for hypothyroidy after hemithyroidectomy [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Hemithyroidectomy is one of the most common procedures performed. It is used to treat patients with benign unilateral nodules. Hemithyroidectomy results in fewer risks of hypothyroidism and the need for thyroid hormone replacement therapy. The present study was designed to identify potential clinicopathologic risk factors associated with the onset of biochemical hypothyroidism. Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of all patients who underwent hemithyroidectomy between 2004 and 2019. Hypothyroidism was defined as a serum thyrotropin level greater than 5 mIU/L. The patients were analyzed for age, sex, preoperative and postoperative thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), state, side, and volume of the remaining lobe, and histologic diagnosis. Results: Hypothyroidism was diagnosed in 30.8% of 214 patients. This complication appeared in the first year in 83.3% of the cases. A preoperative TSH level greater than 1.32 mIU/l, a remaining volume of the lobe less than 3 ml, and the presence of thyroiditis were associated with a significant increase in the risk of developing hypothyroidism (p<0.01). There were no significant differences in age, sex, state, and side of the remaining lobe. The mean thyroxine dose was 57 ± 26 micrograms. Conclusions: The risk of hypothyroidism after hemithyroidectomy should be assessed prior to surgery. Close monitoring is recommended in patients at high risk of developing this complication. However, all patients who undergo hemithyroidectomy should be monitored at least for the first year.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effectiveness of Gatekeeper Training Program (GTP) on awareness, attitude, mental help seeking intention and gatekeeper behavior among Koraga tribe: A study protocol [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Aim: This study aims to build the capacity of the people at grass root level as gatekeepers of mental health. It will assess the effectiveness of the Gatekeeper Training Program (GTP) on gatekeeper behaviour, awareness, attitude, and mental help seeking intention. Design: An evaluative research approach in two phases. Phase 1: Cross-sectional house-to-house exploratory survey. Phase 2: A quasi-experimental design with multiple follow ups at 0, 6 and 12 months. Method: Data will be collected using standardized tools like Mental Health Knowledge Questionnaire (MHKQ), Community Attitude towards Mentally Ill (CAMIS), Mental Help Seeking Intention (MHSIS) and Gatekeeper Behavior Scale (GBS). For Phase 1, a house-to-house survey will be conducted among the selected colonies of Koraga tribe to determine their awareness, attitude, and mental help seeking intention regarding common mental health problems. Phase 2 includes identification of the leaders/representatives of the selected tribal colonies, and involving them in GTP. Pre-test and multiple post-test will be conducted in Phase 2 at 0, 6, 12 months.  The study is funded by Indian Council of Medical Research from 16 August 2021 for 3 years duration. Discussion: Treatment gap in psychiatric disorders remains an issue of great concern. Evidence based research promotes task shifting approaches in dealing with mental health problems in the community. Capacity building programs like GTP for the underprivileged section of the society are important especially in low and middle income group of countries. Impact: This need based GTP, will ensure mental health first aid in the society. Early identification of people with mental health problems at their doorsteps has huge impact on the prognosis of the illness, closing the treatment gap and stigma reduction.

                Background: Many randomized trials measure a continuous outcome simultaneously at baseline and after taking the drug. For a single continuous post-treatment outcome, the sample size calculation is simple, but if there are assessments at multiple time points post-treatment then this longitudinal data may give more insights by analyzing the data using the repeated measures method. Also, if the sample size is calculated using the single time-point method for longitudinal data, it may lead to a larger than required sample size, increasing the cost and time. Methods: In this research, an effort is made to determine the size of the sample for repeated measures case and then compared with the single post-baseline case. The sample sizes were examined under different scenarios for the continuous type of response variable. Under Mean contrast and Diff contrast the sample sizes were calculated with different correlations. These two scenarios were again examined under compound symmetry as well as Auto regressive of order 1 type of correlation structure in longitudinal data. The graphical presentation is given for better visualization of the scenarios. Results: Sample size required for highly correlated longitudinal data using multi timepoint sample size derivation method led to much smaller sample size requirement as compared to single timepoint sample size calculation method. Conclusions: This study will help researchers to make better decisions in choosing the right method for sample size determination which may reduce the time and cost of carrying out the experiment. Also, we must carefully assess which method to go with when the correlation is weak. More complex correlation structures are not studied in this article but can be studied in the same fashion.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">AFHIRIS: African Human Iris Dataset (Version 1) [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Biometric systems remain the most widely used methods for identification and authentication purposes. Their wide acceptability has opened up more research into new application areas of biometric systems. However, biometric research requires an appropriate biometric dataset to validate the proposed technique. This dataset could be privately owned or publicly available for research purposes. In the field of iris biometric research, the iris dataset produced by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA) is the first, most popular, and widely used publicly available iris dataset. However, the increasing popularity and acceptability of human iris-related research have called for additional benchmarks, and therefore, new publicly available databases of human iris images. Existing publicly available human iris datasets have been collected from non-African subjects; therefore, this dataset is the first publicly available human iris dataset of African descent. Three categories of images were collected from 1028 volunteers that participated in the data collection task. The first category was made up of four iris images that were captured when the volunteers used spectacles, while the second category includes four iris images that were captured when the volunteers wore no spectacles. However, the third category of iris images was obtained from eight volunteers that used print-patterned contact lenses. Only four images were captured from volunteers in this category as they were not asked to put on spectacles. In addition to the iris images captured, soft biometric features such as age, gender, state of origin, weight, and height of the volunteers were also captured. It is strongly believed that this unique collection of iris datasets of African descent will open up new research in the study of the human iris.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>MiRNA-124 has been considered to play a significant role in the formation of memory and a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, the aim is to verify whether miRNA-124 is involved in memory impairment induced by <span class="smallCaps">d</span>-galactose, and explore the underlying neuroprotective mechanism. The results revealed that rapid administration of <span class="smallCaps">d</span>-galactose (1000 mg/kg subcutaneously) in mice caused memory impairments, as determined by Novel Object Recognition test, Morris Water Maze test, and histological assessments. MiRNA-124 agomir is stereotactic injected into hippocampus, thus alleviated memory impairment induced by <span class="smallCaps">d</span>-galactose and reversed the neural damage and neuroinflammation. Furthermore, the results of molecular biological analysis and immunohistochemistry revealed that miRNA-124 markedly reduced neuroinflammation induced by <span class="smallCaps">d</span>-galactose through polarization of microglia as determined by detection of ionized calcium binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba-1), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and arginase-1(Arg-1), which also downregulated inflammatory mediators, including interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and upregulated IL-4 and IL-10. Hence, taken together, the results of the present study suggested that miRNA-124 showed a significant negative correlation with memory impairment and neuroinflammation induced by <span class="smallCaps">d</span>-galactose rapidly, possibly via polarization of microglia from M1 to M2. It is possible that miRNA-124 can be used as a new target for the pathogenesis of memory impairment, including age-associated neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>RGS14 is a multifunctional scaffolding protein that is highly expressed within postsynaptic spines of pyramidal neurons in hippocampal area CA2. Known roles of RGS14 in CA2 include regulating G protein, H-Ras/ERK, and calcium signaling pathways to serve as a natural suppressor of synaptic plasticity and postsynaptic signaling. RGS14 also shows marked postsynaptic expression in major structures of the limbic system and basal ganglia, including the amygdala and both the ventral and dorsal subdivisions of the striatum. In this review, we discuss the signaling functions of RGS14 and its role in postsynaptic strength (long-term potentiation) and spine structural plasticity in CA2 hippocampal neurons, and how RGS14 suppression of plasticity impacts linked behaviors such as spatial learning, object memory, and fear conditioning. We also review RGS14 expression in the limbic system and basal ganglia and speculate on its possible roles in regulating plasticity in these regions, with a focus on behaviors related to emotion and motivation. Finally, we explore the functional implications of RGS14 in various brain circuits and speculate on its possible roles in certain disease states such as hippocampal seizures, addiction, and anxiety disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Allosteric regulation in STAT3 interdomains is mediated by a rigid core: SH2 domain regulation by CCD in D170A variant</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tingting Zhao, Nischal Karki, Brian D. Zoltowski, Devin A. Matthews</p>

Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) plays a crucial role in cancer development and thus is a viable target for cancer treatment. STAT3 functions as a dimer mediated by phosphorylation of the SRC-homology 2 (SH2) domain, a key target for therapeutic drugs. While great efforts have been employed towards the development of compounds that directly target the SH2 domain, no compound has yet been approved by the FDA due to a lack of specificity and pharmacologic efficacy. Studies have shown that allosteric regulation of SH2 via the coiled-coil domain (CCD) is an alternative drug design strategy. Several CCD effectors have been shown to modulate SH2 binding and affinity, and at the time of writing at least one drug candidate has entered phase I clinical trials. However, the mechanism for SH2 regulation via CCD is poorly understood. Here, we investigate structural and dynamic features of STAT3 and compare the wild type to the reduced function variant D170A in order to delineate mechanistic differences and propose allosteric pathways. Molecular dynamics simulations were employed to explore conformational space of STAT3 and the variant, followed by structural, conformation, and dynamic analysis. The trajectories explored show distinctive conformational changes in the SH2 domain for the D170A variant, indicating long range allosteric effects. Multiple analyses provide evidence for long range communication pathways between the two STAT3 domains, which seem to be mediated by a rigid core which connects the CCD and SH2 domains via the linker domain (LD) and transmits conformational changes through a network of short-range interactions. The proposed allosteric mechanism provides new insight into the understanding of intramolecular signaling in STAT3 and potential pharmaceutical control of STAT3 specificity and activity.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Exploring a diverse world of effector domains and amyloid signaling motifs in fungal NLR proteins</a></h4>

NLR proteins are intracellular receptors constituting a conserved component of the innate immune system of cellular organisms. In fungi, NLRs are characterized by high diversity of architectures and presence of amyloid signaling. Here, we explore the diverse world of effector and signaling domains of fungal NLRs using state-of-the-art bioinformatic methods including MMseqs2 for fast clustering, probabilistic context-free grammars for sequence analysis, and AlphaFold2 deep neural networks for structure prediction. In addition to substantially improving the overall annotation, especially in basidiomycetes, the study identifies novel domains and reveals the structural similarity of MLKL-related HeLo- and Goodbye-like domains forming the most abundant superfamily of fungal NLR effectors. Moreover, compared to previous studies, we found several times more amyloid motif instances, including novel families, and validated aggregating and prion-forming properties of the most abundant of them <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Also, through an extensive <i>in silico</i> search, the NLR-associated amyloid signaling was identified in basidiomycetes. The emerging picture highlights similarities and differences in the NLR architectures and amyloid signaling in ascomycetes, basidiomycetes and other branches of life.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A method to estimate the cellular composition of the mouse brain from heterogeneous datasets</a></h4>

The mouse brain contains a rich diversity of inhibitory neuron types that have been characterized by their patterns of gene expression. However, it is still unclear how these cell types are distributed across the mouse brain. We developed a computational method to estimate the densities of different inhibitory neuron types across the mouse brain. Our method allows the unbiased integration of diverse and disparate datasets into one framework to predict inhibitory neuron densities for uncharted brain regions. We constrained our estimates based on previously computed brain-wide neuron densities, gene expression data from <i>in situ</i> hybridization image stacks together with a wide range of values reported in the literature. Using constrained optimization, we derived coherent estimates of cell densities for the different inhibitory neuron types. We estimate that 20.3% of all neurons in the mouse brain are inhibitory. Among all inhibitory neurons, 18% predominantly express parvalbumin (PV), 16% express somatostatin (SST), 3% express vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and the remainder 63% belong to the residual GABAergic population. We find that our density estimations improve as more literature values are integrated. Our pipeline is extensible, allowing new cell types or data to be integrated as they become available. The data, algorithms, software, and results of our pipeline are publicly available and update the Blue Brain Cell Atlas. This work therefore leverages the research community to collectively converge on the numbers of each cell type in each brain region.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Differences in the functional brain architecture of sustained attention and working memory in youth and adults</a></h4>

Sustained attention (SA) and working memory (WM) are critical processes, but the brain networks supporting these abilities in development are unknown. We characterized the functional brain architecture of SA and WM in 9- to 11-year-old children and adults. First, we found that adult network predictors of SA generalized to predict individual differences and fluctuations in SA in youth. A WM model predicted WM performance both across and within children—and captured individual differences in later recognition memory—but underperformed in youth relative to adults. We next characterized functional connections differentially related to SA and WM in youth compared to adults. Results revealed 2 network configurations: a dominant architecture predicting performance in both age groups and a secondary architecture, more prominent for WM than SA, predicting performance in each age group differently. Thus, functional connectivity (FC) predicts SA and WM in youth, with networks predicting WM performance differing more between youths and adults than those predicting SA.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Alternative splicing liberates a cryptic cytoplasmic isoform of mitochondrial MECR that antagonizes influenza virus</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Steven F. Baker, Helene Meistermann, Manuel Tzouros, Aaron Baker, Sabrina Golling, Juliane Siebourg Polster, Mitchell P. Ledwith, Anthony Gitter, Angelique Augustin, Hassan Javanbakht, Andrew Mehle</p>

Viruses must balance their reliance on host cell machinery for replication while avoiding host defense. Influenza A viruses are zoonotic agents that frequently switch hosts, causing localized outbreaks with the potential for larger pandemics. The host range of influenza virus is limited by the need for successful interactions between the virus and cellular partners. Here we used immunocompetitive capture-mass spectrometry to identify cellular proteins that interact with human- and avian-style viral polymerases. We focused on the proviral activity of heterogenous nuclear ribonuclear protein U-like 1 (hnRNP UL1) and the antiviral activity of mitochondrial enoyl CoA-reductase (MECR). MECR is localized to mitochondria where it functions in mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFAS). While a small fraction of the polymerase subunit PB2 localizes to the mitochondria, PB2 did not interact with full-length MECR. By contrast, a minor splice variant produces cytoplasmic MECR (cMECR). Ectopic expression of cMECR shows that it binds the viral polymerase and suppresses viral replication by blocking assembly of viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs). MECR ablation through genome editing or drug treatment is detrimental for cell health, creating a generic block to virus replication. Using the yeast homolog Etr1 to supply the metabolic functions of MECR in MECR-null cells, we showed that specific antiviral activity is independent of mtFAS and is reconstituted by expressing cMECR. Thus, we propose a strategy where alternative splicing produces a cryptic antiviral protein that is embedded within a key metabolic enzyme.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">ERR2 and ERR3 promote the development of gamma motor neuron functional properties required for proprioceptive movement control</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mudassar N. Khan, Pitchaiah Cherukuri, Francesco Negro, Ashish Rajput, Piotr Fabrowski, Vikas Bansal, Camille Lancelin, Tsung-I Lee, Yehan Bian, William P. Mayer, Turgay Akay, Daniel Müller, Stefan Bonn, Dario Farina, Till Marquardt</p>

The ability of terrestrial vertebrates to effectively move on land is integrally linked to the diversification of motor neurons into types that generate muscle force (alpha motor neurons) and types that modulate muscle proprioception, a task that in mammals is chiefly mediated by gamma motor neurons. The diversification of motor neurons into alpha and gamma types and their respective contributions to movement control have been firmly established in the past 7 decades, while recent studies identified gene expression signatures linked to both motor neuron types. However, the mechanisms that promote the specification of gamma motor neurons and/or their unique properties remained unaddressed. Here, we found that upon selective loss of the orphan nuclear receptors ERR2 and ERR3 (also known as ERRβ, ERRγ or NR3B2, NR3B3, respectively) in motor neurons in mice, morphologically distinguishable gamma motor neurons are generated but do not acquire characteristic functional properties necessary for regulating muscle proprioception, thus disrupting gait and precision movements. Complementary gain-of-function experiments in chick suggest that ERR2 and ERR3 could operate via transcriptional activation of neural activity modulators to promote a gamma motor neuron biophysical signature of low firing thresholds and high firing rates. Our work identifies a mechanism specifying gamma motor neuron functional properties essential for the regulation of proprioceptive movement control.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Efficient coding theory of dynamic attentional modulation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Wiktor Młynarski, Gašper Tkačik</p>

Activity of sensory neurons is driven not only by external stimuli but also by feedback signals from higher brain areas. Attention is one particularly important internal signal whose presumed role is to modulate sensory representations such that they only encode information currently relevant to the organism at minimal cost. This hypothesis has, however, not yet been expressed in a normative computational framework. Here, by building on normative principles of probabilistic inference and efficient coding, we developed a model of dynamic population coding in the visual cortex. By continuously adapting the sensory code to changing demands of the perceptual observer, an attention-like modulation emerges. This modulation can dramatically reduce the amount of neural activity without deteriorating the accuracy of task-specific inferences. Our results suggest that a range of seemingly disparate cortical phenomena such as intrinsic gain modulation, attention-related tuning modulation, and response variability could be manifestations of the same underlying principles, which combine efficient sensory coding with optimal probabilistic inference in dynamic environments.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Prevalence of mutations in Mendelian stroke genes in early‐onset stroke patients</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Heritability of stroke is assumed not to be low, especially in the young-age stroke population. However, most genetic studies have been performed in highly selected patients with typical clinical or neuroimaging characteristics. We investigated the prevalence of 15 Mendelian stroke genes and explored the relationships between variants and the clinical and neuroimaging characteristics in a large, unselected, young stroke population.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We enrolled patients aged ≤55 years with stroke or transient ischemic attack from a prospective, nationwide, multicenter stroke registry. We identified clinically relevant genetic variants (CRGV) in 15 Mendelian stroke genes (<i>GLA, NOTCH3, HTRA1, RNF213, ACVRL1, ENG, CBS, TREX1, ABCC6, COL4A1, FBN1, NF1, COL3A1, MT-TL1, and APP</i>) using a customized, targeted next-generation sequencing panel.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 1,033 patients, 131 (12.7%) had 28 CRGV, most frequently in <i>RNF213</i> (n=59), followed by <i>ABCC6</i> (n=53) and <i>NOTCH3</i> (n=15). The frequency of CRGV differed by ischemic stroke subtypes (<i>p</i>&lt;0.01)—highest in other determined etiology (20.1%), followed by large artery atherosclerosis (13.6%). It also differed between patients aged ≤35 years and those aged 51–55 years (17.1% vs. 9.3%, <i>p</i>=0.02). Only 27.1% and 26.7% of patients with <i>RNF213</i> and <i>NOTCH3</i> variants had typical neuroimaging features of the corresponding disorders, respectively. Variants of uncertain significance (VUS) were found in 15.4% patients.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>CRGV in 15 Mendelian stroke genes may not be uncommon in the young stroke population. The majority of patients with CRGV did not have typical features of the corresponding monogenic disorders. Clinical implications of having CRGV or VUS should be explored.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The Effect of Pyridostigmine as an Antidote for Botulinum Type A: An Experimental Study on Rabbits [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Botulinum toxin (BoNT) or Botox injections are popular non-surgical and non-invasive option to optimize and change an individual’s facial appearance and achieve rejuvenation. Pyridostigmine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor important in clinical practice. This study evaluated the toxic effect of BoNT to demonstrate the efficacy of anticholinesterase inhibitor pyridostigmine. Methods: We conducted an experimental interventional study to evaluate the antidote effect of pyridostigmine against BoNT. Forty rabbits (skeletally mature males, body weight 1000–2000 g) were included in the study. The rabbits were injected with Clostridium botulinum type A neurotoxin complex (BoNT or Botox), which was reconstituted with 0.9% sterile sodium chloride to a concentration of 100 U/2.5 mL. Animals were divided randomly into four groups (10 in each) as follows: Group 1 (control group), group 2 (pyridostigmine-treated group), group 3 (BoNT only group), and group 4 (BoNT + pyridostigmine treated group). Results: In the control group, there was statistical difference between the rabbits’ weight (P=0.03). The left muscle was significantly heavier than the right (P=0.025). In the pyridostigmine only group, the rabbits’ weight had a high statistical difference during four weeks of the study (P=0.002). In the BoNT injection group, weight had high statistically significant difference four weeks of the study (P=0.033), which was more in first week (1.55±0.2 kg) and then subsequently decreased in the fourth week (1.345±0.13 kg). The mean weight of the rabbits’ right quadriceps muscle was 6.573±1.3 g, which was significantly lower than the mean weight of the rabbits’ left quadriceps muscle (8.09±1.2 g, P=0.0001). Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study conducted in Iraq to investigate the antidote effect of pyridostigmine against BoNT injections. Pyridostigmine and saline caused increased weight of rabbits in comparison to rabbits that received BoNT injections. Pyridostigmine can act as strong antidote against Botox toxicity.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A cross-sectional study on assessment of spiritual health and its associated factors among undergraduate students in a medical college in Mangalore, Karnataka [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Spirituality and spiritual health are an integral component of an individual’s health and wellbeing. Among medical undergraduates and professionals, spiritual health has positive effects on the individual by decreasing burnout, psychological distress, and rates of substance abuse. Spiritual health is also correlated with increased satisfaction and meaning in life. Spiritual health also influences future patient care, builds patient- provider communication channels, and improves patient outcomes. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the spiritual health levels of medical undergraduates in a medical college, in Karnataka, India, and to identify the factors associated with it. Using a pre-designed, validated semi-structed questionnaire, 600 medical undergraduates were approached and provided the forms. Spiritual health was assessed across the three domains of self-development, self-actualization, and self-realization using the Spiritual Health Assessment Scale (SHAS). Results: A total of 436 medical undergraduates participated. Majority (67.7%) of participants were girls. Most (62%) were found to have fair spiritual health with a large portion of the rest (36%) having good spiritual health and 2% had poor spiritual health. A significant association was found  between spiritual health and the father’s (p=0.005) and mother’s (p=0.012) education levels. Spiritual health was also found to be associated with living in a nuclear family (p=0.04). Conclusions: Majority of the medical undergraduates had fair spiritual health. Parents' education levels and nuclear family were significantly associated with spiritual health.

                Background: Aortic rupture and suture dehiscence can complicate a cardiac operation, especially in case of infections of the surgical site. Such a complication can be life-threatening and require immediate surgical treatment. Case: We report the case of a 13-year-old girl who suffered a sudden dehiscence of the aortic suture line in the context of deep sternal wound infection, while in the surgical intensive care unit after a double valve replacement. Control of bleeding was obtained by the insertion of an endotracheal tube into the ascending aorta and inflation of the tube cuff to plug the aortic bleeding point. The extracorporeal circulation was then established and under deep hypothermic arrest the defect was successfully repaired. The patient was discharged 14 days after surgery and reviewed at the outpatient clinic in good health. Conclusions: An endotracheal tube can be used in cases of uncontrollable aortic bleeding as a life-saving tool to bridge the patient to adequate surgical treatment.

                <img src="https://pericles.pericles-prod.literatumonline.com/cms/asset/ad188f55-ec93-4ff9-8575-9e6424254ec1/jnr25156-toc-0001-m.png"
     alt="The role of selective SATB1 deletion in somatostatin expressing interneurons on endogenous network activity and the transition to epilepsy"/>
<p>The dramatic reduction in the numbers of somatostatin interneurons due to the selective deletion of the transcription factor <i>SATB1</i> results in more frequent but shorter cortical Up states. Furthermore, the transition to seizure-like events is accelerated after Mg<sup>2+</sup> washout but is rather unaffected after wash-in of 4-Aminopyridine (4-AP).</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Somatostatin (SST) expressing interneurons are the second most abundant group of inhibitory neurons in the neocortex. They mainly target the apical dendrites of excitatory pyramidal cells and are implicated in feedforward and feedback inhibition. In the present study, we employ a conditional knockout mouse, in which the transcription factor <i>Satb1</i> is selectively deleted in SST-expressing interneurons resulting to the reduction of their number across the somatosensory barrel field. Our goal was to investigate the effect of the reduced number of <i>Satb1</i> mutant SST-interneurons on (i) the endogenous cortical network activity (spontaneously recurring Up/Down states), and (ii) the transition to epileptiform activity. By conducting LFP recordings in acute brain slices from young male and female mice, we demonstrate that mutant animals exhibit significant changes in network excitability, reflected in increased Up state occurrence, decreased Up state duration and higher levels of extracellular spiking activity. Epileptiform activity was induced through two distinct and widely used in vitro protocols: the low magnesium and the 4-Aminopyridine (4-AP) model. In the former, slices from mutant animals manifested shorter latency for the expression of stable seizure-like events. In contrast, when epilepsy was induced by 4-AP, no significant differences were reported. We conclude that normal SST-interneuron function has a significant role both in the regulation of the endogenous network activity, and in the transition to seizure-like discharges in a context-dependent manner.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Diurnal small RNA expression and post-transcriptional regulation in young and old Drosophila melanogaster heads [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: MicroRNAs are a class of small (~22nt) endogenous RNAs that regulate target transcript expression post-transcriptionally. Previous studies characterized age-related changes in diurnal transcript expression but it is not understood how these changes are regulated, and whether they may be attributed in part to changes in microRNA expression or activity with age. Diurnal small RNA expression changes with age were not previously studied. Methods: To interrogate changes in small RNA expression with age, we collected young (5 day) and old (55 day) Drosophila melanogaster around-the-clock and performed deep sequencing on size-selected RNA from whole heads. Results: We found several microRNAs with changes in rhythmicity after aging, and we investigated microRNAs which are differentially expressed with age. We found that predicted targets of differentially expressed microRNAs have RNA-binding and transcription factor activity. We used a previously published method to identify mRNA transcripts which show evidence of microRNA targeting that is altered after aging, and found several that are involved in muscle development and maintenance. Finally, we identified novel microRNAs using the random-forest-based method miRWoods, which surprisingly also discovered transfer RNA-derived fragments. Conclusions: We showed a decrease in global microRNA expression and a corresponding increase in piRNA expression during aging. We also found an increase in rhythmicity of Drosophila small RNAs during aging, including microRNAs, piRNA clusters, and novel transfer RNA-derived fragments. To our knowledge this is the first study examining diurnal small RNA expression around the clock in young and old Drosophila, and as such it paves the way for future research on changes in small RNA regulatory molecules in the context of aging.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Three-dimensional wavelet decomposition-based radiomics analysis for tumor characterization in patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: We investigated the potential predictive value along with interpretability of the three-dimensional wavelet decomposition (3D-WD)-based radiomics analysis for characterization of gross-tumor-volumes (GTVs) for patients with Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). The goal was to characterize and identify the spatial frequencies and regions of primary tumor that are responsible for classifying the HPV status. Methods: One-hundred twenty-eight OPSCC patients (60-HPV+ and 68-HPV-, confirmed by immunohistochemistry-P16-Protein) were retrospectively studied. 3D-WD analysis was performed on the contrast-enhanced-CT images of patients’ primary tumor-GTVs to decompose information into three decomposition levels explained by a series of high-pass and low-pass wavelet coefficients (WCs). Log-Energy-Entropy of the WCs was calculated as radiomics features. A Least-Absolute-Shrinkage-and-Selection-Operation (Lasso) technique combined with a Generalized-Linear-Model (Lasso-GLM) was applied on the feature space to identify and rank the frequency sub-bands associated with the HPV status. The classifier was validated using a nested-cross-validation technique. Average of Area Under ROC (AUC), and Positive and Negative Predictive values (PPV and NPV) were computed to estimate the generalization-error and performance of the classifier. The significant features were used to weight tumor sub-band frequencies to reconstruct the tumor zones with highest information towards characterization of HPV. Results: Among 22 frequency-based features, two low-frequency and two high-frequency features were statistically discriminant between the two cohorts. Results (AUC/PPV/NPV=0.798/0.745/0.823) imply that tumor’s high-frequency and low-frequency components are associated with its HPV positivity and negativity, respectively. Conclusions: This study suggests that compared to the central zones of tumor, peritumoral regions contain more information for characterization of the HPV-status. Albeit subject to confirmation in a larger cohort, this pilot study presents encouraging results in support of the role of frequency-based radiomics analysis towards characterization of tumor microenvironment in patients with OPSCC. By associating this information with tumor pathology, one can potentially link radiomics to underlying biological mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">An updated version of the Madagascar periwinkle genome [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The Madagascar periwinkle, Catharanthus roseus, belongs to the Apocynaceae family. This medicinal plant, endemic to Madagascar, produces many important drugs including the monoterpene indole alkaloids (MIA) vincristine and vinblastine used to treat cancer worldwide. Here, we provide a new version of the C. roseus genome sequence obtained through the combination of Oxford Nanopore Technologies long-reads and Illumina short-reads. This more contiguous assembly consists of 173 scaffolds with a total length of 581.128 Mb and an N50 of 12.241 Mb. Using publicly available RNAseq data, 21,061 protein coding genes were predicted and functionally annotated. A total of 42.87% of the genome was annotated as transposable elements, most of them being long-terminal repeats.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Senataxin and RNase H2 act redundantly to suppress genome instability during class switch recombination</a></h4>

              
                Class switch recombination generates distinct antibody isotypes critical to a robust adaptive immune system, and defects are associated with autoimmune disorders and lymphomagenesis. Transcription is required during class switch recombination to recruit the cytidine deaminase AID—an essential step for the formation of DNA double-strand breaks—and strongly induces the formation of R loops within the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus. However, the impact of R loops on double-strand break formation and repair during class switch recombination remains unclear. Here, we report that cells lacking two enzymes involved in R loop removal—senataxin and RNase H2—exhibit increased R loop formation and genome instability at the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus without impacting its transcriptional activity, AID recruitment, or class switch recombination efficiency. Senataxin and RNase H2-deficient cells also exhibit increased insertion mutations at switch junctions, a hallmark of alternative end joining. Importantly, these phenotypes were not observed in cells lacking senataxin or RNase H2B alone. We propose that senataxin acts redundantly with RNase H2 to mediate timely R loop removal, promoting efficient repair while suppressing AID-dependent genome instability and insertional mutagenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Meningeal lymphatic drainage promotes T cell responses against Toxoplasma gondii but is dispensable for parasite control in the brain</a></h4>

              
                The discovery of meningeal lymphatic vessels that drain the central nervous system (CNS) has prompted new insights into how immune responses develop in the brain. In this study, we examined how T cell responses against CNS-derived antigen develop in the context of infection. We found that meningeal lymphatic drainage promotes CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses against the neurotropic parasite <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> in mice, and we observed changes in the dendritic cell compartment of the dural meninges that may support this process. Indeed, we found that mice chronically, but not acutely, infected with <i>T. gondii</i> exhibited a significant expansion and activation of type 1 and type 2 conventional dendritic cells (cDC) in the dural meninges. cDC1s and cDC2s were both capable of sampling cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-derived protein and were found to harbor processed CSF-derived protein in the draining deep cervical lymph nodes. Disrupting meningeal lymphatic drainage via ligation surgery led to a reduction in CD103<sup>+</sup> cDC1 and cDC2 number in the deep cervical lymph nodes and caused an impairment in cDC1 and cDC2 maturation. Concomitantly, lymphatic vessel ligation impaired CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation, proliferation, and IFN‑γ production at this site. Surprisingly, however, parasite-specific T cell responses in the brain remained intact following ligation, which may be due to concurrent activation of T cells at non-CNS-draining sites during chronic infection. Collectively, our work reveals that CNS lymphatic drainage supports the development of peripheral T cell responses against <i>T. gondii</i> but remains dispensable for immune protection of the brain.

                Axin1 is a key regulator of canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Roles of Axin1 in skeletal development and in disease occurrence have not been fully defined. Here, we report that Axin1 is essential for lower limb development. Specific deletion of <i>Axin1</i> in limb mesenchymal cells leads to fibular hemimelia (FH)-like phenotype, associated with tarsal coalition. Further studies demonstrate that FH disease is associated with additional defects in <i>Axin1</i> knockout (KO) mice, including decreased osteoclast formation and defects in angiogenesis. We then provide<i> in vivo</i> evidence showing that Axin1 controls limb development through both canonical β-catenin and BMP signaling pathways. We demonstrate that inhibition of β-catenin or BMP signaling could significantly reverse the FH phenotype in mice. Together, our findings reveal that integration of β-catenin and BMP signaling by Axin1 is required for lower limb development. Defect in Axin1 signaling could lead to the development of FH disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">TGF-β signaling and Creb5 cooperatively regulate Fgf18 to control pharyngeal muscle development</a></h4>

              
                The communication between myogenic cells and their surrounding connective tissues is indispensable for muscle morphogenesis. During late embryonic development in mice, myogenic progenitors migrate to discrete sites to form individual muscles. The detailed mechanism of this process remains unclear. Using mouse levator veli palatini (LVP) development as a model, we systematically investigated how a distinct connective tissue subpopulation, perimysial fibroblasts, communicates with myogenic cells to regulate mouse pharyngeal myogenesis. Using single-cell RNAseq data analysis, we identified that TGF-β signaling is a key regulator for the perimysial fibroblasts. Loss of TGF-β signaling in the neural crest-derived palatal mesenchyme leads to defects in perimysial fibroblasts and muscle malformation in the soft palate in <i>Osr2<sup>Cre</sup>;Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> mice. In particular, Creb5, a transcription factor expressed in the perimysial fibroblasts, cooperates with TGF-β signaling to activate expression of <i>Fgf18</i>. Moreover, Fgf18 supports pharyngeal muscle development <i>in vivo</i> and exogenous Fgf18 can partially rescue myogenic cell numbers in <i>Osr2<sup>Cre</sup>;Tgfbr1<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> samples, illustrating that TGF-β-regulated Fgf18 signaling is required for LVP development. Collectively, our findings reveal the mechanism by which TGF-β signaling achieves its functional specificity in defining the perimysial-to-myogenic signals for pharyngeal myogenesis.

                Recent years have seen a surge in the use of diffusion MRI to map connectomes in humans, paralleled by a similar increase in pre-processing and analysis choices. Yet these different steps and their effects are rarely compared systematically. Here, in a healthy young adult population (n = 294), we characterized the impact of a range of analysis pipelines on one widely studied property of the human connectome; its degree distribution. We evaluated the effects of 40 pipelines (comparing common choices of parcellation, streamline seeding, tractography algorithm, and streamline propagation constraint) and 44 group-representative connectome reconstruction schemes on highly connected hub regions. We found that hub location is highly variable between pipelines. The choice of parcellation has a major influence on hub architecture, and hub connectivity is highly correlated with regional surface area in most of the assessed pipelines ({rho} > 0.70 in 69% of the pipelines), particularly when using weighted networks. Overall, our results demonstrate the need for prudent decision-making when processing diffusion MRI data, and for carefully considering how different pre-processing choices can influence connectome organization.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">LRRC37B is a species-specific regulator of voltage-gated channels and excitability in human cortical neurons</a></h4>

              
                The enhanced cognitive abilities characterizing the human species result from specialized features of neurons and circuits, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here we report that the hominid-specific gene LRRC37B encodes a novel receptor expressed in a subset of human cortical pyramidal neurons (CPNs). LRRC37B protein localizes at the axon initial segment (AIS), the specialized domain triggering action potentials. LRRC37B ectopic expression in mouse CPNs in vivo leads to reduced intrinsic excitability, a distinctive feature of some classes of human CPNs. At the molecular level, LRRC37B acts as a receptor for the secreted ligand FGF13A and interacts with the voltage gated sodium channel (VGSC) beta subunit SCN1B, thereby inhibiting the channel function of VGSC, specifically at the AIS. Electrophysiological recordings in adult human cortical slices reveals that endogenous expression of LRRC37B in human CPNs reduces neuronal excitability. LRRC37B thus acts as a species-specific modifier of human cortical neuron function, with important implications for human brain evolution and diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Optimal parameters for Rapid invisible Frequency Tagging using MEG</a></h4>

              
                Frequency tagging has been demonstrated to be a useful tool for identifying representational-specific neuronal activity in the auditory and visual domains. However, the slow flicker (<30Hz) applied in conventional frequency tagging studies is highly visible and might entrain endogenous neuronal oscillations. Hence, stimulation at faster frequencies that is much less visible and does not interfere with endogenous brain oscillatory activity is a promising new tool. In this study, we set out to examine the optimal stimulation parameters of rapid invisible frequency tagging (RFT/RIFT) with magnetoencephalography (MEG) by quantifying the effects of stimulation frequency, size and position of the flickering patch. Rapid frequency tagging (RFT) using flickers above 50 Hz results in almost invisible stimulation which does not interfere with slower endogenous oscillations; however, the signal is weaker as compared to tagging at slower frequencies so the optimal parameters of stimulation delivery are crucial. The here presented results examining the frequency range between 60Hz and 96Hz suggest that RFT induces brain responses with decreasing strength up to about 84Hz. In addition, even at the smallest flicker patch (2 degrees) focally presented RFT induces a significant oscillatory brain signal at the stimulation frequency (66Hz); however, the elicited response increases with patch size. While focal RFT presentation elicits the strongest response, off-centre presentations do generally mainly elicit a measureable response if presented below the horizontal midline. The results also revealed considerable individual differences in the neuronal responses of to RFT stimulation. Finally, we discuss the comparison of oscillatory measures (coherence and power) and sensor types (planar gradiometers and magnetometers) in order to achieve optimal outcomes. Based on our extensive findings we set forward concrete recommendations for using rapid frequency tagging in human cognitive neuroscience investigations.

                Non-human primates are a critical species for the identification of key biological mechanisms in normal and pathological aging. One of these primates, the mouse lemur, has been widely studied as a model of cerebral aging or Alzheimer's disease. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations of blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) can be measured with functional MRI. Within specific frequency bands (e.g. the 0.01 0.1 Hz), these amplitudes were proposed to indirectly reflect neuronal activity as well as glucose metabolism. Here, we first created whole brain maps of the mean amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (mALFF) in middle-aged mouse lemurs. Then, we extracted mALFF in old lemurs to identify age-related changes. A high level of mALFF was detected in the temporal cortex (Brodmann area 20), somatosensory areas (Brodmann area 5), insula (Brodmann area 13/6) and the parietal cortex (Brodmann area 7) of healthy middle-aged mouse lemurs. Aging was associated with alteration of mALFF in somatosensory areas (area 5) and the parietal cortex (area 7).

                Innate defensive responses, while primarily instinctive, must also be flexible and highly adaptive to changes in risk assessment. As such, efficient innate escape behavior requires intricate processing to minimize reaction time while maximizing the success and adaptivity of the action. The superior colliculus (SC) is a subcortical sensorimotor integration center linking sensory threat information and escape. Adaptive changes in innate escape after learning could take a maladaptive turn after severe stress. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with long-term maladaptive changes after exposure to traumatic events, related to enhanced threat detection and reaction. Such long-term modifications are thought to involve the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which is implicated in integrating learned emotional values into decisions that drive actions and behaviors. Here, in a series of experiments, we establish the crucial physiological role of specific mPFC neurons, exerting influence on the SC both directly and indirectly through the basal ganglia, in threat detection and reaction after adversity.

                Evoked neural responses to sensory stimuli have been extensively investigated in humans and animal models both to enhance our understanding of brain function and to aid in clinical diagnosis of neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions. Recording and imaging techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), local field potentials (LFPs), and calcium imaging provide complementary information about different aspects of brain activity at different spatial and temporal scales. Modeling and simulations provide a way to integrate these different types of information to clarify underlying neural mechanisms. In this study, we aimed to shed light on the neural dynamics underlying auditory evoked responses by fitting a rate-based model to LFPs recorded via multi-contact electrodes which simultaneously sampled neural activity across cortical laminae. Recordings included neural population responses to best-frequency (BF) and non-BF tones at four representative sites in primary auditory cortex (A1) of awake monkeys. The model considered major neural populations of excitatory, parvalbumin-expressing (PV), and somatostatin-expressing (SOM) neurons across layers 2/3, 4, and 5/6. Unknown parameters, including the connection strength between the populations, were fitted to the data. Our results revealed similar population dynamics, fitted model parameters, predicted equivalent current dipoles (ECD), tuning curves, and lateral inhibition profiles across recording sites and animals, in spite of quite different extracellular current distributions. We found that PV firing rates were higher in BF than in non-BF responses, mainly due to different strengths of tonotopic thalamic input, whereas SOM firing rates were higher in non-BF than in BF responses due to lateral inhibition. In conclusion, we demonstrate the feasibility of the model-fitting approach in identifying the contributions of cell-type specific population activity to stimulus-evoked LFPs across cortical laminae, providing a foundation for further investigations into the dynamics of neural circuits underlying cortical sensory processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Electrophysiological indices of distractor processing in visual search are shaped by target expectations.</a></h4>

              
                Although in many cases salient stimuli capture attention involuntarily, it has been proposed recently that under certain conditions the bottom-up signal generated by such stimuli can be proactively suppressed. In support of this signal suppression hypothesis, ERP studies have demonstrated that salient stimuli that do not capture attention elicit a distractor positivity (PD), a putative neural index of suppression. At the same time, it is becoming increasingly clear that regularities across preceding search episodes have a large influence on attentional selection. Yet to date, studies in support of the signal suppression hypothesis have largely ignored the role of selection history on the processing of distractors. The current study addressed this issue by examining how electrophysiological markers of attentional selection (N2pc) and suppression (PD) elicited by targets and distractors respectively were modulated when the search target randomly varied instead of being fixed across trials. Results showed that while target selection was unaffected by this manipulation, both in terms of manual response times, as well as in terms of the N2pc component, the PD component was reliably attenuated when the target features varied randomly across trials. This result demonstrates that the distractor PD, which is typically considered the marker of selective distractor processing cannot unequivocally be attributed to suppression only, as it also, at least in part, reflects the upweighting of target features.

                Background Motor and cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with dopaminergic dysfunction that stems from substantia nigra (SN) degeneration and concomitant -synuclein accumulation. Diffusion MRI can detect microstructural alterations of the SN and its tracts to (sub)cortical regions, but their pathological sensitivity is still poorly understood. Objective To unravel the pathological substrate underlying microstructural alterations of the SN, and its tracts to the dorsal striatum and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in PD. Methods Combining post-mortem in-situ MRI and histopathology, T1-weighted and diffusion MRI of 9 PD, 6 PD with dementia (PDD), 5 dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and 10 control donors were collected. From MRI, mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were derived from the SN, and tracts between the SN and caudate nucleus, putamen, and DLPFC. Phosphorylated-Ser129--synuclein and tyrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemistry was included to quantify nigral Lewy pathology and dopaminergic degeneration, respectively. Results Compared to controls, PD and PDD/DLB showed increased MD of the SN and SN-DLPFC tract, as well as increased FA of the SN-caudate nucleus tract. Both PD and PDD/DLB showed nigral Lewy pathology and dopaminergic loss compared to controls. Increased FA of the SN and SN-caudate nucleus tract was associated with SN dopaminergic loss, while increased MD of the SN-DLPFC tract was associated with increased SN Lewy neurite load. Conclusions In PD and PDD/DLB, diffusion MRI captures microstructural alterations of the SN and tracts to the dorsal striatum and DLPFC, which differentially associates with SN dopaminergic degeneration and Lewy neurite pathology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Endogenous opioid release following orgasm in man: A combined PET-fMRI study</a></h4>

              
                Sex is one of the most rewarding and motivating behaviours for humans. Endogenous mu-opioid receptor system (MORs) plays a key role in the mammalian reward circuit. Both human and animal experiments suggest the involvements of MORs in human sexual pleasure, yet this hypothesis currently lacks in vivo support. We used positron emission tomography (PET) with the radioligand [11C]carfentanil, which has high affinity for MORs to quantify endogenous opioid release following orgasm in man. Subjects were scanned twice: Once immediately after reaching an orgasm and once in a baseline state. Haemodynamic activity was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging during penile stimulation from partner. The PET data revealed significant opioid release in hippocampus. Haemodynamic activity in somatosensory and motor cortices as well as hippocampus and thalamus increased during penile stimulation, and thalamic activation was linearly dependent on self-reported sexual arousal. Altogether these data show that endogenous opioidergic activation in the medial temporal lobe is centrally involved in sexual arousal.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A Synaptic Corollary Discharge Signal Suppresses Midbrain Visual Processing During Saccade-Like Locomotion</a></h4>

              
                In motor control, the brain not only sends motor commands to the periphery, but it also generates concurrent internal signals known as corollary discharge that influence the processing of sensory information around the time of movement. Corollary discharge signals are important for the brain to identify sensory input arising from self-motion and to compensate for it, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Using whole-cell patch clamp recordings from single neurons in the optic tectum of zebrafish, we discovered an inhibitory synaptic signal which was temporally locked to spontaneous and visually driven swim patterns. This motor-related synaptic signal transiently suppressed tectal output and was appropriately timed to counteract visually driven excitatory input arising from the fish's own motion. High-resolution calcium imaging revealed brief, highly localized post-swim signals in the tectal neuropil, suggesting that corollary discharge enters the tectum in its most superficial layer. Our results demonstrate how spurious visual input is suppressed during self-motion by motor-related phasic inhibition in the tectum. This may help explain perceptual saccadic suppression observed in many species.

                Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a public health concern ranging along a continuum of severity. The neurobiological motives behind ASD have been widely explored with reports about aberrant brain anatomy and functional connectivity. However, research on the underlying structural connectivity alterations is limited. We propose the application of a novel connectomic measure called Network Normality Score (NNS) to identify brain abnormalities and quantity topological dissimilarities in individuals with ASD. We show that the network topology of structural connectivity is altered in ASD brains relative to healthy controls at the global and system levels. We demonstrate that structural connectivity differences are more pronounced in certain subnetworks. Finally, we quantify the association between network similarity and behavioral autism severity to show the efficacy of NNS as a neuroimaging measure.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mitochondrial phosphagen kinases support the volatile power demands of motor nerve terminals</a></h4>

              
                Neural function relies on cellular energy supplies meeting the episodic demands of synaptic activity, but little is known about the extent to which power demands (energy demands per unit time) fluctuate, or the mechanisms that match supply with demand. Here, in individually-identified glutamatergic motor neuron terminals of Drosophila larvae, we leveraged prior macroscopic estimates of power demand to generate profiles of power demand from one action potential to the next. These profiles show that signaling demands can exceed non-signaling demands by 17-fold within milliseconds, and terminals with the greatest fluctuation (volatility) in power demand have the greatest mitochondrial volume and packing density. We elaborated on this quantitative approach to simulate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels during activity and drove ATP production as a function of the reciprocal of the energy state, but this canonical feedback mechanism appeared to be unable to prevent ATP depletion during locomotion. Muscle cells possess a phosphagen system to buffer ATP levels but phosphagen systems have not been described for motor nerve terminals. We examined these terminals for evidence of a phosphagen system and found the mitochondria to be heavily decorated with an arginine kinase, the key element of invertebrate phosphagen systems. Similarly, an examination of mouse cholinergic motor nerve terminals found mitochondrial creatine kinases, the vertebrate analogues of arginine kinases. Knock down of arginine kinase in Drosophila resulted in rapid depletion of presynaptic ATP during activity, indicating that, in motor nerve terminals, as in muscle, phosphagen systems play a critical role in matching power supply with demand.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Prediction error drives associative olfactory learning and conditioned behavior in a spiking model of Drosophila larva</a></h4>

              
                Predicting positive or negative reinforcement from environmental clues is essential to guide decision making and goal-directed behavior. In insect brains the mushroom body is a central structure for learning such valuable associations between sensory signals and reinforcement. We propose a biologically realistic spiking network model of the Drosophila larval olfactory pathway for the association of odors and reinforcement to bias behavior towards either approach or avoidance. We demonstrate that prediction error coding through integration of present and expected reinforcement in dopaminergic neurons can serve as a driving force in learning that can, combined with synaptic homeostasis, account for the experimentally observed features of acquisition and extinction of associations that depend on the intensity of odor and reward, as well as temporal features of the odor/reward pairing. To allow for a direct comparison of our simulation results with behavioral data we model learning-induced plasticity over the full time course of behavioral experiments and simulate locomotion of individual larvae towards or away from odor sources in a virtual environment.

                Electrical stimulation is a powerful therapeutic tool for treating neurologic and neuropsychiatric disorders. Sensing and modulating electrophysiological biomarkers of memory over extended timescales is necessary for tracking and improving memory in humans. Here, we describe results from humans in their natural home environments using a novel, investigational system enabling chronic stimulation and multi-channel recording of anterior thalamic and hippocampal local field potentials during memory tasks. Four people with focal epilepsy performed a free recall verbal memory task repeatedly for up to fifty months on a touch-screen device with wireless signal acquisition with electrophysiology and behavioral data streaming to a cloud environment. Anterior thalamic-hippocampal spectral activities in the theta frequency range were found to correlate with memory processing, to predict task performance, and to be modulated by deep brain stimulation. Our results provide a new biomarker-based technology for chronic remote tracking of memory performance and modulation of the associated neural activities.
