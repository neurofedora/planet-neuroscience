              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-140/v1?src=rss">Authentic Quality Experience as a Catalyst for Brand Trust, Value, and Loyalty: A Multidisciplinary Approach in Heritage Tourism [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Cultural heritage tourism presents unique challenges and opportunities in building long-term consumer–brand relationships. While brand loyalty is a key objective for destination marketers, the role of authentic quality experience in shaping trust and perceived brand value remains underexplored. This study aims to bridge that gap by examining how quality experience influences brand trust, brand value, and ultimately brand loyalty, using a multidisciplinary lens that integrates marketing theory, cultural studies, and psychology. Methods A quantitative survey was conducted involving 573 respondents from diverse demographic backgrounds who had visited cultural heritage destinations. Data were collected using structured questionnaires and analyzed through structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the relationships among quality experience, brand trust, brand value, and brand loyalty. Measurement validity and reliability were assessed prior to hypothesis testing. Results The results indicate that quality experience has a significant positive effect on both brand trust and brand value. Furthermore, brand trust and brand value act as mediating variables that strengthen the relationship between quality experience and brand loyalty. The structural model demonstrated strong fit indices, confirming the robustness of the proposed relationships. These findings underscore the importance of delivering authentic and meaningful experiences to enhance consumer perceptions and emotional attachment to heritage brands. Conclusions This study advances the theory of Relationship Marketing and Tourism Consumption by clarifying the key role of quality experience in building brand loyalty. Practically, the findings offer concrete recommendations for heritage site managers and destination marketers to develop branding strategies that emphasize authenticity, emotional resonance, and sustainable engagement. By focusing on quality experience, heritage destinations can foster greater trust, perceived value, and loyalty among visitors.

                Forest fires are becoming increasingly common worldwide, posing a threat to the environment, economy, and society. Spatiotemporal analysis of forest fires is important to understand their characteristics and causes and to inform decision-making. This type of analysis requires the availability of a number of factors that contribute to fire occurrence, such as land use, environment, climate, and human activities, at high spatial and temporal resolutions. The South American Amazon rainforest covers a large area, and acquiring a useful dataset for analysis requires extensive effort and computer-intensive processing. This study investigates potential data sources, establishes a methodology, and prepares a dataset of attributes useful for spatiotemporal fire analysis. We provide a raster-based dataset that includes fires, land use, environment, and climate factors at a spatial resolution of 500 m and monthly temporal resolution from 2001 to 2020, which facilitates the analysis of forest fires in the Amazon. Moreover, because data sources and implementation procedures are detailed, this work also encourages similar research in other parts of the world.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-622/v2?src=rss">Therapeutic Use of Cannabis: Knowledge and Acceptance among Citizens of Trujillo, Peru  [version 2; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background In Peru, the legalization of Cannabis was given in 2017 and approved in 2019; however, there are discrepancies in the knowledge of the therapeutic use of this plant, causing rejection in its application as an alternative medicine. Methods The research was of a basic type with a quantitative approach and a non-experimental design, with a cross-sectional and descriptive scope. Non-probabilistic sampling was applied, with 324 participants aged 18-60. Data were collected through a virtual questionnaire of closed questions (KR-20 = 0.825). Descriptive statistics were used (frequencies and percentages), and inferential analyses Spearman’s correlation, simple linear regression, Monte Carlo exact tests, and a two-step cluster analysis to identify acceptance profiles. Results Participants expressed a favorable perception of the potential benefits of medical cannabis. However, their knowledge of its therapeutic indications and dosage was limited. Inferential analyses revealed a significant positive association between knowledge and acceptance of the therapeutic use of cannabis. Knowledge emerged as a significant predictor of acceptance, although it explained only a limited proportion of its variability. Cluster analysis identified distinct acceptance profiles within the study population, showing adequate internal cohesion and separation, and highlighting knowledge as the most influential factor in cluster formation. Despite moderate acceptance of regular use under medical supervision, participants emphasized that cannabis use should be limited to prescriptions from specialized physicians and supported by scientific evidence. Conclusion Study participants demonstrate limited knowledge about medical cannabis, despite moderate acceptance of its regulated use. Knowledge plays an important, though not exclusive, role in shaping acceptance, underscoring the need for targeted educational strategies and evidence-based public health policies.

                Abstract* Background The Workflow Description Language (WDL) is an open standard that is widely used for bioinformatics workflows. Due to its declarative nature WDL workflows can be easily presented and edited as graphs. Nextflow is both domain specific language for bioinformatics workflows and a convenient workflow execution engine. Our objective was to develop a tool that allows a user to edit WDL workflows visually as a graph providing synchronisation between its textual and graphical representation. Methods Translation of WDL workflows into Nextflow ones allows usage of both languages with the same execution engine. BioUML platform provides class library for object oriented presentation of most common workflow concepts as well as plugins for workflow visualisation and its graphical editing. Results We have developed a WDL parser that with some limitations maps content of WDL workflows into its object-oriented presentation (model). This model can be visualised and edited as a graph. WDL and Nextflow generators create WDL and Nextflow text from the same model. Conclusions Developed tools are available as a standalone Java program, web server, web service and a plugin for the BioUML platform.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-137/v1?src=rss">The Experimental Development of Solar Collector with Different Types of Nanofluid [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                In the present study, the flow rate and nanofluid effects on a parabolic trough solar collector were examined experimentally in Kirkuk city climate conditions during the period from May to July. Three flow rates, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 l/min were utilized. The theoretical and experimental results prove that lower flow rates enhance the thermal performance significantly as they increase the fluid residence time. According to the obtained results, two nanofluids, ZnO-water and MgO-water (at 0.2 wt. %), were experimentally evaluated at the optimal flow rate of 0.1 l/min. Both nanofluids showed better results than base fluid (water). Thus, MgO exhibited a better thermal efficiency of 66.9% at 12 pm than ZnO (62.7%) and water (57.19%). Directly, MgO generated the better thermal efficiency with maximum outlet temperature of MgO was 75.08°C. This could be due to the higher thermal efficiency of MgO-water, which is attributed to its much higher thermal conductivity (48.4 W/m·K) than ZnO (29 W/m·K). The exergy efficiency was nearly the same and negligible, that is, 13.8% for MgO, owing to the thermodynamic limitations. The practical results show that MgO nanofluid at a low flow rate could be an optimal solution for the parabolic trough solar collector.

                Background HFDs have adverse effects on metabolic health, which puts individuals at risk of obesity and liver and kidney dysfunction. Orlistat is an antihypertensive agent against obesity that prevents the absorption of dietary fats, although its impact on hepatic and renal functions is still disputed. In this study, the dose-dependent effects of orlistat on liver and renal functioning were in male rats on an HFD were assessed. Methods There was a control HFD group and three HFD groups with orlistat (360, 480 and 600 mg/kg) on male rats over 60 days. Lipid profiles, liver enzymes (AST, ALT, GGT, ALP), kidney (urea, creatinine, direct and indirect bilirubin), and hematological (hemoglobin, hematocrit, RBC, WBC counts, MCV, MCH, MCHC) serum tests were done. Histopathological analysis of liver and kidney tissues was done. Findings Orlistat caused dose-related changes in lipid profiles, increased liver enzymes, and an increased mark of kidney functioning. The hematological parameters were also greatly impaired, and the histopathology indicated structural and tissue damage in both of the organs, more so at higher doses. Conclusions Orlistat was used in HFD-conditions in male rats, which resulted in severe dose-related impairment of the liver and kidney. These results highlight the importance of close observation of hepatic and renal functions when using orlistat especially in the high-fat dietary situation.

                Background The incidence of stress and anxiety among nursing students is observed across all academic years of their educational training. Although Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) are helpful in healthcare education, they can be anxiety-inducing. This study aimed to assess the anxiety level among nursing students during the OSCE exams. Methods A descriptive study was carried out on a purposive sample by distributing an online survey among students from an undergraduate nursing program. Anxiety levels were measured using the State-trait anxiety inventory, including the subscales of the state and trait of anxiety. Results A total of 121 students with a mean age of 22.2 years (SD +/-3.6) participated in the study. The majority of the participants, 72.7%, were females, and 27.3% were males. Before attending the OSCE, 58.7% of the participants reported a mild degree of anxiety, 33.1% had a moderate level of anxiety, and only 10.7% had a severe level of trait anxiety. Conclusions The findings highlight the complex interplay between sociodemographic factors, academic performance, work-study balance, and anxiety levels among nursing students preparing for high-stakes assessments like the OSCE. Addressing anxiety levels among nursing students preparing for OSCE assessments requires a multifaceted approach that considers individual characteristics, academic performance, and external stressors.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-892/v2?src=rss">Why Are Christian Schools Popular in Japan Despite the Small Number of Christians? : A Case Study of a Catholic Girls’ Junior and Senior High School [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                The proportion of Christians in Japan’s population is very small (0.7%). In contrast, Christian-affiliated schools are numerous and enjoy widespread popularity. As previous studies suggest, Christian schools—especially those for girls—are often associated with positive social images (such as being “refined” or “upper-class”), particularly among young women, and this association has been considered one reason for their popularity. However, much of the existing research is based on statistical analysis, literature review, or quantitative methods, and few studies have employed detailed qualitative approaches. Some earlier studies have applied Pierre Bourdieu’s theory of class reproduction to analyze the popularity of Christian girls’ schools, but they often frame this in terms of marriage as a pathway to upward social mobility—a perspective that does not fully align with the values of today’s youth, who tend to place greater emphasis on their individual careers. Therefore, this paper focuses on one Christian-affiliated integrated junior and senior high school for girls (referred to as School X) and explores the reasons for its popularity through semi-structured interviews with its alumni. Unlike previous research that has been constrained by gender biases, this study examines the appeal of such schools from the perspective of cultural capital. In particular, it emphasizes the relevance of alignment between the students’ values and the founding mission of the school. The findings reveal that the students perceived School X’s education as directly contributing to the acquisition of various forms of capital and habitus, as defined by Bourdieu (although not articulated in such terms by the students themselves). Additionally, These results indicate a strong sense of coherence between the school’s founding ideals and the students’ personal values. In conclusion, this paper offers insight—through the lens of cultural capital and habitus—into why Christian girls’ schools in Japan continue to be highly regarded.

                This study introduces an innovative Augmented Reality (AR) cultural application designed to enrich the tourism experience of the Dvaravati-Khmer civilization in Thailand. Addressing the scarcity of interactive digital tools at historical sites, which often fail to engage modern visitors effectively, our AR application integrates multiple functionalities, including 3D object scanning, VR site exploration, and a digital rally system. Developed using the Unity engine and Vuforia SDK, the application underwent rigorous user trials involving 43 participants to evaluate its impact on user experience, learning effectiveness, and engagement. Results demonstrated a 40% increase in historical knowledge retention, with 92% task completion rates and high user satisfaction (4.01/5). The application’s intuitive design and gamified elements significantly enhanced visitor interaction and learning. Here, we showcase an adaptable model for digital cultural tourism enhancement, providing practical insights for heritage preservation and visitor engagement.

                Background This study aimed to examine the knowledge, attitude, and perception of body donation among Phase-1 medical students at our institution. The objectives were to assist teachers in providing insight into the perception of this among students. Methods This was a cross-sectional, institution-based, time-bound study comprising 29 validated questions regarding comprehensive aspects of body donation. There were 396 medical students in Phase-1 from admissions for two consecutive years. Results Most students (94.4%) were aware of the source of cadavers in the dissection hall, which were either donated or unclaimed bodies from the hospital. However, 38.9% of them were unaware of the guidelines for body donation, and 79% were ignorant of the documents required to pledge. However, 84.3% were aware that it was mandatory to sign a pledge form. The time frame to procure the dead body to the department of anatomy of the institution was not known to 79% of the participants, and 93.2% of the participants opined that corpses from other neighboring states could be accepted. Opinions regarding the acceptance of donated bodies afflicted with long COVID were supported by 218 (55.1%), not supported by 47 (11.9%), and neutral by 131 (33.1%) participants in this study. Conclusion Specific knowledge gaps were encountered, including the timeframe, logistics, and legal issues in procuring the body. Since medical students play an important role in this societal motivation, it is suggested that a scientific session be planned in the curriculum of Phase-1 regarding the protocol of body donation. Apart from providing insights, this study also accomplishes the United Nations’ sustainable development goal-4 in offering quality medical education. This study, apart from providing insights, also accomplishes the United Nation’s sustainable development goal-4 in offering quality medical education.

                Background Hydatid disease is a widespread disease that affects all human organs. Aims This study aimed to evaluate antibodies (IgA, IgG, and IgM), complement proteins (C3 and C4), MIF of PMNs cells, reduction of nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT), and phagocytic activity against Candida albicans. Methodology Hydatid cysts were collected from surgically injured patients at Fallujah Teaching Hospital, Twenty BALB/c mice were injected with Protoscolex antigen as treatment groups or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as control groups, at booster and challenge doses. Antibodies and complement concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the MIF of PMNs cells, reduction of NBT, and phagocytic activity against Candida albicans were measured to assess cellular activity. Results The results showed significant differences in the levels of antibodies compared to the control group 21 days after injection of the protoscolex antigen at a concentration of 0.5 ml subcutaneously. There were also significant differences between the treatment and control group in the levels of C3 and C4. NBT dye reduction and phagocytosis of Candida albicans by PMNs showed significant differences compared to the control group. The results also showed a significant decrease in PMN viability in the treatment group. An increase in neutrophil migration diameter was observed. The results showed a 50.4% decrease in the infection level in the treatments injected with the antigen, and the average diameter of the hydatid cysts decreased compared with the control group. Conclusions The results indicate that Protoscolex antigen activates the immune response and reduces severity of hydatid disease. This highlights its potential as a promising candidate for developing a vaccine or preventive strategy against hydatid disease.

                arXiv:2601.20447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enabling natural communication through brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) remains one of the most profound challenges in neuroscience and neurotechnology. While existing frameworks offer partial solutions, they are constrained by oversimplified semantic representations and a lack of interpretability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Semantic Intent Decoding (SID), a novel framework that translates neural activity into natural language by modeling meaning as a flexible set of compositional semantic units. SID is built on three core principles: semantic compositionality, continuity and expandability of semantic space, and fidelity in reconstruction. We present BrainMosaic, a deep learning architecture implementing SID. BrainMosaic decodes multiple semantic units from EEG/SEEG signals using set matching and then reconstructs coherent sentences through semantic-guided reconstruction. This approach moves beyond traditional pipelines that rely on fixed-class classification or unconstrained generation, enabling a more interpretable and expressive communication paradigm. Extensive experiments on multilingual EEG and clinical SEEG datasets demonstrate that SID and BrainMosaic offer substantial advantages over existing frameworks, paving the way for natural and effective BCI-mediated communication.

Abstract: Significance: Voltage imaging microscopy has emerged as a powerful tool to investigate neural activity both in vivo and in vitro. Various imaging approaches have been developed, including point-scanning, line-scanning and wide-field microscopes, however the effects of their different temporal sampling methods on signal fidelity have not yet been fully investigated. Aim: To provide an analysis of the inherent advantages and disadvantages of temporal sampling in scanning and wide-field microscopes and their effect on the fidelity of voltage spike detection. Approach: We develop a mathematical framework based on a mixture of analytical modeling and computer simulations with Monte-Carlo approaches. Results: Scanning microscopes outperform wide-field microscopes in low signal-to-noise conditions and when only a small subset of spikes needs to be detected. Wide-field microscopes outperform scanning microscopes when the measurement is temporally undersampled and a large fraction of the spikes needs to be detected. Both modalities converge in performance as sampling increases and the frame rate reaches the decay rate of the voltage indicator. Conclusions: Our work provides guidance for the selection of optimal temporal sampling parameters for voltage imaging. Most importantly it advises against using scanning voltage imaging microscopes at frame rates below 500 Hz.

                arXiv:2601.20480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional neuroimaging data presents challenges for assessing neurodegenerative diseases due to complex non-linear relationships. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) can encode scans into lower-dimensional latent spaces capturing disease-relevant features. We propose a semi-supervised VAE framework with a flexible similarity regularization term that aligns selected latent variables with clinical or biomarker measures of dementia progression. This allows adapting the similarity metric and supervised variables to specific goals or available data. We demonstrate the approach using PET scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), guiding the first latent dimension to align with a cognitive score. Using this supervised latent variable, we generate average reconstructions across levels of cognitive impairment. Voxel-wise GLM analysis reveals reduced metabolism in key regions, mainly the hippocampus, and within major Resting State Networks, particularly the Default Mode and Central Executive Networks. The remaining latent variables encode affine transformations and intensity variations, capturing confounds such as inter-subject variability and site effects. Our framework effectively extracts disease-related patterns aligned with established Alzheimer's biomarkers, offering an interpretable and adaptable tool for studying neurodegenerative progression.

                arXiv:2601.19905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicon-based analog neural networks physically embody the ideal neural network model in an approximate way. We show that by retraining the neural network using a physics-informed hardware-aware model one can fully recover the inference accuracy of the ideal network model even in the presence of significant non-idealities. This is way more promising for scalability and integration density than the default option of improving the fidelity of the analog neural network at the cost of significant energy, area, and design overhead, through extensive calibration and conservative analog design.
  We first present a physics-informed hardware-aware model for a time-domain vector-matrix multiplier implemented with single-transistor floating-gate memory cells that explicitly accounts for two dominant non-idealities of the physical implementation - capacitive crosstalk and bit-line voltage drop - and integrates seamlessly with modern deep-learning workflows. The model discretizes each operation into adaptive time slots, processes activation patterns in parallel, and accumulates their contributions to predict effective multiplier outputs. Using measurements from a 16x16 silicon array, we calibrate the model, show that crosstalk is layout-dependent and often dominant, and introduce an improved weight-extraction procedure that doubles signal-to-error ratio versus an ideal vector-matrix multiplier model. Finally, we show that by training silicon-based analog neural networks using an hardware-aware model in the forward pass we can recover the accuracy of the ideal software networks across three architectures -- custom MLP on low-resolution MNIST, LeNet-5 on MNIST, and a VGG-style CNN on CIFAR-10 - establishing a complete design-to-deployment workflow for time-domain analog neuromorphic chips.

                arXiv:2601.19943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How can populations of learners develop coordinated, diverse behaviors without explicit communication or diversity incentives? We demonstrate that competition alone is sufficient to induce emergent specialization -- learners spontaneously partition into specialists for different environmental regimes through competitive dynamics, consistent with ecological niche theory. We introduce the NichePopulation algorithm, a simple mechanism combining competitive exclusion with niche affinity tracking. Validated across six real-world domains (cryptocurrency trading, commodity prices, weather forecasting, solar irradiance, urban traffic, and air quality), our approach achieves a mean Specialization Index of 0.75 with effect sizes of Cohen's d > 20. Key findings: (1) At lambda=0 (no niche bonus), learners still achieve SI > 0.30, proving specialization is genuinely emergent; (2) Diverse populations outperform homogeneous baselines by +26.5% through method-level division of labor; (3) Our approach outperforms MARL baselines (QMIX, MAPPO, IQL) by 4.3x while being 4x faster.

Abstract: Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have made significant progress in the past few years but have only been loosely inter-connected. Based on a workshop held in August 2025, we identify current and future areas of synergism between these two fields. We focus on the subareas of embodiment, language and communication, robotics, learning in humans and machines and Neuromorphic engineering to take stock of the progress made so far, and possible promising new future avenues. Overall, we advocate for the development of NeuroAI, a type of Neuroscience-informed Artificial Intelligence that, we argue, has the potential for significantly improving the scope and efficiency of AI algorithms while simultaneously changing the way we understand biological neural computations. We include personal statements from several leading researchers on their diverse views of NeuroAI. Two Strength-Weakness-Opportunities-Threat (SWOT) analyses by researchers and trainees are appended that describe the benefits and risks offered by NeuroAI.

                arXiv:2506.23734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black-box coevolution in mixed-motive games is often undermined by opponent-drift non-stationarity and noisy rollouts, which distort progress signals and can induce cycling, Red-Queen dynamics, and detachment. We propose the \emph{Marker Gene Method} (MGM), a curriculum-inspired governance mechanism that stabilizes selection by anchoring evaluation to cross-generational marker individuals, together with DWAM and conservative marker-update rules to reduce spurious updates. We also introduce NGD-Div, which adapts the key update threshold using a divergence proxy and natural-gradient optimization. We provide theoretical analysis in strictly competitive settings and evaluate MGM integrated with evolution strategies (MGM-E-NES) on coordination games and a resource-depletion Markov game. MGM-E-NES reliably recovers target coordination in Stag Hunt and Battle of the Sexes, achieving final cooperation probabilities close to $(1,1)$ (e.g., $0.991\pm0.01/1.00\pm0.00$ and $0.97\pm0.00/0.97\pm0.00$ for the two players). In the Markov resource game, it maintains high and stable state-conditioned cooperation across 30 seeds, with final cooperation of $\approx 0.954/0.980/0.916$ in \textsc{Rich}/\textsc{Poor}/\textsc{Collapsed} (both players; small standard deviations), indicating welfare-aligned and state-dependent behavior. Overall, MGM-E-NES transfers across tasks with minimal hyperparameter changes and yields consistently stable training dynamics, showing that top-level governance can substantially improve the robustness of black-box coevolution in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) relies heavily on labeled data, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming to obtain. In this paper, we propose a novel NAS method based on an unsupervised paradigm, specifically Masked Autoencoders (MAE), thereby eliminating the need for labeled data. By replacing the supervised learning objective with an image reconstruction task, our approach enables the efficient discovery of network architectures without compromising performance and generalization ability. Additionally, we address the problem of performance collapse encountered in the widely-used Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) in the unsupervised setting by designing a hierarchical decoder. Extensive experiments across various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method, offering empirical evidence of its superiority over the counterparts.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03996">Spiking Brain Compression: Post-Training Second-order Compression for Spiking Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2506.03996v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a new generation of energy-efficient neural networks suitable for implementation on neuromorphic hardware. As neuromorphic hardware has limited memory and computational resources, parameter pruning and quantization have recently been explored to improve the efficiency of SNNs. State-of-the-art SNN pruning/quantization methods employ multiple compression and training iterations, increasing the cost for pre-trained or very large SNNs. In this paper, we propose a novel one-shot post-training compression framework, Spiking Brain Compression (SBC), that extends the classical Optimal Brain Surgeon method to SNNs. SBC replaces the current-based objective found in the common layer-wise compression method with a spike-train-based objective whose Hessian is cheaply computable, allowing a single backward pass to compress parameters and analytically rescale the rest. Applying SBC to SNN pruning and quantization across event-based and static datasets (up to ImageNet), including SEW-ResNet152 and spike-driven Transformers, we achieve state-of-the-art one-shot post-training compression for SNNs, with single- to double-digit accuracy gains over ANN compression baselines ported to SNNs. We further report a synaptic-operation-based energy proxy and a calibration-size ablation, demonstrating robust performance under sub-one-sample-per-class calibration.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13843">QUASAR: An Evolutionary Algorithm to Accelerate High-Dimensional Optimization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.13843v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional numerical optimization presents a persistent challenge in computational science. This paper introduces Quasi-Adaptive Search with Asymptotic Reinitialization (QUASAR), an evolutionary algorithm to accelerate convergence in complex, non-differentiable problems afflicted by the curse of dimensionality. QUASAR expands upon the core principles of Differential Evolution (DE), introducing quasi-adaptive mechanisms to dynamically balance exploration and exploitation in its search. Inspired by the behavior of quantum particles, the algorithm utilizes three highly stochastic mechanisms that augment standard DE: 1) probabilistic mutation strategies and scaling factors; 2) rank-based crossover rates; 3) asymptotically decaying covariance reinitializations.
  Evaluated on the notoriously difficult CEC2017 benchmark suite of 29 test functions, QUASAR achieved the lowest overall rank sum (367) using the Friedman test, outperforming DE (735) and L-SHADE (452). Geometric mean comparisons show average final solution quality improvements of $3.85 \times$ and $2.07 \times$ compared to DE and L-SHADE, respectively ($p \ll 0.001$), with average optimization speed averaging $1.40 \times$ and $5.16 \times$ faster. QUASAR's performance establishes it as an effective, efficient, and user-friendly evolutionary algorithm for complex high-dimensional problems.

                arXiv:2601.12913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper argues that interpretability research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) is fundamentally ill-posed as existing definitions of interpretability fail to describe how interpretability can be formally tested or designed for. We posit that actionable definitions of interpretability must be formulated in terms of *symmetries* that inform model design and lead to testable conditions. Under a probabilistic view, we hypothesise that four symmetries (inference equivariance, information invariance, concept-closure invariance, and structural invariance) suffice to (i) formalise interpretable models as a subclass of probabilistic models, (ii) yield a unified formulation of interpretable inference (e.g., alignment, interventions, and counterfactuals) as a form of Bayesian inversion, and (iii) provide a formal framework to verify compliance with safety standards and regulations.

     alt="Distribution of Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels and Scaffolding Proteins on Vestibular Calyx Ending Delineates the Axon Initial Segment"/>
<p>Various sodium channel isoforms and their scaffolding proteins are found in four different microdomains in vestibular calyx-bearing afferents. These microdomains serve different purposes, analogous to the heminode, axon initial segment, and synaptic domains of other types of sensory afferents.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The amniote inner ear contains an unusual type of hair cell and a unique postsynaptic calyx terminal with specialized ion channel expression and afferent transmission mechanisms. The calyceal afferent terminal enwraps the hair cell and leads to a heminode. It has morphological and functional microdomains with distinct complements of potassium channels and scaffolding proteins. Stimulation of hair cells gives rise to postsynaptic potentials in the membrane facing the hair cell that propagate along the outer face of the calyx and parent axon to the heminode, giving rise to spikes with timing and response properties that vary with location (epithelial zone) and afferent morphology (calyx-only vs. dimorphic with additional bouton terminals). Heminodes of calyx-only afferents lie within the epithelium, placing the calyces themselves closer to the heminode. We report that diverse voltage-gated sodium (Na<sub>V</sub>) channel proteins (including Na<sub>V</sub>1.1–1.3, 1.5. 1.6, 1.8, and 1.9), HCN (hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated) channels, and associated scaffolding proteins (ankyrins, βIV-spectrin, and ezrin) are differentially deployed across calyx microdomains, and specific complements of proteins also vary with innervation zone in vestibular epithelia. Our results suggest the calyx outer surface plays a role analogous to an axon initial segment in central neurons, and that systematic variation in Na<sub>V</sub> pore-forming subunits underlies differences in firing properties of vestibular afferents in different epithelial zones.</p>

Here, each brain region is modeled by 2 oscillator clusters—a cluster of low-frequency (LFO) and high-frequency Hopf oscillators (HFO) coupled with an innovative power-coupling rule, facilitating cross-frequency interactions. The model is trained in 2 stages: learning oscillators’ frequencies and phase relations using a biologically plausible complex-Hebbian rule in the first stage and, followed by a modified complex backpropagation for amplitude approximation, overcoming limitations of poor accuracy and computational complexity in existing models. This framework outperforms current methods in replicating empirical functional connectivity (FC), FC dynamics (FCD), and modularity over disparate spatio-temporal scales. The correlation between the FC of fMRI and the FCs of various EEG frequency bands is reflected in the strengths of the LFO–HFO coupling. Furthermore, in silico structural perturbation studies quantified the effect of pruning of the anatomical connectivity on spatiotemporal dynamics in terms of FC, FCD, modularity, and integration level integrated state of occurrence rate. The model’s ability to reconstruct simultaneous EEG-fMRI data showcases significant advancement in understanding the resting-state brain’s functionality from multimodal settings and deciphering neurological disorders in diverse spatiotemporal scales.</span>

However, approximately 6.7% of cases show polymorphonuclear (PMN) cell predominance in pleural fluid, often causing delayed diagnosis and treatment, as these cases may not be initially recognised as tuberculosis. This study aimed to compare the clinical characteristics of PMN- and MN-predominant TPE. Methods This cross-sectional analytical study included 60 patients with bacteriologically confirmed TB with pleural effusion at Wahidin Sudirohusodo Hospital, Makassar, Indonesia. Primary data were collected from patient interviews, physical examinations, and pleural fluid analysis of thoracentesis samples. The diagnosis of pleural effusion was confirmed by radiological imaging and thoracentesis. Patients were classified as PMN-predominant (≥50% PMN) or MN-predominant (≥50% MN) based on pleural fluid cell counts. Results Among the patients, 24 (40%) had PMN-predominant and 36 (60%) had MN-predominant pleural effusion. Significant differences were found between cell predominance and clinical features, including weight loss (p < 0.001), symptom duration (p = 0.034), clinical severity (p = 0.033), pleural fluid leukocyte and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (p < 0.001). PMN predominance was associated with severe clinical presentation and higher pleural leukocyte and LDH levels in pleural fluid than MN predominance. Conclusions PMN-predominant TPE reflects an early, more severe inflammatory phase characterised by severe clinical manifestations and elevated leukocyte and LDH levels. While MN predominance suggests a more chronic disease phase with longer symptoms and mild to moderate clinical presentation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-238/v6?src=rss">Association between perceived oral health and oral health–related quality of life among hospital staff [version 6; peer review: 2 approved, 3 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Oral health is closely linked to well-being at work; however, evidence in hospital personnel remains limited. Methods Cross-sectional study in a Level II-1 hospital (n = 72). Oral-health–related quality of life (OHRQoL) was measured with OHIP-14 and perceived oral health (POH) with a modified HU-DBI. Bivariate associations were estimated with Spearman’s ρ and 95% confidence intervals; domain-level relationships were examined with proportional-odds ordinal logistic regression (Nagelkerke’s pseudo-R2). Results OHRQoL was distributed as 38.9% Excellent, 26.4% Fair and 34.7% Poor; POH concentrated in the Low level (52.8%), followed by Excellent (29.2%) and Fair (18.1%). POH correlated positively with OHRQoL (ρ = 0.391; 95% CI 0.18–0.57; p = 0.001). Domain-level analyses showed the strongest links for psychological discomfort (ρ = 0.421; p < 0.001; pseudo-R2 = 0.111; p = 0.027) and physical disability (ρ = 0.319; p = 0.006; pseudo-R2 = 0.167; p = 0.004); social disability (ρ = 0.242; p = 0.040; pseudo-R2 = 0.124; p = 0.017) and handicap (ρ = 0.298; p = 0.011; pseudo-R2 = 0.131; p = 0.013) were smaller but significant, whereas functional limitation was non-significant (ρ = 0.096; p = 0.424; pseudo-R2 = 0.014; p = 0.6). Conclusions Better perceived oral health is significantly associated with higher oral-health-related quality of life among hospital staff. Consequently, targeted workplace strategies, including education for self-care, pain management, and functional support, could enhance oral well-being. Moreover, open instruments and pilot reliability outputs are available to ensure transparency and reproducibility.

                <p>by Yossi Bokor Bleile, Pooja Yadav, Patrice Koehl, Florian Rehfeldt</p>

Quantifying cell morphology is central to understanding cellular regulation, fate, and heterogeneity, yet conventional image-based analyses often struggle with diverse or irregular shapes. We present a computational framework that uses topological data analysis to characterise and compare single-cell morphologies from fluorescence microscopy. Each cell is represented by its contour together with the position of its nucleus, from which we construct a filtration based on a radial distance function and derive a persistence diagram encoding the shape’s topological evolution. The similarity between two cells is quantified using the 2-Wasserstein distance between their diagrams, yielding a shape distance we call the PH distance. We apply this method to two representative experimental systems—primary human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and HeLa cells—and show that PH distances enable the detection of outliers in those systems, the identification of sub-populations, and the quantification of shape heterogeneity. We benchmark PH against three established contour-based distances (aspect ratio, Fourier descriptors, and elastic shape analysis) and show that PH offers better separation between cell types and greater robustness when clustering heterogeneous populations. Together, these results demonstrate that persistent-homology-based signatures provide a principled and sensitive approach for analysing cell morphology in settings where traditional geometric or image-based descriptors are insufficient.

                <p>by Shrabani S. Tripathy, Joseph V. Puthussery, Taveen S. Kapoor, John R. Cirrito, Rajan K. Chakrabarty</p>

This study aims to quantify environmental health impacts and assess risk by understanding the disproportionate burden of infectious diseases, specifically Influenza-like Illness (ILI), across regions with varying socio-economic characteristics. We introduce a novel vulnerability-based approach to better understand the complex relationship between socio-economic factors and ILI burden. We developed a machine-learning-driven framework to assess and map state-level socio-economic vulnerability to ILI in the United States. A vulnerability index was created by integrating 39 diverse socio-economic and health indicators from the latest CENSUS. A Random Forest Regression model then weighed these indicators to quantify each state’s vulnerability for the ILI values in 2022. To assess multicollinearity, Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) was calculated, and parameters were filtered to reduce the VIF. Key determinants of vulnerability include migration patterns, insurance coverage, and proportions of female and elderly populations. The resulting state-level vulnerability map reveals significant regional disparities. District of Columbia was identified as the most vulnerable state, followed by Massachusetts, Hawaii, New Mexico, and Rhode Island, all with normalized vulnerability indices exceeding 0.35. Our findings highlight significant regional variations in ILI vulnerability, emphasizing the need for targeted public health interventions tailored to state-specific socio-economic conditions. This scalable and adaptable methodology extends beyond influenza, offering a valuable approach for assessing vulnerability to a wide range of infectious diseases, strengthening epidemic preparedness and response.

                Abstract* Background Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis currently relies on behavioral assessments, which can be time-consuming and subjective. This study investigates whether minimal EEG band measurements can differentiate individuals with ASD from neurotypical peers, providing a potential rapid screening tool. Methods A proof-of-concept study was conducted with twelve participants aged 10 to 20 years, including five neurotypical controls and seven ASD residents from the Arabic Village for Special Education Centre. Brain activity was recorded using four-sensor Muse 2 headband covering the temporal and front regions. The primary EEG frequency bands- Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Theta- were measured and statically analysed for each participant. Results The EEG signals from the temporal regions were the most informative for distinguishing between groups. Specifically, gamma activity at the right temporal sensor (TP10) and beta activity at the left temporal (TP9) demonstrated the highest capacity to differentiate ASD individuals from controls. Conclusion These preliminary findings suggest that brief, simple EEG measurements, focusing on specific frequency bands in temporal regions, could rapid screening or monitoring of ASD behaviour in clinical and educational settings. Future research with larger samples and enhanced data collection is necessary to validate and expand upon these results.

                Background Innovation in micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) often stems from CEO traits and leadership. While prior research highlights the role of executive traits in innovation, less is known about the mechanisms through which these traits translate into firm-level innovation capabilities in emerging-economy MSMEs. Methods Grounded in Upper Echelons Theory, the HEXACO personality framework, and transformational leadership theory, this study tests a sequential mediation model using data from 106 CEOs of Colombian MSMEs. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed to examine whether transformational leadership and innovative behavior mediate the relationship between CEO personality traits (Openness to Experience and Conscientiousness) and organizational innovation capabilities. Results The model showed good fit (CFI = 0.92, TLI = 0.90, RMSEA = 0.09, SRMR = 0.07). Openness and Conscientiousness significantly predicted transformational leadership, which in turn promoted innovative behavior. Innovative behavior subsequently enhanced firms’ innovation capabilities, confirming (through bootstrapped indirect effects) mediation from CEO traits to innovation capabilities through transformational leadership and innovative behavior. Conclusions The findings indicate that CEO personality and leadership are key to indirectly fostering innovation in resource-constrained MSMEs. The findings extend upper-echelons theory and suggest leadership development is key to improving innovation performance in emerging-economy MSMEs.

                Background Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly reshaping various aspects of human life, including healthcare. In the Western world, AI is increasingly applied in education and clinical practice through algorithms designed to analyze health data, aid in prediction, and assist with disease diagnosis. However, developing countries like India face obstacles in adopting AI due to limited resources and socio-cultural factors. Aim This study seeks to assess and compare the knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to AI in dentistry among undergraduate and postgraduate students in South India. Methodology A descriptive cross-sectional online survey was conducted among dental students in South India. The survey included 21 validated, structured, close-ended questions addressing demographic details, self-assessment of knowledge, attitudes toward AI applications in dentistry, and self-perceived understanding of AI practice in the field. Results Of 208 respondents (81.8% response rate), 95.6% were familiar with the term AI. Postgraduates demonstrated significantly greater awareness of AI applications (90.9%) compared to undergraduates (25.8%). About 78.3% of undergraduates believed AI supports diagnosis and treatment planning, while 33.4% of undergraduates and 43.2% of postgraduates expressed concern that AI may replace dentists in the future. Most respondents acknowledged AI’s role in oral radiology (UG: 79.1%; PG: 72.2%). Interest in future learning was high (UG: 82.5%; PG: 92.2%). Level of education was a significant predictor of knowledge (p<0.01), while male students showed more positive attitudes (p<0.01). First-year postgraduates reported better AI-related practices than other groups (p<0.01). Conclusion Although most dental students lacked sufficient knowledge regarding the use of AI in dentistry, they displayed positive and encouraging attitudes toward its application. A large proportion expressed willingness to learn AI technologies to apply them in clinical practice. It is therefore recommended that universities and government bodies work together to integrate AI related topics into the dental curriculum to strengthen dental education in India.

     alt="Core and Matrix Thalamopallial Projections in Birds: A Study in the Pigeon (Columba livia)"/>
<p>Fernández et al. describe two novel aspects of thalamopallial organization in birds: (1) the existence of a matrix-like system of projections originating from a population of dorsal thalamic neurons that are distributed between sensory nuclei. These projections target the intermediate and dorsal layers, but not the senso-recipient layers of the sensory pallium; and (2) the presence of a reciprocal connection between the core thalamic sensory nuclei and the inhibitory reticular thalamic nucleus. Notably, both features closely parallel key aspects of the thalamocortical projection system in mammals.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The ascending sensory projections from the dorsal thalamus to the pallium are one of the most distinctive features of the amniote brain. In mammals, these projections can be broadly classified into two main types: (1) those arising from “core” neurons, mostly located in the central region of sensory nuclei, which relay topographic inputs to the intermediate layers of primary sensory cortices, forming a reciprocal circuit with the reticular thalamic nucleus (RTN); and (2) those originating from “matrix” neurons, located in the periphery of sensory nuclei, which project to superficial layers of primary and higher order cortices. To date, both the reciprocal core-RTN circuitry and the matrix projections have only been described in mammals. In this study, we re-examined the organization of thalamic projections to the visual dorsal ventricular ridge (DVR) in pigeons using neural tracing techniques. In addition to the well-known projection from the thalamic nucleus rotundus (Rt) to the ventral layer of the visual DVR (entopallium), we described a reciprocal projection pattern between the Rt and the RTN. Moreover, we identified a second ascending thalamopallial projection, arising from neurons surrounding the Rt and terminating primarily in the intermediate layer of the visual DVR. These neurons form a continuous “matrix” of cells within the dorsal thalamus, which as a group also give rise to axons targeting several associative pallial areas. Furthermore, we found that this “matrix” region receives descending inputs from the motor arcopallium. Collectively, these findings indicate that the avian thalamopallial system is more complex than previously recognized and thus more comparable to its mammalian counterpart.</p>

                Objective Dental caries continues to be a significant public health concern, particularly prevalent during adolescence. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of dental caries among adolescents aged 10 to 18 years attending two different types of private schools in Kabul City. Materials and Methods This descriptive cross-sectional study included 381 school-going adolescents. Data were collected through pre-structured questionnaires and face-to-face interviews, while oral examinations were conducted by experienced dentists. Both primary and permanent dentitions were assessed for decayed, missing, and filled teeth. Data analysis was performed using SPSS version 21.0, with p < 0.005 considered statistically significant. Results The mean age of participants was 14.6 ± 12.13 years, predominantly boys, as girls above grade six are not permitted to attend school in Afghanistan. The prevalence of dental caries was high (70.1%) and decreased with increasing age (p = 0.004), number of siblings (p < 0.001), and better tooth-brushing habits (p = 0.025). The mean DMFT score was 2.40 ± 2.45. Overall, 45.4% of students had good oral hygiene, 11.3% had poor oral hygiene, and 46.7% presented with dental calculus. Both dental calculus and oral hygiene were significantly associated with tooth-brushing habits and use of dental cleansing agents (p < 0.001). Conclusion This study highlights a high prevalence of dental caries among students aged 10–18 years at private schools in Kabul, varying by school type. Factors such as age and tooth brushing habits significantly influence dental health, emphasizing the urgent need for targeted oral health education and interventions.

                Background Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides high-resolution insights into cellular states, yet its analytical workflows are often fragmented and inconsistently documented. Challenges such as technical noise, dropout events, batch effects, and insufficient reporting of method parameters can hinder reproducibility and the interpretation of biological signals. Methods We developed scToolkit, a workflow built on the Scanpy framework to streamline core steps in scRNA-seq analysis. The toolkit implements quality control, preprocessing, clustering, and multiple downstream analytical modules within a unified Python interface. It also incorporates external resources, including curated cell-marker databases and pathway collections, and employs vectorization, just-in-time compilation, parallelization, and optional GPU acceleration to enhance performance. Comprehensive visualization tools support exploratory and comparative analyses. Results We applied scToolkit to a dataset of immune cells from blood and tonsil tissues to illustrate its functionality. The workflow produced interpretable clustering results, informative differential expression analyses, and clear visual comparisons across tissues and conditions. Enhanced plotting modules facilitated the examination of transcriptional differences across clusters and within individual clusters under matched experimental conditions. Conclusions scToolkit provides an accessible and scalable solution for scRNA-seq data analysis, helping users perform rigorous and reproducible workflows with reduced technical burden. Its integration of curated external resources and high-performance computation improves analytical consistency and usability. The workflow is openly available on GitHub, accompanied by documentation and tutorials to support broad adoption.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-128/v1?src=rss">Enhancing Solar Power Forecasting Accuracy Using HMPCS and Machine Learning Techniques: An Applied Study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Solar irradiance is a nonlinear and intermittent function, which makes accurate forecasting of solar power generation a challenge. The high variability of meteorological conditions is not well represented by conventional atmospheric models, thus hampering forecasting skill and model robustness. In this work, an advanced hybridization of multi-population cuckoo search (HMPCS) algorithm with machine learning (ML) methods is developed to enhance the prediction performance of photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting with more reliability. Methods In this study, a hybrid modeling framework is proposed, called HMPCS–ML framework which captures the global search capacity of HMPCS and predictive power of sophisticated ML models (Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM)). Optimizing hyperparameters by balancing exploration and exploitation, the algorithm runs on multi-populations through Lévy flight randomization. Interpolation, normalization, and temporal windowing were utilized to preprocess synthetic meteorological and irradiance datasets. We evaluated the framework by comparing commonly used statistical measures (MAE, RMSE, MAPE, R2). Results Moreover, experimental analyses showed that HMPCS–ML models significantly outperformed baseline approaches (Grid Search and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)). Results showed that the optimized LSTM+HMPCS model outperformed other models in terms of lowest RMSE (0.139) and highest R2 (0.93), reflecting the LSTM model’s good fit with practical observations and generalization ability. The optimal LightGBM + HMPCS variant also proved to be consistently better, with reduced error (23% lower than unoptimized models). Conclusions In this regard, the HMPCS–ML framework is a powerful and efficient solution for the optimization of solar power forecasting, improving the predictive performance and calculation efficiency. This research shows the potential of hybrid metaheuristic–ML integration for renewable energy prediction and smart-grid applications in general and indicates further extensions to multi-objective and Transformer-based architectures.

                Purpose This study aims to examine how religiosity moderates the influence of attitude and electronic word of mouth (E-WOM) on purchase decisions in Indonesia’s modest fashion market. It seeks to provide empirical evidence on how cognitive, social, and spiritual factors interact in shaping Muslim consumers’ purchasing behavior. Design/methodology/approach A quantitative research approach was employed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with data collected from 320 Muslim consumers in Jakarta and surrounding areas. The constructs (attitude, E-WOM, religiosity, and purchase decision) were measured using validated multi-item scales adapted from previous studies. Findings The results indicate that both attitude and E-WOM have significant positive effects on purchase decisions, with E-WOM being the most dominant factor. Religiosity exerts a direct positive influence and strengthens the relationship between attitude and purchase decision, but does not moderate the effect of E-WOM. These findings highlight that while religiosity enhances value-driven behavior, digital influence transcends religious intensity. Practical implications The study suggests that modest fashion marketers should integrate syariah-compliant values with credible digital engagement strategies to foster consumer trust and loyalty. Balancing faith-based authenticity with modern digital communication can enhance brand relevance in the halal fashion market. Originality/value This study extends the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) by incorporating religiosity as a moderating factor within the context of Islamic consumer behavior. It contributes to the growing body of Islamic marketing literature by revealing how faith and digital interaction jointly shape purchase decisions in the modest fashion industry.

                Background South Africa continues to underperform in primary mathematics, with persistent foundational gaps across content and cognitive domains. This study examines domain-specific patterns of mathematics achievement using data from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2023, benchmarking South African Grade 5 learners against Singaporean Grade 4 learners. Methods A quantitative secondary analysis was conducted using nationally representative TIMSS 2023 datasets comprising 10,424 South African learners from 285 schools and 6,530 Singaporean learners from 181 schools. In TIMSS 2023, South Africa assessed learners in Grade 5 using the internationally standardised TIMSS Grade 4 mathematics assessment framework, a practice adopted within TIMSS where curriculum exposure aligns more closely with this level. Singapore assessed learners at Grade 4 using the same instruments. Mathematics achievement was analysed across content domains (number, measurement and geometry, and data) and cognitive domains (knowing, applying, and reasoning). Weighted estimates, mean differences, and effect sizes (Cohen’s d) were computed in line with IEA guidelines. Results South African learners performed well below the international centre point across all domains. The largest content-level gap relative to Singapore occurred in measurement and geometry, indicating persistent weaknesses in spatial reasoning. At the cognitive level, the most pronounced deficit was in the knowing domain, reflecting fragile mastery of basic facts and procedural fluency. Although performance in applying was comparatively stronger, limitations in foundational knowledge constrained progression to reasoning, particularly in non-routine problem-solving. Conclusions Weak foundations, underdeveloped spatial reasoning, and limited opportunities for higher-order thinking characterise early mathematics learning in South Africa. Targeted support for number fluency and geometry instruction, alongside pedagogical approaches that leverage application to scaffold reasoning, is required. Improved alignment between curriculum design, teacher development, and assessment practices is essential for advancing equitable foundational learning outcomes.

                He et al. show that the TCA cycle metabolite α-ketoglutarate positively regulates Hippo signaling by promoting PH4αEFB-mediated prolyl hydroxylation, ubiquitination, and subsequent degradation of the Yki/YAP effector. Genetic mutation of three hydroxylation sites of Yki leads to tissue overgrowth in Drosophila.

                A light-triggered “macrophage bomb” is designed to undergo controlled pyroptosis within tumors, rupturing to release therapeutic bacteria. This release, together with endogenous inflammatory signals, drives an in situ biphasic antitumor therapy.

                Benfey et al. find that norepinephrine shifts the visual response selectivity of optic tectal neurons in the Xenopus tadpole to favor threatening loom stimuli over more neutral, randomly drifting dots. Mechanistically, norepinephrine induces radial astrocyte activation and glial release of ATP/adenosine, resulting in reduced excitatory neurotransmission and selectivity shift.

                <p>Nature Communications, Published online: 28 January 2026; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-026-68466-5">doi:10.1038/s41467-026-68466-5</a></p>Beta-glucan is an inducer of trained immunity, an epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming of the innate immune cells conferring immunological memory. Here the authors show that glucan-induced trained immunity enhances response to a cancer vaccine platform in colorectal cancer models, by inducing epigenetic and metabolic rewiring of macrophages that promotes an NK-cDC1 axis boosting anti-tumor immunity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106975">Cryo-EM structure revealed a novel F-actin binding motif in a Legionella pneumophila lysine fatty acyltransferase</a></h4>

              
                <i>Legionella pneumophila</i> is an opportunistic bacterial pathogen that causes Legionnaires’ disease. To establish an intracellular niche conducive to replication, <i>L. pneumophila</i> translocates a diverse array of effector proteins that manipulate various host cellular processes, including the actin cytoskeleton. In a screen for effectors that alter actin dynamics, we identified a <i>Legionella</i> effector, Lfat1 (lpg1387), which colocalizes with the actin cytoskeleton in eukaryotic cells. Lfat1 specifically binds F-actin through a novel actin-binding domain (ABD). High-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) analysis revealed that this ABD forms a long α-helix hairpin, with its tip interacting with subdomains I and II of two adjacent actin molecules within the F-actin filament. Interestingly, while individual α-helices of the hairpin fail to bind F-actin, co-expression as separate fusion proteins restores binding activity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Lfat1 exhibits lysine fatty acyltransferase (KFAT) activity, targeting host small GTPases. These findings establish a foundation for studying the KFAT family of bacterial toxins and uncover a novel F-actin-binding motif, providing an alternative F-actin marker with notable flexibility.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104748">Global risk mapping of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 and H5Nx in the light of epidemic episodes occurring from 2020 onwards</a></h4>

              
                Avian influenza (AI) is a highly contagious viral disease affecting poultry and wild water birds, posing significant global challenges due to its high mortality rates and economic impacts. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreaks, particularly those caused by H5N1 and its variants, have surged since 1959. The HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b viruses have notably expanded their geographical reach, affecting numerous countries, diverse avian species, and now mammals. Using an ecological niche modelling approach, this study aims to elucidate the environmental factors associated with increased HPAI H5 cases since 2020, investigate potential shifts in ecological niches, and predict new areas suitable for viral circulation. We developed ecological niche models for HPAI cases in wild and domestic birds across two distinct periods: 2015–2020 and 2020–2022. Key environmental predictors include chicken and duck population density, human density, distance to water bodies, and land cover variables. Post-2020, we observe increased relative influence of predictors such as intensive chicken population density and cultivated vegetation. Risk maps reveal notable ecological suitability for HPAI H5 circulation in Europe, Asia, and the Americas, with significant expansions of at-risk areas post-2020. Wild bird H5 occurrences appear primarily correlated with urban areas and open water regions. Our analyses also highlight a potential shift in affected wild bird species diversity, with more avian species, particularly sea birds, impacted post-2020. Overall, these results further contribute to the understanding of HPAI epidemiology and identify regions where surveillance and control measures should be prioritised.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/108335">Allosteric effects of the coupling cation in melibiose transporter MelB</a></h4>

              
                The major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporters play significant roles in human health and disease. <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium melibiose permease (MelB<sub>St</sub>) catalyzes the symport of galactosides with Na<sup>+</sup>, H<sup>+</sup>, or Li<sup>+</sup> and is a prototype of MFS transporters. We published the structures of MelB<sub>St</sub> in both inward- and outward-facing conformations, bound to galactoside or Na<sup>+</sup>, and proposed that positive cooperativity of the co-transported solutes is crucial for the symport mechanism. Here, we elucidated the underlying mechanisms by analyzing MelB<sub>St</sub> dynamics and the effects of melibiose, Na<sup>+</sup>, or both using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS). We also refined the determinants of sugar recognition by solving the crystal structures of a uniporter D59C MelB<sub>St</sub> complexed with melibiose and other sugars, and by identifying a critical water molecule involved in sugar recognition. Our integrated studies, combining structures, HDX-MS, and molecular dynamics simulations, support the conclusion that sugar-binding affinity is directly correlated with protein dynamics. Na<sup>+</sup> acts as an allosteric activator, reducing the flexibility of dynamic residues in the sugar-binding site and in the cytoplasmic gating salt-bridge network, thereby increasing sugar-binding affinity. This study provides a molecular-level framework of the symport mechanism that could serve as a general model for cation-coupled symporters.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/108176">Executive resources shape the impact of language predictability across the adult lifespan</a></h4>

              
                Humans routinely anticipate upcoming language, but whether such predictions come at a cognitive cost remains debated. In this study, we demonstrate the resource-dependent nature of predictive mechanisms in language comprehension across the lifespan: Experimentally limiting executive resources through a concurrent task reduces the effect of language predictability on reading time. Participants (<i>N</i> = 175, replication <i>N</i> = 96) read short articles presented word-by-word while completing a secondary font colour <i>n</i>-back task, thus varying cognitive demand. Language predictability was indexed by word surprisal as derived from a pre-trained large language model (GPT-2). Across two independent samples, our findings reveal that language predictions are not cost-free: They draw on executive control resources, and this dependency becomes more pronounced with age (18–85 years). These results help resolve the debate over cognitive demands in language comprehension and highlight prediction as a dynamic, resource-dependent process across the lifespan.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102634">Mast cells promote pathology and susceptibility in tuberculosis</a></h4>

              
                Tuberculosis (TB), caused by the bacterium <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (<i>Mtb</i>), infects approximately one-fourth of the world’s population. We reported an increased accumulation of mast cells (MCs) in the lungs of macaques with active pulmonary TB (PTB), compared with those with latent TB infection (LTBI). MCs respond in vitro to <i>Mtb</i> exposure via degranulation and by inducing proinflammatory cytokines. In the current study, we demonstrate an increased production of chymase by MCs in granulomas of humans and macaques with PTB. Single-cell (sc) RNA sequencing analysis revealed distinct MC transcriptional programs between LTBI and PTB, with PTB-associated MCs enriched in interferon gamma, oxidative phosphorylation, and MYC signaling. In a mouse model, MC deficiency led to improved control of <i>Mtb</i> infection that coincided with reduced accumulation of lung myeloid cells and diminished lung inflammation at chronic stages of infection. Airway transfer of MCs into wild-type <i>Mtb</i>-infected mice showed increased neutrophils, decreased recruited macrophages, and elevated <i>Mtb</i> dissemination to the spleen. Together, these findings highlight MCs as active drivers of TB pathogenesis and potential targets for host-directed therapies for TB.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/108438">Identifying regulators of associative learning using a protein-labelling approach in Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                The ability to learn and form memories is critical for animals to make choices that promote their survival. The biological processes underlying learning and memory are mediated by a variety of genes in the nervous system, acting at specific times during memory encoding, consolidation, and retrieval. Many studies have utilised candidate gene approaches or random mutagenesis screens in model animals to explore the key molecular drivers for learning and memory. We propose a complementary approach to identify this network of learning regulators: the proximity-labelling tool TurboID, which promiscuously biotinylates neighbouring proteins, to snapshot the proteomic profile of neurons during learning. To do this, we expressed the TurboID enzyme in the entire nervous system of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> and exposed animals to biotin only during the training step of an appetitive gustatory learning paradigm. Our approach revealed hundreds of proteins specific to ‘trained’ worms, including components of molecular pathways previously implicated in memory in multiple species such as insulin signalling, G-protein-coupled receptor signalling, and MAP kinase signalling. Most (87–95%) of the proteins identified are neuronal, with relatively high representation for neuron classes involved in locomotion and learning. We validated several novel regulators of learning, including cholinergic receptors (ACC-1, ACC-3, LGC-46) and putative arginine kinase F46H5.3. These previously uncharacterised learning regulators all showed a clear impact on appetitive gustatory learning, with F46H5.3 showing an additional effect on aversive gustatory memory. Overall, we show that proximity labelling can be used in the brain of a small animal as a feasible and effective method to advance our knowledge on the biology of learning.

">Mechanisms of disrupted neurodevelopment after Zika virus infection in infancy</a></h4>

              
                Congenital and early-life Zika virus (ZIKV) infection can result in neurologic deficits. Precise mechanisms of injury, especially in the more subtle presentation of postnatal infection, are not fully elucidated. Here, we defined the effects of ZIKV on the developing brain using single cell transcriptomics, histopathology and design-based stereology, diffusion MRI, and neurobehavioral assessments in infant rhesus macaques. ZIKV upregulated interferon-stimulated genes in activated microglia and cell death pathways in neurons and downregulated metabolism and differentiation genes in mature oligodendrocytes. Abnormal micro-organization of the corpus collosum and limbic white matter tracts was seen on diffusion weighted imaging. A curated gene set associated with autism spectrum disorder risk was negatively enriched in inhibitory and excitatory neurons from ZIKV-infected infants, with increased emotional reactivity already evident two weeks following infection. From single cells to organism-level behaviors, these results define the pathways and processes disrupted by early-life ZIKV infection.

">Semantic axes in the brain support analogical representations</a></h4>

              
                In vectorial embeddings of word meaning, semantic features often reflect consistent directions, or axes, within a representational space. A classic example is gender: the vector spanning boy to girl can be added to the embedding for king to predict queen. Here we show that the same principle governs semantically driven neural responses in the human brain. We recorded single-neuron activity in three brain regions while participants listened to podcasts. Across fifteen analogical categories, including gender, number, and antonymy, we observed consistent vectorial directions, resulting in parallelogram structure within the neural manifold. Among pronouns, vectors corresponding to grammatical case, number, person, and possession obeyed the principle of commutativity, resulting in a prismatic structure, demonstrating that semantic axes can be factorized. We found parallelogram structure in all three regions, with some regional specialization: noun pluralization was more robust in the hippocampus than in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) or orbitofrontal cortex, whereas verbal conjugation effects were more robust in the ACC. Finally, we found evidence for partial functional specialization at the neuron level: neurons most strongly involved in one analogy type were less involved in others. These principles parallel representational structure observed in large language models. Together, these findings support a geometric basis for analogical reasoning.

">Subthreshold Kir and Ih currents modulate excitability of Layer 1 VIP interneurons in the medial prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Cortical layer 1 (L1) is a key site for integrating top-down and bottom-up information and is populated by inhibitory interneurons, including vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing cells. These interneurons regulate information flow across the cortical column by disinhibiting pyramidal neurons, yet the subthreshold ionic mechanisms that shape their excitability in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) remain poorly understood. Here, we characterize the electrophysiological properties of L1b VIP interneurons in mouse mPFC, focusing on the role of the hyperpolarization-activated cation current (Ih) and inward-rectifying potassium current (Kir). Using whole-cell recordings in acute slices, we find that L1b VIP interneurons exhibit constitutively active Ih and Kir conductances. Inhibition of Ih with ZD-7288 hyperpolarized the resting membrane potential (RMP), increased input resistance (Rin), and prolonged action potential (AP) duration without altering rheobase or firing frequency, while increasing EPSP-spike coupling probability. Blocking Kir with BaCl2 depolarized the RMP, increased Rin and membrane time constant, reduced rheobase, increased firing frequency, and similarly enhanced EPSP-spike probability and AP duration. Voltage-clamp experiments confirmed the presence of ZD-7288-sensitive Ih and BaCl2-sensitive Kir currents of small amplitude but operating on a high-resistance membrane, consistent with a strong impact on excitability. In contrast, neither Ih nor Kir inhibition affected the amplitude or frequency of spontaneous or miniature EPSCs, indicating that these currents do not measurably alter basal excitatory synaptic transmission. Immunofluorescence revealed weak somatic HCN1 and no detectable HCN2 expression in L1b VIP interneurons. Notably, Kir inhibition unmasked an Ih-dependent voltage sag during hyperpolarizing steps, suggesting that constitutive Kir activity normally masks Ih recruitment at subthreshold potentials. Together, these results indicate that Ih and Kir are active near RMP in L1b VIP interneurons and jointly regulate their passive properties, intrinsic excitability, and EPSP-spike coupling, therefore shaping how L1 VIP cells filter incoming signals and influence information flow within the prefrontal cortical column.

">A Key Regulator of Dendritic Morphology in Supragranular Neocortex Impacts Mismatch Negativity</a></h4>

              
                Background: Cytoskeletal structure and neuronal function are heavily intertwined, and altered pyramidal neuron morphology (e.g., reduced dendritic arbors) has been consistently identified in the neocortex of individuals with psychiatric disorders. A missense mutation in Kalrn (Kalrn-PT) enhances activation of RhoA, a cytoskeletal regulator, and leads to adolescent-onset dendritic regression in supragranular auditory cortex. To investigate the relationship between this spatiotemporally altered cytoskeletal structure and psychiatric-relevant dysfunction, we examine the functional impacts of this genetic mutation, focusing on mismatch negativity -- a common biomarker of altered sensory integration that matures across adolescence. Methods: In Kalrn-PT and littermate wild-type mice, pyramidal dendritic morphology was assessed across primary visual cortex (V1) layers using Golgi staining (n=172 neurons/26 mice). Local field potentials (LFPs) and neuronal spiking were recorded during a visual oddball sequence (n=25 mice). Deviance detection -- the rodent neural analogue of mismatch negativity -- was analyzed across V1 layers. Results: Kalrn-PT mice exhibit reductions in V1 dendritic length specific to layer 2/3, mirroring observations in post-mortem samples from people with psychiatric disorders. Deviance detection was reduced in LFPs from Kalrn-PT mice and absent in layer 2/3 neurons, despite typical feature selectivity and firing rates. These deficits were accompanied by reduced functional connectivity between visual and frontal areas. Conclusions: These results highlight alterations in higher-level sensory cortical integration in Kalrn-PT mice and demonstrate that adolescent-onset, disease-relevant structural and functional phenotypes can be linked by a common upstream effector. Further, these alterations appear restricted to supragranular layers, demonstrating an outsized role for Kalrn, particularly longer isoforms, in superficial neocortex.

">Intuitive knowledge of object acoustics enables perceptual separation of physical variables from impact sounds</a></h4>

              
                Upon hearing objects collide, humans can estimate physical attributes such as material and mass. Although the physics of sound generation is well established, the inverse problem that listeners solve - of inferring physical parameters from sound - remains poorly understood. Classical accounts posit the use of acoustic cues that correlate with physical variables, but do not explain how humans might distinguish multiple concurrent physical causes. To study this problem, we built a probabilistic generative model of impact sounds, combining theoretical acoustics with statistics of object resonances measured from hundreds of everyday objects, and used it to synthesize and manipulate experimental stimuli. Humans accurately judged object properties from collision sounds. However, when both of the colliding objects varied, performance was impaired if the distribution of object resonances deviated from those measured in real-world objects. The results suggest that listeners use internal physical models to separate the acoustic contributions of objects in the world.

">Flexible perception of face attributes under naturalistic visual constraints</a></h4>

              
                How does human brain adapt face perception to naturalistic visual constraints? While faces are typically perceived under dynamic and uncertain conditions, most studies use static presentation and enough temporal exposure, leaving the neural mechanisms of adaptive face processing poorly understood. Here, we employed steady-state evoked potential electroencephalography (EEG) to track how perception of multiple face attributes (age, emotion, gender, and race) adjusts to two ecologically relevant scenarios: (1) faces gradually sharpening from blur to clear (mimicking approaching from a distance), and (2) faces presented with incrementally increasing exposure times (mimicking brief, flashed encounters). By progressively increasing sensory input (via spatial frequency content in Experiment 1 and exposure time in Experiment 2) in a stepwise manner, we show that emotion and race categorization emerge early, even under high blur (e.g., 4.89 cycles/image) or brief exposures (e.g., 41.7-50 ms), reflecting coarse visual processing. In contrast, age discrimination requires higher clarity (e.g., 7.31 cycles/image) but shorter exposure (e.g., 41.7 ms) if clear images are presented. In both scenarios, gender processing exhibits the strongest dependence on clarity (e.g., 10.94 cycles/image) and time (e.g., 66.7 ms). Representational similarity analyses further show that reliable response patterns for emotion and race emerge earlier in the posterior brain region relative to those for gender in both experiments. Together, these results identify a flexible temporal order for face perception that adapts to naturalistic visual constraints, bridging the gap between controlled laboratory paradigms and naturalistic social vision.

">Cell-Type Specific Molecular and Functional Consequences of TDP-43 Loss-of-Function in Human Induced Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the cytoplasmic aggregation and nuclear depletion of the TDP-43 protein. The latter impairs TDP-43 function as an RNA-binding protein and compromises the repression of cryptic splicing events, affecting both glutamatergic upper motor neurons and cholinergic lower motor neurons. This study systematically investigated the molecular and functional consequences of TDP-43 knockdown in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived glutamatergic neurons (iGNs) and cholinergic motor neurons (iMNs) using antisense oligonucleotides. The results demonstrated that TDP-43 loss elicits widespread, cell-type-specific changes in gene expression and alternative splicing. Notably, a shared subset of ALS-associated targets, including STMN2 and UNC13A, were consistently downregulated and mis-spliced across both neuronal subtypes. Functionally, Microelectrode Array (MEA) electrophysiology recordings revealed that TDP-43 knockdown induces a hyperexcitable phenotype in both neuronal populations, though they exhibited distinct network patterns: iGNs displayed synchronized bursting and significant shifts in overall electrophysiological profiles, while iMNs showed asynchronous firing. Furthermore, the inclusion of astrocytes in co-culture models expanded the repertoire of detectable cryptic splicing, including an event in HDGFL2 previously identified in patient cerebrospinal fluid. Despite these profound molecular and functional deficits, TDP-43 depletion did not impact neuronal viability or increase susceptibility to glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. These findings validate hiPSC-derived iGNs and iMNs as relevant models for ALS and highlight the critical necessity of considering cell-type specificity when elucidating pathogenesis and developing targeted therapies.

">Protein folding stress shapes microglial phenotype in progressive supranuclear palsy</a></h4>

              
                Microglia play a pivotal role in neurodegeneration, yet their response to tau pathology remains incompletely understood. Through single-nucleus RNA sequencing of Amyloid beta plaque-free frontal cortex from 4R tauopathy progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) brains, we reveal a distinct transcriptional reprogramming of homeostatic microglia. PSP microglia exhibit pronounced protein-folding and ER-stress signatures, elevated homeostatic and MHC class II gene expression, and attenuated cytoskeletal, motility, and interferon-related programs, accompanied by reduced inferred intercellular communication. Neuropathological analysis corroborates a shift toward highly ramified morphologies and increased MHC class II positivity in PSP cortex. In HMC3 cells, pharmacological induction of protein-folding stress recapitulates this phenotype, driving homeostatic gene upregulation and morphological transition to process-bearing forms. We define this protein-folding-stress-associated microglial (PSAM) state as a PSP-linked phenotype mechanistically distinct from disease-associated microglia (DAM), highlighting ER stress as a key driver of microglial remodeling in tauopathies.

">Task-Dependent Effects of Channel Density on Multivariate Pattern Analysis and Spatial Representational Similarity Analysis: Evidence from Three EEG Datasets</a></h4>

              
                Despite the widespread use of EEG decoding and representational similarity analysis (RSA), the extent of the impact of electrode density on these multivariate approaches has not been systematically evaluated, particularly across different cognitive domains. Here, we systematically compared four electrode configurations (19, 32, 64, and 128 channels) across three EEG datasets encompassing visual perception, visual search, and emotional processing. All datasets were recorded at 128 channels and subsequently reduced to 64, 32, and 19 channels via electrode subset selection based on the international 10-20 system. Time-resolved decoding and spatial RSA were computed for each configuration with paired statistical evaluation. Decoding sensitivity demonstrated clear task dependence: in the color-harmony paradigm, performance improved markedly with higher densities, consistent with spatially distributed perceptual representations, whereas decoding in the icon-search and dot-probe tasks remained stable across densities, indicating diminishing returns of additional electrodes although all configuration yielded robust decoding accuracies that above chance level. RSA results were comparatively robust, with relative representational similarity structures largely preserved even for 16 channel counts. These findings demonstrate that low-density setups can be sufficient, offering practical guidance for EEG channel selection and supporting the use of low-density EEG in real-world applications, including wearable systems, mobile EEG recordings, and clinical or rehabilitation settings.

">Large-Scale Control of Neuronal Networks In Vitro Using Perforated Microfluidic Devices</a></h4>

              
                Neurons in the brain are organized and connected into complex networks in which electrochemical signaling forms the basis for all brain function. Cortical neuronal networks are arranged in distinct modular, layered, and hierarchical structures, underlying its diverse functions such as learning, memory, or vision. Modern biotechnology has enabled an array of techniques to culture human neural cells, ranging from discreet co-cultures to complex developmental organoids, but all of which almost exclusively form unstructured and hypersynchronous networks. Overcoming this and capturing the functional and anatomical properties of the brain textit{in vitro} has proven to be a great challenge. Current techniques for guiding neuronal connectivity textit{in vitro} is often limited to a small fraction of the total population of neural cells, leaving most of the culture effectively unguided. To provide large-scale guidance of neurons in culture, we developed a microtunnel device which allows large-scale cell entry through an array of perforations, and guides neuronal network formation through a series of tunnels. Human neural stem cells capable of forming extensive neuronal projections were used to investigate several different microtunnel designs. One particularity noteworthy design which produced predominantly unidirectional growth was used to successfully validate its effect on propagation of neural activity on microelectrode arrays. Serendipitously, we found that our microtunnels had an extraordinary effect on signal-to-noise ratio and the quality of electrophysiological recordings with regards to number of active channels and detected spikes. Since we often found the neuronal growth surprising, we developed a simple computer model which could reproduce neuronal growth in the various tunnels, allowing computer aided design (CAD) of future projects.

">Sparse input representations explain odor discrimination in complex, concentration-varying mixtures</a></h4>

              
                In natural environments, animals must detect behaviorally relevant odors despite variability in both odor mixture composition and stimulus intensity. Although mice can identify salient odors embedded in complex mixtures, how target concentration and background complexity jointly constrain discrimination remains unclear. We trained mice in a two-alternative forced choice task to identify target odors embedded in mixtures containing up to 16 background components. After performance stabilized, we systematically varied target odor concentration. Discrimination accuracy declined with decreasing target concentration but showed little additional dependence on background complexity. Using a biophysically grounded model of olfactory bulb glomerular responses, we show that linear decoding reproduces behavioral performance when intrinsic neural noise dominates over background-driven variability. Manifold capacity analysis revealed that neural representations remain efficiently structured for odor discrimination despite variation in background complexity. These results define a noise-limited regime of olfactory discrimination in which target detectability is primarily constrained by neural sensitivity rather than background interference.

This fills a critical gap between whole-brain MRI at 100-micron resolution and serial-section histological reconstructions at 20 microns or finer.

We provide open-source workflows for online data exploration, subvolume download, segmentation, and reintegration of analyses into the full dataset. We demonstrate the potential of this resource by tracing vasculature over long distances, segmenting nuclei, and extracting white-matter orientations with 3D structure-tensor analysis. High-resolution human brain datasets are transformative for quantitative neuroanatomy, circuit mapping, and validation of clinical imaging; this openly available resource is a critical step for global access to next-generation multiscale brain imaging.

">Spatial memory performance is associated with region-specific coordination of hippocampo-cortical sleep oscillations</a></h4>

              
                Sleep plays a critical role in memory consolidation, yet how coordination among sleep oscillations across hippocampo-cortical circuits relates to behavioral performance remains incompletely understood. Here, we examined how cross-regional coordination of cardinal sleep oscillations during non-rapid eye movement (nREM) sleep relates to spatial memory performance. Adult rats were trained in an object-place recognition task and allowed to sleep while local field potentials were recorded simultaneously from dorsal and ventral hippocampus (CA1d and CA1v) and retrosplenial, prefrontal, and lateral entorhinal cortices. We first confirm that nREM sleep duration, but not REM sleep, is positively associated with spatial memory performance. We then characterized the temporal relationships between hippocampal sharp-wave ripples and cortical spindles and slow oscillations, revealing region- and oscillation-specific coordination patterns that depend on the dorso-ventral origin of hippocampal ripple events. Finally, by comparing task-related changes in ripple-triggered cortical activity between low- and high-performing sessions, we identify selective, performance-dependent modulation of hippocampo-cortical coupling during task-related sleep. Spatial memory performance was consistently associated with enhanced ripple-spindle and ripple-slow oscillation coupling driven by dorsal hippocampal ripples, particularly in interactions with entorhinal and prefrontal cortices, whereas ventral hippocampal interactions failed to show behavioural association. Together, these results reveal that spatial memory performance is linked to region- and timing-specific coordination of sleep oscillations across hippocampo-cortical networks during nREM sleep, highlighting a functional differentiation of dorsal and ventral hippocampal contributions to sleep-dependent memory consolidation.

">Tunable Tau Expression in C. elegans Neurons Reveals that Early-AD Tau Phosphorylation Selectively Impacts Behavior and Mitochondrial Quality Control</a></h4>

              
                Tau protein accumulates myriad post-translational modifications as Alzheimer's disease (AD) progresses, and early-disease tau modifications such as phosphorylation at threonine 231 (T231) likely play a key role in AD pathogenesis. Here, a series of "tunable tau" strains was developed in C. elegans to test the relative impact of tau pseudo-phosphorylation of T231 (T231E) compared to protein expression level as a driver of phenotypic penetrance and severity. Multiple copies of a cassette coding for pan-neuronal wildtype tau or T231E were inserted at a genomic safe harbor loci to create a repertoire of strains expressing tau from low to high levels. In stereotypical behavioral assays of locomotory activity, T231E selectively impacted phenotypic severity compared to wild-type human tau controls, which further tracked with age and tau expression level. However, deficits in associative memory were non-selective between tau and T231E. Moreover, genetic, pharmacologic, and molecular approaches indicated that mitophagy modulation could suppress T231E phenotypes. Additionally, a robust mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) occurred in T231E, and loss of atfs-1, a transcription factor central to the UPRmt suppressed T231E toxicity. These results demonstrate that phenotypic severity is invariably associated with tau dosage, while early-AD relevant modifications can be causative drivers of selective deficits. Consistent with recent findings, enhancing mitophagy or suppressing potentially maladaptive consequences of persistent UPRmt induction can be beneficial. This provides a solid foundation for further interrogation into mitochondrial quality control disruption as a potential root cause for AD pathogenesis.

">Spatial transcriptomics reveals brain-wide circadian disruption in an Alzheimer's disease model</a></h4>

              
                Diurnal rhythms in brain transcription align neural, immune, and metabolic processes with the light-dark cycle and are profoundly disrupted in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the regional organization of diurnal transcription in the healthy and diseased brain remains poorly defined. Using large-scale spatial transcriptomics, we mapped 24-hour rhythmic transcription across cortical and subcortical regions of the mouse brain. We identified marked regional differences in rhythmicity, including distinct oscillatory signatures across cortical areas and along the rostro-caudal axis. In the APP23 mouse model of AD, pathology-vulnerable brain regions exhibited early, region-specific disruption of diurnal transcription prior to substantial amyloid plaque deposition. These findings reveal a spatially organized architecture of brain diurnal rhythms and identify early rhythmic dysregulation as a feature of Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.

">Peripheral phoneme encoding and discrimination in aging and hearing impairment</a></h4>

              
                Speech perception difficulties in noise are common among older adults and individuals with hearing impairment, even when audiometric thresholds appear normal. We examined how aging, cochlear synaptopathy (CS), and outer hair cell (OHC) damage affect speech encoding and phoneme discrimination. Envelope-following responses (EFRs) to rectangular amplitude-modulated (RAM) tones and speech-like phoneme pairs were recorded in quiet using EEG, and behavioral discrimination was assessed in quiet, ipsilateral, and contralateral noise. Stimuli were designed to target temporal envelope (TENV) or temporal fine structure (TFS) encoding. Results showed that RAM-EFR amplitudes decreased gradually with age, consistent with emerging CS, while magnitudes of high-frequency TENV-based EFRs in quiet were most reduced in older hearing-impaired listeners with combined CS and OHC damage. In contrast, EFRs targeting low-frequency TENV encoding in quiet remained preserved. Behaviorally, phoneme discrimination of TFS contrasts worsened with OHC loss and age in quiet and contralateral noise, respectively, while there was no significant effect of age on the discrimination of TENV contrasts. Considering that high-frequency contrasts are discriminated via place-based spectral cues, low-frequency contrasts rely on TFS, and the EFR reflects primarily TENV, this framework explains why EFRs decline for high-frequency cues without perceptual loss, while EFRs remain stable for low-frequency cues even as TFS-based discrimination deteriorates. These findings highlight the need for further investigation into how neural coding deficits relate to perceptual outcomes. Combining electrophysiological and behavioral measures might provide a sensitive framework for detecting subclinical auditory deficits to earlier diagnose age-related and hidden hearing loss.

">Personalized smartphone notifications bias auditory salience across processing stages</a></h4>

              
                Modern digital environments expose the brain to a dense stream of personally meaningful cues that differ markedly from the conditions under which sensory systems evolved. Understanding how the brain responds and adapts to such environments is increasingly relevant for cognitive and mental well-being. In this study, we used auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) recorded during a task-irrelevant auditory oddball paradigm to obtain a time-resolved account of neural responses to smartphone notifications. We dissociated the effects of generic notification sounds from the learning-related effects of personalized notification sounds, and examined how these responses varied across levels of smartphone use. Among early stages of processing, generic tones exhibited experience-dependent strengthening of auditory representations, whereas personalized tones engaged stable, pre-learned representations, as reflected in P2 dynamics. The strongest stimulus-dependent modulation was observed in pre-attentive salience detection, reflected in the mismatch negativity (MMN), which was earlier and larger for personalized tones compared to generic ones. At later stages, attentional orienting and extended evaluative processing showed distinct patterns that were differentially sensitive to stimulus identity and smartphone use. Notably, smartphone usage levels modulated later attentional and evaluative stages (P3a and LPP) without altering early pre-attentive prediction-error signaling. Overall, our findings demonstrate that personalized smartphone notifications do not uniformly increase neural distraction. Instead, they engage robust and rapid pre-attentive prediction-error signaling that is largely independent of usage, while habitual smartphone use selectively shapes later attentional orienting and evaluative dynamics.

">Endothelin 2-Mediated Neuroinflammation Drives Hypertension-Associated Retinal Dysfunction</a></h4>

              
                Systemic hypertension is a significant risk factor for glaucoma, a leading cause of irreversible blindness, yet the mechanistic basis connecting the two conditions remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that hypertensive rats develop accelerated retinal degeneration characterized by retinal thinning, functional impairment, reduced perfusion, and progressive neuroinflammation. Critically, these changes occur despite persistently lower intraocular pressure (IOP), indicating an IOP-independent mechanism of pathology. Transcriptomic and biochemical analyses identified a robust activation of the retinal endothelin system, with endothelin-2 (EDN2) being the earliest and most significantly upregulated component. AAV-delivered retinal Edn2 knockdown completely restored retinal function, ameliorated neuroinflammation, and enhanced retinal blood flow in hypertensive rats. Pharmacological blockade of endothelin receptor type A (EDNRA), but not type B, replicated these protective effects without altering IOP. Our findings establish EDN2 as a central, IOP-independent driver of hypertension-associated retinal neurodegeneration and identify the endothelin-EDNRA axis as a potential therapeutic target to prevent vision loss in hypertensive patients.

">A multi-input optic glomerulus mediates opposing behavioral responses to visual objects</a></h4>

              
                Prey, predators or conspecifics are first detected as visual objects in seeing animals. Vision guides behavioral actions towards or away from these objects. An error in this visual perception could prove fatal. How object information is untangled to avoid errors remains unclear. Here we show that LC10d visual projection neurons in Drosophila melanogaster mediate avoidance of visual objects devoid of a chemosensory profile. LC10d neurons are broadly tuned to objects and project to same retinorecipient brain region that receives inputs from LC10a neurons, which are required for tracking. The descending neurons DNa10 are directly downstream of the anterior-looking LC10d sub-population and mediate LC10d-dependent avoidance. Our work demonstrates the use of two similar neuron types and chunking of the visual field as strategies to disentangle similar sets of visual cues. Discrete objects are avoided until chemosensory information is gathered to enable decision making on whether to engage in social interactions or rather to avoid them.

">Calcium-binding protein expression alone is insufficient to identify and classify GABAergic neurons in macaque cortex</a></h4>

              
                Understanding neuron subclasses and their functional consequences can contribute to understanding brain circuits. A scheme long used to classify GABAergic neurons in the neocortex is based on expression of three calcium-binding proteins (CBPs): parvalbumin (PV), calbindin D-28K (CB), and calretinin (CR). Because CB and CR are frequently co-expressed by individual neurons in rodents, this scheme has been replaced by one based on PV and two signaling peptides: somatostatin (SST) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). In macaques, however, CBPs are generally not co-expressed, and so their use has persisted despite suggestions that the underlying populations are not, in fact, entirely GABAergic. We set out to quantitatively evaluate CBPs as a classification scheme for GABAergic neurons in early and mid-level visual regions in macaque cortex. Combining immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, we find that up to half of neurons expressing CBPs are likely not GABAergic. Furthermore, contrary to what has been previously suggested, the GABAergic subpopulations cannot be distinguished based on staining intensity. Thus, the CBP-based classification scheme is not valid, at least as it has traditionally been used. Instead, we find support for co-labeling CB and CR neurons with SST and VIP, an approach that can identify GABAergic subpopulations within the CBP classes; or simply adopting the PV/SST/VIP scheme. We discuss the functional implications of expressing these various cell type markers, and how consideration of marker functions can support proper selection of a classification scheme for a given experimental purpose.

">First In Vivo Demonstration of Nose-to-Brain Drug Delivery of Memantine Using NosaPlugs Nasal Inserts</a></h4>

              
                Treatment of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease remains a challenge due to ineffective drug delivery to the brain. In recent years, intranasal administration has emerged as a promising non-invasive approach for nose-to-brain delivery. Compared to other routes of administration, nose-to-brain delivery provides a possibility of bypassing both the blood-brain-barrier and the first-pass metabolism in the liver, allowing for a decrease in the delivered dose and thereby a reduced risk of systemic side-effects. While the most common nasal devices, spray pumps, ensure a wide distribution in the nasal cavity and a fast onset of action, a slower release and increased retention time is desired for treatment of many neurological disorders. In this study, we tested the feasibility of a novel nasal insert, NosaPlugs, for prolonged release and delivery of memantine. Using an in vitro anatomically realistic nasal model, we demonstrated cumulative release of memantine from the nasal inserts up to eight hours. Additionally, the therapeutic substance was distributed to all parts of the nasal cavity, with higher amounts accumulating in the middle part. In vivo, an acute dose of memantine in the gas phase released from the nasal device reached pharmacologically relevant levels in both plasma and the brains of the mice. Future research should investigate the release and delivery of alternative substances interesting for brain diseases, and larger animal models are required to determine the efficacy of nose-to-brain delivery using NosaPlugs nasal inserts. Importantly, our study provides the first proof-of-concept that NosaPlugs can serve as an effective intranasal device for targeted drug delivery to the brain.

">Parental state dynamically reshapes auditory processing of offspring vocalizations in zebra finches</a></h4>

              
                Parental care is critical for offspring survival. For many species, including humans, auditory cues unique to dependent offspring, such as baby cries, elicit the necessary behavior from parents to care for young. Despite this, we know little about how the brain encodes auditory cues specific to offspring. Zebra finches are an excellent model to study this. Zebra finches are biparental, meaning both male and female parents raise the young and rely on auditory cues (begging calls) to elicit chick feeding responses (parental behavior). Begging calls also become individually identifiable by the parents, necessitating higher-order learning/ association neural processes. It is well established that the caudomedial nidopallium (NCM), a higher-order region of secondary pallial cortex (analogous to the mammalian secondary auditory cortex), is involved in the perception of complex auditory signals in birds. It is unknown, however, if/how NCM responds to offspring begging calls. To begin testing this, we used high density silicon probes to record single-unit in vivo electrophysiology activity in the NCM of adult parenting and non-parenting zebra finches exposed to playbacks of their own chicks begging calls (parents only), novel age-matched begging calls (parents and non-parents), as well as novel adult male song and pure tone controls. Our results show that NCM neurons in parents respond more strongly (i.e., higher evoked firing rates) to both their own and novel chick begging calls and have higher baseline (spontaneous) firing rates in narrow spiking units relative to non-parents. Furthermore, NCM neurons in parenting females tend to show more selective responses towards their own chick begging calls, whereas those in males do not show similar levels of selectivity. These studies lay essential groundwork for future studies on how auditory responses can elicit parental behavior and how these responses may change over the chick-rearing period.

">Reduced Pupil-Linked Arousal Marks Implicit Memory for Complex Auditory Sequences</a></h4>

              
                Observers rapidly form long-lasting implicit memories for recurring sensory patterns, supporting adaptive behaviour through learning of environmental contingencies. Here we tested how such memories interact with neuromodulatory systems that regulate arousal - whether implicit familiarity increases arousal through retrieval-related processes or instead decreases arousal via more efficient sensory processing. We examined these competing accounts using complex auditory tone-pip sequences in which a subset of patterns recurred approximately every three minutes. One group of participants (N=30) actively detected transitions from random to regular structure, whereas a second group (N=40) heard the same sequences while performing a decoy task. Consistent with prior work, recurring regular sequences elicited faster reaction times in the active group, confirming the formation of implicit memory. Subsequently, both groups listened to previously encountered regular patterns (REGr) and matched novel regular patterns (REGn) while pupil diameter was recorded. Across groups, REGr sequences evoked significantly smaller pupil dilations than REGn sequences, indicating attenuated arousal for familiar patterns. This reduction was sustained until sequence offset in the active group but was transient in the exposure group, suggesting that task demands during exposure shape the stability of pupil-linked memory expression. Importantly, the REGr-REGn pupil difference did not correlate with explicit post-session recognition, demonstrating that the effect was not driven by conscious awareness. Together, these findings identify pupil dynamics as a robust physiological marker of learned auditory structure and show that implicit auditory sequence memory attenuates arousal. The results support predictive processing accounts in which familiarity reduces uncertainty and, consequently, neuromodulatory drive.

">Heterogeneity in neural network engagement supports individual differences in top-down attention</a></h4>

              
                Top-down attention enables selective prioritisation of goal-relevant information, yet how attentional control varies across individuals remains unclear, particularly in relation to sensory processing. Here, we combined magnetoencephalography (MEG) and pupillometry--in older adults performing a spatial cueing task--to examine both shared and subject-specific aspects of top-down attention. Informative spatial cues elicited sustained activity in fronto-parietal and sensory regions, alpha lateralisation, and increased pupil dilation, replicating established neural and physiological markers. Crucially, these group-level patterns were accompanied by systematic intersubject variability: individuals with greater hearing loss showed increased preparatory engagement of precentral and postcentral gyri, and variation in pupil dilation predicted activity in frontal regions. These results reveal that top-down attention arises from heterogeneous network configurations shaped by sensory processing and strategic resource allocation. Overall, our findings underscore the need to move beyond group averages to capture the neural architecture underlying individual differences in top-down attention.
