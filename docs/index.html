              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17897">Multimodal Recurrent Ensembles for Predicting Brain Responses to Naturalistic Movies (Algonauts 2025)</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.17897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately predicting distributed cortical responses to naturalistic stimuli requires models that integrate visual, auditory and semantic information over time. We present a hierarchical multimodal recurrent ensemble that maps pretrained video, audio, and language embeddings to fMRI time series recorded while four subjects watched almost 80 hours of movies provided by the Algonauts 2025 challenge. Modality-specific bidirectional RNNs encode temporal dynamics; their hidden states are fused and passed to a second recurrent layer, and lightweight subject-specific heads output responses for 1000 cortical parcels. Training relies on a composite MSE-correlation loss and a curriculum that gradually shifts emphasis from early sensory to late association regions. Averaging 100 model variants further boosts robustness. The resulting system ranked third on the competition leaderboard, achieving an overall Pearson r = 0.2094 and the highest single-parcel peak score (mean r = 0.63) among all participants, with particularly strong gains for the most challenging subject (Subject 5). The approach establishes a simple, extensible baseline for future multimodal brain-encoding benchmarks.

Abstract: The Algonauts 2025 Challenge called on the community to develop encoding models that predict whole-brain fMRI responses to naturalistic multimodal movies. In this submission, we propose a sequence-to-sequence Transformer that autoregressively predicts fMRI activity from visual, auditory, and language inputs. Stimulus features were extracted using pretrained models including VideoMAE, HuBERT, Qwen, and BridgeTower. The decoder integrates information from prior brain states, current stimuli, and episode-level summaries via dual cross-attention mechanisms that attend to both perceptual information extracted from the stimulus as well as narrative information provided by high-level summaries of narrative content. One core innovation of our approach is the use of sequences of multimodal context to predict sequences of brain activity, enabling the model to capture long-range temporal structure in both stimuli and neural responses. Another is the combination of a shared encoder with partial subject-specific decoder, which leverages common structure across subjects while accounting for individual variability. Our model achieves strong performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, demonstrating the effectiveness of temporally-aware, multimodal sequence modeling for brain activity prediction. The code is available at https://github.com/Angelneer926/Algonauts_challenge.

                arXiv:2507.18401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experience the world through multiple senses that work together to create a cohesive perception, whether in daily life or immersive technologies. Understanding this multisensory integration (MSI) requires examining the interactions between sensory modalities, each with unique temporal dynamics and characteristics. While most research focuses on unimodal or bimodal cues, the integration of three or more modalities remains underexplored. MSI studies must account for factors like cross-modal correspondence, congruence, cognitive load, and stimulus timing, which become increasingly complex as modalities multiply. This article examines these key factors and how they can be applied to 8 design effective MSI study protocols.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11783">EEG Foundation Models: A Critical Review of Current Progress and Future Directions</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.11783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Patterns of electrical brain activity recorded via electroencephalography (EEG) offer immense value for scientific and clinical investigations. The inability of supervised EEG encoders to learn robust EEG patterns and their over-reliance on expensive signal annotations have sparked a transition towards general-purpose self-supervised EEG encoders, i.e., EEG foundation models (EEG-FMs), for robust and scalable EEG feature extraction. However, the real-world readiness of early EEG-FMs and the rubric for long-term research progress remain unclear. A systematic and comprehensive review of first-generation EEG-FMs is therefore necessary to understand the current state-of-the-art and identify key directions for future EEG-FMs. To that end, this study reviews 10 early EEG-FMs and presents a critical synthesis of their methodology, empirical findings, and outstanding research gaps. We find that most EEG-FMs adopt a sequence-based modeling scheme that relies on transformer-based backbones and the reconstruction of masked sequences for self-supervision. However, model evaluations remain heterogeneous and largely limited, making it challenging to assess their practical off-the-shelf utility. In addition to adopting standardized and realistic evaluations, future work should demonstrate more substantial scaling effects and make principled and trustworthy choices throughout the EEG representation learning pipeline. We believe that developing benchmarks, software tools, technical methodologies, and applications in collaboration with domain experts may further advance the translational utility and real-world adoption of EEG-FMs.

                arXiv:2507.17886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing (NMC) is increasingly viewed as a low-power alternative to conventional von Neumann architectures such as central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs), however the computational value proposition has been difficult to define precisely.
  Here, we explain how NMC should be seen as general-purpose and programmable even though it differs considerably from a conventional stored-program architecture. We show that the time and space scaling of NMC is equivalent to that of a theoretically infinite processor conventional system, however the energy scaling is significantly different. Specifically, the energy of conventional systems scales with absolute algorithm work, whereas the energy of neuromorphic systems scales with the derivative of algorithm state. The unique characteristics of NMC architectures make it well suited for different classes of algorithms than conventional multi-core systems like GPUs that have been optimized for dense numerical applications such as linear algebra. In contrast, the unique characteristics of NMC make it ideally suited for scalable and sparse algorithms whose activity is proportional to an objective function, such as iterative optimization and large-scale sampling (e.g., Monte Carlo).

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18179">Explicit Sign-Magnitude Encoders Enable Power-Efficient Multipliers</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.18179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a method to maximize power-efficiency of fixed point multiplier units by decomposing them into sub-components. First, an encoder block converts the operands from a two's complement to a sign magnitude representation, followed by a multiplier module which performs the compute operation and outputs the resulting value in the original format. This allows to leverage the power-efficiency of the Sign Magnitude encoding for the multiplication. To ensure the computing format is not altered, those two components are synthesized and optimized separately. Our method leads to significant power savings for input values centered around zero, as commonly encountered in AI workloads. Under a realistic input stream with values normally distributed with a standard deviation of 3.0, post-synthesis simulations of the 4-bit multiplier design show up to 12.9% lower switching activity compared to synthesis without decomposition. Those gains are achieved while ensuring compliance into any production-ready system as the overall circuit stays logic-equivalent. With the compliance lifted and a slightly smaller input range of -7 to +7, switching activity reductions can reach up to 33%. Additionally, we demonstrate that synthesis optimization methods based on switching-activity-driven design space exploration can yield a further 5-10% improvement in power-efficiency compared to a power agnostic approach.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18467">Contraction, Criticality, and Capacity: A Dynamical-Systems Perspective on Echo-State Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.18467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Echo-State Networks (ESNs) distil a key neurobiological insight: richly recurrent but fixed circuitry combined with adaptive linear read-outs can transform temporal streams with remarkable efficiency. Yet fundamental questions about stability, memory and expressive power remain fragmented across disciplines. We present a unified, dynamical-systems treatment that weaves together functional analysis, random attractor theory and recent neuroscientific findings. First, on compact multivariate input alphabets we prove that the Echo-State Property (wash-out of initial conditions) together with global Lipschitz dynamics necessarily yields the Fading-Memory Property (geometric forgetting of remote inputs). Tight algebraic tests translate activation-specific Lipschitz constants into certified spectral-norm bounds, covering both saturating and rectifying nonlinearities. Second, employing a Stone-Weierstrass strategy we give a streamlined proof that ESNs with polynomial reservoirs and linear read-outs are dense in the Banach space of causal, time-invariant fading-memory filters, extending universality to stochastic inputs. Third, we quantify computational resources via memory-capacity spectrum, show how topology and leak rate redistribute delay-specific capacities, and link these trade-offs to Lyapunov spectra at the \textit{edge of chaos}. Finally, casting ESNs as skew-product random dynamical systems, we establish existence of singleton pullback attractors and derive conditional Lyapunov bounds, providing a rigorous analogue to cortical criticality. The analysis yields concrete design rules-spectral radius, input gain, activation choice-grounded simultaneously in mathematics and neuroscience, and clarifies why modest-sized reservoirs often rival fully trained recurrent networks in practice.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18550">On the Performance of Concept Probing: The Influence of the Data (Extended Version)</a></h4>

Abstract: Concept probing has recently garnered increasing interest as a way to help interpret artificial neural networks, dealing both with their typically large size and their subsymbolic nature, which ultimately renders them unfeasible for direct human interpretation. Concept probing works by training additional classifiers to map the internal representations of a model into human-defined concepts of interest, thus allowing humans to peek inside artificial neural networks. Research on concept probing has mainly focused on the model being probed or the probing model itself, paying limited attention to the data required to train such probing models. In this paper, we address this gap. Focusing on concept probing in the context of image classification tasks, we investigate the effect of the data used to train probing models on their performance. We also make available concept labels for two widely used datasets.

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/12/7/ENEURO.0356-23.2025?rss=1">The Effects of Mindfulness Meditation on Mechanisms of Attentional Control in Young and Older Adults: A Preregistered Eye Tracking Study</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neuroimaging data reveal that a functional locus ceruleus-noradrenaline (LC-NA) system is critical in maintaining cognitive performance during aging. However, older adults show reduced LC integrity and altered functional connectivity, demonstrating both structural declines and dysfunction. The LC-NA system mediates mechanisms of attention processing and eye tracking studies have shown that older adults are slower and more distractible compared with young adults in visual search tasks. Prior studies have shown that mindfulness meditation modulates LC noradrenergic activity, increases gray matter volume in the brainstem, and improves attentional control. Thus, in a preregistered longitudinal study, we investigated whether 30&nbsp;d of guided mindfulness meditation using a mobile application improved attentional control measured with eye movements. We hypothesized that older adults would show greater benefits from the mindfulness intervention compared with young adults. In two oculomotor search tasks, we identified that guided mindfulness practice improved saccadic reaction times, but that other longitudinal benefits in goal-directed attentional control or distractibility by task-irrelevant salient stimuli may be from repeated practice. Furthermore, we did not find evidence for age differences in response to the mindfulness intervention between young, middle-aged, and older adults, nor among scores on mindfulness questionnaires. Our findings show that short-term mindfulness practice can modulate cognition, specifically with the speed of overt orienting of attention that may not be observable in self-report measures. This study is the first to show the utility of mindfulness on cognition using a highly reliable measure in eye movements and suggests future longer-term intervention studies may be warranted.</p>

                <p>Neuroscientists are increasingly initiating large-scale collaborations which bring together tens to hundreds of researchers. At this scale, such projects can tackle big challenges and engage diverse participants. Inspired by projects in mathematics, we set out to test the feasibility of widening access to such projects even further, by running a massively collaborative project in computational neuroscience. The key difference, with prior neuroscientific efforts, being that our entire project (code, results, and writing) was public from the outset, and that anyone could participate. To achieve this, we launched a public Git repository, with code for training spiking neural networks to solve a sound localization task via surrogate gradient descent. We then invited anyone, anywhere to use this code as a springboard for exploring questions of interest to them, and encouraged participants to share their work both asynchronously through Git and synchronously at online workshops. Our hope was that the resulting range of participants would allow us to make discoveries that a single team would have been unlikely to find. At a scientific level, our work investigated how a range of biological parameters, from time delays to membrane time constants and levels of inhibition, could impact sound localization in networks of spiking units. At a more macro-level, our project brought together researchers from multiple countries, provided hands-on research experience to early career participants and opportunities for supervision and teaching to later career participants. While our scientific results were not groundbreaking, our project demonstrates the potential for massively collaborative projects to transform neuroscience.</p>

                <p>by Hanne Zillmer, Dirk Walther</p>

With the availability of reliably predicted 3D-structures for essentially all known proteins, characterizing the entirety of compound-binding sites (binding pockets on proteins) has become a possibility. The aim of this study was to identify and analyze all compound-binding sites, i.e., the pocketomes, of eleven species from different kingdoms of life to discern evolutionary trends as well as to arrive at a global cross-species view of the pocketome universe. Computational binding site prediction was performed on all protein structures in each species as available from the AlphaFold database. The resulting set of potential binding sites was inspected for overlaps with known pockets and annotated with regard to the protein domains in which they are located. 2D-projection plots of all pockets embedded in a 128-dimensional feature space, and characterizing them with regard to selected physicochemical properties, provide informative, global pocketome maps that unveil differentiating features between pockets. Our study revealed a sub-linear scaling law of the number of unique binding sites relative to the number of unique protein structures per species. Thus, as proteome size increased during evolution and therefore potentially diversified, the number of distinct binding sites, reflecting potentially diversifying functions, grew less than proportionally. We discuss the biological significance of this finding as well as identify critical and unmet algorithmic challenges.

Mechanistic models of dynamic, interacting cell populations have yielded many insights into the growth and resolution of immune responses. Historically these models have described the behavior of pre-defined cell types based on small numbers of phenotypic markers. The ubiquity of deep phenotyping therefore presents a new challenge; how do we confront tractable and interpretable mathematical models with high-dimensional data? To tackle this problem, we studied the development and persistence of lung-resident memory CD4 and CD8 T cells (TRM) in mice infected with influenza virus. We developed an approach in which dynamical model parameters and the population structure are inferred simultaneously. This method uses deep learning and stochastic variational inference and is trained on the single-cell flow-cytometry data directly, rather than on the kinetics of pre-identified clusters. We show that during the resolution phase of the immune response, memory CD4 and CD8 T cells within the lung are phenotypically diverse, with subsets exhibiting highly distinct and time-dependent dynamics. TRM heterogeneity is maintained long-term by ongoing differentiation of relatively persistent Bcl-2<sup>hi</sup> CD4 and CD8 TRM subsets which resolve into distinct functional populations. Our approach yields new insights into the dynamics of tissue-localized immune memory, and is a novel basis for interpreting time series of high-dimensional data, broadly applicable to diverse biological systems.

Bacteria live in diverse communities, forming complex networks of interacting species. A central question in bacterial ecology is whether species engage in cooperative or competitive interactions. But this question often neglects the role of the environment. Here, we use genome-scale metabolic networks from two different open-access collections (AGORA and CarveMe) to assess pairwise interactions of different microbes in varying environmental conditions (provision of different environmental compounds). By computationally simulating thousands of environments for 10,000 pairs of bacteria from each collection, we found that most pairs were able to both compete and cooperate depending on the availability of environmental resources. This modeling approach allowed us to determine commonalities between environments that could facilitate the potential for cooperation or competition between a pair of species. Namely, cooperative interactions, especially obligate, were most common in less diverse environments. Further, as compounds were removed from the environment, we found interactions tended to degrade towards obligacy. However, we also found that on average at least one compound could be removed from an environment to switch the interaction from competition to facultative cooperation or vice versa. Together our approach indicates a high degree of plasticity in microbial interactions in response to the availability of environmental resources.

The detection of cytosolic viral nucleic acids via pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) activates multiple signaling pathways, leading to the production of interferons (IFNs), which are essential for host survival during viral infection. Precise control of PRR gene expression is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis. Here, we showed that Mediator complex subunit 23 (Med23) is required for the precise production of the innate immune receptor RIG-I in response to RNA virus infection. Med23 deficiency markedly enhances the production of IFN-I, proinflammatory cytokines, and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in both multiple cell lines (MEFs, RAW264.7 cells, and HeLa cells) and mouse primary macrophages (bone marrow-derived macrophages [BMDMs] and peritoneal macrophages [PEMs]) infected with RNA virus VSV or stimulated with poly(I:C). Myeloid-specific Med23 knockout mice were generated to test the critical role of Med23 in host resistance to VSV infection in vivo. Mechanistically, Med23 interacts with the transcription factor forkhead box O3 (Foxo3) to negatively regulate RIG-I, thereby modulating IFN-I signaling. Collectively, these findings elucidate a previously unrecognized role of Med23 as a gatekeeper of the RIG-I-mediated antiviral innate immune response and suggest a potential target for controlling viral infection.

                <p>by Xing-jun Chen, Fei Li, Xinyue Zhao, Long Chen, Jin Xue, Zhimo Yao, Zuobin Gan, Xiaoyue Lian, Zhenghao Liu, Luyao Tong, Qingshan Yan, Linan Qiu, Qin Wang, Jiang-fan Chen, Zhihui Li</p>

Working memory (WM) is a fundamental cognitive function crucial adaptive behavior. The intricate interplay between the frontal cortex and striatum in governing WM maintenance and updating remains a central question. In this study, we employed optogenetics to demonstrate that inhibiting both dorsomedial striatum (DMS) D<sub>1</sub>R- and D<sub>2</sub>R-neurons enhances WM, while their activation impairs it across T-maze- and operant-based delayed-non-match-to-place (DNMTP) paradigms in mice. Notably, these neurons selectively modulate WM maintenance and retrieval, with no impact on encoding. Analysis through signal detection theory (SDT) revealed specific regulation of WM signal detection sensitivity, with no alterations in motivational or motor states during the operant DNMTP task. Interestingly, DMS D<sub>2</sub>R-neurons govern WM regulation under low cognitive load, switching to D<sub>1</sub>R-neurons as cognitive load increases. Activation of DMS D<sub>1</sub>R-neurons during the delay phase severely impairs WM under high cognitive load, a deficit rescued by optogenetic inhibition of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), or dopaminergic terminals in DMS. Additionally, treatment with the D<sub>1</sub>R antagonist SCH39166, but not the D<sub>2</sub>R antagonist Sulpiride mitigates these impairments. Collectively, our findings propose a “relay” model wherein cognitive load-dependent WM control switches from DMS D<sub>2</sub>R- to D<sub>1</sub>R-neurons, offering nuanced, complementary, and inhibitory regulation of WM maintenance and retrieval. This study suggests potential strategies to enhance WM by promoting a suppressive state in DMS and to increase WM capacity through specific modulation of DMS D<sub>1</sub>R-neurons.

                <p>by Jeremy Mo, Hanyun Zhang, Alexander Swarbrick</p>

Cancer treatments often fall short of durable cures, yet most therapeutic strategies neglect the tumor stroma. A concerted effort is needed to understand, model, target and reprogram the tumor ‘soil’, recognizing its profound influence on cancer from tumorigenesis to therapy resistance.

Current anti-cancer treatments often neglect the role of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in resistance and progression. In this Perspective, the authors argue that better preclinical models, understanding of stromal heterogeneity and integration of TME assessments into drug development are needed to improve treatment efficacy.

                <p>by Ha Neul Lee, Julia C. Hardy, Emily H. Pool, Jin-Fan Zhang, Su Hyun Kim, William F. Buhl, Jessica G.H. Bruystens, Sohum Mehta, Susan S. Taylor, Jin Zhang</p>

Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), a ubiquitous second messenger, regulates a variety of cellular functions with high specificity. We previously showed that the type I regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), RIα, undergoes liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) to facilitate spatial compartmentalization of cAMP. However, how RIα LLPS regulates cellular function is largely unknown. Here, we identify the formation of RIα condensates in MIN6 β cells and reveal key roles for RIα LLPS in regulating β cell function. By combining CRISPR-based RIα knockout with an RIα mutant (Y122A) that exhibits defective cAMP-induced LLPS, we demonstrate that RIα LLPS drives cAMP compartmentalization to tune β cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> and cAMP oscillation frequency, control insulin secretion, regulate CREB-mediated gene expression and prevent uncontrolled proliferation. Our data establish the Y122A mutant as a selective molecular tool for studying RIα LLPS and expand our understanding of the functional impact of LLPS-driven protein assemblies.

     alt="The Role of the Amygdala in Nonbreeding Aggression in Male Green Anole Lizards, Anolis carolinensis"/>
<p>During the non-breeding season, male green anoles display aggression that is regulated by the amygdala. Lesioning the amygdala led to a decrease in aggression, which was not observed in animals where the amygdala was missed or in saline controls. Also, plasma testosterone levels did not influence aggression in these males. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Aggression is a set of hostile behaviors expressed to defend and/or obtain resources. Although a social behavior network (SBN) has been postulated to explain the neural mechanisms underlying aggression, the extent of behavioral modulation by specific brain regions remains unclear. Additionally, the regulation of the SBN during the nonbreeding season (NBS) in seasonal breeders that express territorial aggression is still unknown. Thus, we aimed to study the role of one node of the SBN, the amygdala, in green anole lizards as this species displays dynamic changes in aggression, reduced testosterone levels, and increased number of neurons in the amygdala during the NBS compared to the breeding season. Male lizards were placed in a stereotactic apparatus and injected with either a neurotoxin (staurosporine) to damage the amygdala or saline as a control. These focal male lizards were also exposed to size-matched conspecifics before and 3 days after surgery to quantify aggressive behaviors. We found that partly damaging the amygdala significantly reduced aggression levels but did not affect their latency to initiate aggressive behaviors, providing support for the idea that the amygdala mediates aggression but not motivation in this species. Additionally, there was no relationship between aggression and plasma testosterone levels, suggesting that the nonbreeding aggression we measured was independent of plasma testosterone levels. These results indicate that the amygdala might play a significant role in the SBN to regulate NBS aggression and is not dependent on plasma testosterone levels.</p>

<p>The study shows that amacrine cells expressing the alpha subunit of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) make up subpopulations of conventional and displaced amacrine cells. They include ON but not OFF starburst amacrine cells and multiple types of wide-field presumed GABAergic amacrine cells.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Over 30 types of amacrine cells have been described in the primate retina, yet few are well characterized. Here, we investigated amacrine cells expressing the alpha subunit of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in the retinas of human, macaque (<i>Macaca fascicularis, Macaca nemestrina</i>), and marmoset (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>) monkeys using immunohistochemistry and intracellular injections, with a focus on displaced amacrine cells (dACs) in the ganglion cell layer. The spatial density of CaMKII-positive dACs decreases with the distance from the fovea, but in the peripheral temporal retina, the density of CaMKII-positive dACs nevertheless exceeds the density of retinal ganglion cells. In all species, CaMKII-positive dACs include cells expressing choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) cells, but in the human retina, only 60% of the ON ChAT population is CaMKII-positive. Conversely, in the marmoset and the macaque, about 80% of ON ChAT cells co-express CaMKII, but only 55% of ON ChAT cells in humans do so. Intracellular injections of CaMKII-positive dACs with the lipophilic dye DiI revealed ON starburst and semilunar Type 3 cells in all three species, but in the human retina, at least three additional types were detected. In the inner nuclear layer, CaMKII is expressed by multiple populations of amacrine cells, which are distinguished based on their soma size and staining intensity, but OFF ChAT cells do not co-express CaMKII. We conclude that ON- and OFF-ChAT cells show distinct patterns of CaMKII expression and that the diversity of CaMKII-expressing dACs in humans is greater than that in marmoset or macaque retina.</p>

<p>Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) revealed injury-induced changes in neuronal metabolites in the primary motor cortex and lumbar cord enlargement of patients with spinal cord injury.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Spinal cord injury (SCI) disrupts spinal tracts and neuronal pathways, including those in the primary motor cortex (M1) and the lumbar cord enlargement (LCE) involved in motor control. This study sought to determine whether metabolite concentrations deviate between SCI and healthy controls (HC) in M1 and LCE using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) and structural MRI, and if these correlate with clinical impairment. Sixteen chronic SCI (mean age: 54.7 ± 14.8y) and 19 HCs (mean age: 53.2 ± 18.8y) underwent <sup>1</sup>H-MRS to quantify metabolites along with T<sub>1</sub>- and T<sub>2</sub>*-weighted MRI to assess tissue structural changes. Associations between metabolic and structural changes and clinical impairment were also assessed. Patients showed significant atrophy in both white matter of the LCE (HC: 37.7 ± 4.7 mm<sup>2</sup>, SCI: 33.9 ± 3.7 mm<sup>2</sup>, Δ = −10.1%, <i>p</i> = 0.015) and gray matter (HC: 20.9 ± 2.1 mm<sup>2</sup>, SCI: 19.4 ± 1.5 mm<sup>2</sup>, Δ = −7.2%, <i>p</i> = 0.022). Total N-acetylaspartate (tNAA) with respect to total creatine (tCr) was reduced in M1 of SCI (HC: 1.94 ± 0.21, SCI: 1.77 ± 0.14, ∆ = −8.8%, <i>p</i> = 0.006) and in the LCE (HC: 2.48 ± 0.76, SCI: 1.81 ± 0.80, ∆ = −27.0%, <i>p</i> = 0.02). In conclusion, reduced tNAA/tCr in both the atrophied LCE and M1 suggests widespread neuronal changes including cell atrophy and/or cell loss after injury. These findings provide in vivo evidence for retrograde and trans-synaptic neurodegeneration, which may underline the atrophy observed in the motor system in SCI. Ultimately, this highlights the potential for metabolic and structural biomarkers to improve the monitoring of subtle neurodegeneration following SCI and to enhance future regenerative treatment strategies.</p>

                As a step toward human translation, Wang et al. demonstrate, without using contrast agents, the ability to map fine-scale cerebrovasculature (intracortical arterioles and venules) in vivo in primates using a human 7 T MRI scanner. This introduces a primate model for studying cerebral vascular architecture and hemodynamics in health and disease.

                Trinh et al. identify RNF13 as a pH- and Ca2+-dependent regulator of lysosomal positioning via ubiquitin-mediated degradation of ARL8B. They show that starvation or alkaline extracellular pH enhances RNF13 activity, while acidic intracellular pH suppresses it. This reveals a mechanism by which Ca2+ signaling and pH dynamics regulate lysosomal transport.

They demonstrated the important impact of SVs on population divergence and phenotypic variation between hulled and hulless oats and identified one candidate gene, AsMC1, that resulted in their differences in lemma lignin content.

                Kline et al. report that in a preclinical model of the atopic march, Staphylococcus aureus skin exposure initiates neutrophilic lung inflammation that requires skin and lung epithelial IL-36R signaling. Neutrophil-derived serine proteases and IL-36R-dependent NETosis exacerbate lung pathogenesis, which can be ameliorated with protease inhibitors and IL-36R blockade.

                Macartney et al. characterize how male dietary macronutrients influence the proteome of brown adipose tissue, including inter-generational effects. The two clusters of proteins are correlated with BAT weight, including proteasome proteins and UCP1. Paternal dietary protein is inversely related to basigin expression in daughters, a protein important for normal BAT function.

                Angeles-Perez et al. show that social and fear memory deficits in the P301S tauopathy mouse model emerge together with cerebellar Purkinje cell dysfunction. They further identify a critical role for cerebellar RCrus1 in maintaining cognitive function and modulating these tau-related phenotypes.

                Xu et al. reveal a non-canonical mechanism that transduces the membrane-to-nucleus signal of auxin independent of the TIR1 pathway, uncovering a new layer of regulation in auxin signaling. Auxin promotes the GLP1-PTRE1 interaction, leading to PTRE1 retention at the plasma membrane and suppression of nuclear proteasome activity, thereby stabilizing Aux/IAA repressors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98903">Phosphodiesterase 1A physically interacts with YTHDF2 and reinforces the progression of non-small cell lung cancer</a></h4>

              
                Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common subtype of lung cancer, and the prognosis is poor due to distant metastasis. Thus, there is an urgent need to discover novel therapeutic targets and strategies to overcome metastasis. A series of in vitro and in vivo phenotype experiments were performed to investigate the role of phosphodiesterase 1A (PDE1A) in NSCLC. The RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay, messenger RNA (mRNA) stability assay, and LC-MS/MS were performed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of PDE1A in NSCLC progression. PDE1A has been shown to promote metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progression of NSCLC. In addition, NSCLC cells overexpressing PDE1A promoted angiogenesis by regulating exosome release. IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway was highly enriched in PDE1A-coexpressed genes, and PDE1A promoted NSCLC metastasis by activating the STAT3 pathway. GO enrichment analysis of PDE1A-interacting genes showed that PDE1A might interact with YTHDF2 and participate in m6A-containing RNA binding. The binding between PDE1A and YTHDF2 was verified, and PDE1A regulated the STAT3 pathway by interacting with YTHDF2. The mechanism of the YTHDF2/PDE1A complex in regulating the STAT3 pathway was predicted by overlapping YTHDF2-interacting RNAs and genes coexpressed with YTHDF2 and STAT3. The interactions between YTHDF2 and target mRNAs were predicted, and there were three predicted targets of YTHDF2 with high scores: NRF2, SOCS2, and MET. Indeed, PDE1A interacted with YTHDF2, destabilized SOCS2, and activated the STAT3 pathway. Mechanistic data uncover a novel PDE1A/YTHDF2/STAT3 axis driving NSCLC metastasis and suggest potential therapeutic strategies for metastatic disease.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102027">Coordinated Tbx3/Tbx5 transcriptional control of the adult ventricular conduction system</a></h4>

              
                The cardiac conduction system (CCS) orchestrates the electrical impulses that enable coordinated contraction of the cardiac chambers. The T-box transcription factors <i>TBX3</i> and <i>TBX5</i> are required for CCS development and associated with overlapping and distinct human CCS diseases. We evaluated the coordinated role of <i>Tbx3</i> and <i>Tbx5</i> in the murine ventricular conduction system (VCS). We engineered a compound <i>Tbx3:Tbx5</i> conditional knockout allele for both genes located in cis on mouse chromosome 5. Conditional deletion of both T-box transcriptional factors in the VCS, using the VCS-specific <i>MinK<sup>CreERT2</sup></i>, caused loss of VCS function and molecular identity. Combined <i>Tbx3</i> and <i>Tbx5</i> deficiency in the adult VCS led to conduction defects, including prolonged PR and QRS intervals and elevated susceptibility to ventricular tachycardia. These electrophysiological defects occurred prior to detectable alterations in cardiac contractility or histologic morphology, indicative of a primary conduction system defect. <i>Tbx3:Tbx5</i> double-knockout VCS cardiomyocytes revealed a transcriptional shift toward non-CCS-specialized working myocardium, indicating a change to their cellular identity. Furthermore, optical mapping revealed a loss of VCS-specific conduction system propagation. Collectively, these findings indicate that <i>Tbx3</i> and <i>Tbx5</i> coordinate to control VCS molecular fate and function, with implications for understanding cardiac conduction disorders in humans.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101151">Contraction-induced endocardial id2b plays a dual role in regulating myocardial contractility and valve formation</a></h4>

              
                Biomechanical cues play an essential role in sculpting organ formation. Comprehending how cardiac cells perceive and respond to biomechanical forces is a biological process with significant medical implications that remains poorly understood. Here, we show that biomechanical forces activate endocardial <i>id2b</i> (inhibitor of DNA-binding 2b) expression, thereby promoting cardiac contractility and valve formation in zebrafish. Taking advantage of the unique strengths of zebrafish, particularly the viability of embryos lacking heartbeats, we systematically compared the transcriptomes of hearts with impaired contractility to those of control hearts. This comparison identified <i>id2b</i> as a gene sensitive to blood flow. By generating a knock-in reporter line, our results unveiled the presence of <i>id2b</i> in the endocardium, and its expression is sensitive to both pharmacological and genetic perturbations of contraction. Furthermore, <i>id2b</i> loss-of-function resulted in progressive heart malformation and early lethality. Combining RNA-seq analysis, electrophysiology, calcium imaging, and echocardiography, we discovered profound impairment in atrioventricular (AV) valve formation and defective excitation-contraction coupling in <i>id2b</i> mutants. Mechanistically, deletion of <i>id2b</i> reduced AV endocardial cell proliferation and led to a progressive increase in retrograde blood flow. In the myocardium, <i>id2b</i> directly interacted with the bHLH component <i>tcf3b</i> (transcription factor 3b) to restrict its activity. Inactivating <i>id2b</i> unleashed its inhibition on <i>tcf3b</i>, resulting in enhanced repressor activity of <i>tcf3b</i>, which subsequently suppressed the expression of <i>nrg1</i> (neuregulin 1), an essential mitogen for heart development. Overall, our findings identify <i>id2b</i> as an endocardial cell-specific, biomechanical signaling-sensitive gene, which mediates intercellular communications between endocardium and myocardium to sculpt heart morphogenesis and function.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103748">Social rank-order stability of mice revealed by a novel food competition paradigm in combination with available space competition paradigms</a></h4>

              
                Psychological, behavioral, and biological studies on social organization and competition with animal models are boosting. The mouse has been recognized as a valuable and economic model animal for biomedical research in social behaviors; however, currently available food competition paradigms for mice remain limited. Discrepant paradigms involving different competitive factors, such as physical strength vs psychological features, muscular confrontation vs threat perception, and boldness vs timidity, may produce task-specific win-or-lose outcomes and lead to inconsistent ranking results. Here, we developed a food competition apparatus for mice, in which contenders were a pair of mice eager to take over the same food pellet placed under a movable block in the middle of a narrow chamber where they were separated to either the right or left side. This food pellet competition test (FPCT) was designed to (1) provide researchers with a choice of new food competition paradigm and (2) expose psychological factors influencing the establishment and/or expression of social status in mice by avoiding direct physical competition between contenders. Meanwhile, we wanted to evaluate the consistency of social ranking results between FPCT and typically available space competition paradigms—tube test and warm spot test (WST). We hypothesized inconsistency of rankings of mice tested by FPCT, tube test, and WST as they possess different targets for mice to compete and different factors determining competitiveness. Interestingly, application of FPCT in combination with tube test and WST discovered unexpected consistency of mouse social competitivity and rankings in a grouped male or female mice that were housed in either a two- or three-member cage, most likely indicating that the status sense of animals is part of a comprehensive identity of self-recognition of individuals in an established social colony. Furthermore, the FPCT may facilitate research on social organization and competition, given its reliability, validity, and ease of use.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102794">Rho-ROCK liberates sequestered claudin for rapid de novo tight junction formation</a></h4>

              
                The epithelial cell sheet maintains its integrity as a barrier while undergoing turnover of constituent cells. To sustain the barrier continuously, it’s essential to preserve the ‘old’ tight junctions (TJs) between cells being excluded from the sheet and their neighbors while simultaneously forming de novo TJs between newly adjacent cells. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the formation of de novo TJs remain largely unknown. This study investigates two scenarios: the formation of de novo TJs during the removal of apoptotic cells from mouse monolayer epithelial sheets and during the differentiation of the granular layer in mouse stratified epidermis. We revealed that rapid claudin assembly is achieved by actively regulating the dissociation of the EpCAM/TROP2-claudin complex in both situations. Furthermore, we found that the Rho-ROCK pathway initiates the activation of matriptase, which cleaves EpCAM/TROP2, resulting in the supply of polymerizable claudin from the stockpiled EpCAM/TROP2-claudin complex at the plasma membrane to induce rapid de novo TJ formation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104295">Meioc-Piwil1 complexes regulate rRNA transcription for differentiation of spermatogonial stem cells</a></h4>

              
                Ribosome biogenesis is vital for sustaining stem cell properties, yet its regulatory mechanisms are obscure. Herein, we show unique properties of zebrafish <i>meioc</i> mutants in which spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) do not differentiate or upregulate rRNAs. Meioc colocalized with Piwil1 in perinuclear germ granules, but Meioc depletion resulted in Piwil1 accumulation in nucleoli. Nucleolar Piwil1 interacted with 45S pre-rRNA. <i>piwil1<sup>+/-</sup></i> spermatogonia with reduced Piwil1 upregulated rRNAs, and <i>piwil1<sup>+/-</sup>;meioc<sup>-/-</sup></i> spermatogonia recovered differentiation later than those in <i>meioc<sup>-/-</sup></i>. Further, Piwil1 interacted with Setdb1 and HP1α, and <i>meioc<sup>-/-</sup></i> spermatogonia exhibited high levels of H3K9me3 and methylated CpG in the 45S-rDNA region. These results indicate that zebrafish SSCs maintain low levels of rRNA transcription with repressive marks similar to <i>Drosophila</i> piRNA targets of RNA polymerase II, and that Meioc has a unique function on preventing localization of Piwil1 in nucleoli to upregulate rRNA transcripts and to promote SSC differentiation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101938">Identifying genetic variations in emm89 Streptococcus pyogenes associated with severe invasive infections</a></h4>

              
                <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i> causes mild human infections as well as life-threatening invasive diseases. Since the mutations known to enhance virulence to date account for only half of the severe invasive infections, additional mechanisms/mutations need to be identified. Here, we conducted a genome-wide association study of <i>emm</i>89 <i>S. pyogenes</i> strains to comprehensively identify pathology-related bacterial genetic factors (single-nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs], indels, genes, or k-mers). Japanese (<i>n</i> = 311) and global (<i>n</i> = 666) cohort studies of strains isolated from invasive or non-invasive infections revealed 17 and 1075 SNPs/indels and 2 and 169 genes, respectively, that displayed associations with invasiveness. We validated one of them, a non-invasiveness-related point mutation, <i>fhuB</i> T218C, by structure predictions and introducing it into a severe invasive strain and confirmed that the mutant showed slower growth in human blood. Thus, we report novel mechanisms that convert <i>emm</i>89 <i>S. pyogenes</i> to an invasive phenotype and a platform for establishing novel treatments and prevention strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95062">Rapid and inducible mislocalization of endogenous TDP43 in a novel human model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                Transactive response DNA binding protein 43 kDa (TDP43) proteinopathy, characterized by the mislocalization and aggregation of TDP43, is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). In this study, we describe the development of a new model of TDP43 proteinopathy using human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons. Utilizing a genome engineering approach, we induced the mislocalization of endogenous TDP43 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm without mutating the TDP43 gene or using chemical stressors. Our model successfully recapitulates key early and late pathological features of TDP43 proteinopathy, including neuronal loss, reduced neurite complexity, and cytoplasmic accumulation and aggregation of TDP43. Concurrently, the loss of nuclear TDP43 leads to splicing defects, while its cytoplasmic gain adversely affects microRNA expression. Strikingly, our observations suggest that TDP43 is capable of sustaining its own mislocalization, thereby perpetuating and further aggravating the proteinopathy. This innovative model provides a valuable tool for the in-depth investigation of the consequences of TDP43 proteinopathy. It offers a clinically relevant platform that will accelerate the identification of potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of TDP43-associated neurodegenerative diseases, including sporadic ALS.

">The Developmental Trajectory of the Social Brain: A Movie-Based Exploration from childhood to adolescence</a></h4>

              
                In childhood and adolescence, functional brain networks go through different stages of development, and the levels of connectivity within and between these networks change with age. The developmental trajectory of these large-scale networks of the brain have been extensively investigated; however, many aspects of our social brain and its developmental patterns remain unclear. This study employed a cross-sectional design to investigate the brains of 753 children and adolescents (ages 5-15) while they watched a movie. This research investigates the functional distinctness and developmental synchronicity of brain areas implicated in social cognition, such as empathy and affective and cognitive theory of mind, across childhood and adolescence using generalized additive models and inter-region group analysis. Our findings suggest that social cognition components networks such as cognitive and affective theory of mind and empathy exhibit distinct developmental trajectories throughout childhood and adolescence. The findings support the theory that social cognitive networks are developmentally distinct from each other, even in the absence of task-specific paradigms.

">Corticosterone drives behavioral inflexibility via plasticity-related gene expression in the dorsal striatum</a></h4>

              
                Behavioral flexibility allows organisms to modify actions based on new information, such as shifts in reward value or availability, and is promoted by the dorsomedial striatum (DMS). In contrast, behavioral inflexibility provides efficiency and automaticity in familiar contexts, and is promoted by the dorsolateral striatum (DLS). Importantly, chronic elevation of the primary stress hormone, corticosterone (CORT) in rodents or cortisol in humans, impairs behavioral flexibility through dendritic atrophy in the DMS, and promotes inflexible behavioral response strategies through dendritic outgrowth in the DLS. However, understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie the structural changes promoting behavioral inflexibility is lacking. We used a food-motivated operant task in male and female mice to define synaptic plasticity gene regulation supporting a decreased DMS activity and increased DLS activity in the shift to inflexible behavior with CORT. We discovered that CORT-accelerated loss of behavioral flexibility is accompanied by decreased DMS- and increased DLS-specific synaptic plasticity gene expression, and that distinct genes are either differentially expressed or spliced in the transition to inflexible behavior. Splicing analysis suggests that repressed activity in the DMS during the transition to inflexible behavior reflects both reduced expression and increased degradation of plasticity-related mRNA transcripts. Finally, given the ability of CORT to influence histone acetylation, we defined CORT-mediated H3K9ac enrichment profiles associated with synaptic plasticity gene regulation stratified by sex and striatal subregion. This study is the first to define CORT-driven epigenetic regulation in the DMS and DLS during the transition from flexible to inflexible behavior in male and female mice.

">Towards a mental programming neural circuit: Insights from working memory sequence manipulation</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive reasoning, also known as mental programming, is fundamental to our intelligence. A central function in mental programming is working memory (WM), involving both temporarily maintaining the information and manipulating it based on rules. While the neural mechanisms of WM maintenance have been extensively studied, those governing WM manipulation remain largely unknown. To bridge this gap, the present study focuses on an elementary operation in WM manipulation: re-ordering items in WM sequences. We propose a functional, biologically plausible neural circuit model that consists of two interconnected modules: a memory module composed of continuous attractor-based memory slots that store item features, and a control module sending gain-modulating commands to orchestrate specific operations in the memory module. The model successfully implements two-item swapping in a WM sequence, generating neuronal responses similar to recent primate experiments of WM sequence manipulation. By incorporating principles from the algebraic permutation group, we generalize the circuit model to accommodate more complex sequence manipulations. This math foundation reveals how arbitrary permutations can be decomposed into sequences of elementary swapping operations, which can be generated by a hierarchical tree-structured control circuit module. And the mutual inhibition within the control tree ensures that only one program is being executed at the same time. Our study establishes overarching connections among mental programming neural circuit models, neuroscience experiments, and abstract algebraic structure. These insights enhance our understanding of the neural underpinnings of cognitive reasoning and inspire the design of artificial cognitive systems.

">The role of white matter myelin in structural-functional network coupling</a></h4>

              
                The brain is a complex network of neuronal populations interconnected by white matter tracts. The composition of these white matter connections (SC) shapes inter-regional signaling dynamics giving rise to spatial patterns of synchronous functional connectivity (FC). Several modeling approaches have proven useful for studying the mechanisms underlying the relationship between SC and FC. However, the myelination of white matter tracts -- a major component of white matter connectivity -- is not accounted for by conventional SC networks, and thus, has largely been excluded from models of FC. Here, we expand structure-function brain modeling by integrating a multi-feature white matter SC network. We use multi-modal MRI to compute an SC network with connections (edges) weighted by the caliber, myelination, and length of white matter tracts. We investigate the relationship of this multi-feature SC network with both haemodynamic and electromagnetic FC. Edge myelin was strongly predictive of FC in a pattern that was heterogeneous across brain regions and timescales of neural function. Edge myelin showed strong, frequency-specific interactions with both edge caliber and length suggesting a modulatory role for white matter myelin in structure-function coupling. This was further supported by antagonistic gradients of white matter myelin and structure-function coupling along the sensory-association axis. We describe in detail the individual and joint relationships between these major white matter features and multi-frequency FC. These results illustrate the advantage of a more comprehensive characterization of white matter in structure-function models and establish how white matter myelin -- known for roles in conduction velocity, plasticity, and metabolic support at the microscale -- shapes brain function at the macroscale.

">Sensory sharpening and semantic prediction errors unify competing models of predictive processing in communication</a></h4>

              
                The human brain makes abundant predictions in speech comprehension that, in real-world conversations, depend on conversational partners. Yet, models diverge on how such predictions are integrated with incoming speech. Predictive coding proposes that the brain emphasises unexpected information via prediction errors, whereas Bayesian models emphasise expected information through sharpening. We reconcile these views through direct neural evidence from electroencephalography showing that both mechanisms operate at different hierarchical levels during speech perception. Across multiple experiments, participants heard identical ambiguous speech in different speaker contexts. Using speech decoding, we show that listeners learn speaker-specific semantic priors, which sharpen sensory representations by pulling them toward expected acoustic signals. In contrast, encoding models leveraging large language models reveal that prediction errors emerge at higher linguistic levels. These findings support a unified model of predictive processing, wherein sharpening and prediction errors coexist at distinct hierarchical levels to facilitate both robust perception and adaptive world models.

">Huntingtin preserves mitochondrial genome integrity in neurons, which is impaired in Huntingtons disease</a></h4>

              
                Huntingtin (HTT) function is enigmatic, as the native protein plays critical roles in neuronal health, while mutant HTT (mHTT), carrying an expanded polyglutamine stretch, triggers neurotoxicity and contributes to the pathogenesis of Huntingtons disease (HD). We recently found that HTT is part of a nuclear transcription-coupled DNA repair (TCR) complex with DNA repair enzymes including polynucleotide-kinase-3'-phosphatase (PNKP). This complex resolves DNA lesions during transcription to maintain genome integrity, while in HD, mHTT impairs the activity of this complex, resulting in accumulation of DNA lesions. Using molecular, cellular biology and computational methods, we find that HTT has a role in assembling a functional DNA repair complex in mitochondria. Together with mitochondrial RNA polymerase and transcription factors, HTT resolves mitochondrial DNA lesions to preserve mitochondrial genome integrity and function. Pathogenic mHTT impairs this activity, resulting in persistent DNA lesions and reduced mitochondrial function in HD. Importantly, restoring activity of this complex in a Drosophila HD model through ectopic HTT or PNKP expression significantly improves mitochondrial genome integrity and ameliorates motor deficits.

">Cognitive processes are disentangled at cortex-wide scales</a></h4>

              
                Most decisions involve multiple cognitive processes. Recent findings suggest that these processes are distributed across the cortex, but that single regions implement them via orthogonal population-activity patterns. How are these local geometries combined across the cortex? Here, we designed a virtual-navigation task for mice that dissociates the accumulation and short-term memory of sensory evidence, and choice. Combining dimensionality reduction and decoding models with cortex-wide widefield Ca2+ imaging, we observed distributed but near-orthogonal coding subspaces for these different cognitive processes, and that this geometry breaks down during erroneous choices. Further, only the memory subspace corresponded to a spontaneous activity-timescale hierarchy, suggesting that it co-opts intrinsic circuit properties. Thus, we reconcile previous findings by showing that cortex-wide dynamics supporting distinct cognitive processes are disentangled.

">Does Human-Like Contextual Object Recognition Emerge from Language Supervision and Language-Guided Inference?</a></h4>

              
                Human vision is an active, context-sensitive process that interprets objects in relation to their surroundings. While behavioral research has long shown that scene context facilitates object recognition, the underlying computational mechanisms, and the extent to which artificial vision models replicate this ability, remain unclear. Here, we addressed this gap by combining human behavioral experiments with computational modeling to investigate how structured scene context influences object recognition. Using a novel 3D simulation framework, we embedded target objects into indoor scenes, and manipulated contextual coherence between objects and scenes by using either intact scenes or their phase-scrambled versions. Humans showed a robust object recognition advantage in coherent scenes, particularly under challenging conditions such as occlusion, crowding, or non-canonical viewpoints. Conventional vision models, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), failed to replicate this effect. In contrast, vision-language models (VLMs), particularly those using ViT architectures and trained with language supervision (e.g., CLIP), approached human-like accuracy. This shows that semantically rich and category-structured representations are required for modelling context sensitivity. Notably, context sensitive behavior was closest to humans in VLMs when using language-guided inference at test time. This suggests that how a model accesses its representations during inference is relevant for enabling context-sensitive behavior. Together, this work offers steps towards a computational account of contextual facilitation of objects by scenes, and highlights zero-shot inference as an interesting alignment metric when benchmarking artificial and biological vision.

">How Prior Motor States Can Shape Perceptual Decision Bias: Insights from Sensorimotor Beta Oscillations</a></h4>

              
                Emerging evidence suggests that decision making is not a purely cognitive process preceding motor output but rather an embodied phenomenon in which the sensorimotor system actively shapes choice selection. Beta oscillations (13-30 Hz) over left and right sensorimotor cortex have been shown to encode motor action and exert inhibitory influence through lateralization of the post-movement rebound, biasing subsequent decisions toward responses with the other hand. This study investigated whether sensorimotor beta oscillations elicited by an isolated choice-unrelated motor action could influence a subsequent perceptual decision. Twenty-nine healthy adults (25 right-handed) completed a two-stage task while 64-channel EEG was recorded. In each trial, participants executed an initial button press with either the left or right thumb to a letter cue ("L" or "R") followed by, after a variable delay (0.5, 1.2 or 3 s), a briefly presented visual grating requiring a decision response on the orientation of the grating via a second button press. We computed the degree of beta power lateralization between left and right (pre-) motor cortical sources that was present during presentation of the grating stimulus and quantified choice bias as the threshold difference between psychometric curves fitted to left- versus right-initial response trials. Participants with stronger beta lateralization during stimulus presentation showed a greater tendency to alternate their decision response from the hand used for the initial button press and exhibited slower decision speeds. However, we failed to detect a significant group-level decision bias induced by the initial motor action, nor were there consistent within-subject correlations between decision bias and beta lateralization across delays. Following the perspective of embodied-decision making, our results partially support the influence of motor cortex activity on the choice process, while also suggesting that beta activity may serve as a trait-like index of individual susceptibility to decision bias.

">Impairment of neuronal activity occurs at the early stages of the aggregation cascade of Ab1-42 and mutant Tau</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimers disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques and neurofibrillary Tau tangles, ultimately leading to brain atrophy and death. To elucidate the relationship between the aberrant folding and aggregation of Abeta and mutant Tau and neuronal function, we monitored neuronal activity in C. elegans AD models across age. Our findings reveal that expression of both Abeta and Tau lead to significant reductions in neuronal activity and function in young adult animals preceding the accumulation of amyloid aggregates. Notably, Abeta expression and aggregation in muscle tissue produced comparable detrimental effects on neuronal activity as its expression in neurons, suggesting that proteotoxic stress in muscle can influence neuronal function. This may occur through the propagation of Abeta from muscle to neurons or through retrograde signaling pathways. Further, our new sub-stoichiometrically labeled Tau strains highlight that TauP301L,V337M has a significant impact on neuronal activity throughout aging. These results enhance our understanding of the early functional effects of amyloid aggregation in Alzheimer's disease.

">Excitatory signal processing in early visual areas based on task-relevance and perceptual salience modulates visual perceptual learning</a></h4>

              
                Adaptive visual perceptual learning (VPL) should occur primarily for visual signals relevant to an observer's task but not for task-irrelevant signals. However, it is unclear which neural mechanisms reduce VPL for task-irrelevant signals. Here, we repeatedly exposed participants to a task-irrelevant visual signal (coherent motion in one direction) that was perceptually salient (suprathreshold for coherent motion detection) or weak (near threshold for coherent motion detection). The processing of the task-irrelevant signal in early visual areas during the first and final exposure sessions was measured using functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (fMRS). The behavioral results showed that discrimination sensitivity for the exposed coherent motion direction increased to a greater extent after near threshold than after suprathreshold exposure. The fMRS results showed that excitatory processing in early visual areas, as reflected in the concentration of glutamate, was lower during suprathreshold than near threshold exposure. The lower the level of excitatory processing in the first exposure session, the more deteriorated the discrimination sensitivity for the coherent motion direction after suprathreshold exposure. When the coherent motion direction was rendered task-relevant, levels of glutamate in early visual areas reversed such that excitatory processing was greater when the coherent motion direction was presented suprathreshold than near threshold. This suggests that the level of excitatory processing in early visual areas changes with the task relevance and perceptual salience of a visual signal, which may modulate the extent of VPL for this signal when it is repeatedly exposed.

">Perceiving Material Qualities from Moving Contours</a></h4>

              
                While research on the perception of line drawings has long demonstrated the importance of contours in object recognition, recent work shows that contours can also convey material properties. For example, even simple 2D shapes with varying contours have been shown to evoke vivid impressions of different materials (Pinna & Deiana, 2015). However, such static representations capture only a single moment in time. When a material moves, its contours shift, evolve, or deform over time, creating contour motion. Does this contour motion convey diagnostic information about material properties, independent of surface appearance? Existing studies on the role of dynamic cues in material perception either use fully rendered 3D stimuli, where contour motion is confounded with rich surface information, or motion-only displays (dynamic dot stimuli or noise patches), which eliminate surface cues but also lack clearly defined contours. As a result, the relative contribution of contour motion to material perception remains unclear. To address this gap, we measured how human observers perceive materials from dynamic line drawings ("line"), compared to animations of fully textured stimuli that carry optical and motion information ("full"), as well as dynamic dot stimuli ("dot"). Stimuli were rendered versions (full, dot, line) of material animations from five material categories (jelly, liquid, smoke, fabric, and rigid-breakable). In one experiment, participants rated five material attributes (dense, flexible, wobbly, fluid, airy motion), and in a second experiment, participants were asked to choose one of the two materials that is more similar to a third material across all possible combinations. Results from both experiments consistently reveal that 1) Dynamic line drawings vividly convey mechanical material properties, and 2) the similarity in material judgments between line and full conditions was larger than that between dot and full conditions. We conclude that contour motion carries rich information about mechanical material qualities.

">The potential of ensemble-based automated sleep staging on single-channel EEG signal from a wearable device</a></h4>

              
                Machine-learning-based sleep staging models have achieved expert-level performance on standard polysomnographic (PSG) data. However, their application to EEG recorded by wearable devices remains limited by non-conventional referencing montage and the lack of benchmarking against PSG. Here, we tested whether an ensemble of state-of-the-art automatic staging algorithms can reliably classify sleep from a customized configuration of the ZMax headband, adapted to record a single fronto-mastoid EEG channel. A total of 35 nights of simultaneous ZMax and PSG recordings were acquired in a home setting, amounting to 250.02 hours of analysable data from 10 healthy participants. PSG data were scored according to AASM criteria by two independent experts from different sleep centres, with discrepancies resolved to obtain a consensus hypnogram. ZMax signal was processed using four machine-learning algorithms (YASA, U-Sleep, SleepTransformer, DeepResNet), whose predictions were further combined into a final ensemble scoring through soft-voting. The ensemble scoring achieved almost perfect agreement with human consensus staging (night-level mean {+/-} SD; accuracy = 88.83% {+/-} 2.84%, Cohen's {kappa} = 84.10% {+/-} 4.52%, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient = 84.54% {+/-} 4.23%). It showed excellent predictive accuracy for REM (F1-score = 93.99%), N3 (89.53%), N2 (87.93%), and wakefulness (86.37%), with lower performance for N1 (53.20%). These findings support the deployment of an ensemble scoring approach based on state-of-the-art sleep staging algorithms on ultra-minimal, mastoid-referenced EEG setups. This paradigm opens the way to the integration of data from modern wearable technologies into traditional PSG-based sleep research, overcoming longstanding barriers to ecological and large-scale sleep monitoring.

">Towards model-based characterization of individual electrically stimulated nerve fibers</a></h4>

              
                Neuroprosthetics, such as cochlear implants or deep brain stimulators, can restore parts of the function of an impaired system. To improve such prosthetics, a detailed understanding of the electrical stimulation of nerve fibers is required. This knowledge can best be represented by computational models of the process. Currently, most models of individual electrically stimulated nerve fibers are based on many different datasets, which mainly consist of the average analysis values of recordings of many nerve fibers. While this is a valid approach for understanding the basic phenomena, both the combination of many different datasets and the average analysis can confound details in the response of the nerve fiber. To improve computational models of electrically stimulated nerve fibers further, we propose an optimization procedure that can fit the parameters of a neuron model to the response of a single nerve fiber to pulse-train stimulation. We show that in this way, the model can reproduce a wide variety of fiber responses of electrically stimulated auditory nerve fibers of guinea pigs in a remarkably detailed way on a scale of less than 1 ms. We analyze and discuss the certainty and generalizability of the parameter sets thus exposed. The model parameters found by the optimization procedure can then form the basis for a detailed fiber-by-fiber analysis, which we illustrate by a correlation analysis of the predicted phenomena (e.g., spike latency and refractory period) in the fiber response.

">Complementary role of frontal theta and parietal alpha activity in resolving visual competition</a></h4>

              
                The brain processes vast information every second, much of which is irrelevant. Given the massive distracting information in which a target is embedded, the ability to manage distractions becomes the determinant of efficient information processing. Fortunately, the visual world is not entirely random; prior knowledge about targets and distractors can guide strategic attentional allocation. However, the neural mechanisms underlying this process remain incompletely understood. Using a binocular rivalry paradigm with flickering stimuli, we examined the rhythmic neural dynamics modulating target and distractor processing. Participants were cued in advance about the feature of the target or distractor on each trial. There was a behavioral enhancement in the target-cueing condition but no significant benefit or cost was observed in the distractor-cueing condition. Single-trial analyses showed that the absence of distractor-related cost was driven by reactive inhibition control, characterized by pronounced frontal theta activity that reduced the sensory gain of the distractor during rivalry. Additionally, distractor cues produced stronger alpha activity over parietal areas, reflecting enhanced attentional gating. This gating mechanism subserves the segregation of competing visual inputs, stabilizing perception by facilitating target identification and isolating distractors, without directly modulating sensory gain. These findings reveal that resolving competition between rivalrous stimuli is achieved through complementary neural mechanisms of reactive direct inhibition and proactive indirect gating, mediated by temporally dissociable theta and alpha oscillations.

">Optimization of connectome weights for a neural network model generating both forward and backward locomotion in C. elegans.</a></h4>

              
                Previous studies tracking the relationship between manipulations of C. elegans neurons and the resulting behavioral changes have called for the development of a connectome-constrained neural network model that describes the cascade from neurons to behavior. However, the model using anatomical connectome weights as they are did not achieve that. Here, we introduce a concept of learning the synaptic weights in our connectome-constrained neural network model based on the leaky-integrator equation while preserving the structural proportions of anatomical synapses. In this process, the weights of gap junctions and chemical synapses in C. elegans neurons are optimized. As a result, our neural network model generates plausible C. elegans behavior mediated by activity changes in forward and backward command neurons, even without the introduction of pacemaker neurons with intrinsic oscillatory activity. Additionally, we identified necessary or sufficient neurons for maintaining oscillatory patterns on muscular activity that could serve as clues for the central pattern generator in our neural network model. Finally, we provide 10 optimized synaptic weights sets of C. elegans that reproduce the results of manipulation experiments on the SMD neurons. This study will facilitate the future study for unraveling the multiscale relationship of "from synapse to behavior" in nervous system.

">pBOSC: A method for source-level identification of neural oscillations in electromagnetic brain signals</a></h4>

              
                Neural oscillations are recognized as a fundamental component of brain electromagnetic activity. They are implicated in a wide range of cognitive processes and proposed as a core mechanism for brain communication. Nonetheless, detecting genuine neural oscillations remains a methodological challenge, particularly due to the difficulty of distinguishing them from aperiodic background activity. To identify episodes of oscillatory activity directly at their sources, we developed pBOSC, which extends the BOSC (Better OSCillation detection) family of algorithms. Consistent with existing approaches, pBOSC detects oscillatory episodes that exceed both a defined power threshold and a minimum duration criterion. In pBOSC, however, the detection of oscillatory episodes also relies on identifying peaks (i.e., local maxima) in the power spectra as well as throughout the brain volume. Using a series of simulated signals, we tested the ability of pBOSC to detect and localize oscillations across multiple scenarios. Our results show that most oscillatory episodes were accurately detected at their sources, achieving around 95% accuracy under optimal conditions (i.e., high signal-to-noise ratio, lower frequency, and longer oscillation duration). In addition, we validated pBOSCs performance on real resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. By extracting the natural frequency of each brain voxel from the detected oscillatory episodes, we observed a topographic distribution consistent with previous work. In conclusion, pBOSC offers a novel approach for identifying oscillatory activity in electrophysiological signals. It extends previous algorithms by operating in source space and verifying the presence of genuine spectral peaks, thereby enabling new possibilities for exploring brain dynamics.

">Molecular and structural remodeling of stress granules in slowly and rapidly progressive Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Stress granules (SGs) are dynamic ribonucleoprotein condensates that modulate RNA metabolism during cellular stress. Although SG dysfunction has been increasingly linked to neurodegenerative diseases, their structural and molecular remodeling in Alzheimer's disease (AD), particularly rapidly progressive AD (rpAD), remains poorly understood. Here, we present a comprehensive multi-omics characterization of SGs from postmortem frontal cortex tissues of control slowly progressive AD (spAD), and rpAD subjects. SGs were immunoprecipitated using Anti-TIAR antibodies and analyzed via transmission electron microscopy (TEM), LCMS/MS-based proteomics, and RNA sequencing. Key protein findings were validated in human cortical brain homogenates and a 3xTg mouse model of A{beta} and tau pathology. TEM revealed disease-specific SG morphologies: small spherical granules in controls; moderate clustering in spAD; and large, amorphous aggregates in rpAD. Proteomic profiling identified 1,667 high-confidence SG-associated proteins, including RNA-binding proteins and disease-linked proteins such as MAPT, APP, and SNCA. SGs in rpAD were significantly enriched for pathways involved in MAPK signaling, proteostasis, and neuroinflammation, while showing reduced abundance of key cytoskeletal and translational regulators, such as TUBA1B and EEF1A2. Transcriptome analysis revealed widespread depletion of long, GC-rich, protein coding RNAs in rpAD SGs. Notably dynamic dysregulation of TUBA1B was also observed in the 3xTg mouse model and human cortical tissues, highlighting cytoskeletal vulnerability during disease progression Together, these findings uncover profound structural and molecular remodeling of SGs in AD, with rpAD displaying a distinctive shift towards pathological SG composition and function. Together, these findings uncover profound structural and molecular remodeling of SGs in AD, with rpAD exhibiting a distinctive shift towards pathological SG composition and function. Our results highlight a link between SG alterations and aggressive AD subtypes, providing new mechanistic insights and suggesting new potential targets for therapeutic intervention

">A Parietal Memory Strength Signal Linked to Evidence Accumulation in Recognition Decisions</a></h4>

              
                Recognising objects from memory requires an integration of sensory and mnemonic information. This process has been theorised to occur via a stochastic evidence accumulation process implemented within the parietal cortex. Here, we provide evidence for this type of mnemonic accumulator using a combination of electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings and generative computational modelling. We recorded EEG from participants making recognition judgements based on either studied or novel words. We first demonstrate that the widely studied parietal Late Positive event-related potential Component (LPC) reflects a dynamic decision-making variable occurring prior to the recognition judgments. By fitting Diffusion Decision Models to neural and behavioural data using specialised neural network tools, we then show that the LPC amplitudes are selectively associated with the rate of evidence accumulation, signifying memory strength. This association was stronger for previously studied words compared to novel words. Our findings therefore recast the LPC as a neural signature of mnemonic strength in evidence accumulation for recognition memory judgments, especially for memorised objects.

">It is about time: neural temporal scaling accounts for robust hunting behavior across temperatures</a></h4>

              
                Animals are often required to maintain stable performance in critical behaviors despite environmental fluctuations. Temperature broadly affects neural activity, and even localized shifts in brain temperature can alter behavior. However, whether widespread changes across the brain, such as those experienced by ectotherms, disrupt survival-critical behaviors remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that larval zebrafish exhibit robust hunting performance across a ten degrees Celsius ecological range. Although behavior accelerates with temperature, spatial parameters, such as bout distance and turn angle, remain stable. This invariance results from coordinated adjustments in tail beat frequency and movement duration. Brain-wide calcium imaging revealed that behavioral temporal scaling is mirrored at the level of single neurons. A simple rate model showed that temperature-dependent changes in neural time constants can account for compensatory tail dynamics, enabling stability without active regulation. These findings suggest that neural temporal scaling can preserve performance under diffuse temperature fluctuations, supporting robust behavior in natural environments.

">Molecular unbalances between striosome and matrix compartments characterize the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease model mouse</a></h4>

              
                'The pathogenesis of Huntington's disease is still incompletely understood, despite the remarkable advances in identifying the molecular effects of the Htt mutation in this disease. When we focus on movement disorders, clinical studies offer us some hints about this issue. Human studies employing positron emission tomography have identified a reduction in phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) as the earliest event in the brain of patients with Huntington's disease, which occurs about 25 years before symptom onset. A PDE10A mutation is also known to cause childhood-onset chorea. GNAL encodes the olfactory type G-protein  subunit (Golf), strongly expressed in the striatum, and its mutation causes familial dystonia. PDE10A and Golf are both critical regulators of cyclic AMP and are abundant in striatal spiny projection neurons. These findings suggest that maintaining cyclic AMP levels in the striatum might be an essential target for the pathogenesis of movement disorders such as chorea and dystonia. Why and how these changes in the striatum cause movement disorder are still a mystery. Here we suggest that a key might be evaluating these messenger systems in light of the circuit-level compartmental organization of the striatum, in which there is particular vulnerability of the striosome compartment. We developed machine learning algorithms to define with high precision and reproducibility the borders of striosomes in the brains of q175 Huntington's disease model mice from 3-12 months of age. We demonstrate that multiple molecules including Golf, PDE10A, dopamine D1 and D2 receptors, adenosine 2A receptors, and mu-opioid receptors differentially change their expression patterns in striosomes across ages by comparison with their expression patterns in the matrix compartment. An early and pronounced differential vulnerability of striosomes has been demonstrated in studies of post-mortem Huntington's brains. Our findings here, mapping the molecular distributions across age in a widely studied mouse model of Huntington's disease, may help to pinpoint the pathogenic mechanisms of Huntington's disease by demonstrating the differential molecular changes in the striosome compartment.

">Distinct Roles of Central and Peripheral Vision in Rapid Scene Understanding</a></h4>

              
                Central and peripheral vision loss, caused by conditions such as age-related macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa, disrupt visual processing in distinct ways, yet their impact on natural scene perception remains poorly understood. Here, we used a real-time, gaze-contingent simulation to examine how central vision loss and peripheral vision loss alter eye movements and scene understanding. Sighted participants (n = 32, 5 males) viewed 120 natural scenes under one- or three-saccade constraints and described each scene; description quality was quantified via semantic similarity to ground-truth responses. Peripheral vision loss observers produced significantly less informative descriptions than both central vision loss and control participants, particularly for social interaction scenes, suggesting that peripheral vision is critical for rapid extraction of scene semantics. In contrast, central vision loss primarily disrupted oculomotor behavior, including increased saccade amplitudes, delayed saccade initiation, and reduced inter-subject fixation consistency. Description quality was not predicted by fixation similarity to controls, but by fixations to annotated humans and critical objects, underscoring the role of semantically informative sampling. These results reveal a dissociation between perceptual and oculomotor consequences of vision loss and highlight the neural importance of peripheral input for natural scene understanding.

">Whole-Brain Cell-Cell Interaction Axes Explaining Tissue Vulnerability Across the Neurodegenerative Spectrum</a></h4>

              
                Cell-cell communication is essential for proper brain functioning and health. Here, we characterize whole-brain patterns of cellular interactions that spatially align with tissue damage across 13 neurodegenerative conditions, including early- and late-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD, LOAD), presenilin-1 mutations (PS1), frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). By integrating spatial gene expression with structural MRI data, we created over 1,000 whole-brain maps of ligand-receptor interactions. Multivariate analysis revealed three principal axes of cell-cell communication underlying brain tissue vulnerability. The first axis involved neuron-astrocyte-microglia interactions, explaining atrophy patterns shared by frontotemporal lobar degeneration and Alzheimer's disease subtypes. Moreover, the first axis was enriched with genes involved in regulation or spreading of amyloid beta/tau and/or Alzheimer's disease risk. Two complementary axes involving neurons, endothelial cells, and astrocytes explained patterns specific to PS1 and PD. Notably, we confirmed that cell-cell interactions identified for LOAD were also associated with frontal cortex atrophy in 375 participants from an independent database. These findings reveal both distinctive and shared molecular signaling pathways underlying tissue vulnerability across neurodegenerative disorders, clarifying disease mechanisms and highlighting potential cellular targets for therapeutic interventions.

">A Data-Driven Closed-Loop Control Approach to Drive NeuralState Transitions for Mechanistic Insight</a></h4>

              
                Repetitive negative thinking (RNT) is a transdiagnostic risk factor for mood disorders, consistently associated with altered biological substrates, including functional connectivity in key brain networks. As a stable cognitive feature linked to vulnerability across disorders, RNT presents a compelling target for intervention. However, leveraging RNT as a modifiable mechanism requires a deeper understanding of its causal neural dynamics and how targeted modulation can induce adaptive change. This study introduces a data-driven framework combining dynamical system reconstruction (DSR) with model predictive control (MPC) to infer optimal control policies for transitioning between resting and sad mood brain states, based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Using generative DSR models trained on fMRI data from participants with a remitted major depressive disorder (rMDD) and matched healthy controls from a resting state period and a sad mood induction task, we reconstruct nonlinear brain dynamics and derive region-specific control strategies for transitioning from resting to sad mood states. Our results demonstrate that small brain regions, such as the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC), exhibit higher controllability, requiring less energy to drive state transitions. Notably, rMDD group shows reduced control energy demands and stronger neural connectivity, particularly relating to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)-hippocampal pathways, suggesting heightened susceptibility to relapse into negative mood states. These findings highlight the potential of closed-loop control approaches to uncover mechanistic insights into RNT and inform targeted interventions for mood disorders in the future.

">Controlling spatio-temporal sequences of neural activity by local synaptic changes</a></h4>

              
                The neural basis of behavior is believed to consist of sequential patterns of neural activity in the relevant brain regions. Behavioral flexibility also requires neural circuit mechanisms that support dynamic control of sequential activity. However, mechanisms to control and reconfigure sequential activity have received little attention. Here, we show that recurrently connected networks with heterogeneous connectivity and a smooth spatial in-degree landscape (which may arise due to asymmetric neuron morphologies) provide a robust mechanism to evoke and control sequential activity. By modulating the synaptic strength of only a few neurons in local neighborhoods, we uncovered high-impact locations which can start, stop, extend, gate, and redirect sequences. Interestingly, high-impact locations coincide with mid in-degree regions. We demonstrate that these motifs can flexibly reconfigure sequential activity, and hence, provide a framework for fast and flexible computations on behavioral time scales, while the individual parts of the pathways remain rigid and reliable.

">Synaptic sign switching mediates online dopamine updates</a></h4>

              
                In the mammalian brain, excitatory and inhibitory synapses are generally distinct and have fixed synaptic signs. Therefore, unlike in artificial neural networks, learning in biological networks is thought to be manifested by plasticity mechanisms that modify synaptic weights but not signs. Here, we demonstrate experience-dependent sign switching at synapses between glutamate and GABA co-releasing neurons of the entopedunculus (EP) and their targets in the lateral habenula (LHb). Pairing of reward or punishment with activation of EP co-releasing neurons makes EP-LHb synapses relatively more inhibitory or excitatory, respectively. Synaptic sign switching modulates downstream dopaminergic signaling, correlates with recent dopamine updates, and contributes to reinforcement learning. These data unveil a plasticity mechanism that alters both synaptic signs and weights to rapidly update dopamine release and drive learning.

">Voluntary eating of saltier food by mice and acute stress each abrogate reductions in a neuroinflammatory marker across sexes</a></h4>

              
                Both consuming excess salt (NaCl) and experiencing environmental stress can elevate neuroinflammation and enhance risk for non-communicable diseases. Most rodent studies investigating these topics use only males, and assess salt or stress separately. Here, we used adult female and male mice to investigate how the combination of access to food high in salt (4% NaCl, w/w) and experiencing an acute stressor interact to affect levels of a proxy measure for neuroinflammation (Iba1). We hypothesized eating salty food and experiencing stress would each individually augment neuroinflammation, and their combination would be additive. Further, we anticipated salty food consumption would increase active stress coping behaviors, and that all of these effects would be enhanced in female mice. Over 4 or 8 weeks, we further evaluated how mice responded to choice access to low (0.4%) and high salt food simultaneously. Our hypothesis that mice across sexes would eventually prefer high over low salt food was supported, while our expectations regarding neuroinflammation and stress did not consistently align with our findings. Instead, we found modest changes in passive coping behaviors driven by our choice condition, unanticipated reductions in sham stress neuroinflammation by high salt in brain region- and biological sex-specific patterns after 4 weeks, and distinct sex- and salt-selective increases in swim stress neuroinflammation after 8 weeks. Though some of our results were unexpected, they include multiple novel and translationally relevant outcomes. Mice willingly choose to eat saltier food over time, akin to people, and this could sex-specifically decrease (females) or augment (males) passive coping stress strategies while eliciting distinctive stress- and brain region-dependent neuroinflammatory patterns over time. Future studies implementing more complex behavior tests and stress manipulations will advance identification of the hidden ways through which salty food and stressful experiences interact to affect risk for non-communicable diseases.

">Dentate gyrus network regulation by somatostatin- and parvalbumin-expressing interneurons differentially impacts hippocampal spatial memory processing</a></h4>

              
                GABAergic interneurons regulate circuit dynamics in hippocampal structures such as CA1 that appear to be essential for memory processing. The dentate gyrus (DG) is known to play a role in pattern recognition and spatial working memory. However, the role of the DG in different stages of long-term spatial memory is poorly understood. Moreover, the roles of the predominant interneuron subtypes within the DG - somatostatin-expressing (SST+) and parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) - in different stages of memory processing are unknown. We tested how chemogenetic manipulation of DG SST+ and PV+ interneurons in mice influences the encoding, consolidation, and retrieval of hippocampus-dependent object-location memory (OLM). We find that activation of DG SST+ interneurons impairs both OLM encoding and retrieval, dramatically suppresses DG granule cell cFos expression, and (in the case of encoding) suppresses downstream CA1 network activity. Among individual mice, the degree of DG granule cell suppression is proportional to the extent of SST+ interneuron activation, and predicts the extent of OLM deficits. In striking contrast, PV+ interneuron activation selectively disrupts encoding, but not retrieval, of OLM, and minimally impacts DG or downstream hippocampal network activity. These findings demonstrate that regulation of the DG network by SST+ and PV+ interneurons differentially contributes to the various stages of spatial memory processing, and suggest that distinct network mechanisms are engaged in the hippocampus during each processing stage.

">Assembly-based computations through contextual dendritic gating of plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal assemblies -- groups of strongly connected neurons -- are considered the basic building blocks of perception and memory in the brain by encoding representations of specific concepts. Despite recent evidence for the biological basis behind the existence and formation of such assemblies, computational models often fall short of showing how assemblies can be flexibly learned and combined to perform real-world computations. A prominent problem is 'catastrophic forgetting', where learning a new assembly can disrupt existing connectivity structure and lead to forgetting previously learned assemblies. We propose a biologically plausible computational model, where dendritic compartments (instead of neurons) are the loci for learning and inhibition gates learning in a dendrite-specific manner, to flexibly learn new stimuli without forgetting of old ones. By learning stable projections from one brain region into another and associations between different brain regions, we demonstrate how the proposed assembly framework implements the basic building blocks for diverse computations. In a visual-auditory association task, we demonstrate how the context-specific assembly computations can be used to correctly separate ambiguous stimuli based on their dendritic representations. Our models provide unique insights and predictions for how hierarchically connected brain areas use their biological components to implement flexible yet robust learning.

">Functional covariance modes reveal aligned fetal and neonatal brain functional connectomes.</a></h4>

              
                Multiple lines of evidence suggest that that spatially distributed functional networks in the brain may first start emerging before birth. Reliably demonstrating this in utero using fMRI remains a very challenging problem due to a variety of MRI-adverse factors, including distant coil positioning and motion-induced magnetic field perturbations. Here, we introduce a novel approach to functional network analysis, called seed-based functional covariance modes (FCMs), which leverages inter-subject variability in connectivity between seed regions and the rest of the brain to infer whole-brain network configurations. We first applied the FCMs approach to neonatal data to benchmark it against group-level independent component factorisation - a standard in fMRI network analysis - and found a high degree of concordance between the results produced by the two methods. We then applied it to the fetal data, where the standard approach has consistently failed to reveal spatially distributed networks. For the first time, and despite fundamental differences in signal characteristics between fetal and neonatal data, we detected network-like patterns with high spatial correspondence to neonatal functional networks. In particular, the FCMs approach efficiently recovered interhemispheric connections, a landmark feature of neonatal functional networks. Systematic organisation of interhemispheric fetal networks was observed; they tended to cluster along the brain midline but also were present in lateral sensorimotor and temporal areas as well as cortical limbic territories in ventral orbitofrontal cortex and temporal pole. By aligning fetal and neonatal connectomes, this study represents a crucial step towards supporting the biological veracity of observations made using fetal fMRI. Meanwhile, the concordance between FCMs and independent component factorisation in neonates prompts a re-evaluation of how inter-individual variability contributes to network structure inference in methods that ostensibly emphasise shared correlation patterns across subjects.

This study examined brain imaging in relation to mutation in patients with Wilson’s disease. A total of 57 Wilson’s disease patients and 25 healthy controls were recruited in the current research. Patients were classified as having either the p.R778L or the p.P992L mutation (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span> = 43) or other mutations (<span style="font-style:italic;">N</span> = 14). Utilizing the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations, fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations, and voxel-based morphology, the brain function and structure of Wilson’s disease were explored. Compared to healthy controls, Wilson’s disease patients with the p.R778L or p.P992L mutation showed greater atrophy in the bilateral putamen, caudate, globus pallidus, thalamus, amygdala, insula, and hippocampus. And these patients showed altered spontaneous neural activity in many more brain regions than healthy controls in three frequency bands. Significant correlation was found between altered brain volume and Unified Wilson’s Disease Rating Scale neurological subscale scores. These findings reveal the functional and structural characteristics of Wilson’s disease and emphasize the importance of exploring the neuroimaging correlation of genetic mutations in Wilson’s disease.</span>

                <p>In everyday life, ambient sounds can disrupt our concentration, interfere with task performance, and contribute to mental fatigue. Even when not actively attended to, salient or changing sounds in the environment can involuntarily divert attention. Understanding how the brain responds to these real-world auditory distractions is essential for evaluating the cognitive consequences of environmental noise. In this study, we recorded electroencephalography while participants performed different tasks during prolonged exposure to a complex urban soundscape. We identified naturally occurring, acoustically salient events and analyzed the corresponding event-related potentials (ERPs). Auditory spectral novelty reliably elicited a P3a response (250&ndash;350 ms), reflecting robust attentional capture by novel environmental sounds. In contrast, the reorienting negativity (RON) window (450&ndash;600 ms) showed no consistent modulation, possibly due to the continuous and largely behaviorally irrelevant nature of the soundscape. Performance in a behavioral task was briefly disrupted following novel sounds, underscoring the functional impact of attentional capture. Noise sensitivity, measured via the Weinstein Noise Sensitivity Scale (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B53">1978</cross-ref>), was not associated with ERP amplitudes. Together, these findings demonstrate that the P3a component provides a stable neural marker of attentional shifts in naturalistic contexts and highlight the utility of spectral novelty detection as a tool for investigating auditory attention outside the laboratory.</p>

                <p>The endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling system is robustly expressed in the cerebellum from embryonic developmental stages to adulthood.

In this study, we show that selective deletion of the eCB synthesizing enzyme diacylglycerol lipase alpha (Dagl&alpha;) from mouse cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) alters motor and social behaviors, disrupts short-term synaptic plasticity in both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, and reduces PC activity during social exploration. Our results provide the first evidence for cerebellar-specific eCB regulation of social behaviors and implicate eCB regulation of synaptic plasticity and PC activity as the neural substrates contributing to these deficits.</p>

Here, we examined the functions of <I>Etv5</I>, which is expressed in Schwann cell precursors, neural crest cells and satellite glia, at embryonic stages and at low levels in mature Schwann cells. In hypomorphic <I>Etv5<sup>tm1Kmm</sup></I> homozygous mutant mice, no overt defects in Schwann cell differentiation were observed at embryonic stages. To study the function of <I>Etv5</I> in juvenile (postnatal days 21&ndash;30) and mature adult (6&nbsp;month) mice, we generated <I>Etv5</I> conditional knock-outs (cKOs) using a <I>Sox10-Cre</I> driver. In juvenile male <I>Etv5</I>-cKO mice, Schwann cell numbers increased normally after a peripheral nerve crush injury, a response that was attenuated by 6&nbsp;months. Transmission electron microscopy of the naive sciatic nerve revealed a decline in axonal diameter and perturbed myelination in <I>Etv5</I>-cKO male and female mice. The innervated gastrocnemius muscle declined in area and volume in <I>Etv5</I>-cKO mice of both sexes, suggesting nerve structural abnormalities cause muscle atrophy. However, control and <I>Etv5</I>-cKO male and female mice performed similarly in motor behavior tests after a crush injury. Thus, <I>Etv5</I> is not essential for Schwann cell differentiation, but <I>Etv5</I> plays a crucial role in the age-dependent regulation of Schwann cell function, including nerve repair and the maintenance of axonal integrity in mature peripheral nerves.</p>

                <p>A major challenge in cerebellar physiology is determining how the stereotypic, conserved circuitry of the cerebellar cortex, with its dominant parasagittal and transverse architectures, underlies its fundamental computations and contributions to behavior. Recent advances have allowed for the resolution of Purkinje cell dendritic activity at large scales, but the full roles of these Purkinje cell dynamics during behavior remain undetermined. To interrogate Purkinje cell dynamics at the population level during behavior, we implemented a novel approach for awake, chronic, wide-field Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging of the cerebellar cortex. We performed wide-field cerebellar recordings in mice of both sexes exhibiting sparse expression of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator GCaMP6s, which importantly allowed for the resolution of both dendritic and somatic Purkinje cell activity. Blind source separation of wide-field dynamics using spatial independent component analysis extracts components consisting of either Purkinje cell dendrites or somata, with distinct activity and spatial properties. These independent components (ICs) tend to be either parasagittally organized and likely reflective of dendritic activity or more spatially distributed populations of Purkinje cell somata. We observe broad, bilateral activation of both these dendritic and somatic ICs during behavior, but they exhibit distinct and divergent patterns of spatial correlations occurring primarily along the parasagittal and transverse directions, consistent with the main geometry of the cerebellar cortex. Somatic correlation dynamics are robustly modulated by prediction errors and reflect ultimate behavioral outcomes. These results provide a novel link between cerebellar structure and function, with the correlation dynamics of Purkinje cell activity a key feature during behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/30/e2062242025?rss=1">Emerging Adulthood Is Marked by a Cortical Dendritic Arborization Phase Depending on the Actin Nucleator Cobl</a></h4>

              
                <p>Puberty triggers significant changes. However, besides the pruning of synapses, little is known about more long-range alterations during brain maturation. Actin filament formation&mdash;a process ignited by actin nucleators&mdash;is crucial for life and also a driving force behind cellular morphology changes. Yet, the physiological importance of especially the more recently discovered, evolutionary younger actin nucleators largely remains elusive. We demonstrate the consequences of deficiency for the actin nucleator Cobl in the mouse brain. We identify remarkably layer- and age-restricted cortical <I>Cobl</I> KO phenotypes in dendritic arborization that first transiently emerge in layer V in rather young adolescent male mice and then manifested in a similar but more pronounced manner in layer II/III during the age of emerging adulthood. <I>Cobl</I> KO phenotypes were observed in the somatosensory cortex, prefrontal cortex, and motor cortex. In WT mouse cortices, we discovered an increase in dendritic arbor complexity occurring during emerging adulthood and thereby identified a long-range process for cortical rewiring upon brain maturation. This dendritic arbor expansion is transient and largely erased during mature adulthood. The transient dendritic arbor expansion during emerging adulthood was accompanied by transient length changes of dendritic spines. Molecularly, the process thus seems to relate to alterations in actin dynamics. Importantly, both of these changes were completely absent in <I>Cobl</I> KO mice. Increased risk-taking of <I>Cobl</I> KO mice points toward a lack of maturity. These observations revealed the actin nucleator Cobl as first molecular component crucial for the identified emerging adulthood-related changes of neurons toward brain maturation.</p>

                <p>Structural neuroimaging studies of typical development reveal increases in gray matter volume during childhood, followed by shrinkage in adolescence and early adulthood. With neuropil constituting the bulk of gray matter, these developmental changes may reflect neuropil reorganization accompanied by alterations in cellular membranes, as well as changes in related energy demand. Phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>31</sup>P MRS) allows in vivo assessment of changes in the brain's high-energy phosphates&mdash;phosphocreatine (PCr), inorganic phosphate (Pi), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP)&mdash;as well as metabolites associated with synthesis and degradation of membrane phospholipids (MPLs)&mdash;phosphocholine (PC) and phosphoethanolamine (PE)&mdash;and their breakdown products, glycerophosphocholine (GPC) and glycerophosphoethanolamine (GPE). Forty-nine children and adolescents aged 6&ndash;14&nbsp;years at baseline (37 boys, 12 girls) were assessed on up to three occasions ca. 12&nbsp;months apart. MPL precursor levels decreased across all examined regions over time, including cortical and subcortical gray matter and two major white matter tracts. Breakdown products increased in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in younger children but decreased in their older counterparts. While ATP and Pi decreased across most regions, PCr changes were heterochronic and regional: hippocampal increases were more pronounced in older children, whereas most of the remaining regions showed no change. Changes in MPL precursors were positively associated with change in PFC cortical thickness, suggesting that the expansion and contraction of neuropil are coupled with structural brain changes during childhood and adolescence. Thus, in vivo <sup>31</sup>P MRS provides new insights into the neurobiological mechanisms of normal brain development.</p>

                <p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that affects normal neuronal functioning and alters neuronal circuits activity and memory formation and storage. Disrupted neuronal calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) signaling is one of the drivers of AD pathogenesis. Previously we suggested that positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase (SERCA) pump may help to stabilize cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and exert neuroprotective effects in AD neurons. In the current manuscript, we demonstrate synaptoprotective properties of several SERCA PAMs using an in vitro model of amyloid toxicity. Based on in vitro experiments, we selected the SERCA PAM NDC-9009 for in vivo evaluation in male and female 5xFAD transgenic mice model of Alzheimer's disease. Using the miniscope imaging technique, we observed hyperactivity and abnormal connectivity of hippocampal neuronal ensembles 5xFAD mice. We further discovered that the function of the hippocampal neuronal circuits in 5xFAD mice was normalized by NDC-9009 intraperitoneal administration. NDC-9009 intraperitoneal administration also rescued memory defects in 5xFAD mice as quantified by the fear conditioning behavioral test and significantly reduced accumulation of amyloid plaques in hippocampal region of these mice. The obtained results support the potential utility of NDC-9009 and other SERCA PAMs as lead molecules for development of disease-modifying treatments for AD and potentially other neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

                <p>Microsaccades are miniature saccades performed during visual fixation that were shown to play a pivotal role in active sensing. Recent studies suggested that pre-microsaccadic attention may underlie the enhanced visual processing at the stimulus site. However, the neuronal mechanism underlying this phenomenon at the foveal scale remains unknown. Using voltage-sensitive dye imaging, we investigated the neural responses to uninstructed, spontaneous microsaccades in the fovea of the primary visual cortex (V1) in behaving monkeys (macaque, male). We found that prior to microsaccades onset toward a small visual stimulus, the neuronal activity at the current and future landing stimulus sites was enhanced relative to microsaccades away from the stimulus. This enhancement was spatially confined to the current and future landing stimulus sites, which appeared to merge along the microsaccades (&lt;1&nbsp;deg) trajectory in V1. Finally, we found a pre-microsaccadic increased synchronization at the current stimulus site. Our findings shed new light on neural modulations preceding microsaccades and suggest a link to neural signatures of attention.</p>

                <p>Negative and cognitive symptoms impair functioning in patients with psychotic illnesses [i.e., schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SZ) and bipolar I disorder with psychotic features (BD)]. Disruptions in mesocorticolimbic circuitry are hypothesized to underpin negative symptoms and cognitive impairment in patients with psychosis and may also facilitate reward-motivational deficits. In male and female patients with psychosis (<I>N</I> = 44) and healthy controls (HC = 27), we used neuroimaging to define gray matter morphology and white matter microstructure. We examined negative symptom severity with the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS), effort allocation during reward processing with the Effort Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT), and cognitive performance with the MATRICS cognitive consensus battery (MCCB). Reduced nucleus accumbens volumes in patients with psychosis were associated with higher CAINS total and motivation and pleasure subscale scores as well as lower effort expenditure for medium (50%) and high (88%) reward probability conditions during EEfRT. The fornix showed reduced fractional anisotropy in patients with psychosis. Negative associations were present between CAINS motivation and pleasure subscores and MCCB composite and subscale scores. Lower gray matter volume in cerebellar Lobule IV corresponded with impaired effort allocation during medium and high reward probability conditions and lower cognitive performance. However, Lobule IV was not correlated with CAINS scores. While nucleus accumbens volume may serve as a marker of negative symptoms in psychotic illnesses, cerebellar Lobule IV morphology may inform on cognitive impairment in patients with SZ and BD. The nucleus accumbens and Lobule IV may each contribute to reduced effort allocation during reward processing.</p>

                <p>The hippocampal formation (HF) plays a key role in avian spatial navigation. Previous studies suggest that the HF may serve different functions at various stages in pigeons&rsquo; long-distance outdoor homing flight. However, it remains unclear whether the HF exhibits specific neural responses during these stages. In this study, we employed a wearable bimodal data recording system to simultaneously capture flight trajectories and hippocampal local field potential (LFP) signals of pigeons (either sex) during outdoor homing navigation. Our results revealed significant differences in hippocampal neural responses across the initial decision-making (DM) and en route navigation (ER) stages. Specifically, elevated LFP power in theta (4&ndash;12&nbsp;Hz) and beta (12&ndash;30&nbsp;Hz) bands was detected during the DM stage compared with the ER stage, while the high-gamma (60&ndash;120&nbsp;Hz) band exhibited the opposite pattern. In addition, we examined typical theta&ndash;beta phase&ndash;amplitude coupling during the ER stage. Additionally, stage-specific hippocampal responses remained consistent across release sites. Notably, the difference in hippocampal responses across stages diminished along with the accumulation of homing experience. These results offer new insights into the role of the avian HF in homing flight navigation and suggest parallels between avian and mammalian hippocampal mechanisms in spatial learning.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/30/e0283252025?rss=1">Motion Processing in Visual Cortex of Maculopathy Patients</a></h4>

              
                <p>Previous studies on animal models suggested that visual areas involved in motion processing could undergo important cortical reorganizations following retinal damages. This could have major implications for patients suffering from macular degeneration (MD), one leading cause of vision loss. Here, we performed fMRI recordings in a group of maculopathy patients (<I>N</I> = 7, 3 women, including individuals suffering from age-related macular degeneration or from Stargardt's disease) and a control group to characterize the motion processing cortical network in MD patients and determine whether this network is modified following the onset of the scotoma. We used an experimental protocol based on random-dot kinematograms classically employed to characterize motion-selective areas in the brain. To ensure that the visual information processed by the two groups was equivalent, the visual field in each control participant was masked using an artificial scotoma directly derived from clinical measurements in their paired patient. We found that in MD patients, translational motion elicited significant and robust activations in a restricted cortical network which included the human V5/MT+ complex (hMT+), areas V3A and V6, and a portion of primary visual areas (V1, V2, and V3) connected to peripheral vision. Importantly, the same patterns of responses were also observed in control participants. Moreover, the extent and strength of activation within these motion-selective areas did not differ significantly between the two groups. Altogether, these results suggest that in humans, the motion-selective network does not undergo significant large-scale cortical reorganizations following the onset of MD.</p>

                <p>Prestin's voltage-driven motor activity confers sound-elicited somatic electromotility on auditory outer hair cells (OHCs) and is essential for the exquisite sensitivity and frequency selectivity of mammalian hearing. Lack of prestin results in ~50&nbsp;dB hearing threshold shifts across frequency, supporting the causal association of the prestin-coding gene, <I>SLC26A5</I>, with hereditary hearing loss, DFNB61. However, ~50% reduction in prestin-mediated OHC electromotility barely affects cochlear function, and it is currently unknown how much electromotility is minimally required to support normal hearing. We generated mouse models harboring two deafness-associated prestin variants, p.A100T and p.P119S, and found that these missense variants do not deprive prestin of its fast motor function but significantly reduce membrane expression, leading to 70&ndash;80% reductions in OHC electromotility. Homozygous and compound heterozygous mice of either sex for these missense variants suffered congenital hearing loss; however, they still retained relatively low hearing thresholds at lower frequencies, pointing to the clinical possibility that a small augmentation of OHC electromotility could benefit those with DFNB61 hearing loss. These mice were also found to be prone to audiogenic seizures. This study thus provides insights into the minimum OHC electromotility required for normal cochlear operation and reveals the unappreciated importance of prestin for central gain control.</p>

                <p>We often mistake visual noise for meaningful images, which sometimes appear as convincing as veridical percepts. This suggests considerable overlap between the mechanisms that underlie false and veridical perception. Yet, false percepts must arise at least in part from internally generated signals. Here, we apply multivariate analyses to human MEG data to study the overlap between veridical and false perception across two aspects of perceptual inference: discrimination of content (what did I see?) and detection (did I see something?). Male and female participants performed a visual discrimination task requiring them to indicate the orientation of a noisy grating, as well as their confidence in having seen a grating. Importantly, on 50% of trials, only a noise patch was presented. To exclude external signals driving false percepts, noise patches were carefully designed not to contain orientation signal. Still, participants occasionally confidently reported seeing a grating on noise only trials, i.e., false percepts. Decoding analyses revealed a sensory signal reflecting the content of these false percepts, despite no such grating being physically presented. Uniquely, high confidence false, but not veridical, percepts were associated with increased prestimulus high alpha/low beta [11&ndash;14 Hz] power, potentially reflecting enhanced reliance on top-down signaling on false percept trials. Later on, a shared neural code reflecting confidence in stimulus presence emerged for both false and veridical percepts. These findings suggest that false percepts arise through neural signals reflecting both sensory content and detection, similar to veridical percepts, with an increase in prestimulus alpha/beta power uniquely contributing to false percepts.</p>

                <p>by Jong-Yun Park, Mitsuaki Tsukamoto, Misato Tanaka, Yukiyasu Kamitani</p>

Reconstruction of perceptual experiences from brain activity offers a unique window into how population neural responses represent sensory information. Although decoding visual content from functional MRI (fMRI) has seen significant success, reconstructing arbitrary sounds remains challenging due to the fine temporal structure of auditory signals and the coarse temporal resolution of fMRI. Drawing on the hierarchical auditory features of deep neural networks (DNNs) with progressively larger time windows and their neural activity correspondence, we introduce a method for sound reconstruction that integrates brain decoding of DNN features and an audio-generative model. DNN features decoded from auditory cortical activity outperformed spectrotemporal and modulation-based features, enabling perceptually plausible reconstructions across diverse sound categories. Behavioral evaluations and objective measures confirmed that these reconstructions preserved short-term spectral and perceptual properties, capturing the characteristic timbre of speech, animal calls, and musical instruments, while the reconstructed sounds did not reproduce longer temporal sequences with fidelity. Leave-category-out analyses indicated that the method generalizes across sound categories. Reconstructions at higher DNN layers and from early auditory regions revealed distinct contributions to decoding performance. Applying the model to a selective auditory attention (“cocktail party”) task further showed that reconstructions reflected the attended sound more strongly than the unattended one in some of the subjects. Despite its inability to reconstruct exact temporal sequences, which may reflect the limited temporal resolution of fMRI, our framework demonstrates the feasibility of mapping brain activity to auditory experiences—a step toward more comprehensive understanding and reconstruction of internal auditory representations.

<i>Legionella pneumophila</i> utilizes a type IVB secretion system (T4SS) to translocate over 300 effector proteins into host cells, hijacking cellular processes, including those within the mitochondrion. Currently, no <i>Legionella</i> effectors have been identified at the mitochondrial outer membrane, a critical interface between the organelle and the rest of the cell. We screened the <i>Legionella</i> effector repertoire for features of mitochondrial tail-anchored (TA) proteins and identified four putative TA effectors. Among them, <i>Lp</i>PIP (Lpg1625) localizes to the mitochondrial outer membrane and interacts with all three isoforms of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) via an RVxF motif. <i>Lp</i>PIP functions as a PP1-interacting protein (PIP) as PP1 remains catalytically active upon interaction with <i>Lp</i>PIP to the dephosphorylate mitochondrial outer membrane proteins. Altering the TA signature to direct <i>Lp</i>PIP to the ER induces ER-recruitment of PP1 and dephosphorylation of ER-resident proteins, indicating that <i>Lp</i>PIP controls PP1 localization and not substrate specificity. This study uncovers a novel pathogen-mediated strategy to modulate PP1 and manipulate the host cell phosphoproteome.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Elezanumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds repulsive guidance molecule a (RGMa), an inhibitor of central nervous system regeneration after inflammation or injury. The aim was to assess the safety and efficacy of elezanumab in relapsing and progressive forms of multiple sclerosis (MS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>RADIUS-R and RADIUS-P were phase 2 trials in relapsing (RADIUS-R) or progressive (RADIUS-P) MS. Participants were randomized to intravenous elezanumab 400mg, 1800mg, or placebo every 4 weeks through week 48. The primary endpoint was the mean Overall Response Score (ORS).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In RADIUS-R, 208 participants received elezanumab 400mg (n = 69), elezanumab 1800mg (n = 69), or placebo (n = 70). In RADIUS-P, 123 participants received elezanumab 400mg (n = 40), elezanumab 1800mg (n = 40), or placebo (n = 43). The primary endpoint of ORS was not met in either study. For RADIUS-R, mean ORS was −0.2 with effect size of −0.2 for elezanumab 400mg and −0.2 with effect size of −0.2 for elezanumab 1800mg. For RADIUS-P, mean ORS was 0.0 with effect size of 0.0 for elezanumab 400mg and 0.1 with effect size of 0.1 for elezanumab 1800mg.</p>
<p>Elezanumab was well tolerated; the rate of serious adverse events was similar across treatment groups in both studies. Adverse events with ≥10% of elezanumab population were falls, urinary tract infections, headaches in RADIUS-R and RADIUS-P, and also fatigue, infusion-related reactions, and muscular weakness in RADIUS-P.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Elezanumab was safe and well tolerated, but did not meet the primary endpoint in either study. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

     alt="A Regional Ultrastructural Analysis of the Cellular and Synaptic Architecture of the Mouse Vestibular Periphery, With Reference to the Chinchilla"/>
<p>Synaptic innervation in mouse inner ear vestibular hair cells has been a topic of interest lately, with the revelation of the importance of non-quantal transmission in Type I hair cells. Transmission electron microscopy and the dissector sampling method were used to assess synaptic ribbon counts per hair cell. We showed that although central Type I hair cells contain fewer synaptic ribbons, their calyces also receive a significant input from Type II hair cells on their outer surface. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The mouse utricular macula is increasingly being used as a model preparation to study the vestibular periphery because we can generate transgenic mice to investigate molecular details of development and function. Yet, detailed knowledge of its synaptic innervation is lacking or inconsistent. Accurate ribbon synapse numbers and location are needed to quantitatively model quantal transmission in the mouse, as has recently been done for non-quantal transmission in the Type I vestibular HC (Govindaraju et al. 2023). We investigated this at the ultrastructural level, as we have done previously in the chinchilla and squirrel monkey. The same investigative methods that we used in those previous studies (dissector and transmission electron microscopy [TEM]) were used to confirm recent confocal and TEM studies of the synaptic ribbons contained in the two types of vestibular HCs, Type I (enveloped by a large calyceal, or chalice-shaped, terminal) and Type II (contacted by more conventional synaptic boutons). Because vestibular function varies depending on specific regions in the sensory epithelium (central/striolar, peripheral/extrastriolar), the present study examined the different regions and found both regional and cell-type variations. Synaptic ribbon numbers were higher in Type II than in Type I HCs in both the utricular macula and the crista ampullaris. Previous work in chinchilla crista ampullaris had a gradient of synaptic ribbons in Type I HCs, being more numerous in the central zone versus the periphery. In the mouse crista (present study), the opposite was true; ribbon numbers were slightly higher in the periphery. For comparison to the mouse utricle, we also collected new data from the chinchilla utricular macula in this study. Finally, a variety of ribbon shapes were present in the vestibular epithelium, ranging from spheroid to elongated and intermediate forms. The reasons for these observed variations in shapes are unknown. These data should inform future functional and modeling studies of the vestibular sensory epithelium.</p>

     alt="Hidden Markov Model-Based Behavioral Classification Reveals Visual Function Recovery After Retinal Organoid Transplantation in Mice"/>
<p>A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) framework classifies mouse locomotion into three behavioral states—Resting, Exploring, and Navigating—revealing how depth perception and adaptive responses to a visual cliff evolve across conditions. Wild-type mice show visually guided avoidance and rapid habituation with state collapse. Blind (rd1-2J) mice lack a cliff response, but transplanted mice recover depth perception by week 2 post-transplantation, peaking at week 16 and later habituating similarly to sighted mice.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Retinal degenerative diseases cause irreversible vision loss due to photoreceptor degeneration. Retinal organoid transplantation offers a promising strategy for restoring vision, but assessing functional recovery remains challenging. Standard visual function tests provide binary or coarse measures that do not fully capture how visual input influences natural behavior. Here, we applied a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based behavioral analysis to the visual cliff test to track locomotor state transitions in wild-type (WT) and rd1-2 J (RD) mice, evaluating depth perception and its recovery following photoreceptor transplantation. WT mice exhibited a strong cliff avoidance response, while RD mice showed no response, confirming the model's sensitivity to depth perception. Over repeated trials, WT mice rapidly habituated, shifting from three behavioral states (Resting, Exploring, and Navigating) to just two (Resting and Navigating). Transplanted RD mice began responding to the cliff at 2 weeks posttransplantation, coinciding with early synapse formation between grafted photoreceptors and host bipolar cells. The avoidance response became robust by 16 weeks but disappeared by 18 weeks, accompanied by state collapse, a hallmark of habituation never observed in untreated RD mice. These findings demonstrate that behavioral state-based analysis provides a sensitive and dynamic measure of functional vision recovery, capturing not only the emergence of depth perception but also its integration into adaptive behavior. This approach may help refine clinical evaluations of vision restoration therapies, bridging the gap between sensory recovery and real-world functional outcomes.</p>
