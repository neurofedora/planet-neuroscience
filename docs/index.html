">Locus coeruleus-related insula activation supports implicit learning</a></h4>

              
                The noradrenergic locus coeruleus and its neuromodulatory cortical projections are critical for adaptive behavior, yet their contributions to implicit learning in novel environments remain incompletely understood, due to challenges in non-invasive assessment. Here, we combined multimodal neuroimaging -- including locus-coeruleus-sensitive structural MRI, concurrent pupillometry--fMRI, and PET-derived noradrenergic transporter maps -- with repeated behavioral assessments to investigate noradrenergic contributions to implicit learning across younger and older adults (n = 77). Salient expectation-violating stimuli elicited pupil dilation, indicating enhanced neuromodulation, activated the action-mode network and deactivated the default-mode network. Pupil-linked BOLD responses suggested a functional coupling between the locus coeruleus and action-mode network, further supported by spatial overlap of activation patterns with PET-derived noradrenergic transporter maps. Locus coeruleus MRI-guided functional connectivity analyses demonstrated that locus coeruleus activity is coupled to anterior insula activation, suggesting a noradrenergic role in shifting cortical dynamics toward action-oriented processing. Behaviorally, participants implicitly learned the statistical task structure over time, as evidenced by reaction time adjustments based on stimulus probabilities. Critically, stronger locus coeruleus integrity, greater task-related anterior insula activation, and more pronounced pupil dilation were associated with enhanced implicit learning, highlighting the behavioral relevance of noradrenergic neuromodulation. Notably, noradrenergic responses and their link to learning were preserved across age groups, suggesting a robust noradrenergic role in supporting adaptive behavior throughout adulthood. These findings provide novel insights into the neuromodulatory mechanisms underlying learning and cognitive flexibility, emphasizing the pivotal role of locus coeruleus--action-mode network interactions in behavioral adaptation.

">Excess prenatal folic acid supplementation alters cortical gene expression networks and electrophysiology</a></h4>

              
                Folate is crucial for various biological processes, with deficiencies during pregnancy being linked to increased risk for neural tube defects and neurodevelopmental disorders. As a proactive measure, folic acid fortification in foods has been mandated in many countries, in addition to dietary supplementation recommendations during pregnancy. However, the risks of excess prenatal folic acid supply have yet to be fully understood. To better appreciate in utero molecular changes in mouse brain exposed to 5-fold folic acid excess over normal supplementation, we investigated the transcriptome and methylome for alterations in gene networks. RNA-seq analysis of cerebral cortex collected at birth, revealed significant expression differences in 646 genes with major roles in protein translation. Whole genome bisulfite sequencing revealed 910 significantly differentially methylated regions with functions enriched in glutamatergic synapse and glutathione pathways. To explore the physiological consequences of excess prenatal folic acid exposure, we applied high-density microelectrode arrays to record network-level firing patterns of dissociated cortical neurons. Folic acid excess-derived cortical neurons exhibited significantly altered network activity, characterized by reduced burst amplitude and increased burst frequency, indicating compromised network synchronization. These functional deficits align with the observed molecular alterations in glutamatergic synapse pathways, underscoring the potential for excess prenatal folic acid exposure to disrupt developing metabolic and neurological pathways.

">Whole brain dimensional approach identifies shared and sex-specific networks of stress susceptibility in male and female mice.</a></h4>

              
                Background: Stress is a significant risk factor for depression and anxiety, two highly comorbid disorders with sex differences in symptom presentation and prevalence. The Chronic Variable Stress (CVS) mouse model is a useful method for examining sex-specific susceptibility, as stress can be titrated in a sex-specific manner to produce depressive- and anxiety-like behaviours across both sexes. However, the sex-specific mechanisms regarding how CVS reorganizes brain anatomy remain unclear. Methods: Using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we provide the first whole-brain characterization of neuroanatomical changes induced by 6 or 28 days of exposure to CVS in female and male mice, respectively, and their association to behavior. We then examined the structural connectome underlying sex-specific latent dimensions of stress-susceptibility and potential molecular mechanisms using spatial gene expression analyses. Results: CVS induced significant neuroanatomical changes in regions already implicated in depression in both sexes (e.g. nucleus accumbens and hippocampus) as well as female- and male-specific neuroanatomical changes. In females, these changes were associated with both depressive- and anxiety-like behavior. While in males, we identified two orthogonal dimensions of neuroanatomical changes associated with anxiety-like behavior or social preference. These latent dimensions are associated with sex-specific hub regions and, in females, were associated with genes enriched for protein localization to the cell surface. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that different durations of CVS result in similar neuroanatomical changes in both sexes, however the direction of change and association to behavior is sex-specific. In females, these changes may be attributed to alterations in synaptic connectivity.

">A theory and recipe to construct general and biologically plausible integrating continuous attractor neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Across the brain, circuits with continuous attractor dynamics underpin the representation and storage in memory of continuous variables for motor control, navigation, and mental computations. The represented variables have various dimensions and topologies (lines, rings, euclidean planes), and the circuits exhibit continua of fixed points to store these variables, and the ability to use input velocity signals to update and maintain the representation of unobserved variables, effectively integrating the incoming velocity signal. Integration constitutes a general computational strategy that enables variable state estimation when direct observation of the variable is not possible, suggesting that it may play a critical role in other cognitive processes. While some neural network models for integration exist, a comprehensive theory for constructing neural circuits with a given topology and integration capabilities is lacking. Here, we present a theoretically-driven design framework, Manifold Attractor Direct Engineering (MADE), to automatically, analytically, and explicitly construct biologically plausible continuous attractor neural networks with diverse user-specified topologies. We show how these attractor networks can be endowed with accurate integration functionality through biologically realistic circuit mechanisms. MADE networks closely resemble biological circuits where the attractor mechanisms have been characterized. Additionally, MADE offers innovative and minimal circuit models for uncharacterized topologies, enabling a systematic approach to developing and testing mathematical theories related to cognition and computation in the brain.

">The Parkinsons disease associated Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 affects expression of Transferrin receptor 1 and phosphorylation of key signaling proteins in human iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons</a></h4>

              
                Several variants in the Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene account for familiar and sporadic late-onset Parkinsons disease (PD). LRRK2 is a large, multifunctional kinase involved in different intracellular pathways crucial for homeostasis and cell survival. One of the poorly understood mechanisms of Parkinsonism is the iron accumulation in Substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Transferrin receptor 1 (TfR) plays a significant role for iron uptake into the cell. Here, we investigated the expression of TfR in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived dopaminergic neurons (hDANs) generated from PD patients carrying the LRRK2 p.G2019S form and found dysregulated TfR levels. In addition, we found gene status depending variations of LRRK2 expression in differentiated hDANs, while neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) did not display these changes. This suggests an unknown regulatory mechanism of LRRK2 expression during dopaminergic differentiation. Further investigations showed dysregulated phosphorylation of the PD-associated GSK-3{beta} und the key signaling factor Akt.

">Functional organization of the spinal locomotor network based on analysis of interneuronal activity</a></h4>

              
                Locomotion is a vital motor function for any leaving being. In vertebrates, a basic locomotor pattern is generated by the spinal locomotor network (SLN). Although SLN has been extensively studied, due to technical difficulties, most data were obtained during fictive locomotion, and data about activity of spinal neurons during locomotion with intact sensory feedback from limbs are extremely limited. Here, we overcame the technical problems and recorded activity of putative spinal interneurons from spinal segments L4-L6 during treadmill locomotion (with intact sensory feedback from limbs) evoked by stimulation of the mesencephalic locomotor region in the decerebrate cat. We analyzed activity phases of recorded interneurons, by using a new method that took into account the previously ignored information about stability of neuronal modulation in the sequential locomotor cycles. We suggested that neurons with stable modulation (i.e. small dispersion of their activity phase in sequential cycles) represent the core of SLN. Our analysis allowed to reveal functional groups of neurons with stable modulation presumably generating the vertical and horizontal components of the step, and to characterize their location in the spinal cord. Analysis of relationships between activity phases of these groups revealed possible connections between them, suggesting a novel model for generation of locomotion that combines reciprocally active half-centers with a ring consisting of four sequentially active groups, each inactivating the preceding one and activating the next one.

">Neural Networks and Foundation Models: Two Strategies for EEG-to-fMRI Prediction</a></h4>

              
                Electroencephalography (EEG) and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) are two widely used neuroimaging techniques, with complementary strengths and weaknesses. Predicting fMRI activity from EEG activity could give us the best of both worlds, and open new horizons for neuroscience research and neurotechnology applications. Here, we formulate this prediction objective both as a classification task (predicting whether the fMRI signal increases or decreases) and a regression task (predicting the value of this signal). We follow two distinct strategies: training classical machine learning and deep learning models (including MLP, CNN, RNN, and transformer) on an EEG-fMRI dataset, or leveraging the capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models. We show that predicting fMRI activity from EEG activity is possible for the brain regions defined by the Harvard-Oxford cortical atlas, in the context of subjects performing a neurofeedback task. Interestingly, both strategies yield promising results, possibly highlighting two complementary paths for our prediction objective. Furthermore, a Chain-of-Thought approach demonstrates that LLMs can infer the cognitive functions associated with EEG data, and subsequently predict the fMRI data from these cognitive functions. The natural combination of the two strategies, i.e., fine-tuning an LLM on an EEG-fMRI dataset, is not straightforward and would certainly require further study. These findings could provide important insights for enhancing neural interfaces and advancing toward a multimodal foundation model for neuroscience, integrating EEG, fMRI, and possibly other neuroimaging modalities.

">Repeated restraint stress-induced increase in post-surgical somatosensory hypersensitivity and affective responding is mediated by β-adrenergic receptor activation and spinal NLRP3-IL1β signalling in male rats</a></h4>

              
                Pre-surgical stress is a well-recognised risk factor for persistent post-surgical pain, and while the precise underlying neurobiological mechanisms remain unknown, neuro-immune interactions are believed to play a pivotal role. Here, we investigated the effect of repeated restraint stress (RRS) on post-surgical somatosensory hypersensitivity and affective responding in male rats and examined underlying mechanisms mediating these effects. We showed that RRS induced behavioural despair in the forced swim test, reduced body weight gain and elevated faecal corticosterone levels in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Following paw-incision surgery, animals pre-exposed to RRS exhibited exacerbated mechanical and heat hypersensitivity, pain-related aversion, and anxiety-like behaviour compared to non-stress counterparts. RNAseq analysis revealed alterations in glial and neuro-immune pathways in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord in the RRS + paw incision group compared to paw incision alone, data further confirmed by increased microglial activity and inflammatory gene expression (iba1, itgam, il-1{beta} and nlrp3). Intrathecal administration of IL-1Ra or MCC950 (an NLRP3 inhibitor) attenuated the RRS-induced increase in pain-related aversion and mechanical hypersensitivity post-surgery. Chronic administration of RU486, a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, prevented RRS-induced despair-like behaviour but did not alter the effects of RRS on pain-related aversion or mechanical hypersensitivity post-surgery. In contrast, chronic administration of propranolol, a {beta}-adrenergic receptor antagonist and sympathetic nervous system inhibitor, not only prevented the RRS-induced despair-like behaviour but also attenuated exacerbation of mechanical hypersensitivity, pain-related aversion, and anxiety-like behaviour post-surgery. These findings suggest that RRS exacerbates and prolongs post-surgical somatosensory and affective pain responding via {beta}-adrenergic receptor activation and increased spinal microglial NLRP3-IL1{beta} signalling. These data provide further insight into the mechanisms by which chronic stress and mood disorders exacerbate and prolong post-surgical pain.

">MAPT Splicing Modulators as a Therapeutic Strategy for Tauopathies</a></h4>

              
                Tauopathies are neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the abnormal accumulation of microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) in the brain. These disorders, like frontotemporal dementia (FTD-Tau), currently lack effective therapies and can occur sporadically or be inherited when associated with MAPT gene mutations. The MAPT gene region encompassing exon 10 and adjacent introns is a hotspot for pathogenic variants, including splicing mutations that enhance exon 10 inclusion and increase 4R tau expression, and gain-of-function mutations that generate aggregation-prone mutant 4R tau protein. For these 4R-specific tauopathies, a targeted mRNA splicing approach that promotes exon 10 exclusion may offer therapeutic benefit. In this study, we discovered novel splicing modulator compounds (SMCs) that promote MAPT exon 10 exclusion, and demonstrated their efficacy in FTD patient-derived neuronal models carrying the tau-P301L gain-of-function mutation or the tau-S305N splicing mutation. Treatment with SMC reduced 4R tau expression and decreased the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau (pTau), oligomeric and insoluble tau, thereby rescuing tau-associated neuronal toxicity. Importantly, our lead SMC corrected the 3R/4R splice ratio in vivo and significantly reduced pTau in the brain of a gene-replacement (GR) mouse model expressing the human tau-N279K splicing mutation. These findings support the therapeutic potential of this class of small molecules and establish MAPT pre-mRNA splicing modulation as a promising strategy for the treatment of 4R tauopathies.

">Disruption of grin2A, an epilepsy-associated gene, produces altered spontaneous swim behavior in zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) control synaptic plasticity and brain development in a manner determined by receptor subunit composition. Pathogenic variants in GRIN2A gene, encoding the NMDAR GluN2A subunit, can cause gain or loss of function of receptors containing the affected subunit, and are associated with intellectual disability and epilepsy in patients. While in-vitro studies of recombinant receptors have yielded some insights, animal experimental models are essential to better understand the relationship between the molecular pathology of the variants and the disease. Here we introduce a zebrafish model of GluN2A loss of function to study system-level effects of zebrafish grin2Aa and grin2Ab gene deletion. Our electrophysiological analysis revealed functional differences between receptors containing zebrafish GluN2Aa/b and GluN2Bb paralogs comparable to mammalian receptors containing GluN2A vs. GluN2B subunits. Both grin2Aa-/- and grin2Ab-/-, as well as double-knockout grin2A-/- zebrafish larvae showed increased locomotor activity in a novel environment. Proteomic analysis suggested that the relative proportion of GluN2B-containing NMDARs may be increased in grin2A mutant fish. Our results highlight fundamental similarities between zebrafish and mammalian NMDAR signaling and validate the use of zebrafish as a model organism to study the neurodevelopmental role of NMDARs. The newly created transgenic zebrafish strains complement the rodent models of GluN2A loss of function and can be used for high-throughput testing of pharmacological or genetic treatment strategies for patients with GRIN2A gene variants.

">Expectation modulates the hedonic experiences of and midbrain responses to sweet flavour</a></h4>

              
                Non-nutritive sweeteners are sugar substitutes that may promote weight management by reducing an individual's calorie intake. It is, however, unclear whether (i) sugar and non-nutritive sweetener elicit distinct orosensory responses in the human brain, and (ii) whether the neural responses to these flavours are modulated by expectancy. Addressing these questions has direct relevance to our understanding of food choice behaviour and how it may be modified in dietary interventions. We screened N=99 healthy adults to select a sample (N=27, M[SD]age = 24.25[2.94] years) who reported similar perceptual experiences of sugar and sweetener, thus removing a potential confound of sensory differences, for fMRI scanning. While scanning, they received sugar- and artificially-sweetened beverages in two conditioning paradigms, which both manipulated participants expectation of flavour delivery: first in a probabilistic and second in a deterministic way. Participants ability to accurately distinguish sugar from non-nutritive sweetener depended largely on their expectations, which also significantly affected the perceived pleasantness of each flavour. Expectation altered brain responses to flavour delivery during the deterministic task only, where the (mistaken) expectation of sugar significantly increased midbrain responses to sweetener compared to when sweetener was expected. Trial-wise confidence and pleasantness ratings differentially augmented brain responses to sugar and sweetener delivery. These results highlight the importance of expectancy in both the behavioural and neural encoding of sweet flavour, particularly in the context of unreliable sensory information. The expectation of sugar appears to increase the subjective value of noncaloric sweetener, which may result from flavour-nutrient conditioning that preferentially reinforcers sugar.

">Trpv1-dependent Cacna1b gene inactivation reveals cell-specific functions of CaV2.2 channels in vivo</a></h4>

              
                Voltage-gated CaV2.2 channels underlie the N-type current, and they regulate calcium entry at many presynaptic nerve endings to control transmitter release. A role for CaV2.2 channels has been well-established in the transmission of pain information using pharmacological and global gene inactivated mouse models. However, investigation of the cell-specific actions of CaV2.2 channels would benefit from the availability of cell-restricted knockout mouse models and particularly in dissecting behavioral responses that depend on CaV2.2 channel activity. Here, we show the importance of CaV2.2 channels in Trpv1-lineage neurons in behavioral responses to sensory stimuli using Cre-dependent inactivation of the Cacna1b gene. Our work shows the cell-type specificity of CaV2.2 channels in mediating rapidly developing heat hypersensitivity and the utility of Cre-dependent inactivation of Cacna1b to discern cell-specific CaV2.2 channel functions.

">Spatial Richness of Neural Magnetic Fields</a></h4>

              
                Brain implants that measure neural magnetic fields, rather than electrical potentials, are expected to confer significant clinical advantages related to implant longevity and signal fidelity due to the elimination of the electrode-tissue interface. However, the informational differences between neural electrical potentials and magnetic fields remain poorly understood. Using a mathematical formalism based on neuronal current sources, we directly establish the complementary informational content of extracellular magnetic fields and electrical potentials. We then use computational modeling to illustrate how dense networks of neurons are easier to distinguish and spike sort on the basis of their magnetic, rather than electrical, spike templates. Lastly, we show how the solenoidal nature of neural magnetic fields facilitates approximate morphological reconstruction, even with sparse sensor arrays. Our findings highlight the unique experimental advantages of neural magnetic field sensing, motivating the development of compact, low-noise devices capable of meeting the stringent sensitivity requirements for single-shot cortical recordings.

">Region-specific Brain Targets Drive Circuit Formation and Maturation of Human Retinal Ganglion Cells</a></h4>

              
                Human vision relies on retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), and their connectivity with distinct brain regions enables higher order visual processing. RGCs vary considerably between species, and small model organisms display distinct RGC innervation patterns from that in humans. There is thus a need for robust models of human RGC circuit formation that preserves innervation specificity. Here, we developed an in vitro microfluidics eye-to-brain connectivity model using human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived RGCs to assess brain region-specific connectivity features. We find that cultured human RGCs segregate their dendrites and axons and display axonal features that align with that of their in vivo human RGC counterparts. The addition of region-specific brain targets to human RGC axons terminals resulted in differential RGC connectivity with distinct retinorecipient brain regions. Increased synapse formation occurred between RGCs and lateral geniculate neurons relative to that with superchiasmatic nucleus neurons, mirroring in vivo innervation differences. Both retinorecipient partners induced the formation of more synapses relative to non-retinorecipient brain target controls. These results suggest that human RGC innervation properties are preserved in culture systems and that human RGCs can differentially sense and respond to retinorecipient targets to control wiring outcomes. These systems may aid in the discovery of human-specific wiring factors for potential therapeutic applications.

">NT5DC2 downregulation suppresses monoamine oxidase activity and increases catecholamine levels in PC12D cells</a></h4>

              
                Back ground Genome-wide association studies have revealed the involvement of 5'-nucleotidase domain-containing protein 2 (NT5DC2) in neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder; however, its function remains unclear. Recently, we found that NT5DC2 downregulation in PC12D cells increases catecholamine synthesis by promoting the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase and that monoamine oxidase A (MAO A) might bind to NT5DC2 using Affinity Purification-Mass Spectroscopy. Methods and Results We investigated the role of NT5DC2 for MAO A activity in PC12D cells. Western blot analysis revealed that NT5DC2 primarily binds to the non-phosphorylated form of MAO A. siRNA-mediated NT5DC2 downregulation reduced MAO A activity, leading to decreased dopamine metabolism and increased noradrenaline synthesis. Conclusion Our findings suggest that NT5DC2 could affect both tyrosine hydroxylase and MAO A activity to control catecholamine synthesis. Therefore, our study provides valuable insights into disorders associated with catecholamine dysregulation, such as Parkinson's disease and neuropsychiatric disorders.

">Unveiling the Developmental Dynamics and Functional Role of Odorant Receptor Co-receptor (Orco) in Aedes albopictus: A Novel Mechanism for Regulating Tuning Odorant Receptor Expression</a></h4>

              
                As one of the most aggressive disease vectors, the Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus relies heavily on its olfactory system to search for food in the larval stage, locate hosts after eclosion, and identify suitable oviposition sites after blood feeding. In mosquitoes and other insects, the olfactory system detects environmental odors primarily through a diverse repertoire of tuning odorant receptors (ORs), which require the highly conserved odorant receptor co-receptor (Orco) to function. While Orco's role in enabling tuning receptor function is well established, its cellular localization patterns, developmental expression dynamics, and system-wide impact on olfactory physiology and behavior remain understudied in Ae. albopictus. To address this knowledge gap, we leveraged the Q-system to systematically characterize Orco-expressing neurons (ORNs) across embryonic, larval, pupal and adult stages of Ae. albopictus. We uncovered a dramatic reorganization of the olfactory system during metamorphosis: ORNs were observed as early as the embryonic stage and expanded during larval development before rapid degeneration and re-generation in the pupal stage resulting in the final population of adult ORNs. Orco expression in adults spanned the olfactory neurons of the antennae, labella, and maxillary palps in both male and female mosquitoes, consistent with its conserved peripheral distribution. To further investigate the functional implications of Orco, we generate Orco knockout mutants and strikingly discovered that Orco knockout mutants displayed significant widespread downregulation of tuning Ors, suggesting that Orco may influence OR expression or stability. Electrophysiological recordings confirmed significantly attenuated responses to human volatiles in Orco mutants, and behavioral assays demonstrated a marked decline in blood-feeding efficiency and elimination of host preference in females. Together, these findings reveal dynamic reorganization of ORNs during mosquito development and uncover the critical role of Orco in maintaining the integrity and function of the olfactory system, providing insights which may inform novel, next-generation vector control strategies.

">Adaptation in somatosensory afferents improves rate and temporal coding of vibrotactile stimulus features</a></h4>

              
                Adaptation is a common neural phenomenon wherein sustained stimulation evokes fewer action potentials (spikes) over time. Rather than simply reduce firing rate, adaptation may help neurons form better (i.e. more discriminable) representations of sensory input. To study effects of adaptation in low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs), we recorded single unit LTMR responses to 30-second-long vibrotactile stimuli with different intensities and frequencies applied to the hind paw of rats. To assess the impact of adaptation on somatosensory encoding, decoders were applied to the initial and late (adapted) phases of population-level responses to assess the decodability (discrimination) of stimulus intensity and frequency. Adaptation-mediated changes in the rate and timing (phase-locking) of spikes were quantified. Rate coding of stimulus intensity was improved by the nonuniform reduction in firing rate across responses to different stimuli, and across neurons. This improvement was absent in simulations with uniform reductions in firing rate, thus revealing the necessity of stimulus-dependent variability in adaptation effects. Spike timing (quantified as interspike intervals) remained highly informative about stimulus frequency throughout stimulation despite the progressive reduction in spike count over time. When the drop in spike count was accounted for, adaptation was found to improve temporal coding of stimulus frequency by increasing the precision of phase-locking. In other words, adaptation improved the precision of spike timing, and this increased the information about stimulus frequency conveyed by each spike. These results show that adaptation, by modulating spiking in different ways, can improve encoding of different stimulus features using different coding schemes.

">Systems biology analysis of vasodynamics in mouse cerebral arterioles during resting state and functional hyperemia</a></h4>

              
                Cerebral hemodynamics is tightly regulated by arteriolar vasodynamics. In this study, a systems biology approach was employed to investigate how the interplay between passive, myogenic, neurogenic, and astrocytic responses shapes arteriolar vasodynamics in small rodents. A model of neurovascular coupling is proposed in which neurons inhibit and dampen the myogenic response to promote vasodilation during activation, and facilitate the myogenic response to promote rapid vasoconstriction immediately post-activation. In this model, inhibition of the myogenic response is mediated by the hyperpolarization of smooth muscle and endothelial cells. Dampening and facilitation of the response are mediated by neuronal production of nitric oxide and release of neuropeptide Y, respectively. We also introduce a model for gliovascular coupling, in which astrocytes periodically inhibit the myogenic response upon detecting an increase in myogenic activity through interactions between their endfeet and arterioles. Our study revealed that in the resting state, the interplay between the delayed myogenic response and passive distension, acting as negative and positive feedbacks respectively, generates undamped oscillations in vessel diameter, known as vasomotion. In the active state, these oscillations are disrupted by the neurogenic and astrocytic responses. The biophysical model of arteriolar vasodynamics presented in this study lays the foundation for quantitative analysis of cerebral hemodynamics for cerebrovascular health diagnostics and hemodynamic neuroimaging.

">Modulation of cofilin 1 phosphorylation induces juvenile-like plasticity in the adult mouse visual cortex.</a></h4>

              
                Cofilin 1 is an actin-depolymerizing protein that plays a fundamental role in actin dynamics, particularly within dendritic spines, where it has been implicated in both structural and functional plasticity. We recently demonstrated (by differential proteomics, western blot and immunohistochemistry) that the expression of cofilin 1 and its inactive phosphorylated form are dynamically regulated in the mouse visual cortex during postnatal development and by visual experience, with expression levels correlating with periods of heightened plasticity. In this study, we investigated the role of cofilin 1 in structural and visual plasticity in adult mice through pharmacological modulation of its activity. Specifically, we administered a synthetic peptide inhibitor of cofilin 1 activity in vivo (PCOF). Following monocular deprivation, adult mice received either the PCOF peptide or a control peptide. Structural plasticity was assessed by quantifying dendritic spine density using Golgi-like staining, while visual plasticity was evaluated by measuring visual acuity through the optomotor response test. Our results show that, in adult mice treated with the PCOF peptide - but not in controls - monocular deprivation led to a significant reduction in dendritic spine density in the contralateral visual cortex, as well as a decrease in visual acuity of the previously deprived eye. These findings indicate that cofilin 1 activity is crucial for the regulation of experience-dependent plasticity in the adult mouse visual cortex.

">Cognitive Load Impairs Professional Scepticism in Decision-Making: The Mitigating Role of Default Nudges</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive overload may compromise critical competencies essential for effective auditing, including fraud detection and risk assessment. Auditors, tasked with processing extensive information under time constraints, may experience difficulties in maintaining professional scepticism, a fundamental mechanism that supports these core evaluative functions. Default nudges or pre-selected options, subtly shape choices with the premise of easing cognitive load and ultimately enhancing audit performance. This study examined how cognitive load and default nudges shape decision-making-based professional scepticism. In three online experiments, we investigated how default nudges influence professional scepticism under varying cognitive loads among auditors. Experiment 1 validated a cognitive load manipulation (minimal, low, medium, high) using reaction time and accuracy, selecting low and high load conditions for further study. Experiment 2 confirmed load-dependent reaction time increases, with audit task accuracy remaining stable. Experiment 3a tested the effect of default nudge on professional scepticism under varying levels of cognitive load, revealing that nudging accelerated responses and improved audit accuracy, but only under cognitive load. Experiment 3b explored default-setting-response alignment, showing that nudging toward considering an accounting item as "non-aggressive" (e.g., not indicative of fraud), the less sceptical and most common case, enhanced accuracy, whereas nudging toward considering the item "aggressive", reduced it. These findings highlight how cognitive load disrupts scepticism and suggest that strategically placed nudges can enhance audit decision-making based professional scepticism under pressure. Insights from this study have direct implications for high-stakes professions, where optimized decision environments could support critical judgment under cognitive strain.

">Separable global and local beta burst dynamics in motor cortex of primates</a></h4>

              
                Sensorimotor beta band oscillations are known to modulate during normal movement control and abnormal beta modulation is linked to pathological bradykinesia. However, the functional differences between beta localized to one brain area versus beta synchronized across brain areas remains unclear. We monitored beta bursts in non-human primates, both neurotypical and stroke-impaired, during the performance of complex motor tasks. Across both groups of animals, we identified two distinct beta burst types: global bursts that tend to be synchronized across cortical and subcortical areas, and local bursts that tend to be confined to cortex. These two types exhibited distinct neural dynamics, with global bursts linked to reduced firing variability and overall slowed movements. In contrast, local bursts often occurred during the execution of complex behaviors, particularly during prehension. We found evidence for changes in the distribution of global and local bursts during recovery after stroke. In impaired animals early after stroke, global bursts predominated and were associated with reduced speed and impaired grasping. Notably, recovery of grasping was associated with a reduction in global bursts and an increase in local bursts, suggesting that local bursts may play an important role during prehension. Our findings reveal distinct roles of global and local beta bursts and indicate that the normalization of global and local burst timing tracks recovery of dexterity.

                The tactile temporal order judgment (TOJ) task is widely used in multisensory neuroscience. Participants judge which of two tactile stimuli, one on each hand, came first. A key finding is that TOJ performance declines when the arms are crossed, likely due to interactions between tactile, proprioceptive, and visual information. The TOJ crossing effect has been widely reported, but studies have employed various analysis methods, leaving open whether the choice of method influences the effect's magnitude. Moreover, some studies have reported modulations by the availability of visual information, response modality, or speeded response requirements. Through an exhaustive, systematic literature search, we identified 37 experiments that investigated the TOJ crossing effect. Meta-analysis estimated the effect size at approximately 1.4. The moderators did not significantly affect this estimate, though this is likely due to too few studies being available to obtain sufficient statistical power. The large effect size supports the TOJ task's use in other, e.g. developmental and clinical, research. However, the lack of statistically significant effect modulation by the moderators calls for caution when applying it for research questions beyond the crossing effect itself.

">An intracortical brain-computer interface for navigation in virtual reality in macaque monkeys</a></h4>

              
                We present an innovative intracortical Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) to bridge the gap between laboratory settings and real-world applications. This BCI approach introduces three key advancements. First, we utilized neural signals from three macaque brain region- primary motor, dorsal and ventral premotor cortex- enabling precise and flexible decoding of real-time 3D sphere/avatar velocities. Second, we developed a realistic, immersive three-dimensional virtual reality setup with dynamic camera tracking, allowing continuous navigation and obstacle avoidance that closely mimic real-world scenarios. Finally, our BCI approach is optimized for use by paralyzed patients, featuring a brief training phase without overt movements and closed-loop operation without retraining of the decoder, relying on the neural plasticity of the user and the robust generalization of the decoder across tasks. Our BCI adapted to different environments, targets, and obstacles, illustrating its potential to significantly enhance the quality of life for paralyzed patients by enabling natural, reliable and flexible control in complex settings.

">Single pulse electrical stimulation in white matter modulates iEEG visual responses in human early visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Electrical stimulation is increasingly used to modulate brain networks for clinical purposes. The basic unit of neurostimulation, a single electrical pulse, can travel through white matter to influence connected neuronal populations. However, the mechanisms by which it influences connected populations is not well understood: stimulation may excite, inhibit, or add noise to neuronal population activity. In this study, we investigated how single pulses modulate the neuronal processing of images in a well-controlled visual paradigm. In two human subjects implanted with iEEG electrodes for clinical purposes, single pulses were delivered to electrodes in white matter tracts connected to measurement electrodes in visual cortex. Images appeared on-screen at 0, 100, or 200 ms after each pulse. Using finite impulse response modeling, we decomposed the broadband and evoked potential responses into separate components induced by electrical stimulation and by visual processing. Single pulses induced transient broadband increases followed by suppression, but they did not modulate the visual broadband responses (i.e., stimulation response was additive to visual response). In contrast, single pulses elicited prominent brain stimulation evoked potentials and they modulated the visual evoked potentials. Specifically, visual evoked potentials were larger when stimulation occurred closer to visual onset. This indicates that a single electrical pulse can increase the strength or synchrony of visual inputs. Overall, these findings suggest that the effects of electrical stimulation in the visual system are two-fold: stimulation induces additive effects on broadband power, possibly by adding noise, and it interacts with synchronous visual inputs to amplify them.

">Lrrns define a visual circuit underlying brightness and contrast perception</a></h4>

              
                Brightness and contrast are fundamental features of vision, crucial for object detection, environmental navigation, and feeding. Here, we identify a brightness- and contrast-processing circuit in the zebrafish visual system and uncover the role of Leucine-rich repeat neuronal (Lrrn) cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) in regulating its assembly. Deep-projecting retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) serve as the first synaptic relay to the brain requiring Lrrn2 and Lrrn3a for precise axonal targeting and connectivity within the optic tectum. Genetic targeting of these CAMs leads to circuit disorganization and impairments in contrast sensitivity, leading to deficits in visually guided behaviors. Additionally, ultrastructural circuit reconstruction and functional imaging analysis revealed their critical role in luminance processing. These studies define a fundamental visual processing pathway and establish Lrrn CAMs as essential molecular drivers of its assembly.

">Brain-wide cell-type-specific noradrenergic modulation of the transcriptome</a></h4>

              
                Neuromodulatory systems such as the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system exert a widespread influence on brain function, yet the transcriptional consequences of such neuromodulatory perturbations remain largely unknown across the many unique cell types in the brain. In this study, we establish a generalizable framework to map brain-wide, cell-type-specific gene expression changes in mice following in vivo chemogenetic activation or inhibition of LC neurons. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed that LC perturbation induces widespread but highly cell type- and region-specific transcriptional program changes, shaped by the distribution of adrenergic receptor subtypes. These findings support a model in which a shared global signal of neuromodulatory tone can produce discrete, context-dependent cellular outcomes through distinct molecular gating mechanisms of cell-type-specific adrenergic receptor subtype combinations. By establishing gene expression as a quantifiable metric of neuromodulatory control, this study lays the foundation for transcriptionally informed interventions capable of modulating brain functions with cellular precision.

">Longitudinal deep phenotyping in a mouse model of West syndrome reveals temporal dynamics of synapse remodeling, gliosis, and proteomic and lipidomic changes during seizure evolution</a></h4>

              
                Neurodevelopmental disorders can have long-lasting effects, causing not only early pediatric symptoms but also a range of neurological issues throughout adulthood. West syndrome is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder marked by infantile spasms, an early symptom that typically subsides with age. However, many patients progress to other seizure forms, known as seizure evolution, which is closely linked to poor long-term outcomes. Despite its clinical significance, the neurobiological mechanisms behind seizure evolution in West syndrome remain poorly understood. Recent genetic studies have consistently identified the CYFIP2 p.Arg87Cys variant in West syndrome patients, and the Cyfip2+/R87C mouse model carrying this mutation has been shown to recapitulate key symptoms of the disorder, including infantile spasms. In this study, we aimed to gain deeper insight into seizure evolution by conducting longitudinal deep phenotyping of the Cyfip2+/R87C mouse model from the neonatal stage to seven months of age. We tracked seizure activity through behavioral and EEG recordings and employed multi-omic analyses, including tissue and single-cell level transcriptomics, ultrastructural analysis, proteomics, and lipidomics, to capture a comprehensive view of molecular and cellular changes. Our results showed that after an initial period of neonatal spasms, Cyfip2+/R87C mice entered a seizure-free phase, followed by spontaneous recurrent seizures in adulthood, ultimately leading to premature death. This progression was associated with synaptic remodeling, sequential activation of different glial cell types, lipid droplet accumulation in astrocytes, and significant proteomic and lipidomic changes in the brain. These findings suggest that seizure evolution in West syndrome involves complex, time-dependent interactions between neurons and glial cells, along with alterations in lipid metabolism. Our study highlights the potential of longitudinal multi-omic approaches to uncover underlying mechanisms of seizure evolution and suggests that targeting these changes could offer novel therapeutic strategies. Additionally, the dataset generated here may provide valuable insights for other epilepsy and neurodevelopmental disorder models.

">APOE genotype confers context dependent neurovascular vulnerability in immune-vascularized human forebrain organoids</a></h4>

              
                The APOE gene is a major genetic determinant of neurovascular and immune function, yet the mechanisms by which its isoforms modulate brain vulnerability to pathogenic stress remain incompletely understood. Here, we employ isogenic human iPSC-derived immune vascularized Forebrain Organoid-based Multicellular Assembled Cerebral Organoids (FORMA COs) to dissect isoform-specific responses to a clinically relevant viral challenge. We find that APOE2 and APOE4 FORMA-COs exhibit heightened viral RNA burden and distinct neuroinflammatory profiles compared to APOE3. Specifically, APOE4 promotes IL-1 and VEGFA induction, whereas APOE2 leads to elevated TNF{beta} and VEGFA protein accumulation, indicating divergent pathways of injury. Integrated transcriptomic analyses, combined with known and predicted APOE protein protein interaction networks, reveal genotype dependent enrichment of cytokine signaling, angiogenic remodeling, and immune dysregulation. In vivo validation using humanized mouse models corroborates APOE genotype specific vascular remodeling, microglial activation, and oligodendrocyte perturbation. These findings demonstrate that APOE genotype confers context-specific susceptibility to neuroimmune and vascular injury, providing insight into genetic risk mechanisms underlying infection-related and neurodegenerative brain disorders.

">Linking Brain Entropy to Molecular and Cellular Architecture in Psychosis</a></h4>

              
                Brain entropy reflects the complexity of intrinsic activity and has been associated with cognitive function and psychiatric disorders. However, its relationship with neurochemical and cellular architecture in the brain remains poorly understood. By integrating molecular imaging, and neuroimaging datasets, we provide converging evidence that the spatial distribution of diverse cell types, neurotransmitter systems, and mitochondrial phenotypes is systematically associated with brain entropy. We found significant differences in entropy correlations between normal controls and individuals with schizophrenia for the mu-opioid receptor and dopamine receptor (D1), and between normal controls and bipolar disorder for the norepinephrine transporter (NAT) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA). No significant differences were observed between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in the neurotransmitter domain. In terms of cellular and metabolic features, both the normal controls vs. schizophrenia and normal controls vs. bipolar disorder comparisons revealed widespread differences associated with most mitochondrial markers, as well as glial cells and inhibitory neurons. These findings suggest disruptions in energy metabolism, neuroinflammatory activity, and inhibitory neuronal regulation in the clinical groups. Furthermore, these results indicate that brain entropy is not randomly distributed but is systematically linked to specific neurochemical systems and cellular characteristics. This systems-level perspective offers valuable insights into how the complexity of brain activity emerges from the underlying molecular architecture and how it is altered in psychiatric disorders. Moreover, it provides a biological foundation for understanding brain entropy in the context of psychosis.

">A unified imaging-histology framework for superficial white matter architecture studies in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                The superficial white matter (SWM), immediately beneath the cortical mantle, is thought to play a major role in cortico-cortical connectivity as well as large-scale brain function. Yet, this compartment remains rarely studied due to its complex organization. Our objectives were to develop and disseminate a robust computational framework to study SWM organization based on 3D histology and high-field 7T MRI. Using data from the BigBrain and Ahead 3D histology initiatives, we first interrogated variations in cell staining intensities across different cortical regions and different SWM depths. These findings were then translated to in-vivo 7T quantitative myelin-sensitive MRI, including T1 relaxometry (T1 map) and magnetization transfer saturation (MTsat). As indicated by the statistical moments of the SWM intensity profiles, the first 2 mm below the cortico-subcortical boundary were characterized by high structural complexity. We quantified SWM microstructural variation using a non-linear dimensionality reduction method and examined the relationship of the resulting microstructural gradients with indices of cortical geometry, as well as structural and functional connectivity. Our results showed correlations between SWM microstructural gradients, as well as curvature and cortico-cortical functional connectivity. Our study provides novel insights into the organization of SWM in the human brain and underscores the potential of SWM mapping to advance fundamental and applied neuroscience research.

Participants performed a monetary incentive delay task, which successfully induced a state of reward anticipation, and a 24-h delayed surprise memory test. Region-of-interest analyses revealed that activity in all subcortical nuclei increased in anticipation of potential rewards as opposed to neutral outcomes. In contrast, activity in none of the nuclei predicted memory performance 24 h later.

                Background This study investigates the connection between aggregate markups and income inequality, exploring how market power affects inequality in developed, emerging, and developing economies. The analysis aims to reveal how institutional differences and economic systems shape this relationship. Method The study examines data from 12 countries from 1997 to 2016 using a panel data approach. The analysis focuses on key variables such as the Gini index (measuring inequality), lagged markups, trade openness, GDP per capita, tax revenue, poverty, and R&D expenditure. A two-way fixed-effects model is applied to account for country and year-specific differences, while robust standard errors ensure reliability. Results The results show that higher markups are closely linked to greater income inequality, with the impact being particularly pronounced in emerging and developing economies. Integrating tax policies, trade openness, and GDP growth into the analysis indicates the limitations of relying solely on economic growth to achieve equity. The research highlights taxation and trade as effective levers for mitigating inequality and raises important questions about the role of innovation in this dynamic. Conclusion This study shows the interaction between market power and inequality across diverse economic systems. We examine how factors like market concentration and institutional quality drive inequality provides practical insights and policy recommendations for effectively addressing income disparities.

                Background Shaken Baby Syndrome describes serious cranial trauma inflicted upon infants and young children, potentially leading to significant injury or death. This study aims to evaluate parents' knowledge and attitudes regarding Shaken Baby Syndrome in Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in Al-Ahsa, focusing on all reachable parents of young children by using convenience sampling from June 2024 to August 2024, and data was collected using a pre-structured questionnaire. Results A total of 572 eligible parents participated, with ages ranging from 20 to over 40 years. The predominant gender of responders was female, comprising 433 (75.7%). A significant proportion of participants 432 (75.5%) displayed poor overall knowledge of Shaken Baby Syndrome, whereas 140 (24.5%) indicated competent knowledge and awareness. Female gender and parents with multiple children had a significant correlation with parents' understanding of Shaken Baby Syndrome (P< 0.05). Conclusion The study indicated that only around one-quarter of parents demonstrated a competent comprehension of Shaken Baby Syndrome, with mothers exhibiting more awareness. Consequently, health authorities must increase efforts to enhance public awareness of Shaken Baby Syndrome.

                The WWC1 (KIBRA) gene has been repeatedly implicated in cognitive performance, with carriers of the favorable allele showing enhanced episodic memory, spatial ability, and achievements in chess and STEM fields. However, gene-level associations do not reveal the underlying biological mechanisms. Here, we applied a modern proteomic assay coupled with an AI-based protein complex quantification method to elucidate the protein interaction phenotype involving WWC1 in a Scottish cohort (Viking Genes; N = 200). Although the bulk plasma level of WWC1 was not significantly associated with cognitive g factor, several WWC1-containing protein complexes, including the DDR1-WWC1 and the DDR1-PRKCZ-WWC1 complex scores, demonstrated significant associations with cognitive performance. In particular, one standard deviation increase in the normalized DDR1-WWC1 complex score corresponded to about 14% decrease in cognitive g factor (P = 0.024), even with educational attainment adjusted. These findings validate previous genetic studies and highlight the importance of protein-protein interactions in mediating the cognitive effects of WWC1.

                <p>by Jan Babič, Tjasa Kunavar, Erhan Oztop, Mitsuo Kawato</p>

Our study explores how ecological aspects of motor learning enhance survival by improving movement efficiency and mitigating injury risks during task failures. Traditional motor control theories mainly address isolated body movements and often overlook these ecological factors. We introduce a novel computational motor control approach, incorporating ecological fitness and a strategy that alternates between success-driven movement efficiency and failure-driven safety, akin to win-stay/lose-shift tactics. In our experiments, participants performed squat-to-stand movements under novel force perturbations. They adapted effectively through various adaptive motor control mechanisms to avoid falls, reducing failure rates rapidly. The results indicate a high-level ecological controller in human motor learning that switches objectives between safety and movement efficiency, depending on failure or success. This approach is supported by policy learning, internal model adaptation, and adaptive feedback control. Our findings offer a comprehensive perspective on human motor control, integrating risk management in a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for real-world environments.

                <p>by Debby D. Wang, Yuting Huang</p>

With a burgeoning number of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in various fields, biomolecular science has also given a big welcome to advanced AI techniques in recent years. In this broad field, scoring a protein-ligand binding structure to output the binding strength is a crucial problem that heavily relates to computational drug discovery. Aiming at this problem, we have proposed an efficient scoring framework using deep learning techniques. This framework describes a binding structure by a high-resolution atomic graph, places a focus on the inter-molecular interactions and learns the graph in a rational way. For a protein-ligand binding complex, the generated atomic graph reserves key information of the atoms (as graph nodes), and focuses on inter-molecular interactions (as graph edges) that can be identified by introducing multiple distance ranges to the atom pairs within the binding area. To provide more confidence in the predicted binding strengths, we have interpreted the deep learning model from the model level and in a post-hoc analysis. The proposed learning framework has been demonstrated to have competitive performances in scoring and screening tasks, which will prospectively promote the development of related fields further.

                <p>by Xiaoxiao Cheng, Shixian Shen, Ekaterina Ivanova, Gerolamo Carboni, Atsushi Takagi, Etienne Burdet</p>

Humans activate muscles to shape the mechanical interaction with their environment, but can they harness this control mechanism to best sense the environment? We investigated how participants adapt their muscle activation to visual and haptic information when tracking a randomly moving target with a robotic interface. The results exhibit a differentiated effect of these sensory modalities, where participants’ muscle coactivation increases with the haptic noise and decreases with the visual noise, in apparent contradiction to previous results. These results can be explained when considering muscle spring-like mechanics, where stiffness increases with coactivation to regulate motion guidance. Increasing coactivation to more closely follow the motion plan favors accurate visual over haptic information, while decreasing it filters visual noise and relies more on accurate haptic information. We formulated this active sensing mechanism as the optimization of visuo-haptic information and effort. This optimal information and effort (OIE) model can explain the adaptation of muscle activity to unimodal and multimodal sensory information when interacting with fixed or dynamic environments, or with another human, and can be used to optimize human-robot interaction.

Molecular docking is a useful method for predicting the binding affinity and conformation of small chemical entities to support lead optimisation. It is also used to virtually screen a large chemical database to find new chemical entities. There are several docking programs available with different algorithms and varying preparation steps. We identify ten quick tips that apply to molecular docking irrespective of the program one might choose. Our objective is to provide the beginners with important things to keep in mind while using molecular docking for their research. We aim to ensure that experts and beginners can perform molecular docking to yield biologically relevant and reproducible results.

                <p>by Yuru Song, Marcus K. Benna</p>

Cortical neurons often establish multiple synaptic contacts with the same postsynaptic neuron. To avoid functional redundancy of these parallel synapses, it is crucial that each synapse exhibits distinct computational properties. Here we model the current to the soma contributed by each synapse as a sigmoidal transmission function of its presynaptic input, with learnable parameters such as amplitude, slope, and threshold. We evaluate the classification capacity of a neuron equipped with such nonlinear parallel synapses, and show that with a small number of parallel synapses per axon, it substantially exceeds that of the Perceptron. Furthermore, the number of correctly classified data points can increase superlinearly as the number of presynaptic axons grows.
When training with an unrestricted number of parallel synapses, our model neuron can effectively implement an arbitrary aggregate transmission function for each axon, constrained only by monotonicity. Nevertheless, successful learning in the model neuron often requires only a small number of parallel synapses.
We also apply these parallel synapses in a feedforward neural network trained to classify MNIST images, and show that they can increase the test accuracy. This demonstrates that multiple nonlinear synapses per input axon can substantially enhance a neuron’s computational power.

AI-ready health datasets can be exploited to generate many research articles with potentially limited scientific value. A study in PLOS Biology highlights this problem, by describing a recent, sudden explosion in papers analyzing the NHANES health dataset.

A new study by Suchak et al. describes a sudden, recent explosion in papers analyzing the NHANES health dataset, where similar manuscripts have been described as overwhelming processes at some journals. In this accompanying Primer article, we summarize the study's findings and recommendations. We outline practical steps that publishers, journals, peer reviewers and readers can take to better recognize similarly formulaic, low-value submissions and publications to reduce their research impacts.

                Ongoing digitalization and data-driven developments in materials science and engineering (MSE) emphasize the growing importance of reusing research data and enabling machine accessibility, which requires robust data management and consistent semantic data representation. Ontologies have emerged as powerful tools for establishing interoperable and reusable data structures from inconsistent data structures. Despite advancements in semantic data representation for specific applications, integrating application ontologies with primary data repositories, such as electronic lab notebooks (ELNs), to feed world data remains an open task. As a use case in the MSE domain, this work presents a system based on semantic technologies from the point of view of engineers, developed with the help of information scientists, and unraveled on a small scale. The development of an application ontology (AO) was elaborated for flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) processes with the implementation of a data pipeline. The proposed FSP application ontology emerges from experimental in-house best-practice procedures and is adapted to the mid-level Project Material Digital core ontology (PMDco) to allow interoperability within the MSE domain. The pipeline retrieves manually acquired experimental data from an ELN, translates it into a machine-actionable format, and converts it into a Resource Description Framework (RDF) format to support semantic interoperability. The latter was stored in a triple store with a SPARQL interface, enabling findable and accessible datasets that are searchable and traceable. By creating semantically linked data structures in line with FAIR principles, this approach allows traceable and findable experimental results between stakeholders through both human-readable and machine-actionable formats. Seamless integration of the modular microservices of the data pipeline within established lab practices minimizes disruption while maintaining the software framework. The present work demonstrates the practical implementation of a FAIR data pipeline within a laboratory setting, paving the way for future data-centric science.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-482/v1?src=rss">The perceived barriers to data sharing in health and life sciences: a survey at the University of Bristol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Sharing research data is critical for study validation and reuse, yet challenges persist across disciplines, such as psychology1 and biomedical science2. While global initiatives promote open science, understanding localized barriers in specific academic contexts is vital to implementing effective solutions. Objective To investigate the main perceived barriers and reasons preventing data sharing within the Faculty of Health and Life Sciences (FHLS) at the University of Bristol, a research-intensive university in the UK. Methods We distributed a comprehensive survey to FHLS researchers, addressing logistical, technical, and cultural challenges. A total of 143 participants provided insights into their experiences with data sharing. Results The primary obstacles identified were time constraints and the complexity of the preparation process, with 34% reporting they “usually” or “always” lack sufficient time to adequately prepare their data for sharing. Additional barriers included not having the rights to share (27%), insufficient technical support (15%), and limited incentives within research teams. Moreover, qualitative responses highlighted a lack of confidence in data sharing infrastructure and guidance. Conclusions These findings highlight the importance of targeted interventions to enhance data-sharing practices. Solutions should prioritize data preparation processes, clarify data ownership policies, and offer tailored training programs. Integrating data-sharing requirements into research workflows from the outset could significantly alleviate these challenges. Our study provides actionable recommendations to inform the development of resources and infrastructure that support a culture of open science within the FHLS at the University of Bristol.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1307/v2?src=rss">Terminal efficiency of Peruvian university students in the second specialty programs of a dental school over seven years [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Terminal efficiency (TE), the proportion of students completing academic programs within the expected timeframe, is a critical metric for assessing postgraduate health education quality, yet it remains underexplored in Latin American dental specialties. Efficient training is vital for producing competent professionals to meet regional healthcare demands. This study aimed to determine the TE of Peruvian university students in second specialty dental programs at a Peruvian university from 2017 to 2023. Methods A longitudinal, cross-sectional analysis was conducted using 257 complete records from the university institutional repository. Inclusion criteria encompassed full documentation of admission, academic status, and graduation dates. TE was calculated as the time from document submission to graduation, categorized as ≤1 year or ≥2 years. Statistical analyses included Chi-square tests, non-parametric Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests, Poisson regression, and hierarchical multiple linear regression on log-transformed TE. Results: Mean TE was 0.93 years (SD=1.22), with 72.37% of students (n=186) completing within ≤1 year. Significant variations were observed by submission year (p=0.001) and specialty (p<0.001), with Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology (0.30 years) outperforming Periodontics and Implantology (1.76 years). The submission year was the only significant predictor of mean TE (β=0.144, p<0.001). Conclusion Dental programs of a Peruvian university demonstrate robust TE, though specialty-specific and temporal disparities highlight areas for improvement. Targeted interventions, such as streamlined thesis processes and specialty-specific support, could enhance efficiency, informing educational policy in Latin America.

                McFadden et al. find the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) is activated by C-type lectin receptor signaling during Candida albicans infection without protein misfolding. IRE1α enhances calcium flux at the C. albicans-containing phagosome, likely through coordinating ER-phagosome contact sites. IRE1α promotes phagosome maturation and integrity, as well as macrophage fungicidal activity.

                Krell et al. show that mTORC1 in β cells acts as an activity sensor, activated by the same signals that trigger insulin secretion. This activation, in turn, inhibits insulin release via RhoA-dependent actin remodeling, establishing a negative feedback loop that allows β cells to intrinsically regulate their own activity.

                Bardon et al. show that different anesthetic drugs have similar effects on the phase alignment of neural oscillations across cortical areas. Neighboring regions within a hemisphere become misaligned, while homologous regions across hemispheres are more synchronized. Their results suggest a common mechanism of anesthetic-induced unconsciousness, through realignment of cortical communication.

Therefore, L1-INs are key sensory processing sites that may modulate cortex in a stimulus- and state-dependent manner.

                Yu et al. dissociate two left-lateralized language networks leading up to word retrieval using electrocorticography in 48 patients: a semantic processing network spanning MFG and IFG, which encodes word surprisal during sentence perception, and an articulatory-planning network spanning IFG and precentral gyrus, which is invariant to input modality.

                The mechanisms by which parasites mediate host behavioral changes remain largely unexplored. Warecki et al. describe a molecular mechanism for how the endosymbiont Wolbachia induces increased mating in female Drosophila: neuronal reduction of the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR.

                Mollusks are a major component of animal biodiversity and play a critical role in ecosystems and global food security. The Pacific oyster, <i>Crassostrea (Magallana) gigas</i>, is the most farmed bivalve mollusk in the world and is becoming a model species for invertebrate biology. Despite the extensive research on hemocytes, the immune cells of bivalves, their characterization remains elusive. Here, we were able to extensively characterize the diverse hemocytes and identified at least seven functionally distinct cell types and three hematopoietic lineages. A combination of single-cell RNA sequencing, quantitative cytology, cell sorting, functional assays, and pseudo-time analyses was used to deliver a comprehensive view of the distinct hemocyte types. This integrative analysis enabled us to reconcile molecular and cellular data and identify distinct cell types performing specialized immune functions, such as phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species production, copper accumulation, and expression of antimicrobial peptides. This study emphasized the need for more in depth studies of cellular immunity in mollusks and non-model invertebrates and set the ground for further comparative immunology studies at the cellular level.

                <p>Principal neurons (PNs) of the lateral superior olive (LSO) are a critical component of brain circuits that compare information between the two ears to extract sound source-location-related cues. LSO PNs are not a homogenous group but differ in their transmitter type, intrinsic membrane properties, and projection pattern to higher processing centers in the inferior colliculus. Glycinergic inhibitory LSO PNs have higher input resistance than glutamatergic excitatory LSO PNs (~double). This suggests that the inhibitory cell type has a lower minimum input or signal intensity required to produce an output (activation threshold) which may impact how they integrate binaural inputs. However, cell-type-specific differences in the strength of synaptic drive could offset or accentuate such differences in intrinsic excitability and have not been assessed. To evaluate this possibility, we used a knock-in mouse model to examine spontaneous and electrically stimulated (evoked) synaptic events in LSO PN types using voltage-clamp technique. Both excitatory and inhibitory spontaneous postsynaptic currents were larger in inhibitory LSO PNs, but evoked events were not. Additionally, we found that LSO PN types had inputs with similar short-term plasticity and number of independent fibers. An important contrast was that inhibitory LSO PNs received inhibitory inputs with slower decay kinetics which could impact integrative functions. These data suggest that synaptic inputs onto LSO PNs are unlikely to offset excitability differences. Differences in activation threshold along with transmitter type and projection laterality may allow for distinct roles for LSO PN types in inferior colliculus information processing.</p>

                <p>Childhood epilepsy is a common and devastating condition, for which many children still do not have adequate treatment. Some children with drug-resistant epilepsy require surgical excision of epileptogenic brain tissue for seizure control, affording the opportunity to study this tissue ex vivo to interrogate human epileptic neurons for potentially hyperexcitable perturbations in intrinsic electrophysiological properties. In this study, we characterized the diversity of layer L2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal neurons (PNs) in ex vivo brain slices from pediatric patients with epilepsy. We found a remarkable diversity in the firing properties of epileptic L2/3 PNs: five distinct subpopulations were identified. Additionally, we investigated whether the etiology of epilepsy influenced the intrinsic neuronal properties of L2/3 PNs when comparing tissue from patients with epilepsy due to malformations of cortical development (MCDs), other forms of epilepsy (OEs), or with deep-seated tumors. When comparing epileptic with control L2/3 PNs, we observed a decrease in voltage sag and lower maximum firing rates. Moreover, we found that MCD and OE L2/3 PNs were mostly similar indicating that epilepsy etiology may not outweigh the influences of epileptiform activity on L2/3 PN physiology. Lastly, we show that the proconvulsant drug, 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), leads to increased AP half-width, reduced firing rate accommodation, and slower AHPs. These changes imply that 4-AP induces an increase in [K<sup>+</sup>]<SUB>o</SUB> and a resultant increase in AP duration, leading to the release of more excitatory neurotransmitters per action potential, thereby promoting network hyperexcitability.</p>

                <p>The explore/exploit trade-off is a fundamental property of choice selection during reward-guided decision making, where the "same" choice can reflect either of these internal cognitive states. An unanswered question is whether the execution of a decision provides an underexplored measure of internal cognitive states. Touchscreens are increasingly used across species for cognitive testing and afford the ability to measure the precise location of choice touch responses. We examined how male and female mice in a restless bandit decision making task interacted with a touchscreen to determine if the explore/exploit trade-off, prior reward, and/or sex differences change the variability in the kinetics of touchscreen choices. During exploit states, successive touch responses are closer together than those made in an explore state, suggesting exploit states reflect periods of increased motor stereotypy. Although exploit decisions might be expected to be rewarded more frequently than explore decisions, we find that immediate past reward reduces choice variability independently of explore/exploit state. Male mice are more variable in their interactions with the touchscreen than females, even in low-variability trials such as exploit or following reward. These results suggest that as exploit behavior emerges in reward-guided decision making, all mice become less variable and more automated in both their choice and the actions taken to make that choice, but this occurs on a background of increased male variability. These data uncover the hidden potential for touchscreen decision making tasks to uncover the latent neural states that unite cognition and movement.</p>

                <p>by William R. Shoemaker, Álvaro Sánchez, Jacopo Grilli</p>

Ecology has historically benefited from the characterization of statistical patterns of biodiversity within and across communities, an approach known as macroecology. Within microbial ecology, macroecological approaches have identified universal patterns of diversity and abundance that can be captured by effective models. Experimentation has simultaneously played a crucial role, as the advent of high-replication community time-series has allowed researchers to investigate underlying ecological forces. However, there remains a gap between experiments performed in the laboratory and macroecological patterns documented in natural systems, as we do not know whether these patterns can be recapitulated in the lab and whether experimental manipulations produce macroecological effects. This work aims at bridging the gap between experimental ecology and macroecology. Using high-replication time-series, we demonstrate that microbial macroecological patterns observed in nature exist in a laboratory setting, despite controlled conditions, and can be unified under the Stochastic Logistic Model of growth (SLM). We found that demographic manipulations (e.g., migration) impact observed macroecological patterns. By modifying the SLM to incorporate said manipulations alongside experimental details (e.g., sampling), we obtain predictions that are consistent with macroecological outcomes. By combining high-replication experiments with ecological models, microbial macroecology can be viewed as a predictive discipline.

                <p>by Péter Polcz, István Z. Reguly, Kálmán Tornai, János Juhász, Sándor Pongor, Attila Csikász-Nagy, Gábor Szederkényi</p>

Optimal intervention planning is a critical part of epidemiological control, which is difficult to attain in real life situations. Ordinary differential equation (ODE) models can be used to optimize control but the results can not be easily translated to interventions in highly complex real life environments. Agent-based methods on the other hand allow detailed modeling of the environment but optimization is precluded by the large number of parameters. Our goal was to combine the advantages of both approaches, i.e., to allow control optimization in complex environments. The epidemic control objectives are expressed as a time-dependent reference for the number of infected people. To track this reference, a model predictive controller (MPC) is designed with a compartmental ODE prediction model to compute the optimal level of stringency of interventions, which are later translated to specific actions such as mobility restriction, quarantine policy, masking rules, school closure. The effects of interventions on the transmission rate of the pathogen, and hence their stringency, are computed using PanSim, an agent-based epidemic simulator that contains a detailed model of the environment. The realism and practical applicability of the method is demonstrated by the wide range of discrete level measures that can be taken into account. Moreover, the change between measures applied during consecutive planning intervals is also minimized. We found that such a combined intervention planning strategy is able to efficiently control a COVID-19-like epidemic process, in terms of incidence, virulence, and infectiousness with surprisingly sparse (e.g. 21 day) intervention regimes. At the same time, the approach proved to be robust even in scenarios with significant model uncertainties, such as unknown transmission rate, uncertain time and probability constants. The high performance of the computation allows a large number of test cases to be run. The proposed computational framework can be reused for epidemic management of unexpected pandemic events and can be customized to the needs of any country.

                <p>by Jaspreet Pannu, Doni Bloomfield, Robert MacKnight, Moritz S. Hanke, Alex Zhu, Gabe Gomes, Anita Cicero, Thomas V. Inglesby</p>

As a result of rapidly accelerating artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, multiple national governments and multinational bodies have launched efforts to address safety, security and ethics issues related to AI models. One high priority among these efforts is the mitigation of misuse of AI models, such as for the development of chemical, biological, nuclear or radiological (CBRN) threats. Many biologists have for decades sought to reduce the risks of scientific research that could lead, through accident or misuse, to high-consequence disease outbreaks. Scientists have carefully considered what types of life sciences research have the potential for both benefit and risk (dual use), especially as scientific advances have accelerated our ability to engineer organisms. Here we describe how previous experience and study by scientists and policy professionals of dual-use research in the life sciences can inform dual-use capabilities of AI models trained using biological data. Of these dual-use capabilities, we argue that AI model evaluations should prioritize addressing those which enable high-consequence risks (i.e., large-scale harm to the public, such as transmissible disease outbreaks that could develop into pandemics), and that these risks should be evaluated prior to model deployment so as to allow potential biosafety and/or biosecurity measures. While biological research is on balance immensely beneficial, it is well recognized that some biological information or technologies could be intentionally or inadvertently misused to cause consequential harm to the public. AI-enabled life sciences research is no different. Scientists’ historical experience with identifying and mitigating dual-use biological risks can thus help inform new approaches to evaluating biological AI models. Identifying which AI capabilities pose the greatest biosecurity and biosafety concerns is necessary in order to establish targeted AI safety evaluation methods, secure these tools against accident and misuse, and avoid impeding immense potential benefits.

                <p>by Daniel Schmid, Heiko Neumann</p>

Object-basd visual attention marks a key process of mammalian perception. By which mechanisms this process is implemented and how it can be interacted with by means of attentional control is not completely understood yet. Incremental binding is a mechanism required in demanding scenarios of object-based attention and is experimentally well investigated. Attention spreads across a representation of the visual object and labels bound elements by constant up-modulation of neural activity. The speed of incremental binding was found to be dependent on the spatial arrangement of distracting elements in the scene and to be scale invariant giving rise to the growth-cone hypothesis. In this work, we propose a neural dynamical model of incremental binding that provides a mechanistic account for these findings. Through simulations, we investigate the model properties and demonstrate how an attentional spreading mechanism tags neurons that participate in the object binding process. They utilize Gestalt properties and eventually show growth-cone characteristics labeling perceptual items by delayed activity enhancement of neuronal firing rates. We discuss the algorithmic process underlying incremental binding and relate it to our model computations. This theoretical investigation encompasses complexity considerations and finds the model to be not only of explanatory value in terms of neurophysiological evidence, but also to be an efficient implementation of incremental binding striving to establish a normative account. By relating the connectivity motifs of the model to neuroanatomical evidence, we suggest thalamo-cortical interactions to be a likely candidate for the flexible and efficient realization suggested by the model. There, pyramidal cells are proposed to serve as the processors of incremental grouping information. Local bottom-up evidence about stimulus features is integrated via basal dendritic sites. It is combined with an apical signal consisting of contextual grouping information which is gated by attentional task-relevance selection mediated via higher-order thalamic representations.

                <p>by Wenjun Zhao, Erica Larschan, Björn Sandstede, Ritambhara Singh</p>

Inferring gene regulatory networks from gene expression data is an important and challenging problem in the biology community. We propose OTVelo, a methodology that takes time-stamped single-cell gene expression data as input and predicts gene regulation across two time points. It is known that the rate of change of gene expression, which we will refer to as gene velocity, provides crucial information that enhances such inference; however, this information is not always available due to the limitations in sequencing depth. Our algorithm overcomes this limitation by estimating gene velocities using optimal transport. We then infer gene regulation using time-lagged correlation and Granger causality via regularized linear regression. Instead of providing an aggregated network across all time points, our method uncovers the underlying dynamical mechanism across time points. We validate our algorithm on 13 simulated datasets with both synthetic and curated networks and demonstrate its efficacy on 9 experimental data sets.

                <p>by Naruemon Rueangkham, Miguel Valle-Inclán Cabello, Franziska Lautenschläger, Rhoda J. Hawkins</p>

We present a model to calculate the displacement and extension of deformable cellular cargo pulled by molecular motors stepping along cytoskeletal filaments. We consider the case of a single type of molecular motor and cytoskeletal filaments oriented in one dimension in opposite directions on either side of a cargo. We model a deformable cargo as a simple elastic spring. We simulate this tug-of-war simple exclusion process model using a Monte Carlo Gillespie algorithm and calculate the displacement and extension of the cargo for different configurations of motors and filaments. We apply our model to kinesin-1 motors on microtubules to investigate whether they are strong enough to translocate and deform the largest cellular cargo, the nucleus. We show that the extension caused by motors on a single microtubule saturates for larger numbers of motors but that the extension and displacement scales linearly with the number of microtubules. We also show how the binding and unbinding behaviors of molecular motors on microtubule filaments affect the nuclear deformation. Our modelling results correspond to experiments on cells treated with the drug kinesore, which is thought to increase rescue events resulting in more stable microtubules and more active kinesin-1 molecular motors bound to them. Both the experiments and our simulations result in nuclear deformation.

Chemical synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is regulated by electrical activity of the motor circuit, but may also be affected by neuromodulation. Here, we assessed the role of neuropeptide signaling in the plasticity of NMJ function in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. We show that the CAPS (Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent activator protein for secretion) ortholog UNC-31, which regulates exocytosis of dense core vesicles, affects both pre- and post-synaptic functional properties, as well as NMJ-mediated locomotion. Despite reduced evoked acetylcholine (ACh) transmission, the loss of <i>unc-31</i> results in a more vigorous response to presynaptic stimulation, i.e., enhanced muscle contraction and Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. Based on expression profiles, we identified neuropeptides involved in both cholinergic (FLP-6, FLP-15, NLP-9, NLP-15, NLP-21, and NLP-38) and GABAergic motor neurons (FLP-15, NLP-15), that mediate normal transmission at the NMJ. In the absence of these peptides, neurons fail to upregulate their ACh output in response to increased cAMP signaling; for <i>flp-15; nlp-15</i> double mutants, we observed overall increased postsynaptic currents, indicating that these neuropeptides may be inhibitory. We also identified proprotein convertases encoded by <i>aex-5/kpc-3</i> and <i>egl-3/kpc-2</i> that act synergistically to generate these neuropeptides. We propose that postsynaptic homeostatic scaling, mediated by increased muscle activation, likely through excitability, might compensate for the reduced cholinergic transmission in mutants affected for neuropeptide signaling, thus maintaining net synaptic strength. We show that in the absence of UNC-31 muscle excitability is modulated by upregulating the expression of the muscular L-type voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel EGL-19. Our results unveil a role for neuropeptidergic regulation in synaptic plasticity, linking changes in presynaptic transmission to compensatory changes in muscle excitability.

With the growth of artificial intelligence (AI)-ready datasets such as the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), new opportunities for data-driven research are being created, but also generating risks of data exploitation by paper mills. In this work, we focus on two areas of potential concern for AI-supported research efforts. First, we describe the production of large numbers of formulaic single-factor analyses, relating single predictors to specific health conditions, where multifactorial approaches would be more appropriate. Employing AI-supported single-factor approaches removes context from research, fails to capture interactions, avoids false discovery correction, and is an approach that can easily be adopted by paper mills. Second, we identify risks of selective data usage, such as analyzing limited date ranges or cohort subsets without clear justification, suggestive of data dredging, and post-hoc hypothesis formation. Using a systematic literature search for single-factor analyses, we identified 341 NHANES-derived research papers published over the past decade, each proposing an association between a predictor and a health condition from the wide range contained within NHANES. We found evidence that research failed to take account of multifactorial relationships, that manuscripts did not account for the risks of false discoveries, and that researchers selectively extracted data from NHANES rather than utilizing the full range of data available. Given the explosion of AI-assisted productivity in published manuscripts (the systematic search strategy used here identified an average of 4 papers per annum from 2014 to 2021, but 190 in 2024–9 October alone), we highlight a set of best practices to address these concerns, aimed at researchers, data controllers, publishers, and peer reviewers, to encourage improved statistical practices and mitigate the risks of paper mills using AI-assisted workflows to introduce low-quality manuscripts to the scientific literature.

<p>Using two different EEG tasks with static and articulating faces, deprivation-induced cortical changes in postlingually deafened individuals were found by means of reduced visual cortex activation and a relationship between these alterations and the CI outcome after 6 months. These alterations are not significantly affected by CI experience.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Although a cochlear implant (CI) can partially restore auditory function, CI recipients show alterations not only in auditory but also in visual cortical processing. Yet, it is not well understood how these visual changes relate to the CI outcome and to what extent these changes are induced by auditory deprivation and the limited CI input, respectively. Here, we present a prospective longitudinal electroencephalography study which examined the deprivation- and CI-induced alterations on cortical face processing by comparing visual evoked potentials (VEP) in CI users before and 6 months after implantation. A group of normal-hearing (NH) listeners served as a control. The participants performed a word-identification task and a face-categorization task to study the cortical processing of static and articulating faces in attended and unattended conditions. The CI candidates and CI users showed a reduced visual-cortex activation, a stronger functional connectivity between the visual and auditory cortex, and a reduced attention effect in the (extended) alpha frequency range (8–18 Hz) when compared to NH listeners. There was a positive correlation between the P1 VEP amplitude recorded before implantation and the speech recognition ability after implantation. Our results suggest that the CI users' alterations in cortical face processing are mainly induced by auditory deprivation and not by CI experience. Importantly, these deprivation-induced changes seem to be related to the CI outcome. Our results suggest that the visual P1 amplitude as recorded <i>before</i> implantation provides an objective index of cortical visual reorganization that may help predict the CI outcome.</p>

[version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Pollution refers to the addition of harmful substances to that level where they cause an effect on the environment, it has three major categories such as water, soil, and air pollution but this report is on water pollution. It occurs when harmful substances contaminate water bodies such as, groundwater, rivers, lakes, and oceans rendering them unfavorable for various purposes for example drinking, recreation, and support to aquatic life. Globally, over 80% of wastewater worldwide is discharged into the water bodies without adequate treatment. In Africa, lack of clean water and sanitation is a significant challenge in many countries, affecting approximately 319 million people. Thus, water pollution is one of the types of pollution that has been threatening the lives of living organisms. Implementing effective policies and strategies can have a profound impact on the environment and local communities. By reducing pollution levels and improving water quality, we can create a healthier environment and decrease the incidence of waterborne diseases, leading to improved health and well-being for residents. The research on water pollution in the River Meizimera Kihihi has important implications for future research, policy and governance, human health, the environment, and communities and society. In conclusion, effective policies can foster community involvement, raise awareness, and promote collective action to address water pollution. By achieving clean water and sanitation (SDG 6), we can contribute to the broader sustainable development goals. This research has important ramifications for future research, policy and governance, human health, the environment, communities, and society. This study investigated the problems of water pollution, its causes, its impact, and the current effort to address the issues along the river of Meizimera-kihihi, Kanugu district, Uganda. Recommendations were made, which included encouraging the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices, industrial processes, and waste management strategies to minimize pollution.

                Background Young people with mental disorders should be offered evidence-based treatments. In 2018, we developed a national evidence portal in Norway providing access to living evidence summaries. This work has been an important contribution to mental health care in Norway but is also a rich data source for exploring the existing research. At the time of this study, eight overviews of overviews (OoO) were published addressing the effects of treatments for attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, psychosis, obsessive compulsive disorder, self-harm and trauma / post-traumatic stress disorder. The objective of this study was to do a secondary analysis of this evidence to describe the state-of-the art in this field, and to map: treatments evaluated for each diagnostic group and the longest time of follow-up treatment comparisons evaluated for more than one diagnostic group Methods We performed a mapping review. Data extraction was performed independently by two authors. All data was entered into Excel. Unique treatment comparisons were visualised in Sunburst diagrams. The longest time of follow-up and treatments evaluated across diagnostic groups were reported in descriptive tables. Results We identified 200 treatment comparisons including a wide variety of interventions. Some diagnoses are treated mostly with pharmaceutical therapies (such as bipolar disorder) or psychological therapy alone or in combination (such as anxiety and psychosis). Others are treated with a broader spectrum of therapeutic approaches (such as depression and ADHD). The evidence supporting most treatments is of low to very low certainty. Ten percent of the comparisons included follow-up assessments beyond 12 months. Cognitive behavioural therapy, dialectic behavioural therapy, physical activity and mindfulness interventions were effective across populations. Conclusions The evidence supporting treatment of mental disorders in young people has important limitations. Future research efforts should address these evidence gaps.

                The taxon Elasmobranchii (sharks and rays) contains one of the most long-established evolutionary lineages of vertebrates with a tantalizing collection of species occupying critical aquatic habitats. To overcome the current limitation in molecular resources, we launched the Squalomix Consortium in 2020 to promote a genome-wide array of molecular approaches, specifically targeting shark and ray species. Among the various bottlenecks in working with elasmobranchs are their elusiveness and low fecundity as well as the large and highly repetitive genomes. Their peculiar body fluid composition has also hindered the establishment of methods to perform routine cell culturing required for their karyotyping. In the Squalomix consortium, these obstacles are expected to be solved through a combination of in-house cytological techniques including karyotyping of cultured cells, chromatin preparation for Hi-C data acquisition, and high fidelity long-read sequencing. The resources and products obtained in this consortium, including genome and transcriptome sequences, a genome browser powered by JBrowse2 to visualize sequence alignments, and comprehensive matrices of gene expression profiles for selected species are accessible through https://github.com/Squalomix/info.

sFCD decreased widely, whereas lFCD increased in PLP patients.
Hub dysfunction in the PreCG/INS/MOG/PCUN correlated with clinical severity.
Seed-based FC showed divergent patterns: diminished intra-hub connectivity versus enhanced DLPFC-directed coupling.
Critical pathways associated with symptom severity: DLPFC-INS and DLPFC-PCUN circuits.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Phantom limb pain (PLP) is prevalent and challenging to treat in amputees, which likely stems from maladaptive cortical reorganization, but the precise mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to comprehensively investigate the cortical remodeling patterns in amputees experiencing PLP, pinpointing key brain regions and neural circuits directly associated with the pain. Eighteen PLP patients and 20 healthy participants were recruited for resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). The functional connectivity density (FCD) mapping method was used to identify PLP-related abnormal local and global signaling hubs. FCD changes were observed within the sensorimotor, pain-processing, and visual stream networks in PLP patients, with the precentral gyrus (PreCG), insula (INS), precuneus (PCUN), and middle occipital gyrus (MOG) identified as key hubs correlated with the visual analog scale (VAS) pain ratings. A voxel-wise functional connectivity (FC) analysis was further performed between the VAS-correlated FCD hubs and the rest of the brain. FC was significantly decreased between the hubs and widespread brain regions. In contrast, increased FC was revealed between the hubs and subregions of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (the dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus [SFGdor] and middle frontal gyrus [MFG]). FC of the SFGdor-INS and MFG-PCUN pathways was negatively correlated with VAS pain ratings specifically, likely playing crucial roles in PLP. These results provide novel insights into the critical neural mechanisms of PLP, highlighting valuable targets for developing long-term effective neuromodulation modalities.</p>

                Microglia–neuron interactions are essential for maintaining brain homeostasis. In a recent study, Zhao and colleagues demonstrated that activation of Gi–G-protein-coupled receptors (Gi-GPCRs) on microglia suppresses microglial process dynamics, reduces neuronal activity, and disrupts network synchronization. These findings highlight the role of microglial Gi-GPCR signaling in neuromodulation and its role in network activity in the healthy brain.

                Li et al. identify the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) as a sorting center that distinctly processes visceral pain and anxiety. The aPVT and pPVT distinctly modulate visceral pain and anxiety via different molecular targets and projection patterns, thus providing evidence for clinically targeted treatment of visceral pain and anxiety.

                Papanikolaou et al. show that deep-layer cortical neurons exhibit abnormally prolonged Ca2+ transients early in Alzheimer’s mouse models. This is linked to suppressed activity and altered tuning of fast-spiking parvalbumin interneurons, mediated by reduced NPTX2 and GluA4, and reversed by NPTX2 overexpression, revealing a deep-layer circuit vulnerability in early Alzheimer’s.

Genetic mapping shows specific epistatic interactions. Blockade of each of the products of two genes completely reverses anti-PD1 response.

                Li et al. identify NSUN2, an m5C methyltransferase, as a key regulator in AML progression. Their findings reveal that NSUN2 stabilizes PHGDH and SHMT2 mRNAs, promoting serine/glycine biosynthesis and cancer growth. Targeting the NSUN2/m5C axis may offer new therapeutic strategies for AML treatment.

                Wang et al. show that SIRT1 secretion into the TME suppresses tumor growth by regulating immune cell interactions. The study reveals that TME stress-induced methylation hinders SIRT1 secretion, leading to enhanced PD-L1 expression on M2 macrophages and subsequent exhaustion of CD8+ T cells.

                Using a cell-culture model, Fahoum et al. demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP) spread from infected to neighboring non-susceptible cells. This elicits NP-driven, antibody-dependent activation of the classical complement pathway. They characterize NP regions binding to cell-surface proteoglycans. Enoxaparin outcompetes NP binding and the associated complement activation, rescuing COVID-19 immunopathology.
