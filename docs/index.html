              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Experimental microevolution of Trypanosoma cruzi reveals hybridization and clonal mechanisms driving rapid diversification of genome sequence and structure</a></h4>

              
                Protozoa and fungi are known to have extraordinarily diverse mechanisms of genetic exchange. However, the presence and epidemiological relevance of genetic exchange in <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i>, the agent of Chagas disease, has been controversial and debated for many years. Field studies have identified both predominantly clonal and sexually recombining natural populations. Two of six natural <i>T. cruzi</i> lineages (TcV and TcVI) show hybrid mosaicism, using analysis of single-gene locus markers. The formation of hybrid strains <i>in vitro </i>has been achieved and this provides a framework to study the mechanisms and adaptive significance of genetic exchange. Using whole genome sequencing of a set of experimental hybrids strains, we have confirmed that hybrid formation initially results in tetraploid parasites. The hybrid progeny showed novel mutations that were not attributable to either (diploid) parent showing an increase in amino acid changes. In long-term culture, up to 800 generations, there was a variable but gradual erosion of progeny genomes towards triploidy, yet retention of elevated copy number was observed at several core housekeeping loci. Our findings indicate hybrid formation by fusion of diploid <i>T. cruzi</i>, followed by sporadic genome erosion, but with substantial potential for adaptive evolution, as has been described as a genetic feature of other organisms, such as some fungi.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Thermosynechococcus switches the direction of phototaxis by a c-di-GMP-dependent process with high spatial resolution</a></h4>

              
                Many cyanobacteria, which use light as an energy source via photosynthesis, show directional movement towards or away from a light source. However, the molecular and cell biological mechanisms for switching the direction of movement remain unclear. Here, we visualized type IV pilus-dependent cell movement in the rod-shaped thermophilic cyanobacterium <i>Thermosynechococcus vulcanus</i> using optical microscopy at physiological temperature and light conditions. Positive and negative phototaxis were controlled on a short time scale of 1 min. The cells smoothly moved over solid surfaces towards green light, but the direction was switched to backward movement when we applied additional blue light illumination. The switching was mediated by three photoreceptors, SesA, SesB, and SesC, which have cyanobacteriochrome photosensory domains and synthesis/degradation activity of the bacterial second messenger cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP). Our results suggest that the decision-making process for directional switching in phototaxis involves light-dependent changes in the cellular concentration of c-di-GMP. Direct visualization of type IV pilus filaments revealed that rod-shaped cells can move perpendicular to the light vector, indicating that the polarity can be controlled not only by pole-to-pole regulation but also within-a-pole regulation. This study provides insights into previously undescribed rapid bacterial polarity regulation via second messenger signalling with high spatial resolution.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">SDR enzymes oxidize specific lipidic alkynylcarbinols into cytotoxic protein-reactive species</a></h4>

              
                Hundreds of cytotoxic natural or synthetic lipidic compounds contain chiral alkynylcarbinol motifs, but the mechanism of action of those potential therapeutic agents remains unknown. Using a genetic screen in haploid human cells, we discovered that the enantiospecific cytotoxicity of numerous terminal alkynylcarbinols, including the highly cytotoxic dialkynylcarbinols, involves a bioactivation by HSD17B11, a short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) known to oxidize the C-17 carbinol center of androstan-3-alpha,17-beta-diol to the corresponding ketone. A similar oxidation of dialkynylcarbinols generates dialkynylketones, that we characterize as highly protein-reactive electrophiles. We established that, once bioactivated in cells, the dialkynylcarbinols covalently modify several proteins involved in protein-quality control mechanisms, resulting in their lipoxidation on cysteines and lysines through <i>Michael</i> addition. For some proteins, this triggers their association to cellular membranes and results in endoplasmic reticulum stress, unfolded protein response activation, ubiquitin-proteasome system inhibition and cell death by apoptosis. Finally, as a proof-of-concept, we show that generic lipidic alkynylcarbinols can be devised to be bioactivated by other SDRs, including human RDH11 and HPGD/15-PGDH. Given that the SDR superfamily is one of the largest and most ubiquitous, this unique cytotoxic mechanism-of-action could be widely exploited to treat diseases, in particular cancer, through the design of tailored prodrugs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">History-dependent physiological adaptation to lethal genetic modification under antibiotic exposure</a></h4>

              
                Genetic modifications, such as gene deletion and mutations, could lead to significant changes in physiological states or even cell death. Bacterial cells can adapt to diverse external stresses, such as antibiotic exposure, but can they also adapt to detrimental genetic modification? To address this issue, we visualized the response of individual <i>Escherichia coli</i> cells to deletion of the antibiotic resistance gene under chloramphenicol (Cp) exposure, combining the light-inducible genetic recombination and microfluidic long-term single-cell tracking. We found that a significant fraction (∼40%) of resistance-gene-deleted cells demonstrated a gradual restoration of growth and stably proliferated under continuous Cp exposure without the resistance gene. Such physiological adaptation to genetic modification was not observed when the deletion was introduced in 10 hr or more advance before Cp exposure. Resistance gene deletion under Cp exposure disrupted the stoichiometric balance of ribosomal large and small subunit proteins (RplS and RpsB). However, the balance was gradually recovered in the cell lineages with restored growth. These results demonstrate that bacterial cells can adapt even to lethal genetic modifications by plastically gaining physiological resistance. However, the access to the resistance states is limited by the environmental histories and the timings of genetic modification.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Inflammatory response in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells                    triggered by activating SHP2 mutations evokes blood defects</a></h4>

              
                Gain-of-function mutations in the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 are the most                    frequently occurring mutations in sporadic juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia                    (JMML) and JMML-like myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) associated with Noonan                    syndrome (NS). Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are the disease                    propagating cells of JMML. Here, we explored transcriptomes of HSPCs with Shp2                    mutations derived from JMML patients and a novel NS zebrafish model. In addition                    to major NS traits, CRISPR/Cas9 knock-in Shp2<i><sup>D61G</sup></i>                    mutant zebrafish recapitulated a JMML-like MPN phenotype, including myeloid                    lineage hyperproliferation, <i>ex vivo</i> growth of myeloid colonies                    and <i>in vivo</i> transplantability of HSPCs. Single cell mRNA                    sequencing of HSPCs from Shp2<i><sup>D61G</sup></i> zebrafish embryos                    and bulk sequencing of HSPCs from JMML patients revealed an overlapping                    inflammatory gene expression pattern. Strikingly, an anti-inflammatory agent                    rescued JMML-like MPN in Shp2<i><sup>D61G</sup></i> zebrafish embryos.                    Our results indicate that a common inflammatory response was triggered in the                    HSPCs from sporadic JMML patients and syndromic NS zebrafish, which potentiated                    MPN and may represent a future target for JMML therapies.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Conformist social learning leads to self-organised prevention against adverse bias in risky decision making</a></h4>

              
                Given the ubiquity of potentially adverse behavioural bias owing to myopic trial-and-error learning, it seems paradoxical that improvements in decision-making performance through conformist social learning, a process widely considered to be bias amplification, still prevail in animal collective behaviour. Here we show, through model analyses and large-scale interactive behavioural experiments with 585 human subjects, that conformist influence can indeed promote favourable risk taking in repeated experience-based decision making, even though many individuals are systematically biased towards adverse risk aversion. Although strong positive feedback conferred by copying the majority’s behaviour could result in unfavourable informational cascades, our differential equation model of collective behavioural dynamics identified a key role for increasing exploration by negative feedback arising when a weak minority influence undermines the inherent behavioural bias. This ‘collective behavioural rescue’, emerging through coordination of positive and negative feedback, highlights a benefit of collective learning in a broader range of environmental conditions than previously assumed and resolves the ostensible paradox of adaptive collective behavioural flexibility under conformist influences.

	<p>Populations with a relatively low concentration of melanin, e.g., inhabitants of Europe, North America, and Australia, are the most vulnerable to the harmful effects of UV radiation. Individuals with fair phototype are at greatest risk of developing skin cancer. Several neurological studies present that light skin may modify the risk of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s and Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s diseases. However, the relationship between migraine and skin pigmentation has not been investigated yet. The objective of this study is to provide evidence of the relationship between skin pigmentation and migraine prevalence in adults. We examined a group of 148 adults (33 men, 115 women) with migraine and a control group of 107 adults (43 men, 64 women). Parameters of skin pigmentation (melanin index, erythema index, CIElab, and RGB scales) were measured using a DSM II Cortex Technology dermospectrophotometer. Risk of migraine in lightly pigmented adults was elevated. Individuals with a low melanin index had over 3-fold increased risk of migraine (women: OR 3.53, men: OR 3.73). Fair phototype, which results from lightly pigmented skin, was associated with migraine prevalence. Migraineurs should take extra care to protect their skin from the negative effects of solar radiation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">VGLUT3 Ablation Differentially Modulates Glutamate Receptor Densities in Mouse Brain</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Type 3 vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT3) represents a unique modulator of glutamate release from both nonglutamatergic and glutamatergic varicosities within the brain. Despite its limited abundance, VGLUT3 is vital for the regulation of glutamate signaling and, therefore, modulates the activity of various brain microcircuits. However, little is known about how glutamate receptors are regulated by VGLUT3 across different brain regions. Here, we used VGLUT3 constitutive knock-out (VGLUT3<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>) mice and explored how VGLUT3 deletion influences total and cell surface expression of different ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors. VGLUT3 deletion upregulated the overall expression of metabotropic glutamate receptors mGluR5 and mGluR2/3 in the cerebral cortex. In contrast, no change in the total expression of ionotropic NMDAR glutamate receptors were observed in the cerebral cortex of VGLUT3<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice. We noted significant reduction in cell surface levels of mGluR5, NMDAR2A, NMDAR2B, as well as reductions in dopaminergic D<SUB>1</SUB> receptors and muscarinic M1 acetylcholine receptors in the hippocampus of VGLUT3<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice. Furthermore, mGluR2/3 total expression and mGluR5 cell surface levels were elevated in the striatum of VGLUT3<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice. Last, AMPAR subunit GluA1 was significantly upregulated throughout cortical, hippocampal, and striatal brain regions of VGLUT3<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice. Together, these findings complement and further support the evidence that VGLUT3 dynamically regulates glutamate receptor densities in several brain regions.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Conditions for Synaptic Specificity during the Maintenance Phase of Synaptic Plasticity</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Activity-dependent modifications of synaptic efficacies are a cellular substrate of learning and memory. Experimental evidence shows that these modifications are synapse specific and that the long-lasting effects are associated with the sustained increase in concentration of specific proteins like PKM<I></I>. However, such proteins are likely to diffuse away from their initial synaptic location and spread out to neighboring synapses, potentially compromising synapse specificity. In this article, we address the issue of synapse specificity during memory maintenance. Assuming that the long-term maintenance of synaptic plasticity is accomplished by a molecular switch, we carry out analytical calculations and perform simulations using the reaction-diffusion package in NEURON to determine the limits of synapse specificity during maintenance. Moreover, we explore the effects of the diffusion and degradation rates of proteins and of the geometrical characteristics of dendritic spines on synapse specificity. We conclude that the necessary conditions for synaptic specificity during maintenance require that molecular switches reside in dendritic spines. The requirement for synaptic specificity when the molecular switch resides in spines still imposes strong limits on the diffusion and turnover of rates of maintenance molecules, as well as on the morphologic properties of synaptic spines. These constraints are quite general and apply to most existing models suggested for maintenance. The parameter values can be experimentally evaluated, and if they do not fit the appropriate predicted range, the validity of this class of maintenance models would be challenged.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Multimodal, Multiscale Insights into Hippocampal Seizures Enabled by Transparent, Graphene-Based Microelectrode Arrays</a></h4>

              
                <p>Hippocampal seizures are a defining feature of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). Area CA1 of the hippocampus is commonly implicated in the generation of seizures, which may occur because of the activity of endogenous cell populations or of inputs from other regions within the hippocampal formation. Simultaneously observing activity at the cellular and network scales <I>in vivo</I> remains challenging. Here, we present a novel technology for simultaneous electrophysiology and multicellular calcium imaging of CA1 pyramidal cells (PCs) in mice enabled by a transparent graphene-based microelectrode array (Gr MEA). We examine PC firing at seizure onset, oscillatory coupling, and the dynamics of the seizure traveling wave as seizures evolve. Finally, we couple features derived from both modalities to predict the speed of the traveling wave using bootstrap aggregated regression trees. Analysis of the most important features in the regression trees suggests a transition among states in the evolution of hippocampal seizures.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A generalized Flory-Stockmayer kinetic theory of connectivity percolation and rigidity percolation of cytoskeletal networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Carlos Bueno, James Liman, Nicholas P. Schafer, Margaret S. Cheung, Peter G. Wolynes</p>

Actin networks are essential for living cells to move, reproduce, and sense their environments. The dynamic and rheological behavior of actin networks is modulated by actin-binding proteins such as α-actinin, Arp2/3, and myosin. There is experimental evidence that actin-binding proteins modulate the cooperation of myosin motors by connecting the actin network. In this work, we present an analytical mean field model, using the Flory-Stockmayer theory of gelation, to understand how different actin-binding proteins change the connectivity of the actin filaments as the networks are formed. We follow the kinetics of the networks and estimate the concentrations of actin-binding proteins that are needed to reach connectivity percolation as well as to reach rigidity percolation. We find that Arp2/3 increases the actomyosin connectivity in the network in a non-monotonic way. We also describe how changing the connectivity of actomyosin networks modulates the ability of motors to exert forces, leading to three possible phases of the networks with distinctive dynamical characteristics: a sol phase, a gel phase, and an active phase. Thus, changes in the concentration and activity of actin-binding proteins in cells lead to a phase transition of the actin network, allowing the cells to perform active contraction and change their rheological properties.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modelling the acclimation capacity of coral reefs to a warming ocean</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nomenjanahary Alexia Raharinirina, Esteban Acevedo-Trejos, Agostino Merico</p>

The symbiotic relationship between corals and photosynthetic algae is the foundation of coral reef ecosystems. This relationship breaks down, leading to coral death, when sea temperature exceeds the thermal tolerance of the coral-algae complex. While acclimation via phenotypic plasticity at the organismal level is an important mechanism for corals to cope with global warming, community-based shifts in response to acclimating capacities may give valuable indications about the future of corals at a regional scale. Reliable regional-scale predictions, however, are hampered by uncertainties on the speed with which coral communities will be able to acclimate. Here we present a trait-based, acclimation dynamics model, which we use in combination with observational data, to provide a first, crude estimate of the speed of coral acclimation at the community level and to investigate the effects of different global warming scenarios on three iconic reef ecosystems of the tropics: Great Barrier Reef, South East Asia, and Caribbean. The model predicts that coral acclimation may confer some level of protection by delaying the decline of some reefs such as the Great Barrier Reef. However, the current rates of acclimation will not be sufficient to rescue corals from global warming. Based on our estimates of coral acclimation capacities, the model results suggest substantial declines in coral abundances in all three regions, ranging from 12% to 55%, depending on the region and on the climate change scenario considered. Our results highlight the importance and urgency of precise assessments and quantitative estimates, for example through laboratory experiments, of the natural acclimation capacity of corals and of the speed with which corals may be able to acclimate to global warming.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Noradrenergic deficits contribute to apathy in Parkinson’s disease through the precision of expected outcomes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Frank H. Hezemans, Noham Wolpe, Claire O’Callaghan, Rong Ye, Catarina Rua, P. Simon Jones, Alexander G. Murley, Negin Holland, Ralf Regenthal, Kamen A. Tsvetanov, Roger A. Barker, Caroline H. Williams-Gray, Trevor W. Robbins, Luca Passamonti, James B. Rowe</p>

Apathy is a debilitating feature of many neuropsychiatric diseases, that is typically described as a reduction of goal-directed behaviour. Despite its prevalence and prognostic importance, the mechanisms underlying apathy remain controversial. Degeneration of the locus coeruleus-noradrenaline system is known to contribute to motivational deficits, including apathy. In healthy people, noradrenaline has been implicated in signalling the uncertainty of expectations about the environment. We proposed that noradrenergic deficits contribute to apathy by modulating the relative weighting of prior beliefs about action outcomes. We tested this hypothesis in the clinical context of Parkinson’s disease, given its associations with apathy and noradrenergic dysfunction. Participants with mild-to-moderate Parkinson’s disease (<i>N</i> = 17) completed a randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study with 40 mg of the noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor atomoxetine. Prior weighting was inferred from psychophysical analysis of performance in an effort-based visuomotor task, and was confirmed as negatively correlated with apathy. Locus coeruleus integrity was assessed <i>in vivo</i> using magnetisation transfer imaging at ultra-high field 7T. The effect of atomoxetine depended on locus coeruleus integrity: participants with a more degenerate locus coeruleus showed a greater increase in prior weighting on atomoxetine <i>versus</i> placebo. The results indicate a contribution of the noradrenergic system to apathy and potential benefit from noradrenergic treatment of people with Parkinson’s disease, subject to stratification according to locus coeruleus integrity. More broadly, these results reconcile emerging predictive processing accounts of the role of noradrenaline in goal-directed behaviour with the clinical symptom of apathy and its potential pharmacological treatment.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Multiscale modeling of presynaptic dynamics from molecular to mesoscale</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jonathan W. Garcia, Thomas M. Bartol, Terrence J. Sejnowski</p>

Chemical synapses exhibit a diverse array of internal mechanisms that affect the dynamics of transmission efficacy. Many of these processes, such as release of neurotransmitter and vesicle recycling, depend strongly on activity-dependent influx and accumulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. To model how each of these processes may affect the processing of information in neural circuits, and how their dysfunction may lead to disease states, requires a computationally efficient modelling framework, capable of generating accurate phenomenology without incurring a heavy computational cost per synapse. Constructing a phenomenologically realistic model requires the precise characterization of the timing and probability of neurotransmitter release. Difficulties arise in that functional forms of instantaneous release rate can be difficult to extract from noisy data without running many thousands of trials, and in biophysical synapses, facilitation of per-vesicle release probability is confounded by depletion. To overcome this, we obtained traces of free Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in response to various action potential stimulus trains from a molecular MCell model of a hippocampal Schaffer collateral axon. Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors were placed at varying distance from a voltage-dependent calcium channel (VDCC) cluster, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> was buffered by calbindin. Then, using the calcium traces to drive deterministic state vector models of synaptotagmin 1 and 7 (Syt-1/7), which respectively mediate synchronous and asynchronous release in excitatory hippocampal synapses, we obtained high-resolution profiles of instantaneous release rate, to which we applied functional fits. Synchronous vesicle release occurred predominantly within half a micron of the source of spike-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, while asynchronous release occurred more consistently at all distances. Both fast and slow mechanisms exhibited multi-exponential release rate curves, whose magnitudes decayed exponentially with distance from the Ca<sup>2+</sup> source. Profile parameters facilitate on different time scales according to a single, general facilitation function. These functional descriptions lay the groundwork for efficient mesoscale modelling of vesicular release dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Role of non-specific interactions in the phase-separation and maturation of macromolecules</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rakesh Krishnan, Srivastav Ranganathan, Samir K. Maji, Ranjith Padinhateeri</p>

Phase separation of biomolecules could be mediated by both specific and non-specific interactions. How the interplay between non-specific and specific interactions along with polymer entropy influences phase separation is an open question. We address this question by simulating self-associating molecules as polymer chains with a short core stretch that forms the specifically interacting functional interface and longer non-core regions that participate in non-specific/promiscuous interactions. Our results show that the interplay of specific (strength, <i>ϵ</i><sub>sp</sub>) and non-specific interactions (strength, <i>ϵ</i><sub>ns</sub>) could result in phase separation of polymers and its transition to solid-like aggregates (mature state). In the absence of <i>ϵ</i><sub>ns</sub>, the polymer chains do not dwell long enough in the vicinity of each other to undergo phase separation and transition into a mature state. On the other hand, in the limit of strong <i>ϵ</i><sub>ns</sub>, the assemblies cannot transition into the mature state and form a non-specific assembly, suggesting an optimal range of interactions favoring mature multimers. In the scenario where only a fraction (N<sub>frac</sub>) of the non-core regions participate in attractive interactions, we find that slight modifications to either <i>ϵ</i><sub>ns</sub> or N<sub>frac</sub> can result in dramatically altered self-assembled states. Using a combination of heterogeneous and homogeneous mix of polymers, we establish how this interplay between interaction energies dictates the propensity of biomolecules to find the correct binding partner at dilute concentrations in crowded environments.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Influence of confinement on the spreading of bacterial populations</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Daniel B. Amchin, Jenna A. Ott, Tapomoy Bhattacharjee, Sujit S. Datta</p>

The spreading of bacterial populations is central to processes in agriculture, the environment, and medicine. However, existing models of spreading typically focus on cells in unconfined settings—despite the fact that many bacteria inhabit complex and crowded environments, such as soils, sediments, and biological tissues/gels, in which solid obstacles confine the cells and thereby strongly regulate population spreading. Here, we develop an extended version of the classic Keller-Segel model of bacterial spreading via motility that also incorporates cellular growth and division, and explicitly considers the influence of confinement in promoting both cell-solid and cell-cell collisions. Numerical simulations of this extended model demonstrate how confinement fundamentally alters the dynamics and morphology of spreading bacterial populations, in good agreement with recent experimental results. In particular, with increasing confinement, we find that cell-cell collisions increasingly hinder the initial formation and the long-time propagation speed of chemotactic pulses. Moreover, also with increasing confinement, we find that cellular growth and division plays an increasingly dominant role in driving population spreading—eventually leading to a transition from chemotactic spreading to growth-driven spreading via a slower, jammed front. This work thus provides a theoretical foundation for further investigations of the influence of confinement on bacterial spreading. More broadly, these results help to provide a framework to predict and control the dynamics of bacterial populations in complex and crowded environments.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A randomization-based causal inference framework for uncovering environmental exposure effects on human gut microbiota</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alice J. Sommer, Annette Peters, Martina Rommel, Josef Cyrys, Harald Grallert, Dirk Haller, Christian L. Müller, Marie-Abèle C. Bind</p>

Statistical analysis of microbial genomic data within epidemiological cohort studies holds the promise to assess the influence of environmental exposures on both the host and the host-associated microbiome. However, the observational character of prospective cohort data and the intricate characteristics of microbiome data make it challenging to discover causal associations between environment and microbiome. Here, we introduce a causal inference framework based on the Rubin Causal Model that can help scientists to investigate such environment-host microbiome relationships, to capitalize on existing, possibly powerful, test statistics, and test plausible sharp null hypotheses. Using data from the German KORA cohort study, we illustrate our framework by designing two hypothetical randomized experiments with interventions of (i) air pollution reduction and (ii) smoking prevention. We study the effects of these interventions on the human gut microbiome by testing shifts in microbial diversity, changes in individual microbial abundances, and microbial network wiring between groups of matched subjects via randomization-based inference. In the smoking prevention scenario, we identify a small interconnected group of taxa worth further scrutiny, including <i>Christensenellaceae</i> and <i>Ruminococcaceae</i> genera, that have been previously associated with blood metabolite changes. These findings demonstrate that our framework may uncover potentially causal links between environmental exposure and the gut microbiome from observational data. We anticipate the present statistical framework to be a good starting point for further discoveries on the role of the gut microbiome in environmental health.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effect of Antigravity Treadmill Training on Gait and Balance in Patients with Diabetic Polyneuropathy: A Randomized Controlled Trial [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) is the most prevalent consequence of diabetes mellitus, and it has a significant impact on the patient's health. This study aims to evaluate effects of antigravity treadmill training on gait and balance in patients with DPN. Methods: The study included 45 males with type 2 diabetes who were randomly assigned to one of two groups: the experimental group (n=23) or the control group (n=22). For a period of 12 weeks, the experimental group received antigravity treadmill training (75% weight bearing, 30 min per session, three times per week) combined with traditional physical therapy. During the same time period, the control group received only traditional physical therapy. The Biodex Balance System was used to assess postural stability indices, while the GAITRite Walkway System was used to assess spatiotemporal gait parameters. All measurements were obtained before and at the end of the study after 12 weeks of treatment. Results: The mean values of all measured variables improved significantly in both groups (P<0.05), with the experimental group showing significantly greater improvements than the control group. The post-treatment gait parameters (i.e., step length, step time, double support time, velocity, and cadence) were 61.3 cm, 0.49 sec, 0.25 sec, 83.09 cm/sec, and 99.78 steps/min as well as 56.14 cm, 0.55 sec, 0.29 sec, 75.73 cm/sec, and 88.14 steps/min for the experimental and control group, respectively. The post-treatment overall stability index was 0.32 and 0.70 for the experimental and control group, respectively. Conclusions: Antigravity treadmill training in combination with traditional physical therapy appears to be superior to traditional physical therapy alone in terms of gait and balance training. As a result, the antigravity treadmill has been found to be an effective device for the rehabilitation of DPN patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Analysis of contact tracing surveillance for COVID-19 among healthcare workers in secondary referral hospital, Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are more vulnerable to COVID-19 infection. Tracing and screening cases among healthcare workers are essential to overcome the spread of COVID-19. We held surveillance at the second-referral hospital in Surabaya, Indonesia, to inspect the associating factors of infected HCWs. Methods: From 776 HCWs, we conducted a structured retrospective review of all COVID-19-confirmed HCWs and ones having contact with COVID-19 patients between February-July 2021. We associated general characteristics (i.e age, gender, working sites, etc) of the sample with the positive cases, analyzed the vaccination status, then did bivariate and multivariate regression logistic analyses to determine related factors putting HCWs at risk for COVID-19 infection.   Results: Bivariate analysis significantly revealed that 72.86% patients had a close contact (OR = 2.61; p<0.05), with medical staffs as the most frequent source (85.71%; OR = 2.19; p=0.033), for > 15 minutes contact duration (90%; OR = 1.1; p<0.05). Healthcare workers wearing proper PPE (N-95 and face shields) were significantly less exposed to COVID-19 (OR = 0.47; p<0.05; and OR = 0.46; p<0.05). Even fully-vaccinated samples were still prone to infection. (OR=1.25; p= 0.042). Common symptoms consisted of fever, rhinorrhea, sore throat, and vomiting (p=0.025l p=0.002; p<0.05; p=0.002). Multivariate regression logistic analysis disclosed that the use of N95 masks, contact duration >15 minutes, and the vaccine were the most influential factors (aOR = 1.72. 95% CI (1.029-2.88); aOR = 3.92. 95% CI (1.75-8.78); aOR = 0.39. 95% CI (0.13-0.82 )) Conclusions: Close contact, lack of compliance in wearing N95 masks, and unvaccinated status are risk factors for COVID-19 exposure to HCWs; thus, to achieve maximum prevention of intra-hospital transmission, the use of N-95 masks, contact avoidance, and vaccination, along with immediate tracing and strict health-protocols are all compulsory.

                Background: Prosthetic restorations are made to adapt or attach missing human parts in order to restore function and appearance. Maxillofacial defects connote a greater impact on patients, since the face cannot be concealed, and all the senses of the human body are expressed in it. Therefore, in order to restore the patient’s quality of life, they are the ones that require the best possible adaptation to the characteristics of the patients. Methods: For the maxillofacial prostheses to fit patients, they must be personalized for each patient. The NGO “Mais Identidade” is a multidisciplinary team that specializes in the rehabilitation of patients with maxillofacial trauma. They use digital manufacturing as a tool to manufacture personalized maxillofacial prostheses for patients. With the help of the NGO, the following research is conducted with the purpose of evaluating different methods of additive manufacturing, 3D printing, in order to select the equipment that suits the needs of the method used in the manufacture of maxillofacial prostheses. To this end, eyelid models will be manufactured in different additive manufacturing equipment, and these will be evaluated according to their economic, physical, and aesthetic characteristics.

                Background: Cisplatin (CP) is one of the chemotherapeutic drugs widely utilized in the treatment of several malignancies. However, recently; its use has been limited because of its hazardous health drawbacks. Previous researches confirmed that CP has severe deleterious side effects on pregnant mothers and their fetuses. Garlic (Allium sativum) extract has been claimed to exhibit potent antioxidative and free radical scavenging abilities. Aim: This work is mainly designed to evaluate the potential therapeutic role of garlic extract against CP-induced nephrotoxicity in pregnant rats and their offspring. Methods: 24 pregnant rats were used in the current study. They were randomly allocated into four groups (n=6):  control, garlic, CP, and CP + garlic group. At the end of the weaning period, the mothers and the offsprings of all groups were sacrificed, the kidneys were immediately excised, and processed for histological and biochemical investigations. Also, blood samples were withdrawn and processed for estimation of the assigned biochemical parameters.   Results: The renal histological sections from CP-treated mother rats displayed pronounced histopathological lesions however, their offspring showed mild renal histopathological lesions if compared with those of their mothers. The levels of renal tissue Superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase enzymes were significantly decreased. On the contrary, the levels of malondialdehyde, serum urea, and creatinine were significantly increased in CP-treated mother rats and their offspring as compared with control. The percentage value of caspase 3 activity was markedly elevated in the renal tissues of CP-treated mother rats and their offspring compared to the control group. Supplementation of garlic extract to the CP treated rats; the overall histological lesions, as well as biochemical parameters, were restored nearly to the control ones. It is concluded that garlic (Allium sativum) extract has a powerful ameliorative role against CP-induced nephrotoxicity in pregnant rats and their offspring.

                Background: Sexual dysfunction is common among patients with mental disorders but receives less clinical attention, especially in Thailand and other Asian countries. The Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale-the Thai Translation (ASEX-Thai), a self-rated, brief, questionnaire is a potential tool for screening for sexual dysfunction in this population. Our study aimed to assess the reliability and validity of ASEX-Thai in Thai patients with mental disorders. Methods: We enrolled 202 patients from an outpatient psychiatric department at a tertiary hospital in Bangkok, Thailand. Demographic data, clinical data, and diagnosis of sexual dysfunction were assessed. ASEX-Thai was done, and we analyzed the test’s psychometric properties.  Results: Most participants were diagnosed with major depressive disorder (48%). A score of ≥ 17 points of the ASEX-Thai was the most suitable for sexual dysfunction screening (sensitivity 77.23 %, and specificity 58.42 %). For reliability, the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient (0.831) showed good internal consistency. Conclusions: The ASEX-Thai is a valid and reliable self-rated questionnaire for screening for sexual dysfunction among Thai patients with mental disorders. The test could help clinicians to evaluate this undetected condition and deliver proper interventions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">ASEAN and the Frankenstein dilemma: Will ASEAN become a monster? [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: International organizations are pivotal as actors in international relations. Although its establishment represents a state, they have their objectives separate from their creators. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations [ASEAN] was created to handle cooperation and maintain peace and security in Southeast Asia. Although ASEAN was equipped with institutional organs to fulfil its purposes, member states' influence is unavoidable. This situation raises the Frankenstein dilemma in which creators cannot fully control its creature. This research aims to elaborate on ASEAN as a separate institution with independent objectives and how far member states can manage ASEAN as its creation. Methods: This study uses descriptive-analytical legal research as a method to examine ASEAN constitutional instruments and its first legal text to elaborate on its capacity as a legal person and its role in distinguishing interests between member states. The two ASEAN constitutional instruments are the Bangkok Declaration, 1967, and The ASEAN Charter, 2007, while the first legal instrument is the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation. All of the resources were gathered from ASEAN legal instruments database.  Results: After carefully examining the documents, since its establishment ASEAN has kept member states at arms-length to realize their interests; the ASEAN position is only to legalize what its member state wants. Even after 40 years, this situation has not changed. While ASEAN has independent objectives and structures, its member states always made institutional designs to control ASEAN's capacity to act in the international forum. In this case, ASEAN is always under the authority of its member states and has never evolved like Frankenstein's creature. Conclusions: ASEAN will never turn into a monster as ASEAN never has sole interests that contradict its members. ASEAN member states always design ASEAN constitutional and legal instruments to restrict its role as an independent legal person in international forums.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The structures of neurons, such as dendrites and axonal projections, are closely related to their response properties and their specific functions in neural circuits. Identified neurons, having genetically determined morphological features and pre- and postsynaptic partners, play significant roles in specific behaviors. Giant interneurons (GIs) are identified in the terminal abdominal ganglion of the cricket as mechanosensory projection neurons and are sensitive to airflow stimulation of the cerci. GIs are classified into ventral GIs (vGIs) or dorsal GIs (dGIs) depending on the location of their axons running within the connective nerve cord. Based on their response properties to airflow, vGIs are presumed to be involved in triggering the wind-elicited escape response, whereas dGIs are thought to be airflow direction-encoding neurons. The previous findings regarding airflow sensitivity point to possible differences in the morphology of the central projections that may correspond to their neural functions. However, the detailed morphologies of the GIs in the cephalic and thoracic ganglia of adult crickets remain unclear. In this study, we stained six GIs, namely, GI 8-1 (medial giant interneuron, MGI), 9-1 (lateral giant interneuron, LGI), 9-2, 9-3, 10-2, and 10-3, using intracellular iontophoretic or pressure injection of dyes. Staining revealed remarkable differences in the axonal branching patterns between vGIs and dGIs. The dGIs were further divided into subgroups based on the profiles of their axon collaterals and projection sites in the brain. The anatomical differences between the GIs’ central projections seemed to be related to their information encodement and behavioral functions.</p>

                Despite decades of experimental and clinical practice, the neuropsychological mechanisms underlying neurofeedback (NF) training remain obscure. NF is a unique form of reinforcement learning (RL) task, during which participants are provided with rewarding feedback regarding desired changes in neural patterns. However, key RL considerations – including choices during practice, prediction errors, credit-assignment problems, or the exploration–exploitation tradeoff – have infrequently been considered in the context of NF.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Complex fitness landscape shapes variation in a hyperpolymorphic species</a></h4>

              
                It is natural to assume that patterns of genetic variation in hyperpolymorphic species can reveal large-scale properties of the fitness landscape that are hard to detect by studying species with ordinary levels of genetic variation. Here, we study such patterns in a fungus <i>Schizophyllum commune</i>, the most polymorphic species known. Throughout the genome, short-range linkage disequilibrium (LD) caused by attraction of minor alleles is higher between pairs of nonsynonymous than of synonymous variants. This effect is especially pronounced for pairs of sites that are located within the same gene, especially if a large fraction of the gene is covered by haploblocks, genome segments where the gene pool consists of two highly divergent haplotypes, which is a signature of balancing selection. Haploblocks are usually shorter than 1000 nucleotides, and collectively cover about 10% of the <i>S. commune</i> genome. LD tends to be substantially higher for pairs of nonsynonymous variants encoding amino acids that interact within the protein. There is a substantial correlation between LDs at the same pairs of nonsynonymous mutations in the USA and the Russian populations. These patterns indicate that selection in <i>S. commune</i> involves positive epistasis due to compensatory interactions between nonsynonymous alleles. When less polymorphic species are studied, analogous patterns can be detected only through interspecific comparisons.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Human visual gamma for color stimuli</a></h4>

              
                Strong gamma-band oscillations in primate early visual cortex can be induced by homogeneous color surfaces (Peter et al., 2019; Shirhatti and Ray, 2018). Compared to other hues, particularly strong gamma oscillations have been reported for red stimuli. However, precortical color processing and the resultant strength of input to V1 has often not been fully controlled for. Therefore, stronger responses to red might be due to differences in V1 input strength. We presented stimuli that had equal luminance and cone contrast levels in a color coordinate system based on responses of the lateral geniculate nucleus, the main input source for area V1. With these stimuli, we recorded magnetoencephalography in 30 human participants. We found gamma oscillations in early visual cortex which, contrary to previous reports, did not differ between red and green stimuli of equal L-M cone contrast. Notably, blue stimuli with contrast exclusively on the S‑cone axis induced very weak gamma responses, as well as smaller event-related fields and poorer change-detection performance. The strength of human color gamma responses for stimuli on the L-M axis could be well explained by L-M cone contrast and did not show a clear red bias when L-M cone contrast was properly equalized.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A novel lineage-tracing mouse model for studying early MmuPV1 infections</a></h4>

              
                Human papillomaviruses are DNA viruses that ubiquitously infect humans and have been associated with hyperproliferative lesions. The recently discovered mouse specific papillomavirus (MmuPV1) provides the opportunity to study papillomavirus infections in vivo in the context of a common laboratory mouse model (<i>Mus musculus</i>). To date, a major challenge in the field has been the lack of tools to identify, observe, and characterize individually the papillomavirus hosting cells and also trace the progeny of these cells over time. Here, we present the successful generation of an in vivo lineage-tracing model of MmuPV1-harboring cells and their progeny by means of genetic reporter activation. Following the validation of the system both in vitro and in vivo, we used it to provide a proof-of-concept of its utility. Using flow-cytometry analysis, we observed increased proliferation dynamics and decreased MHC-I cell surface expression in MmuPV1-treated tissues which could have implications in tissue regenerative capacity and ability to clear the virus. This model is a novel tool to study the biology of the MmuPV1 host-pathogen interactions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">MDGAs are fast-diffusing molecules that delay excitatory synapse development by altering neuroligin behavior</a></h4>

              
                MDGA molecules can bind neuroligins and interfere with trans-synaptic interactions to neurexins, thereby impairing synapse development. However, the subcellular localization and dynamics of MDGAs, or their specific action mode in neurons remain unclear. Here, surface immunostaining of endogenous MDGAs and single molecule tracking of recombinant MDGAs in dissociated hippocampal neurons reveal that MDGAs are homogeneously distributed and exhibit fast membrane diffusion, with a small reduction in mobility across neuronal maturation. Knocking-down/out MDGAs using shRNAs and CRISPR/Cas9 strategies increases the density of excitatory synapses, the membrane confinement of neuroligin-1, and the phosphotyrosine level of neuroligins associated with excitatory post-synaptic differentiation. Finally, MDGA silencing reduces the mobility of AMPA receptors, increases the frequency of miniature EPSCs (but not IPSCs), and selectively enhances evoked AMPA-receptor-mediated EPSCs in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Overall, our results support a mechanism by which interactions between MDGAs and neuroligin-1 delays the assembly of functional excitatory synapses containing AMPA receptors.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Proximal CA1 20-40 Hz power dynamics reflect trial-specific information processing supporting nonspatial sequence memory</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus is known to play a critical role in processing information about temporal context. However, it remains unclear how hippocampal oscillations are involved, and how their functional organization is influenced by connectivity gradients. We examined local field potential activity in CA1 as rats performed a nonspatial odor sequence memory task. We found that odor sequence processing epochs were characterized by distinct spectral profiles and proximo-distal CA1 gradients of theta and 20-40 Hz power than track running epochs. We also discovered that 20-40 Hz power was predictive of sequence memory performance, particularly in proximal CA1 and during the plateau of high power observed on trials in which animals had to maintain their decision until instructed to respond. Altogether, these results provide evidence that dynamics of 20-40 Hz power along the CA1 axis are linked to trial-specific processing of nonspatial information critical to order judgements and are consistent with a role for 20-40 Hz power in gating information processing.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A LAMP sequencing approach for high-throughput co-detection of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus in human saliva</a></h4>

              
                The COVID-19 pandemic has created an urgent need for rapid, effective, and low-cost SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing. Here, we describe COV-ID, an approach that combines RT-LAMP with deep sequencing to detect SARS-CoV-2 in unprocessed human saliva with a low limit of detection (5–10 virions). Based on a multi-dimensional barcoding strategy, COV-ID can be used to test thousands of samples overnight in a single sequencing run with limited labor and laboratory equipment. The sequencing-based readout allows COV-ID to detect multiple amplicons simultaneously, including key controls such as host transcripts and artificial spike-ins, as well as multiple pathogens. Here, we demonstrate this flexibility by simultaneous detection of 4 amplicons in contrived saliva samples: SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, human <i>STATHERIN</i>, and an artificial SARS calibration standard. The approach was validated on clinical saliva samples, where it showed excellent agreement with RT-qPCR. COV-ID can also be performed directly on saliva absorbed on filter paper, simplifying collection logistics and sample handling.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Von Willebrand factor A1 domain stability and affinity for GPIbα are differentially regulated by its O-glycosylated N- and C-linker</a></h4>

              
                Hemostasis in the arterial circulation is mediated by binding of the A1 domain of the ultralong protein von Willebrand factor (VWF) to GPIbα on platelets to form a platelet plug. A1 is activated by tensile force on VWF concatemers imparted by hydrodynamic drag force. The A1 core is protected from force-induced unfolding by a long-range disulfide that links cysteines near its N- and C-termini. The <i>O</i>-glycosylated linkers between A1 and its neighboring domains, which transmit tensile force to A1, are reported to regulate A1 activation for binding to GPIb, but the mechanism is controversial and incompletely defined. Here, we study how these linkers, and their polypeptide and <i>O</i>-glycan moieties, regulate A1 affinity by measuring affinity, kinetics, thermodynamics, hydrogen deuterium exchange (HDX), and unfolding by temperature and urea. The N-linker lowers A1 affinity 40-fold with a stronger contribution from its <i>O</i>-glycan than polypeptide moiety. The N-linker also decreases HDX in specific regions of A1 and increases thermal stability and the energy gap between its native state and an intermediate state, which is observed in urea-induced unfolding. The C-linker also decreases affinity of A1 for GPIbα, but in contrast to the N-linker, has no significant effect on HDX or A1 stability. Among different models for A1 activation, our data are consistent with the model that the intermediate state has high affinity for GPIbα, which is induced by tensile force physiologically and regulated allosterically by the N-linker.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reproducibility of in-vivo electrophysiological measurements in mice</a></h4>

              
                Understanding whole-brain-scale electrophysiological recordings will rely on the collective work of multiple labs. Because two labs recording from the same brain area often reach different conclusions, it is critical to quantify and control for features that decrease reproducibility. To address these issues, we formed a multi-lab collaboration using a shared, open-source behavioral task and experimental apparatus. We repeatedly inserted Neuropixels multi-electrode probes targeting the same brain locations (including posterior parietal cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus) in mice performing the behavioral task. We gathered data across 9 labs and developed a common histological and data processing pipeline to analyze the resulting large datasets. After applying stringent behavioral, histological, and electrophysiological quality-control criteria, we found that neuronal yield, firing rates, spike amplitudes, and task-modulated neuronal activity were reproducible across laboratories. To quantify variance in neural activity explained by task variables (e.g., stimulus onset time), behavioral variables (timing of licks/paw movements), and other variables (e.g., spatial location in the brain or the lab ID), we developed a multi-task neural network encoding model that extends common, simpler regression approaches by allowing nonlinear interactions between variables. We found that within-lab random effects captured by this model were comparable to between-lab random effects. Taken together, these results demonstrate that across-lab standardization of electrophysiological procedures can lead to reproducible results across labs. Moreover, our protocols to achieve reproducibility, along with our analyses to evaluate it are openly accessible to the scientific community, along with our extensive electrophysiological dataset with corresponding behavior and open-source analysis code.

                This paper proposes a tool for automatic and optimal tuning of pulse amplitude and width for sequential parameter estimation (SPE) of the membrane time constant and input-output curve in closed-loop electromyography-guided (EMG-guided) controllable transcranial magnetic stimulation (cTMS). A normalized depolarization factor is defined which separates the optimization of the pulse amplitude and width. Then, the pulse amplitude is chosen by the maximization of the Fisher information matrix (FIM), while the pulse width is chosen by the maximization of the normalized depolarization factor. The simulation results confirm satisfactory estimation. The results show that the normalized depolarization factor maximization can identify the critical pulse width, which is an important parameter in the identifiability analysis, without any prior neurophysiological or anatomical knowledge of the neural membrane.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Comparative brain structure and the neural network features of cuttlefish and squid</a></h4>

              
                Cuttlefishes, like their octopus cousins, are masters of camouflage by control of body pattern and skin texture to blend in with their surroundings for prey ambush and threat avoidance. Aside from significant progress on the cuttlefish visual perception and communication, a growing number of studies have focused on their behavioural neurobiology and the remarkably rapid and apparently cognitively complex reactions to novel challenges such as spatial learning to solve maze tasks and vertebrate-like cognitive capabilities (e.g. object recognition, number sense and episodic-like memory). Despite intense interest of cuttlefish, much of our knowledge of its neuroanatomy and links to behaviour and ecology comes from one temperate species, the European common cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis. Here we present the first detailed comparison of neuroanatomical features between the tropical cuttlefish and squid and describe differences in basic brain and wiring anatomy using MRI-based techniques and conventional histology. Furthermore, comparisons amongst nocturnal and diurnal cuttlefish species suggest that the characteristic neuroanatomical features infer interspecific variation in visual capabilities, the importance of vision relative to the less utilised chemosensory system and clear links with life modes (e.g. diurnal vs nocturnal), ecological factors (e.g. living depth and ambient light condition) as well as to an extent, phylogeny. These findings link brain heterogeneity to ecological niches and lifestyle, feeding hypotheses around evolutionary history and provide a timely, new technology update to older literature.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multi-policy models of interregional communication in the human connectome</a></h4>

              
                Network models of communication, e.g. shortest paths, diffusion, navigation, have become useful tools for studying structure-function relationships in the brain. These models generate estimates of communication efficiency between all pairs of brain regions, which can then be linked to the correlation structure of recorded activity, i.e. functional connectivity (FC). At present, however, communication models have a number of limitations, including difficulty adjudicating between models and the absence of a generic framework for modeling multiple interacting communication policies at the regional level. Here, we present a framework that allows us to incorporate multiple region-specific policies and fit them to empirical estimates of FC. Briefly, we show many communication policies, including shortest paths and greedy navigation, can be modeled as biased random walks, enabling these policies to be incorporated into the same multi-policy communication model alongside unbiased processes, e.g. diffusion. We show that these multi-policy models outperform existing communication measures while yielding neurobiologically interpretable regional preferences. Further, we show that these models explain the majority of variance in time-varying patterns of FC. Collectively, our framework represents an advance in network-based communication models and establishes a strong link between these patterns and FC. Our findings open up many new avenues for future inquiries and present a flexible framework for modeling anatomically-constrained communication.

	<p>Background: Stroke is a high burden illness and the second leading cause of worldwide disability with generally poor recovery rates. Robust benefits of hippotherapy, a novel neurorehabilitation approach, in functional recovery following various severe neurological disabling conditions has been shown. In the present study, we will analyze the effect of a hippotherapy program on the outcome of post-stroke patients in the first year post-stroke. Method: A randomized controlled clinical trial on the effectiveness of hippotherapy (4 weeks/18 weeks hippotherapy/conventional neurorehabilitation) versus conventional neurorehabilitation alone (22 weeks) will be conducted over 48 weeks. In the treated group, one-hour daily hippotherapy sessions will be exclusively conducted during the hippotherapy&amp;amp;rsquo;s cycles, alternated with periods of conventional neurorehabilitation. A test battery will measure both the functional and psychological outcomes. The primary endpoint will be the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s functional independence. The secondary endpoints will measure the sensorimotor function, autonomy, and quality of life, as well as the caregivers&amp;amp;rsquo; quality of life. Results and conclusion: Individual brain connectome, life history and personality construct influence the brain&amp;amp;rsquo;s functional connectivity and are central to developing optimal tailored neurorehabilitation strategies. According to our current practice, hippotherapy allows the enhancement of substantial neuroplastic changes in the injured brain with significant neurological recovery. The protocol aims to confirm those issues. Trial registration in ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04759326 accessed on 19 February 2021.</p>

	<p>Background: There are a number of medications prescribed to address comorbid challenging behaviors in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), including risperidone and aripiprazole. This retrospective case series reports the use of these drugs in children aged 2 to 13 years. Methodology: A total of 82 children (mean age, 5 years; 79% male) with ASD treated at the Kids Neuro Clinic and Rehab Center in Dubai between January 2020 and September 2021 were included in this retrospective case series. All patients had comorbid challenging behaviors that were resistant to standard supportive therapies alone and warranted pharmacological intervention. The Childhood Autism Rating Scale&amp;amp;mdash;2nd Edition Standard form (CARS2-ST) and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI)&amp;amp;mdash;Severity (CGI-S) and CGI&amp;amp;mdash;Improvement (CGI-I) scales were used to assess the severity of ASD at baseline and to monitor response to treatment with risperidone or aripiprazole. Results: Besides the expected improvement in comorbid challenging behaviors, 79/82 patients (96%) attained a CGI-I score of 2 or 1 following treatment, and 35/82 patients (43%) achieved both a CGI-I score of 1 and minimal-to-no symptoms as per the CARS2-ST test, with complete resolution of their ASD signs and symptoms. The differences in the overall mean CARS2-ST and CGI-S scores pre- and post-treatment were statistically significant (Z = &amp;amp;minus;7.86, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001 for both), with pre- and post-treatment mean values of 42 and 23 for CARS2-ST, respectively, and 6 and 2 for CGI-S, respectively. The main side effects were asymptomatic elevated prolactin (n = 12) and excessive weight gain (n = 2). Conclusions: When combined with standard supportive therapies, chronic treatment with antipsychotic medications, either with or without medications for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, was well tolerated and effective in the treatment of ASD core symptoms and comorbid behaviors in young children. Double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials are needed to verify these findings.</p>

	<p>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by the progressive degeneration of upper or lower motor neurons, leading to muscle wasting and paralysis, resulting in respiratory failure and death. The precise ALS aetiology is poorly understood, mainly due to clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Thus, the identification of reliable biomarkers of disease could be helpful in clinical practice. In this study, we investigated whether the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its precursor Pro-BDNF in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may reflect the pathological changes related to ALS. We found higher BDNF and lower Pro-BDNF levels in ALS sera compared to healthy controls. BDNF/Pro-BDNF ratio turned out to be accurate in distinguishing ALS patients from controls. Then, the correlations of these markers with several ALS clinical variables were evaluated. This analysis revealed three statistically significant associations: (1) Patients carrying the C9orf72 expansion significantly differed from non-carrier patients and showed serum BDNF levels comparable to control subjects; (2) BDNF levels in CSF were significantly higher in ALS patients with faster disease progression; (3) lower serum levels of Pro-BDNF were associated with a shorter survival. Therefore, we suggest that BDNF and Pro-BDNF, alone or in combination, might be used as ALS prognostic biomarkers.</p>

	<p>Previous work has provided contrasting evidence on syntax acquisition. Syntax-internal factors, i.e., instinctive knowledge of the universals of grammar (UG) for finite-state grammar (FSG) and phrase-structure grammar (PSG) but also syntax-external factors such as language competence, working memory (WM) and demographic factors may affect syntax acquisition. This study employed an artificial grammar paradigm to identify which factors predicted syntax acquisition. Thirty-seven healthy individuals and forty-nine left-hemispheric stroke patients (fourteen with aphasia) read syllable sequences adhering to or violating FSG and PSG. They performed preference classifications followed by grammatical classifications (after training). Results showed the best classification accuracy for sequences adhering to UG, with performance predicted by syntactic competence and spatial WM. Classification of ungrammatical sequences improved after training and was predicted by verbal WM. Although accuracy on FSG was better than on PSG, generalization was fully possible only for PSG. Education was the best predictor of syntax acquisition, while aphasia and lesion volume were not predictors. This study shows a clear preference for UG, which is influenced by spatial and linguistic knowledge, but not by the presence of aphasia. Verbal WM supported the identification of rule violations. Moreover, the acquisition of FSG and PSG was related to partially different mechanisms, but both depended on education.</p>

	<p>Schizophrenia is a severe neuropsychiatric disease whose diagnosis, unfortunately, lacks an objective diagnostic tool supporting a thorough psychiatric examination of the patient. We took advantage of today&amp;amp;rsquo;s computational abilities, structural magnetic resonance imaging, and modern machine learning methods, such as stacked autoencoders (SAE) and 3D convolutional neural networks (3D CNN), to teach them to classify 52 patients with schizophrenia and 52 healthy controls. The main aim of this study was to explore whether complex feature extraction methods can help improve the accuracy of deep learning-based classifiers compared to minimally preprocessed data. Our experiments employed three commonly used preprocessing steps to extract three different feature types. They included voxel-based morphometry, deformation-based morphometry, and simple spatial normalization of brain tissue. In addition to classifier models, features and their combination, other model parameters such as network depth, number of neurons, number of convolutional filters, and input data size were also investigated. Autoencoders were trained on feature pools of 1000 and 5000 voxels selected by Mann-Whitney tests, and 3D CNNs were trained on whole images. The most successful model architecture (autoencoders) achieved the highest average accuracy of 69.62% (sensitivity 68.85%, specificity 70.38%). The results of all experiments were statistically compared (the Mann-Whitney test). In conclusion, SAE outperformed 3D CNN, while preprocessing using VBM helped SAE improve the results.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A task-general connectivity model reveals variation in convergence of cortical inputs to functional regions of the cerebellum</a></h4>

              
                While resting-state fMRI studies have provided a broad picture of the connectivity between human neocortex and cerebellum, the degree of convergence of cortical inputs onto cerebellar circuits remains unknown: Does each cerebellar region receive input from a single cortical area or convergent inputs from multiple cortical areas? Here we use task-based fMRI data to build a range of cortico-cerebellar connectivity models, each allowing for a different degree of convergence. We compared these models by their ability to predict cerebellar activity patterns for novel task sets. Models that allow some degree of convergence provided the best predictions, arguing for convergence of multiple cortical inputs onto single cerebellar voxels. Importantly, the degree of convergence varied across the cerebellum with the highest convergence observed in areas linked to language, working memory, and social cognition. These findings suggest important differences in the way that functional subdivisions of the cerebellum support motor and cognitive function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Characteristics and Impact of the rNST GABA Network on Neural and Behavioral Taste Responses</a></h4>

              
                The rostral nucleus of the solitary tract (rNST), the initial CNS site for processing gustatory information, is comprised of two major cell types, glutamatergic excitatory and GABAergic inhibitory neurons. Many investigators have described taste responses of rNST neurons, but the phenotypes of these cells were unknown. The current investigation used mice expressing ChR2 under the control of GAD65, a synthetic enzyme for GABA. In vivo single-unit recording of rNST cells during optogenetic stimulation allowed us to address two important questions: (1) what are the gustatory response characteristics of 'optotagged', putative GABAergic (G+TASTE) neurons? and (2) how does optogenetic activation of the rNST GABA network impact taste responses in non-GABAergic (G-TASTE) neurons? We observed that chemosensitive profiles of G+TASTE neurons were similar to non-GABA taste neurons but had much lower response rates. We further observed that there was a population of GABA cells unresponsive to taste stimulation (G+UNR) and located more ventrally in the nucleus. Activating rNST inhibitory circuitry suppressed gustatory responses of G-TASTE neurons across all qualities and types of chemosensitive neurons. Tuning curves were modestly sharpened but the overall shape of response profiles and the ensemble pattern remained highly stable. These neurophysiological effects were consistent with the behavioral consequences of activating GAD65-expressing inhibitory neurons using DREADDs. In a brief-access licking task, concentration-response curves to both palatable (sucrose, maltrin) and unpalatable (quinine) stimuli were shifted to the right when GABA neurons were activated. Thus, the rNST GABAergic network is poised to modulate taste intensity across the qualitative and hedonic spectrum.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Opposing associations of Internet Use Disorder symptom domains with structural and functional organization of the striatum: a dimensional neuroimaging approach</a></h4>

              
                Background: Accumulating evidence suggests brain structural and functional alterations in Internet Use Disorder (IUD). However, conclusions are strongly limited due to the retrospective case-control design of the studies, small samples, and the focus on general rather than symptom-specific approaches. Methods: We here employed a dimensional multi-methodical MRI-neuroimaging design in a final sample of n = 203 subjects to examine associations between levels of IUD and its symptom-dimensions (loss of control/time management, craving/social problems) with brain structure, resting state and task-based (pain empathy, affective go/no-go) brain function. Results: Although the present sample covered the entire range of IUD, including normal, problematic as well as pathological levels, general IUD symptom load was not associated with brain structural or functional alterations. However, the symptom-dimensions exhibited opposing associations with the intrinsic and structural organization of the brain, such that loss of control/time management exhibited negative associations with intrinsic striatal networks and hippocampal volume, while craving/social problems exhibited a positive association with intrinsic striatal networks and caudate volume. Conclusions: Our findings provided the first evidence for IUD symptom-domain specific associations with progressive alterations in the intrinsic structural and functional organization of the brain, particularly of striatal systems involved in reward, habitual and cognitive control processes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A sequential two-step priming scheme reproduces diversity in synaptic strength and short-term plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Glutamatergic synapses display variable strength and diverse short-term plasticity (STP), even for a given type of connection. Using non-negative tensor factorization (NTF) and conventional state modelling, we demonstrate that a kinetic scheme consisting of two sequential and reversible steps of release-machinery assembly and a final step of synaptic vesicle (SV) fusion reproduces STP and its diversity among synapses. Analyzing transmission at calyx of Held synapses reveals that differences in synaptic strength and STP are not primarily caused by variable fusion probability (pfusion) but determined by the fraction of docked synaptic vesicles equipped with a mature release machinery. Our simulations show, that traditional quantal analysis methods do not necessarily report pfusion of SVs with a mature release machinery but reflect both pfusion and the distribution between mature and immature priming states at rest. Thus, the approach holds promise for a better mechanistic dissection of the roles of presynaptic proteins in the sequence of SV docking, two-step priming and fusion and suggests a mechanism for activity-induced redistribution of synaptic efficacy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Predicting Working Memory performance based on specific individual EEG spatiotemporal features</a></h4>

              
                Working Memory (WM) is a limited capacity system for storing and processing information, which varies from subject to subject. Several works show the ability to predict the performance of WM with machine learning (ML) methods, and although good prediction results are obtained in these works, ignoring the intersubject variability and the temporal and spatial characterization in a WM task to improve the prediction in each subject. In this paper, we take advantage of the spectral properties of WM to characterize the individual differences in visual WM capacity and predict the subject's performance. Feature selection was implemented through the selection of electrodes making use of methods to treat unbalanced classes. The results show a correlation between the accuracy achieved with an Regularized Linear Discriminant Analysis (RLDA) classifier using the power spectrum of the EEG signal and the accuracy achieved by each subject in the behavioral experiment response of a WM task with retro-cue. The proposed methodology allows identifying spatial and temporal characteristics in the WM performance in each subject. Our methodology shows that it is possible to predict the WM performance in each subject. Finally, our results showed that by knowing the spatiotemporal characteristics that predict WM performance, it is possible to customize a WM task and optimize the use of electrodes for agile processing adapted to a specific subject. Thus, we pave the way for implementing neurofeedback through a Brain-Computer Interface.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamic emergence of relational structure network in human brains</a></h4>

              
                Reasoning the hidden relational structure from sequences of events is a crucial ability humans possess, which help them to predict the future and make inferences. Besides simple statistical properties, humans also excel in learning more complex relational networks. Several brain regions are engaged in the process, yet the time-resolved neural implementation of relational structure learning and its behavioral relevance remains unknown. Here human subjects performed a probabilistic sequential prediction task on image sequences generated from a transition graph-like network, with their brain activities recorded using electroencephalography (EEG). We demonstrate the emergence of two key aspects of relational knowledge - lower-order transition probability and higher-order community structure, which arise around 840 msec after image onset and well predict behavioral performance. Furthermore, computational modeling suggests that the formed higher-order community structure, i.e., compressed clusters in the network, could be well characterized by a successor representation operation. Overall, human brains are constantly computing the temporal statistical relationship among discrete inputs, based on which new abstract knowledge could be inferred.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Nitric oxide-induced tyrosine nitration of TrkB impairs BDNF signaling and restrains neuronal plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Nitric oxide has been long recognized as an important modulator of neural plasticity, but characterization of the molecular mechanisms involved - specially the guanylyl cyclase-independent ones - has been challenging. There is evidence that NO could modify BDNF-TRKB signaling, a key mediator of neuronal plasticity. However, the mechanism underlying the interplay of NO and TRKB remains unclear. Here we show that nitric oxide induces nitration of the tyrosine 816 in the TRKB receptor in vivo and in vitro, and that post-translational modification inhibits TRKB phosphorylation and binding of phospholipase C{gamma}1 (PLC{gamma}1) to this same tyrosine residue. Additionally, nitration triggers clathrin-dependent endocytosis of TRKB through the adaptor protein AP2M and ubiquitination, thereby increasing translocation of TRKB away from the neuronal surface and directing it towards lysosomal degradation. Accordingly, inhibition of nitric oxide increases TRKB phosphorylation and TRKB-dependent neurite branching in neuronal cultures. In vivo, chronic inhibition of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) dramatically reduced TRKB nitration and facilitated TRKB signaling in the primary visual cortex, and promoted a shift in ocular dominance upon monocular deprivation in the visual cortex - an indicator of increased plasticity. Altogether, our data describe and characterize a new molecular brake on plasticity, namely nitration of TRKB receptors.

Significance statementWe described the nitration of TRKB receptors at the tyrosine residue 816 as a new post-translational modification (PTM) that restrains the signaling of the neurotrophic factor BDNF in neurons. This new PTM leads to endocytosis and degradation of the TRKB receptors. Intriguingly, this mechanism is tonically active under physiological conditions in vivo, and it is important for restricting ocular dominance plasticity in the visual cortex. This mechanism directly links two major systems involved in brain plasticity, BDNF/TRKB and nitric oxide. Our data provides a model for how NO production from nNOS can compromise TRKB function, and for the effects of nNOS inhibitors promoting plasticity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multi-tasking Deep Network for Tinnitus Classification and Severity Prediction from Multimodal Structural Images</a></h4>

              
                Subjective tinnitus is an auditory phantom perceptual disorder without an objective biomarker. Fast and efficient diagnostic tools will advance clinical practice by detecting or confirming the condition, tracking change in severity, and monitoring treatment response. Motivated by evidence of subtle anatomical or functional morphological information in magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the brain, we examined data-driven machine learning methods for joint tinnitus classification (tinnitus or no tinnitus) and tinnitus severity prediction. We propose a deep multi-task multi-modal framework for joint functionalities using structural MRI (sMRI) data. To leverage cross-information multimodal neuroimaging data, we integrated two modalities of 3-dimensional sMRI - T1 weighted (T1w) and T2 weighted (T2w) images. To explore the key components in the MR images that drove task performance, we segmented both T1w and T2w images into three different components - cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM), and examined performance of each segmented image. Results demonstrate that our multimodal framework capitalizes on the information across both modalities (T1w and T2w) for the joint task of tinnitus classification and severity prediction. Our model outperforms existing learning-based and conventional methods in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hemodynamic transient and functional connectivity follow structural connectivity and cell type over the brain hierarch</a></h4>

              
                The neural circuit of the brain is organized as a hierarchy of functional units with wide-ranging connections that support the information flow and functional connectivity. Studies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicate a moderate coupling between structural and functional connectivity at the system level. However, how do connections of different directions (feedforward and feedback) and regions with different excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) neurons shape the hemodynamic activity and functional connectivity over the hierarchy are unknown. Here, we used functional MRI to detect optogenetic-evoked and resting-state activities over a somatosensory pathway in the mouse brain and compared with axonal projection and E/I distribution. With a highly sensitive ultrafast imaging, we identified extensive activation in regions up to the third order of axonal projections following optogenetic excitation of the ventral posteriomedial nucleus of the thalamus. The evoked response and functional connectivity correlated with feedforward projections but less with the feedback and weakened with the hierarchy. The hemodynamic signal exhibited regional and hierarchical differences, with slower and more variable responses in high-order areas and bipolar responses predominantly in the contralateral cortex. Importantly, the positive and negative parts of hemodynamics correlated with E/I neuronal densities, respectively. Furthermore, resting-state functional connectivity more associated with E/I distribution whereas stimulus-evoked effective connectivity followed structural wiring. These findings indicate that structure-function relationship is projection-, cell-type- and hierarchy-dependent. Hemodynamic transients could reflect E/I activity and the increased complexity of hierarchical processing.

Significance statementThe neural circuit of the brain is organized as a hierarchy of functional units with complicated feedforward and feedback connections to selectively enhance (excitation) or suppress (inhibit) information from massive sensory inputs. How brain activity is shaped by the structural wiring and excitatory and inhibitory neurons are still unclear. We characterize how brain-wide hemodynamic responses reflect these structural constituents over the hierarchy of a somatosensory pathway. We find that functional activation and connectivity correlate with feedforward connection strengths and neuronal distributions. This association subsides with hierarchy due to slower and more variable hemodynamic responses, reflecting increased complexity of processing and neuronal compositions in high-order areas. Our findings indicate that hemodynamics follow the hierarchy of structural wiring and neuronal distribution.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Preconfigured dynamics in the hippocampus are guided by embryonic birthdate and rate of neurogenesis</a></h4>

              
                The incorporation of novel information into the hippocampal network is likely be constrained by its innate architecture and internally generated activity patterns. However, the origin, organization, and consequences of such patterns remain poorly understood. Here, we show that hippocampal network dynamics are affected by sequential neurogenesis. We birthdated CA1 pyramidal neurons with in-utero electroporation over 4 embryonic days encompassing the peak of hippocampal neurogenesis, and compared their functional features in freely moving, adult mice. Neurons of the same birthdate displayed distinct connectivity, coactivity across brain states, and assembly dynamics. Same birthdate hippocampal neurons were topographically organized, in that anatomically clustered (<500{micro}m) neurons exhibited overlapping spatial representations. Overall, the wiring and functional features of CA1 pyramidal neurons reflected a combination of birthdate and the rate of neurogenesis. These observations demonstrate that sequential neurogenesis in embryonic development shapes the preconfigured forms of adult network dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Phase separation of competing memories along the human hippocampal theta rhythm.</a></h4>

              
                Competition between overlapping memories is considered one of the major causes of forgetting and it is still unknown how the human brain resolves such mnemonic conflict. In the present MEG study, we empirically tested a computational model that leverages an oscillating inhibition algorithm to minimise overlap between memories. We used a proactive interference task, where a reminder word could be associated with either a single image (non-competitive condition) or two competing images, and participants were asked to always recall the most recently learned word-image association. Time-resolved pattern classifiers were trained to detect the reactivated content of target and competitor memories from MEG sensor patterns, and the timing of these neural reactivations was analysed relative to the phase of the dominant hippocampal 3Hz theta oscillation. In line with our preregistered hypotheses, target and competitor reactivations locked to different phases of the hippocampal theta rhythm after several repeated recalls. Participants who behaviourally experienced lower levels of interference also showed larger phase separation between the two overlapping memories. The findings provide evidence that the temporal segregation of memories, orchestrated by slow oscillations, plays a functional role in resolving mnemonic competition by separating and prioritising relevant memories under conditions of high interference.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Alone in a crowd: Effect of a nonfunctional lateral line on expression of the social hormone parathyroid hormone 2.</a></h4>

              
                Parathyroid hormone 2 (Pth2) is a vertebrate-specific neuropeptide whose thalamic expression is upregulated by social contact with conspecifics. However, social interactions fail to stimulate pth2 expression in isolated zebrafish whose lateral line hair cells have been chemically ablated. These results suggest that modulation of pth2 by social context is acutely dependent on mechanosensory information from the lateral line. However, it is unclear how a congenital loss of lateral line function influences the ability of zebrafish to interpret their social environment. In this study, we measure pth2 levels in zebrafish mutants lacking hair cell function in either the lateral line only, or in both the inner ear and lateral line. Socially-raised lateral line mutants express lower levels of pth2 relative to wild type siblings, but there is no further reduction when all sensory hair cells are nonfunctional. However, social isolation of hair cell mutants causes a further reduction in pth2 expression, pointing to additional unidentified sensory cues that influence pth2 production. Lastly, we report that social context modulates fluorescent transgenes driven by the pth2 promoter. Altogether, these data suggest that lateral line mutants experience a chronic sense of isolation, even when raised in a social environment.

SUMMARY STATEMENTExpression of the pro-social neuropeptide pth2 is downregulated in larval zebrafish with a congenital loss of lateral line function. Thus, even in social environments, fish with compromised lateral lines may experience chronic loneliness.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">ATXN2 is a target of N-terminal proteolysis</a></h4>

              
                Spinocerebellar ataxia 2 (SCA2) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of the poly-glutamine (polyQ) tract of Ataxin-2 (ATXN2). Other polyQ-containing proteins such as ATXN7 and huntingtin are associated with the development of neurodegenerative diseases when their N-terminal polyQ domains are expanded. Furthermore, they undergo proteolytic processing events that produce N-terminal fragments that include the polyQ stretch, which are implicated in pathogenesis. Interestingly, N-terminal ATXN2 fragments were reported in a brain extract from a SCA2 patient, but it is currently unknown whether an expanded polyQ domain contributes to ATXN2 proteolytic susceptibility. Here, we used transient expression in HEK293 cells to determine whether ATXN2 is a target for specific N-terminal proteolysis. We found that ATXN2 proteins with either normal or expanded polyQ stretches undergo proteolytic cleavage releasing an N-terminal polyQ-containing fragment. We identified a short amino acid sequence downstream of the polyQ domain that is necessary for N-terminal cleavage of full-length ATXN2 and sufficient to induce proteolysis of a heterologous protein. However, this sequence is not required for cleavage of a short ATXN2 isoform produced from an alternative start codon located just upstream of the CAG repeats encoding the polyQ domain. Our study extends our understanding of ATXN2 posttranslational regulation by revealing that this protein can be the target of specific proteolytic cleavage events releasing polyQ-containing products that are modulated by the N-terminal domain of ATXN2. N-terminal ATXN2 proteolysis of expanded polyQ domains might contribute to SCA2 pathology, as observed in other neurodegenerative disorders caused by polyQ domain expansion.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Oxytocin attenuates microglial activation and restores social and non-social memory in the APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimers disease (AD) is the main cause of dementia in the elderly and is characterized by memory loss, social withdrawal and neurodegeneration, eventually leading to death. Brain inflammation has emerged as a key pathogenic mechanism in AD. We hypothesized that oxytocin, a pro-social hypothalamic neuropeptide with anti-inflammatory properties, could have therapeutic actions in AD. We investigated oxytocin production in mouse models of AD, and evaluated the therapeutic potential of intranasal oxytocin. We observed lower levels of hypothalamic oxytocin in wild-type mice following brain infusion of amyloid-{beta} oligomers (A{beta}Os), as well as in APP/PS1 AD model mice. Treatment of APP/PS1 mice with intranasal oxytocin reduced microglial activation and favored deposition of A{beta} in dense core plaques, a potentially neuroprotective mechanism. Oxytocin further alleviated social and non-social memory impairments in APP/PS1 mice. Our findings point to oxytocin as a potential therapeutic target to reduce brain inflammation and correct memory deficits in AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reinstatement of Pavlovian responses to alcohol cues by stress</a></h4>

              
                Stress may contribute to relapse to alcohol use in part by enhancing reactivity to cues previously paired with alcohol. Yet, standard models of stress-induced reinstatement generally use contingent presentations of alcohol-paired cues to reinforce instrumental behaviors, making it difficult to isolate the ability of cues to invigorate alcohol-seeking. Here we sought to test the impact of stress on behavioral responses to alcohol-paired cues, using a model of stress-induced reinstatement of Pavlovian conditioned approach, inspired by Nadia Chaudhri's work on context-induced reinstatement. Long Evans rats were trained to associate one auditory cue with delivery of alcohol or sucrose and an alternative auditory cue with no reward. Following extinction training, rats were exposed to a stressor prior to being re-exposed to the cues under extinction conditions. We assessed the effects of yohimbine, intermittent footshock and olfactory cues paired with social defeat on responses to alcohol-paired cues, and the effects of yohimbine on responses to sucrose-paired cues. The pharmacological stressor, yohimbine, enhanced Pavlovian responses to both alcohol and sucrose cues, but intermittent footshock and social defeat cues did not. While yohimbine elicited reinstatement of Pavlovian conditioned responses, these effects may be unrelated to activation of stress systems.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pattern dynamics and stochasticity of the brain rhythms</a></h4>

              
                Our current understanding of brain rhythms is based on quantifying their instantaneous or time-averaged characteristics. What remains unexplored, is the actual structure of the waves--their shapes and patterns over finite timescales. To address this, we used two independent approaches to link wave forms to their physiological functions: the first is based on quantifying their consistency with the underlying mean behavior, and the second assesses "orderliness" of the waves features. The corresponding measures capture the waves characteristic and abnormal behaviors, such as atypical periodicity or excessive clustering, and demonstrate coupling between the patterns dynamics and the animals location, speed and acceleration. Specifically, we studied patterns of{theta} and{gamma} waves, and Sharp Wave Ripples, and observed speed-modulated changes of the waves cadence, an antiphase relationship between orderliness and acceleration, as well as spatial selectiveness of patterns. Further-more, we found an interdependence between orderliness and regularity: larger deviations from steady oscillatory behavior tend to accompany disarrayed temporal cluttering of peaks and troughs. Taken together, our results offer a complementary--mesoscale--perspective on brain wave structure, dynamics, and functionality.

	<p>Horizontal gaze palsy with progressive scoliosis (HGPPS) is a rare congenital disease characterized by the absence of horizontal gaze movements, progressive scoliosis, and typical brain, cerebellum, and medullary malformations. Here we describe a pediatric HGPPS case with overlapping epilepsy and learning difficulties. A 6-year-old girl was admitted to the University Hospital of Bari for the onset of a tonic&amp;amp;ndash;clonic seizure. Electroencephalogram showed slow and sharp waves on the right side with the tendency to diffuse. Brain magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated malformations compatible with HGPPS. Ophthalmological and orthopedic evaluations confirmed conjugate horizontal gaze palsy and mild thoracolumbar scoliosis. Neuropsychological assessment attested normal intelligence but serious difficulties in reading and writing. In spite of neuroradiological malformations, visual difficulties, and spinal deformities, literature data are limited about any coexisting neurocognitive HGPPS symptoms. Literature data regarding such topics are very limited. If, on the one hand, the coexistence of such symptoms can be interpreted as occasional, it could support the idea that they could fall within a spectrum of HGPPS anomalies. In addition to the standard investigations, the activation of specific neuropsychological assessment programs could help interventions improve the specialist care and the quality of life of HGPPS patients.</p>

	<p>It is known that the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) receptor is involved in limbic brain functions by regulating dopamine transmission and putative reward circuitry. Moreover, other TAARs are expressed in the olfactory system of all studied vertebrate species, sensing innate socially-relevant odors, including pheromones. Therefore, one can assume that TAARs may play a role in rodent social and sexual behavior. A comparative behavioral and biochemical analysis of TAAR1 knockout (TAAR1-KO) and wild-type mice is also important for the preliminary evaluation of the potential side effects of future TAAR1-based therapies. In our studies, we adapted a sexual incentive motivation test for mice to evaluate the sexual behavior of TAAR1-KO and wild-type mice. Previously, similar methods were primarily applied to rats. Furthermore, we measured testosterone and other biochemical parameters in the blood. As a result, we found only minimal alterations in all of the studied parameters. Thus, the lack of TAAR1 does not significantly affect sexual motivation and routine lipid and metabolic blood biochemical parameters, suggesting that future TAAR1-based therapies should have a favorable safety profile.</p>

                <p>Nodding syndrome (NS) is a poorly understood form of childhood-onset epilepsy that is characterized by the pathognomonic ictal phenomenon of repetitive vertical head drops. To evaluate the underlying ictal neurophysiology, ictal EEG features were evaluated in nine participants with confirmed NS from South Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda and ictal presence of high frequency gamma oscillations on scalp EEG were assessed. Ictal EEG during the head nodding episode predominantly showed generalized slow waves or sharp-and-slow wave complexes followed by electrodecrement. Augmentation of gamma activity (30–70 Hz) was seen during the head nodding episode in all the participants. We confirm that head nodding episodes in persons with NS from the three geographically distinct regions in sub-Saharan Africa share the common features of slow waves with electrodecrement and superimposed gamma activity.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Heterozygous PNPT1 Variants Cause Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 25</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are characterized by genetic heterogeneity. Some mapped and named <i>loci</i> remain without a causal gene identified. Here we applied next generation sequencing (NGS) to uncover the genetic etiology of the <i>SCA25 locus</i>.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing were performed in families linked to <i>SCA25</i>, including the French family in which the <i>SCA25 locus</i> was originally mapped. Whole exome sequence data were interrogated in a cohort of 796 ataxia patients of unknown etiology.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The SCA25 phenotype spans a slowly evolving sensory and cerebellar ataxia, in most cases attributed to ganglionopathy. A pathogenic variant causing exon skipping was identified in the gene encoding Polyribonucleotide Nucleotidyltransferase PNPase 1 (<i>PNPT1)</i> located in the <i>SCA25</i> linkage interval. A second splice variant in <i>PNPT1</i> was detected in a large Australian family with a dominant ataxia also mapping to <i>SCA25</i>. An additional nonsense variant was detected in an unrelated individual with ataxia. Both nonsense and splice heterozygous variants result in premature stop codons, all located in the S1-domain of PNPase. In addition, an elevated type I interferon response was observed in blood from all affected heterozygous carriers tested. PNPase notably prevents the abnormal accumulation of double-stranded mtRNAs in the mitochondria and leakage into the cytoplasm, associated with triggering a type I interferon response.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study identifies <i>PNPT1</i> as a new SCA gene, responsible for SCA25, and highlights biological links between alterations of mtRNA trafficking, interferonopathies and ataxia. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                <p>Oxidative stress (OS) induces inflammation, which in turn exacerbates OS and the expression of acute phase proteins (APPs). Regulatory T lymphocyte (Treg) therapy was assessed for suppression of OS and APP responses in longitudinal serum samples from subjects with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) enrolled in a phase I clinical trial. The first round of Treg therapy suppressed levels of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL). During a 6-month washout period, ox-LDL levels increased. A second round of therapy again suppressed ox-LDL levels and then rose following the cessation of treatment. Serum levels of APPs, soluble CD14, lipopolysaccharide binding protein, and C-reactive protein, were stabilized during Treg administrations, but rose during the washout period and again after therapy was discontinued. Treg therapy potentially suppresses peripheral OS and the accompanying circulating pro-inflammatory induced APPs, both of which may serve as peripheral candidates for monitoring efficacies of immunomodulating therapies.

	<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a critical public health challenge. Although studies have found several prognostic factors for TBI, a useful early predictive tool for mortality has yet to be developed in the triage of the emergency room. This study aimed to use machine learning algorithms of artificial intelligence (AI) to develop predictive models for TBI patients in the emergency room triage. We retrospectively enrolled 18,249 adult TBI patients in the electronic medical records of three hospitals of Chi Mei Medical Group from January 2010 to December 2019, and undertook the 12 potentially predictive feature variables for predicting mortality during hospitalization. Six machine learning algorithms including logistical regression (LR) random forest (RF), support vector machines (SVM), LightGBM, XGBoost, and multilayer perceptron (MLP) were used to build the predictive model. The results showed that all six predictive models had high AUC from 0.851 to 0.925. Among these models, the LR-based model was the best model for mortality risk prediction with the highest AUC of 0.925; thus, we integrated the best model into the existed hospital information system for assisting clinical decision-making. These results revealed that the LR-based model was the best model to predict the mortality risk in patients with TBI in the emergency room. Since the developed prediction system can easily obtain the 12 feature variables during the initial triage, it can provide quick and early mortality prediction to clinicians for guiding deciding further treatment as well as helping explain the patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s condition to family members.</p>

	<p>Low-intensity transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) is a novel non-invasive brain stimulation technique that uses acoustic energy to induce changes in neuronal activity. However, although low-intensity TUS is a promising neuromodulation tool, it has been poorly studied as compared to other methods, i.e., transcranial magnetic and electrical stimulation. In this article, we first focus on experimental studies in animals and humans aimed at explaining its mechanisms of action. We then highlight possible applications of TUS in movement disorders, particularly in patients with parkinsonism, dystonia, and tremor. Finally, we highlight the knowledge gaps and possible limitations that currently limit potential TUS applications in movement disorders. Clarifying the potential role of TUS in movement disorders may further promote studies with therapeutic perspectives in this field.</p>

	<p>Conventional transcranial electric stimulation(tES) using standard anatomical positions for the electrodes and standard stimulation currents is frequently not sufficiently selective in targeting and reaching specific brain locations, leading to suboptimal application of electric fields. Recent advancements in in vivo electric field characterization may enable clinical researchers to derive better relationships between the electric field strength and the clinical results. Subject-specific electric field simulations could lead to improved electrode placement and more efficient treatments. Through this narrative review, we present a processing workflow to personalize tES for focal epilepsy, for which there is a clear cortical target to stimulate. The workflow utilizes clinical imaging and electroencephalography data and enables us to relate the simulated fields to clinical outcomes. We review and analyze the relevant literature for the processing steps in the workflow, which are the following: tissue segmentation, source localization, and stimulation optimization. In addition, we identify shortcomings and ongoing trends with regard to, for example, segmentation quality and tissue conductivity measurements. The presented processing steps result in personalized tES based on metrics like focality and field strength, which allow for correlation with clinical outcomes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Developmental Differences in Neuromagnetic Cortical Activation and Phase Synchrony Elicited by Scenes with Faces during Movie Watching</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The neural underpinnings of humans&rsquo; ability to process faces and how it changes over typical development have been extensively studied using paradigms where face stimuli are oversimplified, isolated, and decontextualized. The prevalence of this approach, however, has resulted in limited knowledge of face processing in ecologically valid situations, in which faces are accompanied by contextual information at multiple time scales. In the present study, we use a naturalistic movie paradigm to investigate how neuromagnetic activation and phase synchronization elicited by faces from movie scenes in humans differ between children and adults. We used MEG data from 22 adults (6 females, 3 left handed; mean age, 27.7 &plusmn; 5.28 years) and 20 children (7 females, 1 left handed; mean age, 9.5 &plusmn; 1.52 years) collected during movie viewing. We investigated neuromagnetic time-locked activation and phase synchronization elicited by movie scenes containing faces in contrast to other movie scenes. Statistical differences between groups were tested using a multivariate data-driven approach. Our results revealed lower face-elicited activation and theta/alpha phase synchrony between 120 and 330 ms in children compared with adults. Reduced connectivity in children was observed between the primary visual areas as well as their connections with higher-order frontal and parietal cortical areas. This is the first study to map neuromagnetic developmental changes in face processing in a time-locked manner using a naturalistic movie paradigm. It supports and extends the existing evidence of core face-processing network maturation accompanied by the development of an extended system of higher-order cortical areas engaged in face processing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Tonic excitation of nucleus reuniens decreases prefrontal‐hippocampal coordination during slow‐wave states</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The nucleus reuniens of the thalamus (RE) is an important node between the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the hippocampus (HPC). Previously, we have shown that its mode of activity and its influence in mPFC–HPC communication is dependent upon brain state. During slow-wave states, RE units are closely and rhythmically coupled to the ongoing mPFC-slow oscillation (SO), while during activated (theta) states, RE neurons fire in an arrhythmic and tonically active manner. Inactivating the RE selectively impoverishes coordination of the SO between mPFC and HPC and interestingly, both mPFC and RE stimulation during the SO cause larger responses in the HPC than during theta. It is unclear if the activity patterns within the RE across states may play a role in both phenomena. Here, we optogenetically excited RE neurons in a tonic fashion to assess the impact on mPFC-HPC coupling. This stimulation decreased the influence of mPFC stimulation in the HPC during SO states, in a manner similar to what is observed across state changes into theta. Importantly, this type of stimulation had no effect on evoked responses during theta. Perhaps more interestingly, tonic optogenetic excitation of the RE also decreased mPFC-HPC SO coherence. Thus, it may not be the integrity of the RE per se that is responsible for efficient communication between mPFC and HPC, but rather the particular state in which RE neurons find themselves. Our results have direct implications for how distant brain regions can communicate most effectively, an issue that is ultimately important for activity-dependent processes occurring during slow-wave sleep-dependent memory consolidation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Thank Martin Luther that ciprofloxacin could cure your gonorrhoea? Ecological association between Protestantism and antimicrobial consumption in 30 European countries [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Higher consumption of antimicrobials plays an important role in driving the higher prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in Southern compared to Northern Europe. Poor controls on corruption (CoC), high uncertainty avoidance (UA) and performance vs. cooperation orientation (POCO) of societies have been found to explain much of this higher consumption in Southern European countries.  We hypothesized that these predictors were in turn influenced by the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century onwards. Methods: We used structural equation modelling (SEM) to assess the relationships between country-level proportions being Protestant, CoC, UA, POCO and four markers of antimicrobial consumption in the community (all antibacterials, cephalosporin, macrolides and fluoroquinolones). Results: The proportion of a country that was Protestant was negatively correlated with the consumption of all antibacterials. SEM revealed that UA predicted all antibacterial consumption (direct effect coef. 0.15, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.04-0.26). The proportion Protestant exerted an indirect effect on consumption (coef. -0.13, 95% CI -0.21- -0.05). This effect was mediated predominantly via its effect on UA (direct effect coef. 0.15, 95% CI 0.04-0.26). The model explained 37% of the variation in consumption.  Similar results were obtained for each of the other three classes of antimicrobials investigated. Conclusions: Our results are compatible with the theory that contemporary differences in antimicrobial consumption in Europe stem in part from cultural differences that emerged in the Reformation. These findings may explain the differential efficacy of similar antibiotic stewardship campaigns in Northern and Southern European populations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Gene regulation by a protein translation factor at the single-cell level</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Roswitha Dolcemascolo, Lucas Goiriz, Roser Montagud-Martínez, Guillermo Rodrigo</p>

Gene expression is inherently stochastic and pervasively regulated. While substantial work combining theory and experiments has been carried out to study how noise propagates through transcriptional regulations, the stochastic behavior of genes regulated at the level of translation is poorly understood. Here, we engineered a synthetic genetic system in which a target gene is down-regulated by a protein translation factor, which in turn is regulated transcriptionally. By monitoring both the expression of the regulator and the regulated gene at the single-cell level, we quantified the stochasticity of the system. We found that with a protein translation factor a tight repression can be achieved in single cells, noise propagation from gene to gene is buffered, and the regulated gene is sensitive in a nonlinear way to global perturbations in translation. A suitable mathematical model was instrumental to predict the transfer functions of the system. We also showed that a Gamma distribution parameterized with mesoscopic parameters, such as the mean expression and coefficient of variation, provides a deep analytical explanation about the system, displaying enough versatility to capture the cell-to-cell variability in genes regulated both transcriptionally and translationally. Overall, these results contribute to enlarge our understanding on stochastic gene expression, at the same time they provide design principles for synthetic biology.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Spatial dynamics of feedback and feedforward regulation in cell lineages</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Peter Uhl, John Lowengrub, Natalia Komarova, Dominik Wodarz</p>

Feedback mechanisms within cell lineages are thought to be important for maintaining tissue homeostasis. Mathematical models that assume well-mixed cell populations, together with experimental data, have suggested that negative feedback from differentiated cells on the stem cell self-renewal probability can maintain a stable equilibrium and hence homeostasis. Cell lineage dynamics, however, are characterized by spatial structure, which can lead to different properties. Here, we investigate these dynamics using spatially explicit computational models, including cell division, differentiation, death, and migration / diffusion processes. According to these models, the negative feedback loop on stem cell self-renewal fails to maintain homeostasis, both under the assumption of strong spatial restrictions and fast migration / diffusion. Although homeostasis cannot be maintained, this feedback can regulate cell density and promote the formation of spatial structures in the model. Tissue homeostasis, however, can be achieved if spatially restricted negative feedback on self-renewal is combined with an experimentally documented spatial feedforward loop, in which stem cells regulate the fate of transit amplifying cells. This indicates that the dynamics of feedback regulation in tissue cell lineages are more complex than previously thought, and that combinations of spatially explicit control mechanisms are likely instrumental.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Integrin–ECM interactions and membrane-associated Catalase cooperate to promote resilience of the Drosophila intestinal epithelium</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mohamed Mlih, Jason Karpac</p>

Balancing cellular demise and survival constitutes a key feature of resilience mechanisms that underlie the control of epithelial tissue damage. These resilience mechanisms often limit the burden of adaptive cellular stress responses to internal or external threats. We recently identified Diedel, a secreted protein/cytokine, as a potent antagonist of apoptosis-induced regulated cell death in the <i>Drosophila</i> intestinal midgut epithelium during aging. Here, we show that Diedel is a ligand for RGD-binding Integrins and is thus required for maintaining midgut epithelial cell attachment to the extracellular matrix (ECM)-derived basement membrane. Exploiting this function of Diedel, we uncovered a resilience mechanism of epithelial tissues, mediated by Integrin–ECM interactions, which shapes cell death spreading through the regulation of cell detachment and thus cell survival. Moreover, we found that resilient epithelial cells, enriched for Diedel–Integrin–ECM interactions, are characterized by membrane association of Catalase, thus preserving extracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) balance to maintain epithelial integrity. Intracellular Catalase can relocalize to the extracellular membrane to limit cell death spreading and repair Integrin–ECM interactions induced by the amplification of extracellular ROS, which is a critical adaptive stress response. Membrane-associated Catalase, synergized with Integrin–ECM interactions, likely constitutes a resilience mechanism that helps balance cellular demise and survival within epithelial tissues.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The function and evolution of child-directed communication</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Johanna Schick, Caroline Fryns, Franziska Wegdell, Marion Laporte, Klaus Zuberbühler, Carel P. van Schaik, Simon W. Townsend, Sabine Stoll</p>

Humans communicate with small children in unusual and highly conspicuous ways (child-directed communication (CDC)), which enhance social bonding and facilitate language acquisition. CDC-like inputs are also reported for some vocally learning animals, suggesting similar functions in facilitating communicative competence. However, adult great apes, our closest living relatives, rarely signal to their infants, implicating communication surrounding the infant as the main input for infant great apes and early humans. Given cross-cultural variation in the amount and structure of CDC, we suggest that child-surrounding communication (CSC) provides essential compensatory input when CDC is less prevalent—a paramount topic for future studies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The human insula processes both modality-independent and pain-selective learning signals</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Björn Horing, Christian Büchel</p>

Prediction errors (PEs) are generated when there are differences between an expected and an actual event or sensory input. The insula is a key brain region involved in pain processing, and studies have shown that the insula encodes the magnitude of an unexpected outcome (unsigned PEs). In addition to signaling this general magnitude information, PEs can give specific information on the direction of this deviation—i.e., whether an event is better or worse than expected. It is unclear whether the unsigned PE responses in the insula are selective for pain or reflective of a more general processing of aversive events irrespective of modality. It is also unknown whether the insula can process signed PEs at all. Understanding these specific mechanisms has implications for understanding how pain is processed in the brain in both health and in chronic pain conditions. In this study, 47 participants learned associations between 2 conditioned stimuli (CS) with 4 unconditioned stimuli (US; painful heat or loud sound, of one low and one high intensity each) while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and skin conductance response (SCR) measurements. We demonstrate that activation in the anterior insula correlated with unsigned intensity PEs, irrespective of modality, indicating an unspecific aversive surprise signal. Conversely, signed intensity PE signals were modality specific, with signed PEs following pain but not sound located in the dorsal posterior insula, an area implicated in pain intensity processing. Previous studies have identified abnormal insula function and abnormal learning as potential causes of pain chronification. Our findings link these results and suggest that a misrepresentation of learning relevant PEs in the insular cortex may serve as an underlying factor in chronic pain.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Determinants of patient behavioural loyalty on primary health centres: Evidence from a cross-sectional study in Indonesia [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Patients’ loyalty to visit and use the services provided by the primary health centers (PHCs) is an important requirement of a patient referral system in many countries. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of internal service factors (service provider, service process, and service environment) on service quality and behavioural loyalty of patients in Indonesian PHCs. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 14 districts in Aceh Province, Indonesia between September and December 2020. Data were collected in 102 PHCs that were selected randomly from 137 PHCs that have an Inpatient Unit in the province. A proportional number of patients were recruited from each PHC and 389 patients were included. The demographic data, three components of internal service factors (service provider, service process, and service environment), the service quality and behavioural loyalty were assessed using a validated questionnaire. Hypothesis testing was conducted by using the structural equation model (SEM). Results: Our data suggested that two elements of internal service factors (service provider and service environment) had a positive and significant influence on service quality of the PHCs with p<0.001 and p=0.021, respectively. Service quality had a positive and significant influence of behavioural loyalty of patients to the PHCs (p=0.003). Service quality however did not serve as an intervening variable between internal service factors (service provider, service process, and service environment) and behavioural loyalty of patients, with p=0.091, p=0.230 and p=0.260, respectively.  Conclusions: Service provider and service environment are two main factors that influence the service quality and the service quality directly influence the behavioural loyalty on PHC users. Therefore, to increase the patients’ loyalty to use the PHC services, the quality of the services should be improved by levelling up the quality of providers and both physical and social environments in the PHCs.

                Cholinergic neurons of the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) are relevant for adaptive behavior. In a recent study, Ruan et al. revealed that PPN cholinergic neurons signal negative feedback during reward omission after contingency changes, which is necessary for switching to new behavioral strategies.

                Sun et al. unveil a novel recurrent circadian circuit involving DN1s, DN3s, and CLs. This circuit amplifies the sleep-promoting signal and induces mushroom-body activity changes to maintain deep sleep in Drosophila.

                Fujiwara et al. show that HS cells, self-motion sensitive neurons in Drosophila, are modulated at different timescales by walking strides. The modulation recruits HS cells to adjust heading only during fast walking. This study provides a mechanistic link between body state and brain activity for the flexible control of locomotion.

                Valuable stimuli attract our attention, but how this interacts with subsequent decisions remains unclear. Balewski et al. found a rapid, phasic signal in the caudate that guided eye movements and biased subsequent choices. This signal was independent of value representations in the orbitofrontal cortex that are involved in value-guided decision-making.

                BackgroundType 2 diabetes (T2D), characterized by hyperinsulinemia, protects motor neurons against amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Type 1 diabetes and a total lack of insulin are associated with increased risk of ALS. Connexin 43 (Cx43), an astrocyte protein, operates as an open pore via which toxic substances from the astrocytes reach the motor neurons.

MethodsIn the current study we performed molecular docking of insulin with monomeric Cx31, monomeric Cx43, and hexameric Cx31 to assess whether insulin might affect the pore. Hexameric Cx31 and hexameric Cx43 have hemichannels composed of 6 subunits that work as transmembrane channels, binding together to form gap junction intercellular channels that open and close. We used the program AutoDock Vina Extended for the molecular docking study.

ResultsCx31 shares amino acid and structural similarity to Cx43 and insulin docks to the same position of the N-terminal domain of monomeric Cx31 and monomeric Cx43. Insulin docks within the open hemichannel of hexameric Cx31, potentially blocking it. The block may be responsible for the protective relationship of T2D to ALS.

ConclusionInsulin might be a treatment for ALS, especially since insulin enhances glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in healthy humans. An insulin secretogogue such as oral sulfonylurea or glinide might also be of value.

                BackgroundHistology remains the gold standard to assess human brain biology, so ex vivo studies using tissue from brain banks are standard practice in neuroscientific research. However, a larger number of specimens could be obtained from gross anatomy laboratories. These specimens are fixed with solutions appropriate for dissections, but whether they also preserve brain tissue antigenicity is unclear. Therefore, we perfused mice brains with solutions used for human body preservation to assess and compare the tissue quality and antigenicity of the main cell populations.

Methods28 C57BL/6J mice were perfused with: 4% formaldehyde (FAS, N=9), salt-saturated solution (SSS, N=9), and alcohol-solution (AS, N=10). The brains were cut into 40m sections for antigenicity analysis and were assessed by immunohistochemistry of four antigens: neuronal nuclei (NeuN), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP-astrocytes), ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule1 (Iba1-microglia), and myelin proteolipid protein (PLP). We compared the fixatives according to multiple variables: perfusion quality, ease of manipulation, tissue quality, immunohistochemistry quality, and antigenicity preservation.

ResultsThe perfusion quality was better using FAS and worse using AS. The manipulation was very poor in SSS brains. FAS and AS fixed brains showed higher tissue and immunohistochemistry quality than the SSS brains. All antigens were readily observed in every specimen, regardless of the fixative solution.

ConclusionSolutions designed to preserve specimens for human gross anatomy dissections also preserve tissue antigenicity in different brain cells. This offers opportunities for the use of human brains fixed in gross anatomy laboratories to assess normal or pathological conditions.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTNeuroscientists currently obtain tissue samples from brain banks. Alternatively, a much larger amount of tissue may be obtained from bodies donated to gross anatomy laboratories. However, they are preserved with different fixative solutions that are used for dissection purposes. We ignore if these solutions also preserve antigenicity of the main cell populations, essential in neuroscientific research. This work is the first to show that two solutions currently used in human gross anatomy laboratories preserve sufficient histological quality, in addition to preserve antigenicity of the main cell populations of the mice brain. This work opens the door to the use of human brain tissue obtained from anatomy laboratories in neuroscientific research.

                The claustrum is highly interconnected with many structures in the brain, but the organizing principles governing its vast connectivity have yet to be fully explored. We investigated the defining characteristics and activity of single claustrum neurons, the nature of their relationship with the cortex, and their connectivity within the claustrum itself to gain a comprehensive view of claustral circuits. We show that the claustrum is composed of excitatory and inhibitory cell types that are connected through intraclaustral excitatory synapses, especially between neurons with disparate projection targets. Investigations of corticoclaustral innervation demonstrated that axons from the cortex localize to distinct dorsoventral modules depending on their region of origin. In vitro dual-color optogenetic mapping experiments revealed that individual claustrum neurons integrated inputs from more than one cortical region in a cell type- and projection target-specific manner. Integration in claustrum neurons was observed to be particularly common between areas of the frontal cortex and less so for sensory, motor, and association cortices. Finally, activity in claustrum axons in midline cortical areas recorded with in vivo two-photon calcium imaging showed responses to multimodal sensory stimuli. Our findings shed light on the organizing principles of claustrum circuits, demonstrating that individual claustrum neurons integrate cortical inputs and redistribute this information back to cortex after performing output target- and cell type-dependent local computations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Heart Rate Variability Covaries with Amygdala Functional Connectivity During Voluntary Emotion Regulation</a></h4>

              
                The Neurovisceral Integration Model posits that shared neural networks support the effective regulation of emotions and heart rate, with heart rate variability (HRV) serving as an objective, peripheral index of prefrontal inhibitory control. Prior neuroimaging studies have predominantly examined both HRV and associated neural functional connectivity at rest, as opposed to contexts that require active emotion regulation. The present study sought to extend upon previous resting-state functional connectivity findings, examining HRV and corresponding amygdala functional connectivity during a cognitive reappraisal task. Seventy adults (52 old and 18 young adults, 18-84 years, 51% male) received instructions to cognitively reappraise negative and neutral affective images during functional MRI scanning. HRV measures were derived from a finger pulse signal throughout the scan. During the task, young adults exhibited a significant inverse association between HRV and amygdala-medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) functional connectivity, in which higher HRV was correlated with weaker amygdala-mPFC coupling, whereas old adults displayed a slight positive, albeit non-significant correlation. Furthermore, voxelwise whole-brain functional connectivity analyses showed that higher HRV was linked to weaker right amygdala-posterior cingulate cortex connectivity across old and young adults, and in old adults, higher HRV positively correlated with stronger right amygdala - right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex connectivity. Collectively, these findings highlight the importance of assessing HRV and neural functional connectivity during active regulatory contexts to further identify neural concomitants of HRV and adaptive emotion regulation.

                Endogenous retroviruses, remnants of viral germline infections, make up a substantial proportion of the mammalian genome. While usually epigenetically silenced, retroelements can become upregulated in neurodegenerative diseases associated with protein aggregation, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and tauopathies. Here we demonstrate that spontaneous upregulation of endogenous retrovirus gene expression drastically affects the dissemination of protein aggregates between murine cells in culture. Viral glycoprotein Env mediates membrane association between donor and recipient cells and promotes the intercellular transfer of protein aggregates packaged into extracellular vesicles. Proteopathic seed spreading can be inhibited by neutralizing antibodies targeting Env as well as drugs inhibiting viral protein processing. Importantly, we show that also overexpression of a human endogenous retrovirus Env elevates intercellular spreading of pathological Tau. Our data highlight the potential influence of endogenous retroviral proteins on protein misfolding diseases and suggest that antiviral drugs could represent promising candidates for inhibiting protein aggregate spreading.

                postpartum depression (PPD) is a severe psychiatric disorder that affects up to 15% of mothers and impairs mother-infant bonding with devastating consequences on the child development and the mother health. Several studies indicate a possible dysregulation of glutamatergic and GABAergic signalling in the corticolimbic system, as well as a downregulation of the allopregnanolone levels in serum of PPD patients. Although brexanolone, an allopregnanolone-based treatment, has recently emerged as fundamental PPD treatment, there is scarce evidence on its neurobiological action mechanism. Moreover, ketamine appears to be a promising antidepressant treatment preventing PPD, nevertheless whether it might be a more effective than allopregnanolone for some patients remain unknown. Therefore, the present study is aimed to evaluate the depressive-like phenotype of postpartum females undergoing maternal separation with early weaning (MSEW) protocol, as well as to compare the effectiveness of ketamine and allopregnanolone treatments. MSEW dams show increased despair-like behaviour, anhedonia and disrupted maternal behaviour. Moreover, lower allopregnanolone serum levels, reduction of vesicular transporters for GABA (VGAT) and glutamate (VGLUT1) in the infralimbic cortex, as well as decreased hippocampal cellular proliferation are found in MSEW females. As for the antidepressant treatments, both drugs prevent despair-like behaviour, whereas only ketamine reverts anhedonia present in MSEW females. In addition, both treatments induce pro-neurogenic effects in the dorsal hippocampus but only allopregnanolone increases the VGAT and VGLUT1, without altering the excitatory/inhibitory ratio. Altogether, we propose a new mice model that recapitulates the core symptomatology and alterations in glutamatergic and GABAergic systems shown in PPD patients, which allows us to investigate the therapeutic mechanisms of allopregnanolone and ketamine.

                BackgroundPathologically increased beta power has been described as a biomarker for Parkinsons disease (PD) and related to prolonged bursts of subthalamic beta synchronization.

MethodsHere, we investigate the association between subthalamic beta dynamics and motor impairment in a cohort of 106 Parkinsons patients in the ON- and OFF-medication state, suing two different methods of beta burst determination.

ResultsWe report a frequency-specific correlation of low beta power and burst duration with motor impairment OFF dopaminergic medication. Furthermore, reduction of power and burst duration correlated significantly with symptom alleviation through dopaminergic medication. Importantly, qualitatively similar results were yielded with two different methods of beta burst definition.

ConclusionsOur findings validate the robustness of previous results on pathological changes in subcortical oscillations both in the frequency- as well as in the time-domain in the largest cohort of PD patients to date with important implications for next-generation adaptive deep brain stimulation control algorithms.

                Despite the importance of the cerebellum for motor learning, and the recognised role of sleep in motor memory consolidation, surprisingly little is known about activity in the sleeping cerebro-cerebellar system. Here we used wireless recording from M1 and the cerebellum in monkeys to examine the relationship between patterns of single-unit spiking activity observed during waking behaviour and in natural sleep. Across the population of recorded units, we observed similarities in the timing of firing relative to local field potential features associated with both movements during waking and up-states during sleep. We also observed a consistent pattern of asymmetry in pair-wise cross-correlograms, indicative of preserved sequential firing in both wake and sleep at low frequencies. Despite the overall similarity in population dynamics between wake and sleep, there was a global change in the timing of cerebellar activity relative to motor cortex, from contemporaneous in the awake state, to motor cortex preceding the cerebellum in sleep. We speculate that similar population dynamics in waking and sleep may imply that cerebellar internal models are activated in both states, but that their output is decoupled from motor cortex in sleep. Nevertheless, spindle frequency coherence between the cerebellum and motor cortex may provide a mechanism for cerebellar computations to influence sleep-dependent learning processes in the cortex.

Significance statementIt is well known that sleep can lead to improved motor performance. One possibility is that synaptic changes during sleep result from off-line repetitions of neuronal activity patterns in brain areas responsible for the control of movement. In this study we show for the first time that neuronal patterns in the cerebro-cerebellar system are conserved during both movements and sleep up-states, albeit with a shift in the relative timing between areas. Additionally, we show the presence of simultaneous M1-cerebellar spike coherence at spindle frequencies associated with up-state replay and postulate that this is a mechanism whereby a cerebellar internal models can shape plasticity in neocortical circuits during sleep.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Allocation of visuospatial attention indexes evidence accumulation for reach decisions</a></h4>

              
                Visuospatial attention is a prerequisite for the performance of visually guided movements: Perceptual discrimination is regularly enhanced at target locations prior to movement initiation. It is known that this attentional prioritization evolves over the time of movement preparation; however, it is not clear whether this build-up simply reflects a time requirement of attention formation or whether, instead, attention build-up reflects the emergence of the movement decision. To address this question, we combined behavioral experiments, psychophysics, and computational decision-making models to characterize the time course of attention build-up during motor preparation. Participants (n = 46, 29 female) executed center-out reaches to one of two potential target locations and reported the identity of a visual discrimination target that occurred concurrently at one of various time-points during movement preparation and execution. Visual discrimination increased simultaneously at the two potential target locations but was modulated by the experiment-wide probability that a given location would become the final goal. Attention increased further for the location that was then designated as the final goal location, with a time course closely related to movement initiation. A sequential sampling model of decision-making predicted key temporal characteristics of attentional allocation. Together, these findings provide evidence that visuospatial attentional prioritization during motor preparation does not simply reflect that a spatial location has been selected as movement goal, but rather indexes the time-extended, cumulative decision that leads to selection, hence constituting a link between perceptual and motor aspects of sensorimotor decisions.

Significance statementWhen humans perform a goal-directed movement such as a reach, attention shifts towards the goal location already before movement initiation, indicating that motor goal selection relies on the use of attention. Here, we demonstrate that key temporal aspects of visuospatial attention are predicted by a well-known computational model of decision-making. These findings suggest that visual attention signals much more than simply that a motor goal has been selected: instead, the time-course of emergent, visuospatial attention reflects the time-extended, cumulative decision that leads to goal selection, offering a window onto the tight link of perceptual and motor aspects in sensorimotor decision-making.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Obesity medication lorcaserin requires brainstem GLP-1 neurons to reduce food intake in mice</a></h4>

              
                Overweight and obesity are rapidly becoming the "new normal" in developed countries, which promotes a widespread negative impact on human health. Amongst recently developed obesity medications are the serotonin 2C receptor (5-HT2CR) agonist lorcaserin and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists, but the brain circuits employed by these medications to produce their therapeutic effects remain to be fully defined. 5-HT2CRs and GLP-1Rs are widely distributed in the brain, including in the key homeostatic region the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) where GLP-1 is produced by preproglucagon (PPGNTS) neurons. PPGNTS cells were profiled using histochemistry and single nucleus RNA sequencing (Nuc-Seq) of mouse brainstem. Transcriptomic analyses revealed 5-HT2CR expression was widespread in PPGNTS clusters. Demonstrating the functional significance of this co-expression, lorcaserin required PPGNTS to reduce food intake. Analysis of second order neurons revealed that local GLP1-R neurons within the NTS are necessary for 5-HT2CRNTS food intake suppression. In contrast, GLP-1RNTS were not required for GLP-1R agonist liraglutide and exendin-4s short term feeding reduction, suggesting scope for lorcaserin and GLP1-R agonist combination therapy. In support of this, lorcaserin+liraglutide and lorcaserin+exendin-4 produced greater reductions in food intake when administered in combination as compared to monotherapies. These data provide insight into the therapeutic mechanisms of lorcaserin and identify a combination strategy to improve the therapeutic profile of lorcaserin and GLP1-R agonists.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Probabilistic Tracking U-fiber on the Superficial White Matter Surface</a></h4>

              
                The short association fibers or U-fibers connect two neighboring gyri and travel in the superficial white matter (SWM) beneath the cortical layer. These U-fibers are essential for the understanding of neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration. However, the complex structures and the high curvature of the U-fibers lead to erroneous streamlines reconstruction of the traditional tractography since the volume-based tractography cannot use the biological characteristic of U-fibers that they tightly beneath the cortical layer. In this work, we proposed a surface-based framework for probabilistic tracking of the U-fibers on the triangular mesh of the SWM. We develop a novel approach to project the fiber orientation distributions (FODs) data onto the tangent space of the SWM surface. With the projected FODs, an advanced probabilistic tracking technique, which regularizes the streamlines based on the intrinsic geometry of the surface, is developed to reconstruct the highly bent U-fibers on the SWM surface. In the experiment, we demonstrate our method based on the high-resolution diffusion imaging data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). We quantitatively compare the proposed method with state-of-the-art volume-based tractography from MRTrix and another surface-based tractography on the U-fibers of the central sulcus. Moreover, we show the reconstructed U-fibers on the parietal lobe and frontal lobe. The results show that our method outperforms the other two methods and successfully reconstructs the U-fibers on the cortical regions with high intersubject variability.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Nav1.1 in mammalian sensory neurons is required for normal motor behaviors</a></h4>

              
                The mammalian voltage-gated sodium channel (NaV), NaV1.1, has been well-studied in the central nervous system; conversely, its contribution to peripheral sensory neuron function is more enigmatic. Here, we report a new role for peripherally expressed NaV1.1 in murine motor behaviors. RNAscope analysis found 100% of proprioceptors express NaV1.1 transcript, consistent with in vitro patch clamp recordings showing this channel is required for repetitive firing in proprioceptors. Notably, genetic deletion of NaV1.1 in all sensory neurons caused profound motor coordination deficits in homozygous conditional knockout animals of both sexes, a phenotype similar to conditional Piezo2-knockout animals. Movement deficits were also observed in heterozygotes, demonstrating that NaV1.1 haploinsufficiency in sensory neurons leads to motor deficiencies. This behavioral phenotype was not due to reduced proprioceptor numbers or abnormal muscle spindle formation; however, we observed decreased proprioceptor innervation of motor neurons in the spinal cord in conditional knockouts, indicating loss of NaV1.1 in sensory neurons alters spinal cord circuitry. Ex vivo muscle afferent recordings also support the notion that loss of NaV1.1 leads to aberrant proprioceptor function. Collectively, these data provide the first evidence that NaV1.1 in mammalian sensory neurons is essential for motor coordination. Importantly, human patients harboring NaV1.1 loss-of-function mutations often present with motor delays and ataxia. Thus, our data suggest sensory neuron dysfunction may contribute to the clinical manifestations and co-morbidities of neurological disorders in which NaV1.1 function is compromised.

	<p>In this study, we examined the early value of automated quantitative pupillary examination, using the Neurological Pupil index (NPi), to predict the long-term outcome of acute brain injured (ABI) patients. We performed a single-centre retrospective study (October 2016&amp;amp;ndash;March 2019) in ABI patients who underwent NPi measurement during the first 3 days following brain insult. We examined the performance of NPi&amp;amp;mdash;alone or in combination with other baseline demographic (age) and radiologic (CT midline shift) predictors&amp;amp;mdash;to prognosticate unfavourable 6-month outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale 1&amp;amp;ndash;3). A total of 145 severely brain-injured subjects (65 traumatic brain injury, TBI; 80 non-TBI) were studied. At each time point tested, NPi &amp;amp;lt;3 was highly predictive of unfavourable outcome, with highest specificity (100% (90&amp;amp;ndash;100)) at day 3 (sensitivity 24% (15&amp;amp;ndash;35), negative predictive value 36% (34&amp;amp;ndash;39)). The addition of NPi, from day 1 following ABI to age and cerebral CT scan, provided the best prognostic performance (AUROC curve 0.85 vs. 0.78 without NPi, p = 0.008; DeLong test) for 6-month neurological outcome prediction. NPi, assessed at the early post-injury phase, has a superior ability to predict unfavourable long-term neurological outcomes in severely brain-injured patients. The added prognostic value of NPi was most significant when complemented with baseline demographic and radiologic information.</p>

	<p>Research on multitasking driving has suggested age-related deterioration in driving performance. It has been shown that physical and cognitive functioning, which are related to driving performance and decline with aging, are positively associated with physical activity behavior. This study aimed to explore whether driving performance decline becomes severe with advancing age and whether physical activity behavior modifies age-related deterioration in driving performance. A total of one hundred forty-one healthy adults were categorized into three groups based on their age; old-old (74.21 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.33 years), young-old (66.53 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.50 years), and young adults (23.25 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.82 years). Participants completed a realistic multitasking driving task. Physical activity and cardiorespiratory fitness levels were evaluated. Older groups drove more slowly and laterally than young adults, and old-old adults drove slower than young-old ones across the whole driving course. Physical activity level did not interact with the aging effect on driving performance, whereas cardiovascular fitness interacted. Higher-fitness young-old and young adults drove faster than higher-fitness old-old adults. Higher-fitness old adults drove more laterally than higher-fitness young adults. The present study demonstrated a gradual decline in driving performance in old adults, and cardiorespiratory fitness interacted with the aging effect on driving performance. Future research on the interaction of aging and physical activity behavior on driving performance in different age groups is of great value and may help deepen our knowledge.</p>

	<p>Olfactory dysfunction is considered a pre-cognitive biomarker of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD). Because the olfactory system is highly conserved across species, mouse models corresponding to various AD etiologies have been bred and used in numerous studies on olfactory disorders. The olfactory behavior test is a method required for early olfactory dysfunction detection in AD model mice. Here, we review the olfactory evaluation of AD model mice, focusing on traditional olfactory detection methods, olfactory behavior involving the olfactory cortex, and the results of olfactory behavior in AD model mice, aiming to provide some inspiration for further development of olfactory detection methods in AD model mice.</p>

                As research becomes more interdisciplinary, fast-paced, data-intensive, and collaborative, there is an increasing need to share data and other research products in accordance with Open Science principles. In response to this need, we created an Open Science & Data Collaborations (OSDC) program at the Carnegie Mellon University Libraries that provides Open Science tools, training, collaboration opportunities, and community-building events to support Open Research and Open Science adoption. This program presents a unique end-to-end model for Open Science programs because it extends open science support beyond open repositories and open access publishing to the entire research lifecycle. We developed a logic model and a preliminary assessment metrics framework to evaluate the impact of the program activities based on existing data collected through event and workshop registrations and platform usage. The combination of these evaluation instruments has provided initial insight into our service productivity and impact. It will further help to answer more in-depth questions regarding the program impact, launch targeted surveys, and identify priority service areas and interesting Open Science projects.

                EMBL-EBI, Europe's biomolecular data hub, is a world leader in managing and analysing big data in biology and making it freely available to scientists worldwide. Researchers can access the open data resources and related services of EMBL-EBI by submitting minimal personal data. In May 2018, following the enforcement of the European Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), EMBL adopted the EMBL Internal Policy no. 68 on General Data Protection. It reflects European data protection principles while remaining within the bounds of EMBL's international legal status. As a result of GDPR and EMBL's Internal Policy No. 68 coming into force, 190 EMBL-EBI user-facing services that processed personal data in 2018 were required to have Records of Processing Activities (RoPA) and Privacy Notices (PN). EMBL-EBI's solution was to develop a Data Protection Engine (DPE) that automatically generates RoPA and PN when a service owner answers a series of questions. In addition to maintaining a centrally located database for RoPAs and PNs, the DPE tracks changes to the documents, as well as providing versioning and time-stamped updates. It is the aim of this article to share the EMBL-EBI IT department’s experience with designing and implementing the DPE and providing a toolkit to let others develop a similar solution and benefit from our experience. Implementation steps, benefits, challenges, opportunities, and practices are discussed and critically analysed.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Conflict and competition between model-based and model-free control</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yuqing Lei, Alec Solway</p>

A large literature has accumulated suggesting that human and animal decision making is driven by at least two systems, and that important functions of these systems can be captured by reinforcement learning algorithms. The “model-free” system caches and uses stimulus–value or stimulus–response associations, and the “model-based” system implements more flexible planning using a model of the world. However, it is not clear how the two systems interact during deliberation and how a single decision emerges from this process, especially when they disagree. Most previous work has assumed that while the systems operate in parallel, they do so independently, and they combine linearly to influence decisions. Using an integrated reinforcement learning/drift-diffusion model, we tested the hypothesis that the two systems interact in a non-linear fashion similar to other situations with cognitive conflict. We differentiated two forms of conflict: <i>action conflict</i>, a binary state representing whether the systems disagreed on the best action, and <i>value conflict</i>, a continuous measure of the extent to which the two systems disagreed on the difference in value between the available options. We found that decisions with greater value conflict were characterized by reduced model-based control and increased caution both with and without action conflict. Action conflict itself (the binary state) acted in the opposite direction, although its effects were less prominent. We also found that between-system conflict was highly correlated with within-system conflict, and although it is less clear a priori why the latter might influence the strength of each system above its standard linear contribution, we could not rule it out. Our work highlights the importance of non-linear conflict effects, and provides new constraints for more detailed process models of decision making. It also presents new avenues to explore with relation to disorders of compulsivity, where an imbalance between systems has been implicated.

Despite the rapid creation of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines, the precise correlates of immunity against severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) are still unknown. Neutralizing antibodies represent a robust surrogate of protection in early Phase III studies, but vaccines provide protection prior to the evolution of neutralization, vaccines provide protection against variants that evade neutralization, and vaccines continue to provide protection against disease severity in the setting of waning neutralizing titers. Thus, in this study, using an Ad26.CoV2.S dose-down approach in nonhuman primates (NHPs), the role of neutralization, Fc effector function, and T-cell immunity were collectively probed against infection as well as against viral control. While dosing-down minimally impacted neutralizing and binding antibody titers, Fc receptor binding and functional antibody levels were induced in a highly dose-dependent manner. Neutralizing antibody and Fc receptor binding titers, but minimally T cells, were linked to the prevention of transmission. Conversely, Fc receptor binding/function and T cells were linked to antiviral control, with a minimal role for neutralization. These data point to dichotomous roles of neutralization and T-cell function in protection against transmission and disease severity and a continuous role for Fc effector function as a correlate of immunity key to halting and controlling SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variants.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Do multiple experimenters improve the reproducibility of animal studies?</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Vanessa Tabea von Kortzfleisch, Oliver Ambrée, Natasha A. Karp, Neele Meyer, Janja Novak, Rupert Palme, Marianna Rosso, Chadi Touma, Hanno Würbel, Sylvia Kaiser, Norbert Sachser, S. Helene Richter</p>

The credibility of scientific research has been seriously questioned by the widely claimed “reproducibility crisis”. In light of this crisis, there is a growing awareness that the rigorous standardisation of experimental conditions may contribute to poor reproducibility of animal studies. Instead, systematic heterogenisation has been proposed as a tool to enhance reproducibility, but a real-life test across multiple independent laboratories is still pending. The aim of this study was therefore to test whether heterogenisation of experimental conditions by using multiple experimenters improves the reproducibility of research findings compared to standardised conditions with only one experimenter. To this end, we replicated the same animal experiment in 3 independent laboratories, each employing both a heterogenised and a standardised design. Whereas in the standardised design, all animals were tested by a single experimenter; in the heterogenised design, 3 different experimenters were involved in testing the animals. In contrast to our expectation, the inclusion of multiple experimenters in the heterogenised design did not improve the reproducibility of the results across the 3 laboratories. Interestingly, however, a variance component analysis indicated that the variation introduced by the different experimenters was not as high as the variation introduced by the laboratories, probably explaining why this heterogenisation strategy did not bring the anticipated success. Even more interestingly, for the majority of outcome measures, the remaining residual variation was identified as an important source of variance accounting for 41% (CI<sub>95</sub> [34%, 49%]) to 72% (CI<sub>95</sub> [58%, 88%]) of the observed total variance. Despite some uncertainty surrounding the estimated numbers, these findings argue for systematically including biological variation rather than eliminating it in animal studies and call for future research on effective improvement strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Environmental perceptions of global business travel by Swiss companies in the Zurich airport region [version 2; peer review: 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This article presents findings from research conducted before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on companies located in the Zurich airport region of Switzerland, regarding the needs for global business travel and its impacts. Methods: The study involved a mixed methods approach. Five hypotheses were tested using inferential statistics on data obtained from pre-tested closed questions in a web-based survey. Deeper context was explored through an interview-based case-study conducted at a Swiss pharma company. Results: Supporting alternative hypothesis 3 (Ha(3)), a significant positive relationship was found between travel frequency and business growth, F(1, 100) = 11.31, p = 0.0011. Supporting Ha(4), corporate culture had a significant positive relationship with business travel frequency (F(1, 100) = 15.50, p = 0.0002) and average trip length (F(1, 100) = 6.39, p = 0.01). And thirdly supporting Ha(5), corporate social responsibility had a significant relationship with global business travel (91%). Ho(2) and Ho(3) were accepted. The case study found that smart corporate travel policies and regulations should be instantiated to enhance our environment, which would also benefit employee wellbeing. Travel can be reduced significantly despite being demonstrated that physical co-presence is important for building trust. The case study suggests tools to support the monitoring and management of global business travel by organizations. Conclusions: COVID-19 has impacted travel for business significantly, and future research will be necessary to assess its impact. The article explores the ongoing research in this area, and several relevant implications are proposed for future leaders. The case study found willingness to pay both corporate and individual green taxes, and a deficiency in corporate communication around the environment. Business travel is needed to build trust; however, it can be reduced.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A qualitative study of sexual violence and attribution of responsibility in Georgian youth [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Sexual violence is a complex and pressing social issue that needs urgent solutions. Republic of Georgia is one of those countries where despite some advancements in law and practice, patriarchal beliefs and behaviour patterns still prevail in a daily life. So far, there has not been undertaken an in-depth study on how Georgians and particularly youth, define sexual violence and what are the justifications behind these views. The aim of the research is to understand how Georgian students understand sexual violence, who they think are responsible for sexual violence and what are the underlying reasons behind those views. Method: In total, 37 in-depth interviews have been conducted with Georgian students, from September of 2019 to March of 2021. The study participants were recruited from different universities, including the two biggest cities of Georgia - Tbilisi and Batumi.   Results: The research revealed that understanding of sexual violence is far more complex than it was expected. Georgian students define sexual violence as a broad category where sexual harassment and sexual coercion have overlapping and at the same time independent meaning. Interpretation and attribution of responsibility in all three categories are dependent on situations and context that contain not only physical violence but also inappropriate touch, insistent gaze, comments about body parts, sexist insults and discrimination, messages of sexual content, psychological pressure and blackmailing. Attribution of responsibility was equally dependent on personal judgements as well as culturally determined stereotypes. Conclusion: Sexual violence is not a new phenomenon in Georgia, but its consideration as a social problem is. The research demonstrated that understanding and judgment on sexual violence, sexual harassment and sexual coercion is nuanced issue and still needs clear categories of definitions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Crisis-management, Anti-stigma, and Mental Health Literacy Program for University Students (CAMPUS): A preliminary evaluation of suicide prevention [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: University students have specific risk factors for suicide, necessitating targeted prevention programs. This preliminary study evaluated the efficacy of the Crisis-management, Anti-stigma, Mental health literacy Program for University Students (CAMPUS) for reduction of risk factors and promotion of preventative behaviors. Methods: A total of 136 medical students attended the CAMPUS as a required course at the national university in Japan. The CAMPUS consisted of a lecture and two group sessions covering mental health literacy, self-stigma, and gatekeeper efficacy (e.g., identifying and helping at-risk individuals). The students were asked to role-play based on a movie about gatekeepers and scripts about self-stigma and suicide-related issues. Participants completed questionnaires on suicidal thoughts, depression, help-seeking intentions, self-efficacy as gatekeepers, self-concealment, and self-acceptance. A total of 121 students completed the questionnaires pre- and post-program, and 107 students also responded six months later. Results: Students demonstrated significantly reduced overall suicide thoughts six months post-program compared to before the program. In addition, gatekeeper self-efficacy, help-seeking intentions for formal resources, and self-acceptance were improved in the students six month after the program. Conclusions: The CAMPUS suggested effective at reducing suicidal people and promoting preventative psychological tendencies among medial students. This study was a one-group pre post design study without control group. The CAMPUS program was delivered as a mandatory requirement to a group with relatively low suicide risk. Further studies are required to assess its suitability for the general university student population.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Modelling sociodemographic factors that affect malaria prevalence in Sussundenga, Mozambique: a cross-sectional study. [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Malaria is still one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in Mozambique with little progress in malaria control over the past 20 years. Sussundenga is one of most affected areas. Malaria transmission has a strong association with environmental and sociodemographic factors. The knowledge of sociodemographic factors that affects malaria, may be used to improve the strategic planning for its control. Currently such studies have not been performed in Sussundenga. Thus, the objective of this study is to model the relationship between malaria and sociodemographic factors in Sussundenga, Mozambique. Methods: Houses in the study area were digitalized and enumerated using Google Earth Pro version 7.3. In this study 100 houses were randomly selected to conduct a community survey of Plasmodium falciparum parasite prevalence using rapid diagnostic test (RDT). During the survey, a questionnaire was conducted to assess the sociodemographic factors of the participants. Descriptive statistics were analyzed and backward stepwise logistic regression was performed establishing a relationship between positive cases and the factors. The analysis was carried out using SPSS version 20 package. Results: The overall P. falciparum prevalence was 31.6%. Half of the malaria positive cases occurred in age group 5 to 14 years. Previous malaria treatment, population density and age group were significant predictors for the model. The model explained 13.5% of the variance in malaria positive cases and sensitivity of the final model was 73.3%. Conclusion: In this area the highest burden of P. falciparum infection was among those aged 5–14 years old. Malaria infection was related to sociodemographic factors. Targeting malaria control at community level can combat the disease more effectively than waiting for cases at health centers. These finding can be used to guide more effective interventions in this region.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effects of exercise training on cardiotoxicity in cancer survivors. A systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background:  Cardiotoxicity is a major long-term complication of anti-cancer drugs such as anthracycline and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). These drugs also impact the quality of life, reduced functional capacity, and life expectancy. Exercise attenuates the cardiotoxic effects of anticancer treatments, as indicated by a growing body of evidence.   Methods:  Studies for this review were retrieved from databases PubMed, SCOPUS, EMBASE, COCHRANE, and Web of Science and were restricted only to clinical trials. Study results were screened and synchronized to Mendeley. Studies that met the eligibility criteria were extracted into the spreadsheet, summarizing information regarding the site and cancer stages, adjuvant therapy, various exercise interventions, and outcome measures. Risk of bias quality analysis was done in accordance with the National Heart Lung Blood Institute.  Results:    In this systematic review, 9021 articles were screened. After the exclusion criteria, seven articles were included for qualitative analysis. Outcome measures analyzed were measures of cardiotoxicity such as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), cardiac biomarkers, and global longitudinal strain.  Conclusion:  Although a structured exercise protocol including aerobic and resistance training has been found to improve, the functional capacity is an indirect measure of cardiotoxicity. There is a lack of data in terms of improvement seen in direct measurements of cardiotoxicity such as LVEF and cardiac biomarkers. A lack of evidence regarding the effects of exercise on the direct measurement of cardiotoxicity encourages the need for further research.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Acute Kidney Injury associated with "Triple whammy" combination: a protocol for a systematic review. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: “Triple whammy” (TW) refers to the simultaneous use of diuretics, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). To date, the risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI) associated to this combination has not been deeply investigated. The objectives are to analyze the incidence of AKI associated to the exposure to “triple whammy” including all NSAIDs versus non-exposure to this combination. Secondarily, the risk of hospitalization, severe adverse events, requirement of renal replacement therapy and mortality will be assessed. Also, the incidence of AKI associated to the exposure to “triple whammy” versus non-exposure will be analyzed, including only metamizole as NSAID.   Methods: A systematic literature search of intervention studies and analytical observational studies will be conducted in the Cochrane Library, Medline and EMBASE, among others. AKI 12 months after the last prescription of the triple combination will be the main outcome. Relative frequencies, risk of bias and certainty of evidence will be analyzed. Additionally, sensitivity and subgroup analyses will be performed.   Results: Once this systematic review has been completed, the results are expected to provide an estimate of the risk associated with this triple combination and the renal variables, in addition to new guidance on the renal treatment of patients potentially receiving triple therapy.  Conclusions: This is intended to be the first systematic review of observational studies to analyse TW combination and AKI's risk based on well-validated epidemiological databases exploring drug safety issues.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Association of leukocyte nadir with complete remission in Indonesian acute myeloid leukemia patients undergoing 7+3 remission induction chemotherapy [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The 7+3 regimen is still the main choice of remission induction chemotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Successfully achieving complete remission (CR) and the time required to achieve it determine patient’s survival. Hence, bone marrow examination on 14th day of chemotherapy is recommended to predict CR. However, the examination is invasive and still inaccurate. Methods: A prognostic study with retrospective cohort design was conducted at two central hospitals in Indonesia based on medical record data of AML patients who underwent 7+3 induction chemotherapy from January 1st, 2015, to December 31st, 2019. The association of nadir leukocyte level and the time required to achieve it with CR occurrence was assessed. Results: One hundred and one subjects were recruited with median age 39 years and 55% men. A total of 55.4% subjects achieved CR. Nadir leukocyte level below 200/mcl was the most optimal cut-off point and independently associated with CR (OR 2.45; 95% CI 1.01–5.94) while time required to achieve it was not. Conclusions: The nadir leukocyte level is associated with an increase probability of CR but not for the time required to achieve it in AML patients undergoing 7+3 induction chemotherapy.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Assessment of the knowledge, attitudes and practices of Lebanese shoppers towards food labeling: The first steps in the Nutri-score roadmap [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Food labeling is a fundamental educational tool for advocating for public awareness. It emphasizes knowledge of the nutrient content of food and thus directs the choice towards the healthiest food products. This cross-sectional survey aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding nutrition label use in Lebanon through a valid questionnaire. Methods: Overall, 768 participants (mean age: 30.8 ±12, males: 60.2%) were recruited randomly between February and May 2020. We used word of mouth and social media to recruit our sample population. Results: Social media was the most accessed tool to attain nutrition information by responders (39.8%). More than half the participants expressed positive attitudes to check information related to sugars (66.4%), vitamins (64.9%), total fats (61.7%), proteins (59.1%), and calories (58.7%) on the food label. Expiry date, price, and brand name were the top three considerations while reading food labels. About half (46.5%) reported to “always” look at the food label. Responders reported reading labels related primarily to sugars (44.3%), calories (38.8%), and total fats (36.8%). The optimal total KAP score was 46; our findings revealed a mean KAP score of 14.46 ±7 (31.4%). When categorizing the KAP scores, 15% had high scores, and 85% scored low. Spearman’s coefficients showed positive correlations between knowledge-attitude, knowledge-practice, and attitude-practice scores, with p<0.001. The regression analysis revealed that gender, age, BMI, residency area, educational level, university degree, health and diet statuses, and activity level were significant predictors of the KAP score. Being on a diet had the highest odds (OR=3.107, CI=1.904-5.072, p<0.001). Conclusion: The low awareness of food labels leads Lebanese people to choose unhealthy food options. A planned educational program is recommended to ease the interpretation of these labels.

     alt="Brain size and behavioral specialization in the jataí stingless bee (Tetragonisca angustula)"/>
<p>In the jataí stingless bee (<i>Tetragonisca angustula</i>), body size plays an important role in the division of labor among workers. Larger workers (soldiers) take over defensive roles while smaller workers (foragers) engage in foraging activities. Nest defense performed by soldiers includes two different tasks: (1) hovering around the nest entrance for the detection and interception of heterospecific bees (a task relying mostly on vision) and (2) standing at the nest entrance tube for inspection of returning foragers and discrimination against conspecific non-nestmates based on olfactory cues. In our study, the most important finding is that between soldiers, hoverers had larger brain compartments related to visual processing (the optic lobes) and learning (the mushroom bodies). Brain size differences we report thus correspond to behavioral specialization in defense and illustrate a functional neuroplasticity underpinning division of labor.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Social insects are instructive models for understanding the association between investment in brain size and behavioral variability because they show a relatively simple nervous system associated with a large set of complex behaviors. In the jataí stingless bee (<i>Tetragonisca angustula</i>), division of labor relies both on age and body size differences among workers. When young, both minors and soldiers engage in intranidal tasks and move to extranidal tasks as they age. Minors switch to foraging activities, while soldiers take over defensive roles. Nest defense performed by soldiers includes two different tasks: (1) <i>hovering</i> around the nest entrance for the detection and interception of heterospecific bees (a task relying mostly on vision) and (2) <i>standing</i> at the nest entrance tube for inspection of returning foragers and discrimination against conspecific non-nestmates based on olfactory cues. Here, using different-sized individuals (minors and soldiers) as well as same-sized individuals (hovering and standing soldiers) performing distinct tasks, we investigated the effects of both morphological and behavioral variability on brain size. We found a negative allometric growth between brain size and body size across jataí workers, meaning that minors had relatively larger brains than soldiers. Between soldier types, we found that hovering soldiers had larger brain compartments related to visual processing (the optic lobes) and learning (the mushroom bodies). Brain size differences between jataí soldiers thus correspond to behavioral specialization in defense (i.e., vision for hovering soldiers) and illustrate a functional neuroplasticity underpinning division of labor.</p>
