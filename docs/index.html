[version 2; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background One billion people worldwide have preventable vision impairment. Ocular morbidities are a significant problem in the public health sector, especially among medical students. The study objectives were to identify the prevailing ocular morbidities and evaluate the risk factors and their impact on students’ lifestyles and academics. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among (Study sample 312) undergraduate medical students over 6 months. Data were collected through a structured questionnaire and analysed to identify the prevalence, associated risk factors, and consequences of ocular morbidities. Results 64.7% were suffering from ocular morbidities. Headache was a predominant symptom in students with (51.7%) and without (39.1%) ocular morbidities. The most common ocular morbidity was myopia (84.3%). 18.7% of students perceived that ocular morbidity had restricted them from participating in activities or applying for specific job posts. The evaluation of various risk factors inferred that ocular morbidity was associated with family history, early age onset of the condition, lighting, inappropriate posture while reading, screen time, and a vitamin A-rich diet. Conclusion The study concluded that the most prevalent ocular morbidity was refractive error, with myopia being the highest among medical students, and it has adversely impacted the students’ lifestyle and academics, underscoring the need for early detection, preventive strategies, and health education interventions.

                Background This article explored the chemical constituents of water and ethanol extracts from the whole body of A. m. jemenitica honeybee drones and workers, investigating their effects on glucose tolerance test (GTT) curves through feeding experiments conducted on Oryctolagus cuniculus male rabbits. Methods Chemical analysis of the extracts was performed using infrared (IR) spectroscopy alongside the spectral database of organic compounds. Results The water extract revealed a richer diversity of natural products (38 compounds) compared to the ethanol extract (12 compounds). Notably, the water extract comprised various bioactive molecules, including sugars and their derivatives, phenolic compounds, alkaloids, quinones, amino acid derivatives, dipeptides, and organometallic compounds. In contrast, the ethanol extract primarily contained sugar derivatives, phenolic compounds, alkaloids, and pesticides. The water extract decreased the blood glucose level and transformed the GTT curve from a convex to a concave shape. Conclusion The blood glucose-lowering effect of the water extract may be attributed to the anti-diabetic properties of its dipeptides, phenolic compounds and alkaloid contents.

                This paper introduces two theorems in number theory about zeta at − 4 and the fifth Bernoulli number B 5 , showing that the zeta function ζ ( − 4 ) has two complex values and that the fifth Bernoulli number is not zero but alsohas two complex values. The current research concludes that the zeta function ζ ( − 4 ) has two imaginary values that are different from what was previously known to mathematicians, which was believed to be equal to zero, whereas, ζ ( − 4 ) = - i 558 , ζ ( − 4 ) = - i 2232 Therefore, the fifth Bernoulli number is not equal to zero and has two values: B 5 = − 5 i 558 and B 5 = − 5 i 2232 .

                The development of smart cities through the ASEAN Smart Cities Network (ASCN) has accelerated the growth of Southeast Asia’s capital and important cities. However, a growing concern has been how much the intentions of Southeast Asian cities to achieve ‘smart city status’ consider the basic elements of human rights and the provision of essential public services. The first policy recommendation is to acknowledge the vulnerability of the underprivileged, personal security, and social inclusion in governing smart cities to counter the possible derailment of democratic progress in the region. The second recommendation is to have fellow ASEAN member states assist in providing essential public services to avoid a ‘development’ model imposed by external funding stakeholders. The policy brief uses secondary data from 2018 to 2024 on the ASEAN Smart Cities Network projects and identifies civic and social concerns that arose during this period.

                Background Deleterious rhizobacteria (DRB) constitute an emerging category of bioherbicides with the capacity to inhibit weed germination through phytotoxic metabolites. Aim This study aimed to isolate and screen rhizobacteria for deleterious potentials. Bacterial isolation was carried out using the standard pour plating method. Methods Five agricultural crops (cucumber, soybean, sorghum, cowpea and maize) were assayed for phytotoxic screening against the DRB. In addition, antimicrobial potential of the DRB against test pathogens and indole acetic acid (IAA) were also investigated. Polymerase chain reaction and gene sequencing of the isolates revealed three strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and one each of P. fluorescens and E. hormaechei. Results The antimicrobial outcomes of the test DRB revealed broad-spectrum inhibition against the test pathogens. In terms of culture age, younger cultures (≤48 h) mostly stimulated or matched control germination and vigor indices with toxicity increasing progressively with age beyond 120 h for most of the seeds. In the case of steeping duration, short steeping durations (1–2 h) typically maintained germination and vigor near control levels. Progressive extension of steeping time increased inhibition across all isolates. At different inoculum concentrations, higher inoculum concentrations produced stronger inhibitory effects than diluted suspensions. Full-strength inoculum (100%) suppressed vigor drastically, whereas 20–40% dilutions produced diminished or reversible effects. Also, all isolates produced measurable IAA in tryptophan-supplemented media with output increasing with incubation age, correlating with suppression of vigor at later time points. Conclusion The indigenous origin of the DRB evaluated in this study enhances environmental compatibility and reduces ecological disturbance risks.

                Background Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E), Alcian Blue/Periodic Acid-Schiff (AB/PAS), and Giemsa stains are routinely used in the histopathological evaluation of gastric biopsies. However, comparative data on their diagnostic performance and cost-effectiveness in detecting Helicobacter pylori are limited. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of using H&E and AB/PAS as alternatives to Giemsa. Methods A retrospective study was conducted on 816 gastric biopsy cases collected between 2019 and 2021. Three slides (H&E, Giemsa, and AB/PAS) were previously prepared from each paraffin-embedded tissue sample and blindly evaluated by three independent examiners. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and overall diagnostic accuracy were calculated using 2×2 contingency tables. Results >H&E yielded a sensitivity of 51.6%, specificity of 74.4%, and diagnostic accuracy of 66.4% when compared to Giemsa as the reference standard. In comparison, AB/PAS exhibited a sensitivity of 45.9%, specificity of 73.2%, and an accuracy of 63.7%. When evaluating operational factors, H&E emerged as the most cost-effective and fastest method, while AB/PAS was associated with higher costs and longer processing times. Overall, Giemsa consistently demonstrated superior diagnostic performance across the assessed metrics, positioning it as the more reliable choice for H. pylori detection within this comparative framework. Conclusions H&E shows potential for initial screening but its limited sensitivity prevents definitive diagnosis. AB/PAS proved less effective and economical. Giemsa maintained superior diagnostic performance. This study provides a comparative methodological assessment, suggesting H&E and Giemsa combinations could enhance detection efficiency and accuracy. Further prospective validation is needed before clinical implementation.

                Background Areke is a popular traditional distilled beverage in semi-urban and rural areas in Ethiopia. Traditional areke distillation uses an open-fire system that consumes a lot of firewood and produces a large amount of indoor air pollution. Methods The areke distiller apparatus (heat exchanger, condenser, energy-efficient stoves, storage tanks, and local areke extraction apparatus) was manufactured by technicians (welders). Different types of grains (wheat, millet, lupine, barley, and maize) were purchased from a neighborhood market. The traditional method of areke fermentation was prepared by an experienced woman brewer using a combination of ingredients and appropriate steps and procedures. The efficacy of a traditional stove, modified stove, and a combination of modified stove and double-pipe were evaluated. The amount of ethanol was estimated by measuring its refractive index and specific gravity. The sensory evaluation of areke samples was conducted by 10 consumer sensory panelists. Result The highest ethanol concentration in areke (53.75 ± 0.01 (% v/v)) was obtained from millet E (dagusa E) in double-pipe distillation (E). The maize E (bekolo E) of overall acceptance had the greatest score (4.5 ± 0.01) compared to other areke sensory parameters. The alcoholic strength of lupine E ( gibeto E) was scored as excellent (5.0 ± 0.01) compared to other areke sensory parameters. All judges agreed that traditional and double-pipe areke consumption was acceptable. The combination of double-pipe distillation and modified stove resulted in a 50% ± 0.15 reduction in the average amount of firewood used. The traditional open fire stove consumed more firewood (5.1 kg ± 0.1) than the combination of double-pipe distillation and modified stove (2.5 kg ± 0.01). Conclusion These results indicate that the combination of double-pipe distillation with a modified stove had better performance than traditional areke distillation.

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/13/1/ENEURO.0112-25.2025?rss=1">Different But Complementary Motor Functions Reveal an Asymmetric Recalibration of Upper Limb Bimanual Coordination</a></h4>

              
                <p>Bimanual coordination, fundamental to human motor control, typically involves the execution of different functions by the two limbs (e.g., opening a jar). Previous research has largely investigated bimanual control through simple coordination tasks in which the limbs perform similar movements (e.g., finger tapping); however, few studies have specifically examined coordination when the two limbs perform different yet complementary functions. In the current study, participants performed point-to-point movements of a rectangular cursor, where one limb controlled cursor trajectory and the other rotated a knob to match a target orientation. Participants (<I>N</I> = 116, 76 female, 1 nonbinary; 92% right-handed) were divided into four groups and completed the task with a visual feedback gain perturbation (an increase or decrease) applied either to the cursor trajectory or orientation. Our results showed rapid adaptation to perturbations of visual feedback of the movement trajectory, affecting both the perturbed limb controlling the trajectory and the unperturbed limb controlling the orientation. Conversely, perturbation to the visual orientation feedback primarily only influenced the perturbed limb controlling orientation, with minimal impact on movement trajectory metrics. Importantly, these results were independent of reaching amplitude, duration, and limb dominance. In addition, we assessed the temporal coordination between the two limbs and found that perturbations in visual trajectory feedback led to significant changes in limb coordination, whereas no notable difference was observed for perturbations of orientation. These findings indicate asymmetries in bimanual motor recalibration dependent on the perturbed aspect of visual feedback (orientation vs trajectory), suggesting differences in underlying neural mechanisms and interhemispheric communication.</p>

                <p>Alpha peak frequency (APF) is defined as a prominent spectral peak within the 8&ndash;12&nbsp;Hz frequency range. Typically, an individual's alpha frequency is regarded as a stable neurophysiological marker. A wealth of recent evidence, however, indicates that APF shifts within short timescales in relation to task demands and even spontaneously so. Further, brain stimulation studies often report shifts in APF both within and between experimental sessions, directly contradicting the idea of a stable APF. To characterize the nonstationarities in spectral parameters, we estimated APFs from 1&nbsp;s epochs of resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings from healthy adults of either sex. To enhance signal-to-noise ratio, without compromising on temporal resolution, we averaged power spectra within parcelled regions. Our findings indicate that variation in APFs exacerbates along the posterior-to-anterior cortical plane, i.e., from the occipital to the frontal cortices. Further, by comparisons with amplitude-matched simulated signals, we demonstrated that the observed gradient is not attributable to measurement noise. Across the cortex, APFs showed poor temporal reliability, raising the question of whether APFs are more like a transient state than a trait. In general, our study elucidates the dynamic characteristics of alpha oscillations and reveals systematic regional differences which are, in part, shaped by underlying signal-to-noise ratio inherent to MEG recordings.</p>

                Background Academic integrity is presented as a complex, multidimensional concept that involves all members of an educational institution. However, non-teaching staff members are often excluded from research on academic integrity. I engaged in professional support alongside academic staff to explore how academic integrity is understood within the Mauritius branch of a UK higher education institution. Methods I adopted a qualitative approach to engage those tasked with implementing academic integrity to examine how they understood and practised it. Data were gathered through face-to-face focus-group interviews, which were translated into themes. Results This article identified the factors that make academic integrity challenging and presents recommendations for practitioners and researchers. Conclusions More energy should be invested in the processes that build cultures of integrity rather than focusing on the opposite, such as cheating, plagiarism, and misconduct. Academic integrity is ultimately a positive values-driven approach to learning and a skill that can be developed and strengthened.

                Background The study of algebraic structures through graph-theoretic representations provides a powerful visual and combinatorial framework for analyzing ring-theoretic properties. The ideal-based non-zero divisor graph ∅ I ( Z n ) , constructed from the ring of integers modulo n with respect to a proper ideal I . This graph extends the classical zero-divisor graph framework and serves as a visual and structural invariant for analyzing ideal interactions in finite commutative rings. Methods Using combinatorial graph theory and modular arithmetic, we analyze fundamental properties of ∅ I ( Z n ) . Vertex degrees, connectivity, and cut-sets are characterized using divisibility conditions and the Euler totient function ϕ ( n ) . The analysis distinguishes cases based on the parity and primality of n , as well as the generator of I . Topological indices, including the Zagreb and Randić indices, are formulated to quantify structural complexity. Results We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the connectivity of ∅ I ( Z n ) , proving it is connected for all n ≥ 10 and any non-zero proper ideal I . For prime n ∉ { 2 , 3 } , the graph is shown to be complete. General formulas are provided for calculating vertex degrees based on gcd ( x , d ) where I = < d > . Furthermore, the structure and computation cut-sets are characterized for Z p 2 and composite n = xy . Moreover, the domination number γ ( ∅ I ( Z n ) )=1 and girth gr ( ∅ I ( Z n ) )=3 is established for n ≥ 10 . General expressions for Zagreb and Randić indices are derived, directly linking graph invariants to n and d . Conclusions The graph ∅ I ( Z n ) serves as an effective combinatorial invariant for studying the interplay between ideals and zero-divisor structure in Z n . These results establish systematic connections between ring-theoretic properties and graph parameters, enabling both qualitative and quantitative analysis through connectivity, degree distributions, cut-sets, and topological indices.

                Recognizing and appreciating the diversity of people around the world is a necessary step in achieving equality for all. The opening of equitable chances for society as a whole is one of the ways in which libraries contribute to the reduction of the exclusion gap. Despite their expanding relevance, institutions like libraries demonstrate inconsistent patterns of integration and research. This literature analysis aimed to examine the methods employed by public libraries to foster social inclusion across various populations from 2014 to 2024. A comprehensive literature review was performed, identifying n = 69 interventions that fulfilled the inclusion criteria according to PRISMA methodological principles. The findings indicate a necessity for collaboration between libraries and other organizations to enhance their effectiveness in promoting social inclusion. The findings underscore the necessity of adopting a comprehensive perspective on inclusion in libraries, which encompasses an examination of infrastructure and participation in physical spaces, as well as additional aspects and dimensions, integrating both physical and digital inclusion.

                Background Female teachers working in conflict and displacement settings are both crisis survivors and crisis responders, nurturing learning, stability, and hope and experiencing trauma, economic insecurity and systemic neglect. Their lived experiences and coping systems remain under-documented and undervalued. This review is a synthesis of multi-regional findings to shed light on the interaction of gender, precarity, and resilience on the development of professional and psychosocial pathways of women teachers during and after conflict. Methods This narrative systematic review was done using PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Thirty-four primary studies and several secondary sources in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and North Africa, and Eastern Europe were reviewed. Results Female teachers were subjected to the greatest instability and trauma, with post-traumatic stress (22-35%), burnout (40-70%), and acute psychological distress (over 70% under active crises) being the most prominent. The chronic attrition and “brain waste” were caused by structural deprivation in the form of salary arrears, invalidation of credential, and exclusion to continuous professional development (CPD). Relational and spiritual resilience were found to be strong buffers despite these limitations. Burnout was reduced by peer networks, faith-based coping and community support and agency was restored. Online and physical CPD programs in Kakuma, Lebanon and Ukraine assisted displaced women to maintain teaching identity and re-credential after displacement. Teacher Stability Index (TSI) showed that there was universal low interdependence resilience (0.50). Conclusion Women educators in conflict and displacement situations represent paradox: they perpetuate the educational process and survive the trauma and structural marginalization. It would take systematic reform to identify them as professionals in humanitarian work, rather than as a fringe volunteer. Some of the priority interventions are listed as the stabilization of salaries, transnational credential recognition, survivor-focused protection against GBV, and the scaling of culturally grounded and peer-based resilience networks.

                Background Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in premenopausal women is frequent, yet distinguishing benign from malignant causes remains clinically challenging. Endometrial thickness (ET) measured by transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) is well established in postmenopausal bleeding but less validated in premenopausal women due to cyclical variations. This study aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy and prognostic value of ET, supplemented by Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, in predicting endometrial malignancy among premenopausal women with AUB. Methods We conducted a retrospective analytical study including premenopausal women presenting with AUB at Charles Nicolle Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia (2016–2024). All underwent TVUS followed by endometrial sampling (hysteroscopy or curettage) and definitive histological confirmation on hysterectomy specimens. Sonographic features were described using International Endometrial Tumor Analysis (IETA) criteria. Diagnostic performance of ET was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Kaplan-Meir survival analysis was applied to time-to-consultation and time-to-diagnosis, not survival outcomes. Results ROC analysis identified ET as the strongest predictor of endometrial malignancy (AUC = 0.842, p < 0.001). An optimal cutoff of >9 mm achieved 69.2% sensitivity, 87.1% specificity, and a negative predictive value of 97.7%, effectively ruling out malignancy in patients with ET ≤9 mm. Although the positive predictive value was modest (26.5%), ET reliably stratified risk for further invasive evaluation. Kaplan–Meier analysis demonstrated that ET >9 mm was associated with earlier consultation (mean 27.7 vs. 70.3 months, p < 0.0001) and shorter time-to-diagnosis (median 12 months vs. not reached, p < 0.0001), reflecting a more aggressive clinical course. Conclusions ET >9 mm is a robust, non-invasive potential prognostic marker in premenopausal AUB, identifying high-risk women requiring urgent evaluation while safely excluding malignancy in low-risk patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-1192/v5?src=rss">Conceptualizing a model to study university students’ food choices based on the theory of planned behavior [version 5; peer review: 5 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Higher education at the university level is essential for advanced learning, enhancing academic knowledge, and precipitating significant life changes. These include lifestyle adjustments, relocation from one’s primary residence, and the acquisition of autonomy in decision-making. Numerous students opt to reside in dormitories/hostels, resulting in notable alterations in dietary habits. Food habits at campus differ substantially from their previous domestic diets, potentially influencing their overall growth and development during their academic tenure. Method The study employs the theory of planned behavior to conceptualize a model and understand university students’ food choices, utilizing qualitative research and a phenomenological approach. Snowball sampling selected 26 undergraduate and postgraduate students from technical and health science programs at a private university in Udupi, who were residing on campus for two to four years. Online interviews were audio-recorded with participants’ consent. Results Transcribed interviews were coded and categorized to identify themes, which were subsequently conceptualized to develop a model based on the theory of planned behavior. The model illustrated the duration of students’ campus residence, provided insight into their perspectives on food events and consumption at the university dining facility (UDF), influenced by factors such as palatal preferences, cost considerations, temporal constraints (during academic activities), accessibility of nutritious options, academic-related stress, and insufficient nutritional knowledge. Two primary findings emerged: first, recommendation to display nutritional information in the dining facility; second, students exhibited a preference for consuming less healthy food options off-campus due to their lower monetary cost. Conclusion The investigation offers valuable insights into the role of UDF in providing nutritionally balanced meals to students, which may contribute to improved health outcomes and enhanced academic performance. This research elucidates the relationship between students’ dietary choices and their subsequent impact on scholastic achievement.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Morphological features within the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) granule cell layer (GCL) have been identified in some cases of sudden unexpected infant death (SUDI), including sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Reelin, an extracellular matrix protein, is critical in neuronal migration and cell positioning. An altered reelin expression is hypothesized as a contributor to altered DG morphology. This study aimed to determine whether the number of reelin-expressing cells within the infant hippocampus is altered in (1) SIDS, and according to the presence of (2) SIDS risk factors (age, cigarette smoke exposure [CSE], sleep position, bed sharing, and upper respiratory tract infection [URTI]), and (3) DG morphology. Immunohistochemical staining of reelin was quantified (measured as the number of positive reelin cells/mm<sup>2</sup>) within the layers of the DG, CA4/Hilus, CA3-CA1, and subiculum in cases of explained SUDI (eSUDI, <i>n</i> = 12), SIDS I (<i>n</i> = 7), and SIDS II (<i>n</i> = 33). Reelin was highly correlated with age. After adjusting for age, SIDS II infants had a lower number of reelin immunopositive cells in the CA1, a finding that was more pronounced in bed sharers. Analysis of risk factors indicated lower reelin in the DG and CA3 of males, and in the DG of infants with URTI (when excluding bed sharers). The presence of the DG morphological feature of cluster ectopic cells was associated with a lower number of reelin cells across several hippocampal layers, whereas gaps were associated with higher numbers, with layers predominantly affected being the DG molecular layer and CA2 stratum radiatum.</p>

                Background The present study is an endeavor to explore the global focus on maternal malnutrition research across the globe. The study underscores the development of maternal malnutrition research across the globe and may give impetus to researchers, policy makers and entrepreneurs for further research in this domain. Methods The study is descriptive in nature and used a mixed method approach that includes bibliometrics and altmetrics techniques to explore maternal malnutrition research. The study initiated with systematic data extraction from SCOPUS Database with proper data extraction criteria. The bibliometrics techniques include quantitative and qualitative techniques. The initial part of the study explores the quantitative dimension, including authorship studies, growth rate of publications, country-wise productivity and citation impact across the studied period. The second part of the study is dedicated to trend analysis that reveals the focused areas in malnutrition research. The third part of this study delves into the social impact of the concerned set of literature by analyzing the social media attention score through Altmetrics. Results It is found that there is a relatively low rate of growth of publications, with publications published in 2016 being more impactful and a preference for multi-authored publications over single-authored publications. Regional distribution highlights disparities in the research focus. Thematic analysis identified key clusters, such as acute malnutrition and maternal-child health interdependencies, with emerging areas in public health nutrition and epigenetics. Altmetric analysis has shown an active but declining trend in discourse on academic and social media platforms. Conclusions Results underscore the need for holistic interventions addressing both nutritional and psychosocial factors during pregnancy to break the intergenerational cycle of poor health and promote better outcomes for mothers and their children.

Black pepper (Piper nigrum L.) fruit extract has been reported to possess antidiabetic and reproductive benefits, yet its effect on DM-related ED remains underexplored. Objective To evaluate the effects of Piper nigrum fruit extract on erectile function, libido, sperm parameters, and testicular histology in alloxan-induced diabetic male rats. Methods Thirty male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into five groups: normal control, diabetic control, diabetic rats treated with black pepper extract (122.5 or 245 mg/kg BW), and diabetic rats treated with sildenafil citrate. Erectile function was assessed via penile reflexes, libido by mating behavior, sperm quality by concentration, motility, and morphology, and testicular histology by Leydig cell and spermatogonia counts. Data were analyzed using ANOVA with significance at p<0.05. Results Alloxan-induced diabetic rats showed significant impairment in erectile function, libido, sperm quality, and testicular histology (p<0.001 vs control). Black pepper extract at 122.5 mg/kg BW significantly improved total penile reflexes compared with diabetic controls (9.33±1.03 vs 6.00±1.26, p=0.02). Libido parameters including courtship latency (5.50±0.55 vs 21.00±9.47, p=0.013), mount latency (19.00±10.81 vs 37.17±6.31, p=0.009), and mount frequency (18.05±5.99 vs 7.17±1.83, p=0.002) were significantly improved. Sperm analysis revealed increases in sperm concentration (19.2±6.7 vs 12.6±1.3, though not significant, p=0.877), motility (31.8±23 vs 27±30, p=0.697), and normal morphology (40.9±7.8 vs 35±10.8, p=0.04). Testicular histology showed restoration of Leydig cell count (59.33±4.0 vs 30.50±3.86, p=0.035) and spermatogonia number (319.4±64.59 vs 491±37.0, p<0.001). The 245 mg/kg BW dose primarily improved sperm concentration (62.95±29.4 vs 12.6±1.3, p=0.01) and motility (36.6±23 vs 27±30, p=0.436). Sildenafil citrate significantly enhanced most parameters compared with diabetic controls (p<0.05). Conclusion Piper nigrum fruit extract ameliorates sexual dysfunction and reproductive impairment in alloxan-induced diabetic rats, particularly at 122.5 mg/kg BW, with significant improvements in erectile function, libido (p<0.05), sperm quality (p≤0.04), and testicular histology (p=0.035). These findings suggest its potential as a natural therapeutic agent for DM-related male reproductive dysfunction.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-37/v1?src=rss">Assessing data management and compliance in large research collaborations via knowledge bases:  A semi-structured interview approach [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Large-scale research collaborations rely not only on robust research strategies but also on structured data management and systematic knowledge exchange. Ensuring compliance with ethical and legal requirements is essential from the beginning. This includes obtaining informed consent and adhering to data protection laws such as the GDPR (for Europe), as well as following Open Science and FAIR principles, particularly when working with personal data. Additionally, the systematic assessment and documentation of project objectives, data characteristics, and other project-specific features are essential for advancing the scientific contribution and long-term development of such collaborations. Methods In this paper, we introduce a methodology designed to identify commonalities across research projects and to enhance data governance within large research consortia. The approach consists of three components: (1) a semi-structured interview that served a dual purpose: first, to raise awareness among researchers regarding ethical obligations, data protection requirements, and open science principles; second, to systematically collect metadata on planned studies, data types, participant groups, and methodological procedures; (2) structured processing and organization of the collected information; and (3) visualization of project interrelations through knowledge graphs. The methodology was piloted within a collaborative research centre in linguistics. Results The collected metadata were systematically structured and used to construct knowledge graphs capturing interrelations among projects, data types, methodologies, and participant groups. These visualizations enable research consortia to make informed decisions about collaboration, infrastructure planning, and data reuse. Conclusions The proposed methodology offers a systematic way to assess data management practices, while also fostering a culture of compliance and transparency from the ground up. Knowledge graph visualizations provide a practical tool for identifying synergies, promoting data reuse, and strengthening transparency across projects. This approach can serve as a foundation for developing sustainable research infrastructures in consortia working with diverse empirical data.

                Background Breast metastasis from lung cancer is an extremely rare clinical event, particularly in men, and therefore remains poorly documented. Case presentation We report the case of a 45-year-old man with primary lung adenocarcinoma who subsequently developed a breast metastasis. He initially presented with spinal pain. Physical examination revealed cervical and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. A whole-body computed tomography (CT) scan showed bilateral pulmonary nodules with mediastinal, supraclavicular, and axillary lymphadenopathy. Biopsy of the most accessible axillary lymph node confirmed adenocarcinoma of pulmonary origin. Chemotherapy was initiated. Ten months later, the patient developed a painless ipsilateral breast mass. Histological and immunohistochemical analyses confirmed the diagnosis of breast metastasis from lung adenocarcinoma. Conclusion Distinguishing between primary and metastatic breast carcinoma is essential because their treatment and prognosis differ considerably. Accurate diagnosis is therefore crucial for optimal patient management.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-35/v1?src=rss">Understanding the Link Between Toxic Leadership and Employee Well-being: The Interplay of Employee Turnover, Organizational commitment, Shift timing & Industry Sector [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background This study examines the impact of toxic leadership on employee well-being and turnover across various industry sectors in the United Arab Emirates. Toxic leadership, marked by manipulative and hostile behaviors, has been associated with negative employee outcomes. However, limited research has jointly explored these effects with the moderating roles of organizational commitment and shift timing in this regional context. Grounded in Social Exchange Theory, Psychological Contract Theory, and Conservation of Resources Theory, the study investigates how toxic leadership influences employee well-being and turnover and whether organizational commitment, shift timing, and industry sector moderate these relationships. Methods A quantitative survey design was used, involving responses from 300 employees representing diverse sectors. Regression analysis and structural equation modeling were applied to assess the direct and moderating effects of toxic leadership on well-being and turnover. The analysis examined model significance, variance explained, and moderation through interaction terms while confirming validity and reliability through AVE, HTMT, and VIF metrics. Results Toxic leadership significantly reduced employee well-being (R = 0.445, R2 = 0.198) and increased turnover (R = 0.422, R2 = 0.178). Organizational commitment moderated the toxic leadership–turnover relationship (B = 0.2124, p = .0088) but did not moderate the toxic leadership–well-being relationship. Shift timing and industry sector showed minimal moderation with negligible variance explained. The structural model demonstrated good fit and explanatory power for turnover (R2 = 0.582) and workplace behavior (R2 = 0.373), confirming acceptable reliability and validity indices. Conclusion Toxic leadership detrimentally affects employee well-being and retention across all sectors. Organizational commitment partially buffers these effects on turnover but not on well-being. Findings highlight that reducing toxic leadership behaviors is essential for employee health and organizational stability, as contextual factors like shift timing or sector offer limited protective influence.

                Background The Blue Economy has emerged as the dominant paradigm for ocean governance, promising to reconcile maritime economic expansion with environmental protection through technological innovation and market instruments. However, it rests on theoretically precarious commitments: absolute decoupling of growth from environmental degradation, techno-managerial universalism, and marketisation of marine commons. This article develops a theoretical critique of the Blue Economy by synthesizing degrowth scholarship and political ecology to expose how growth-compatible ocean governance reproduces dispossession, intensification, and unequal exchange in Global South contexts. Methods This literature-based study employs purposive sampling and thematic synthesis to build a conceptual critique. The analysis centers degrowth as the primary theoretical lens and deploys political ecology concepts—enclosure, spatial fix, and ecologically unequal exchange—to trace causal mechanisms through which Blue Economy policies produce unjust distributive outcomes. Literature selection prioritized canonical degrowth texts, foundational political ecology works, and critical Blue Economy scholarship. An illustrative composite vignette from Indonesian coastal contexts grounds the theoretical arguments. Results The synthesis yields six interrelated critiques demonstrating that the Blue Economy’s epistemic framing privileges market valuation over plural values; decoupling assumptions are empirically fragile and undermined by rebound effects and problem-shifting; market instruments commodify commons and enable governance capture; Blue Economy projects function as spatial fixes reproducing accumulation by dispossession; distributional outcomes are regressive; and techno-optimism masks problem-shifting. The article develops Blue Degrowth as a normative alternative, articulating five principles—limits and sufficiency, anti-colonial delinking, commons governance, local value retention, and democratic deliberation—and translates these into policy modalities including legal recognition of customary marine tenure, cooperative processing, precautionary moratoria, and alternative metrics beyond GDP. Conclusions Blue Degrowth offers a framework for just ocean governance that fundamentally breaks from growth-centric paradigms. Future research should test causal mechanisms through comparative studies, develop participatory sufficiency metrics, and explore coalition-building strategies for implementation in diverse Global South settings.

                Spatially-resolved transcriptomics (SRT) generates large and heterogeneous datasets where global (tissue-wide) quality control (QC) metrics often over-aggressively remove biologically meaningful regions or miss localized artifacts. Recently, spatially-aware QC metrics have been introduced in SpotSweeper, but this is limited to the R programming language, which makes it challenging to use these metrics within the Python/scverse ecosystem. Here, we present SpotSweeper-py, a Python equivalent package of SpotSweeper that computes neighborhood-aware z-scores for standard QC metrics such as total counts, log total counts, number of detected genes, and percentage of mitochondrial counts. We demonstrate the performance and usability of SpotSweeper-py on two public datasets from the 10x Genomics Visium and VisiumHD platforms. This implementation of local spatially-aware QC metrics enables direct integration with Python/scverse ecosystem, reduces false positives from global quality control while preserving tissue-specific architecture. Plotting utilities are also included for quick visualizations of flagged outliers. By making robust local QC accessible in Python, SpotSweeper-py strengthens the reliability of pipelines for analyzing SRT data. The open-source software is available on PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/spotsweeper).

                Despite extensive research on hemispheric asymmetries, the mechanisms regulating lateralized brain functions are incompletely understood. Growing evidence suggests that lateralized neural circuits are side-specifically controlled, in part, by neuropeptides acting as neuromodulators, paracrine factors, and neurohormones. This review highlights evidence supporting this concept in the contexts of lateralized pain processing in the amygdala, control of auditory signaling, lateralized interoceptive signaling, and side-specific endocrine regulation. Our focus is primarily on rodent studies, with supporting data from humans and nonmammalian species, including turtles and nematodes. Left–right side-specific control may be rooted in a bipartite, lateralized organization of neuropeptide systems. Neuropeptides with asymmetric actions may act locally within specific brain regions or be coordinated across the neuraxis. These findings converge on a model in which neuropeptides enable lateralized control through interconnected mechanisms spanning gene expression, neural circuits, and behavioral outcomes.

By influencing how T cells respond to antigens, DNA-PKcs emerges as a promising therapeutic target, and inhibiting DNA-PKcs may offer a powerful approach to preventing transplant rejection.

                Groslambert et al. reveal that PARG controls the PAR-dependent proteasomal degradation of TARG1. The authors additionally identify the E3 ligases HUWE1 and TRIP12 as key factors that target TARG1 for degradation, further establishing their roles as PAR-dependent E3 ligases.

                Templeton and Laimins examine the interplay between the high-risk HPV E6 protein and the RNA helicase senataxin (SETX) in regulating global R-loop and m6A levels during HPV infection. E6 depletes m6A levels, while SETX facilitates m6A modification through controlling m6A MTC expression in a differentiation-dependent manner critical for viral replication.

                Gutman-Wei et al. show that layer 6 corticothalamic neurons preferentially form functional synapses onto parvalbumin-positive inhibitory interneurons over more common excitatory cortical cells during postnatal synaptogenesis, following two periods of intracortical axon development. Thus, selective synaptogenesis, rather than non-selective synapse formation followed by selective pruning, generates these cell-type-biased excitatory connections.

Li et al. identify a subset of trigeminal afferents in mice activated by facial brushing after nerve injury. Targeted manipulations reveal these neurons’ causal role in pain-like behaviors and heightened sensitivity, providing new insights into primary afferents underlying mechanical allodynia.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106096">Affinity-guided labeling reveals P2X7 nanoscale membrane redistribution during BV2 microglial activation</a></h4>

              
                ATP-gated purinergic P2X7 receptors are crucial ion channels involved in inflammation. They sense abnormal ATP release during stress or injury and are considered promising clinical targets for therapeutic intervention. However, despite their predominant expression in immune cells such as microglia, there is limited information on P2X7 membrane expression and regulation during inflammation at the single-molecule level, necessitating new labeling approaches to visualize P2X7 in native cells. Here, we present <b>X7-uP</b>, an unbiased, affinity-guided P2X7 chemical labeling reagent that selectively and covalently biotinylates endogenous P2X7 in BV2 cells, a murine microglial cell line, allowing subsequent labeling with streptavidin-Alexa 647 tailored for super-resolution imaging. We uncovered a nanoscale microglial P2X7 redistribution mechanism where evenly spaced individual receptors in quiescent cells undergo upregulation and clustering in response to the pro-inflammatory agent lipopolysaccharide and ATP, leading to synergistic interleukin-1β release. Our method thus offers a new approach to revealing endogenous P2X7 expression at the single-molecule level.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/108225">Two classes of amine/glutamate multi-transmitter neurons innervate Drosophila internal male reproductive organs</a></h4>

              
                The essential outcome of a successful mating is the transfer of genetic material from males to females in sexually reproducing animals from insects to mammals. In males, this culminates in ejaculation, a precisely timed sequence of organ contractions driven by the concerted activity of interneurons, sensory neurons, and motor neurons. Although central command circuits that trigger copulation have been mapped, the motor architecture and the chemical logic that couple specific neuronal subclasses to organ-specific contractility, seminal fluid secretion, and sperm emission remain largely uncharted. This gap in knowledge limits our ability to explain how neural circuits adapt to varying contexts and how their failure contributes to infertility. Here, we present an in-depth anatomical and functional analysis of the motor neurons that innervate the internal male reproductive tract of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. We identify two classes of multi-transmitter motor neurons based on neurotransmitter usage, namely octopamine and glutamate neurons (OGNs) and serotonin and glutamate neurons (SGNs), each with a biased pattern of innervation: SGNs predominate in the accessory glands, OGNs in the ejaculatory duct, with equal contributions of each to the seminal vesicles. Both classes co-express vesicular transporters for glutamate (vGlut) and amines (vMAT), confirming their dual chemical identity. Their target organs differentially express receptors for glutamate, octopamine, and serotonin, suggesting combinatorial neuromodulation of contractility. Functional manipulations show that SGNs are essential for male fertility but OGNs are dispensable. Glutamatergic transmission from both classes is also dispensable for fertility. These findings provide the first high-resolution map linking multi-transmitter motor neurons to specific reproductive organs, reveal an unexpected division of labor between serotonergic and octopaminergic signaling pathways, and establish a framework for dissecting conserved neural principles that govern ejaculation and male fertility.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105776">Short activation domains control chromatin association of transcription factors</a></h4>

              
                Transcription factors regulate gene expression with DNA-binding domains (DBDs) and activation domains. Despite evidence to the contrary, DBDs are often assumed to be the primary mediators of transcription factor (TF) interactions with DNA and chromatin. Here, we used fast single-molecule tracking of transcription factors in living cells to show that short activation domains can control the fraction of molecules bound to chromatin. Stronger activation domains have higher bound fractions and longer residence times on chromatin. Furthermore, mutations that increase activation domain strength also increase chromatin binding. This trend was consistent in four different activation domains and their mutants. This effect further held for activation domains appended to three different structural classes of DBDs. Stronger activation domains with high chromatin-bound fractions also exhibited increased binding to the p300 coactivator in proximity-assisted photoactivation experiments. Genome-wide measurements indicate these activation domains primarily control the occupancy of binding rather than the genomic location. Taken together, these results demonstrate that very short activation domains play a major role in tethering transcription factors to chromatin.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93003">The interplay between biomolecular assembly and phase separation</a></h4>

              
                Many biological functions and dysfunctions rely on two fundamental processes, molecular assembly and the formation of condensed phases such as biomolecular condensates. Condensed phases generally form via phase separation, while molecular assemblies are clusters of molecules of various sizes, shapes, and functionality. We developed a theory that relies on thermodynamic principles to understand the interplay between molecular assembly and phase separation. We propose two prototypical classes of protein interactions and characterize their different equilibrium states and relaxation dynamics. We obtain results consistent with recent in vitro experimental observations of reconstituted proteins, including anomalous size distribution of assemblies, the gelation of condensed phases, and the change in condensate volume during ageing. Our theory provides the framework to unravel the mechanisms underlying physiological assemblies essential for cellular function and aberrant assemblies which are associated with several neurodegenerative disorders.

">Sulcal Widening in Schizophrenia Maps onto Sulcal Hubs and Energy-Synaptic Genes</a></h4>

              
                Schizophrenia (SZ) is increasingly framed as a disorder of large-scale brain networks emerging from atypical early neurodevelopment, yet how network architecture relates to cortical folding abnormalities remains unclear. Here, we introduce a sulcal morphological-centred network framework that integrates normative modelling of sulcal width with diffusion-derived structural connectivity and transcriptomic data in a large multisite cohort (n = 5,392; 377 SZ). Individuals with SZ showed widespread sulcal widening, affecting 30 of 40 sulci and most pronounced in frontal, temporal and occipital regions. Critically, sulci with higher degree centrality, reflecting greater embedding within the structural connectome, exhibited disproportionately greater widening in SZ (pspin = 0.02), indicating that network hubs of cortical folding are preferentially affected. Transcriptomic integration using partial least squares regression identified a single component explaining 56.5% of SZ-related sulcal widening variance (pperm = 0.041), implicating genes enriched for synaptic signalling and energy metabolism with adult cortical expression bias and genetic enrichment for cross-disorder psychiatric risk. In contrast, oppositely weighted genes showed prenatal expression bias and enrichment for rare disruptive variants in autism spectrum disorder. Together, these findings link aberrant sulcal morphology in SZ to the brain's network topology and molecular architecture, positioning cortical folding as a network-embedded phenotype in SZ.

">Feasibility of multimodal metabolic analysis for detecting early changes in acute neuroinflammation</a></h4>

              
                Given the prevalence of metabolic perturbations in a variety of neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, understanding and monitoring brain metabolism is a key step in our advancement of therapies. The details of the citric acid cycle were established at the beginning of the last century but only recently have its metabolic intermediates been observed in vivo in the brain. In this study, we employed orthogonal analyses to investigate metabolic alterations in response to acute neuroinflammation in vivo, demonstrating a multi-technique approach that could be used for future studies. Hyperpolarized 13C-pyruvate spectroscopy revealed an early decline in pyruvate metabolism via pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), leading to reduced 13C-bicarbonate formation. This metabolic disruption occurred despite the absence of structural or perfusion changes on conventional MRI. Further analysis of polar metabolites in the ipsilateral hemisphere confirmed ongoing inflammatory processes. These findings highlight the potential of this dual technique approach to inform upon metabolic changes due to neuroinflammation. Combining methods to probe metabolism in invasive (metabolomics) and non-invasive (hyperpolarized MRI) manners, this represents a promising translational approach for real-time metabolic assessments in an area of the body, the brain, where studying processes such as metabolism has traditionally been challenging. This study has demonstrated the approach to monitor changes in metabolism in response to inflammation in the brain.

">Astrocytes control oxytocin-based maternal behavior via connexin 30</a></h4>

              
                Prosocial and affiliative behaviors rely on complex neuroendocrine neuronal circuits. Dynamic neuroglial interactions play prominent roles in shaping synaptic networks, whose alterations contribute to psychiatric disorders associated with social deficits. However, a role for astrocytes in regulating maternal behavior remains elusive. Here, we show that female mice exhibiting increased oxytocin levels in the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus upon social interactions with pups display neuroglial structural plasticity and downregulation of astroglial connexin 30, a protein involved in morphological remodeling. We found that impairing astroglial connexin 30 expression alters the structural properties of astrocytes by decreasing their volume and coverage of oxytocinergic synapses in the supraoptic nucleus of female mice. This functionally sets levels of plasma oxytocin and maternal behavior, exacerbating maternal care in virgin pup-naive female mice deficient for astroglial Cx30. Hypothalamic astrocytes, via connexin 30, are thus key determinants of oxytocin-based maternal behavior, whose alteration is known to impair social skills development in offspring.

">Expectation of aversive outcomes drives multimodal integration of behavioural, physiological and neural activations during human fear retrieval and generalisation</a></h4>

              
                Classical fear conditioning describes how neutral cues acquire a threat value, yet how learned associations are retrieved and generalised across similar stimuli specifically is an ongoing debate. We combined behavioural ratings, physiological measures, and fMRI in a two-day classical fear conditioning paradigm to characterize acquisition, retrieval, and generalisation across modalities. Twenty-five healthy participants completed acquisition trials on Day 1 and retrieval and generalisation trials on Day 2 using conditioned (CS+, CS-) and graded generalisation stimuli (GS). Outcomes included trial-wise US expectancy ratings, pre/post fear and arousal ratings, skin conductance responses (SCR), pupil dilation, and ROI-based fMRI (amygdala, hippocampus, insula, periaqueductal gray (PAG), locus coeruleus). Acquisition yielded robust CS+/CS- discrimination in behavioural ratings and increased BOLD responses in bilateral insula and PAG. During retrieval, US-expectancy ratings indicated early retrieval of CS contingency. The fMRI results showed greater BOLD activity during CS+ presentations than during CS- presentations in bilateral hippocampus, left insula and right PAG. Additionally, hippocampus-insula coupling increased. Critically, parametric modulation during retrieval revealed that trial-wise mean US-expectancy modulated BOLD responses in left insula and right PAG, with a trend in left hippocampus. Across generalisation, US-expectancy and pupil dilation responses followed graded profiles, which could be explained by a Gaussian model, whereas SCR generalised, but was not captured by a Gaussian model. Parametric modulation by US-expectancy correlated with BOLD activity in left PAG, with a trend in right hippocampus. Stimulus identity explained variance in bilateral insula and left PAG. Findings converge on a hippocampus-insula-PAG network that retrieves learned predictions, and scales defensive output according to similarity-based threat probability, linking subjective, physiological, and neural outcomes.

">Neural Signatures of Automatic Auditory Regularity Detection Reflect Individual Differences in Explicit Short-Term Memory</a></h4>

              
                Perception is shaped by the statistical structure of the environment, reflecting the brain's capacity to detect and exploit regularities in sensory input. This process requires the maintenance of contextual information over time, yet the nature of the memory mechanism supporting automatic structure learning remains unclear. Here, we ask whether auditory regularity processing relies on a dedicated sensory buffer or instead draws on domain-general mnemonic resources. We related neural indices of regularity processing measured with EEG during passive listening to behavioural performance on an explicit auditory short-term memory task. Human participants (N=30; both sexes) passively listened to regularly repeating (cycles of 5.5 seconds) or random tone sequences, while sustained and tone-locked neural responses were extracted as complementary markers of predictability tracking and prediction-error signalling. Individual differences in explicit memory performance, quantified using a delayed match to sample task, systematically predicted both neural measures: high performers showed enhanced sustained responses and attenuated tone-evoked responses (most pronounced in the N2 time window; 250-400 ms post-onset) to regular sequences, whereas low performers showed no reliable modulation by sequence structure. These findings demonstrate that the memory processes engaged automatically during auditory pattern analysis are not encapsulated, but instead draw on shared mnemonic resources, providing a link between predictive perception and individual variability in sensory memory capacity.

">Suppressive Genetic Interactions Between Haploinsufficient Mitochondrial Genes Encoded in the 22q11.2 Microdeletion Locus Define Brain and Cardiac Phenotypes</a></h4>

              
                Genomic copy number variations, such as the 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome, cause pleiotropic disorders that affect diverse organ systems and disrupt neurodevelopment. Deletions of the 22q11.2 locus reduce the dosage of up to 46 protein coding genes, raising questions about the identity of haploinsufficient genes and their genetic interactions contributing to 22q11.2 phenotypes. Here, we dissect functional and molecular relationships between two genes encoded within the 22q11.2 locus: the mitochondrial ribosomal protein gene MRPL40 and the mitochondrial citrate transporter SLC25A1. We show that a MRPL40 null mutation disrupts mitochondrial translation, impairs respiration, and affects multiple components of the SLC25A1 interactome including factors required for lipid metabolism, mitochondrial ribosome subunits, and the mitochondrial RNA processing machinery. In silico coessentiality network analysis revealed correlated and anticorrelated fitness interactions linking MRPL40 and SLC25A1 to mitochondrial translation, intermediate carbon metabolism, and interferon signaling. We determined that Mrpl40-null mutations are embryonic lethal in mice, but Mrpl40-/+ mice are viable and displayed embryonic cardiac development and adult behavioral phenotypes. Similarly, Slc25a1+/- animals showed embryonic cardiac developmental defects but lacked the adult behavioral phenotypes observed in Mrpl40-/+ mice. Surprisingly, transheterozygotic Slc25a1+/-;Mrpl40-/+ mice suppressed or mitigated cardiac development, behavioral, and brain transcriptome phenotypes observed in single heterozygotic animals. These results reveal that MRPL40 and SLC25A1 are haploinsufficient genes within the 22q11.2 locus that genetically and biochemically interact to define tissue development and physiology. Our findings provide a framework for understanding the complexity and type of gene dosage interactions within the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome locus.

">Aging Converts Microglial Repopulation into Maladaptive Reprogramming that Exacerbates Cognitive Deficits</a></h4>

              
                Background and Purpose Aging has been associated with neuroinflammation and cognitive decline. Microglial repopulation after pharmacological depletion has been proposed as a strategy to alleviate microglia-driven neuropathology. However, the effects of microglial repopulation on age-related cognitive decline remain largely unexplored. In the present study, we examined how microglial repopulation affects the transcriptomic profiles of cortical microglia and the decline in prefrontal cortex-dependent cognitive function in aged mice. Experimental Approach Young and aged male C57BL/6J mice were used in this study. Microglial depletion was induced by treatment with PLX3397, a CSF1R inhibitor, followed by microglial repopulation after drug withdrawal. Microglia isolated from the entire cerebral cortex were subjected to bulk RNA-sequencing analysis. The visual discrimination test followed by the response direction test was conducted to assess sensory learning and attentional set shifting abilities, respectively. Key Results Repopulated cortical microglia in aged, but not young, mice exhibited aberrant gene expression patterns, including reduced expression of microglial identity genes, reprogramming of innate and adaptive immune-related gene expression, and derepression of neuronal gene expression. Furthermore, microglial repopulation selectively impaired visual discrimination learning and attentional set shifting in aged mice. Conclusion and Implications These findings demonstrate that aging converts microglial repopulation into maladaptive reprogramming that exacerbates cognitive decline, possibly through aberrant gene expression programs. Therefore, the therapeutic potential of this approach must be carefully evaluated with respect to specific behavioral domains and disease contexts, including aging.

">Ultrafast Frame-Free Imaging of Neural Activity with Event Cameras</a></h4>

              
                Frame-based fluorescence imaging has long defined how neural activity is optically measured. This approach requires acquiring all pixels within an image, regardless of whether they carry meaningful neural dynamics, thereby intrinsically coupling spatial and temporal resolution while increasing data output. Here, we introduce an entirely different, frame-free approach that leverages the sparse nature of neural activity using event-based cameras, which asynchronously report fluorescence changes as spatiotemporal events. Compared with a frame-based camera, our method preserves signal fidelity while eliminating the fixed trade-off between spatial resolution, temporal resolution and data rate, thereby reducing data output by orders of magnitude. Applied to hippocampal preparations we demonstrate that the frame-free approach can resolve both single action potentials and fast network dynamics over large fields of view at kilohertz rates, enabling scalable, ultrafast optical recordings.

                Structural and functional insights into the mouse hypothalamus are hampered by its small size and deep location. Here, we leverage ultra-high-field magnetic resonance imaging (UHF-MRI) at 17.2 Tesla to achieve unprecedented spatial resolution in structural, functional and neurochemical imaging of the mouse hypothalamus, including sexual dimorphism in certain nuclei. High-resolution ex vivo anatomical MRI enabled precise hypothalamic parcellation, improving on existing atlases and revealing nuclei previously unresolved by MRI. Diffusion MRI and tractography mapped intra- and extra-hypothalamic pathways, facilitating circuit-level exploration without a priori assumptions. Resting-state fMRI combined with independent component analysis identified novel hypothalamic networks, demonstrating the enhanced capacity of UHF MRI to detect deep-brain activity. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy quantified neurochemical profiles, revealing sexually dimorphic heterogeneity within the hypothalamus. Our comprehensive multimodal approach uncovers sex differences in hypothalamic anatomy, microstructure, and neurochemistry, emphasizing the importance of sex as a biological variable. This integrated pipeline offers a valuable resource for dissecting hypothalamic circuits and functions, advancing our understanding of neuroendocrine regulation, behavior, and disease mechanisms, with direct translational relevance.

">MEG correlates of empty subjects in Japanese control and raising constructions</a></h4>

              
                Empty categories are unpronounced elements with syntactic properties that play a central role in theories of sentence structure. Although there are several types within these categories, the neural basis for distinguishing among them remains unclear. Using magnetoencephalography, we investigate whether the brain distinguishes between two Japanese sentence structures: Control and raising. Although these constructions appear similar on the surface, they are argued to involve different types of empty categories. In theoretical analyses, the control-type empty category, which is called PRO, is often treated as an anaphoric element, similar to reflexives such as himself and herself, whereas the raising-type empty category is a noun phrase trace. Twenty-six native Japanese speakers participated in a reading task under three experimental conditions: Control, raising, and baseline. Source estimates were computed, and condition differences were tested using spatiotemporal cluster-based permutation t-tests. We observed late left-hemispheric differences at approximately 700-800 ms after the critical verb. The control condition elicited larger responses than the raising condition, with activity centered in the temporal cortex spanning the middle temporal gyrus and the superior temporal sulcus and gyrus and extending into the anterior insula and the supramarginal gyrus. In addition, the control condition elicited larger late responses than the baseline condition in a broader left fronto-temporal distribution, including the inferior frontal cortex, the anterior temporal cortex, and the insula. These results provide source-level evidence that brain activity in the left language network differs between the control and raising conditions in Japanese during online sentence comprehension. Furthermore, they suggest that we can distinguish empty category types in the brain.

">Aging redirects prior expectations from perception to action</a></h4>

              
                Aging profoundly reshapes how the brain integrates sensory evidence with prior expectations during perceptual decision-making. Combining behavioural modelling with high-density EEG, we show that older adults assign greater weight on prior information, resulting in stronger decisional bias and reduced sensory precision under probabilistic cues. Neural dynamics revealed a breakdown of anticipatory tuning in visual alpha rhythms, supporting sensory preparation in youth, alongside enhanced central beta activity, indicating a shift toward pre-emptive motor engagement aligned with expected responses. A data-driven decomposition further showed that, whereas prior-driven behaviour in younger adults emerges from a flexible interplay between sensory and executive oscillatory systems, it becomes dominated in aging by a rigid, response-centred mode. Together, these findings uncover a large-scale reconfiguration of predictive computations with age, marking a transition from adaptive sensory-executive coordination to a more automatized, action-oriented predictive strategy.

">Formation, stability, and competition in dendritic proto-spines</a></h4>

              
                Over 80 % of excitatory synapses in the mammalian brain terminate on dendritic spines, which support key functions of memory storage and computation. Despite the neurodevelopmental and computational implications of spine formation, little is known about the interplay of physical and chemical signaling mechanisms that govern spine initiation. We developed a physics-based model for the formation, stability, and placement of membrane protrusions (proto-spines) triggered by membrane-bending proteins such as IRSp53, and activated by neurotransmitter inputs. We identify two distinct proto-spine energy manifolds depending on the concentration of activated IRSp53, causing shallow and sharp geometries respectively. The sharp proto-spines exhibit properties of wave-pinning models, including stimulus-local formation, positional stability, and merging, but unlike the wave-pinning model they also exhibit competition. We linked the physics-based model to a mass-action chemistry model of neurotransmitter-driven signaling pathway activation of IRSp53 to simulate proto-spine formation in response to neurotransmitter stimulus patterns. Multiple proto-spines compete for IRSp53, leading to inter-spine spacing of 1 - 3 m, similar to experiments. Correlated and spatially clustered synaptic input enhances proto-spine lifetime and density compared to non-correlated stimuli. Finally, we tested the effects of autism spectrum disorder-related mutations in spine-formation signaling, leading to altered RhoGEF activity. We found that elevated RhoGEF activity increased proto-spine density and reduced their lifetime, consistent with ASD phenotypes. Overall, our analysis shows that the interplay between membrane bending mechanics and reaction-diffusion chemistry creates rich proto-spine dynamics and concisely captures key features of early spine formation.

">Pannexin-1 channel activity regulates neurogenesis and cell survival in the developing cortex</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in genes encoding a range of ion-conducting proteins disrupt development of the cerebral cortex in humans, often causing polymicrogyria (PMG), yet how ion conduction guides the development of cortical architecture is not clear. Here, we describe three individuals with brain malformations including PMG and microcephaly in whom de novo, missense mutations were identified in PANX1--encoding an ATP and ion conducting channel. We show that these PMG-associated PANX1 mutations (p.D14H, p.M37R, and p.N338T) disrupt normal glycosylation and confer gain-of-function with respect to ATP release and channel conductance. In vivo modeling of PANX1 mutant forms in cortical progenitor cells demonstrated disrupted cell migration and cell fate, including excess cell death in both mice and ferret models. Modeling the N338T allele in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons further revealed how conductance changes lead to functional consequences of increased excitability and synchronicity. Our results show that normal PANX1 function contributes to cortical structure through regulation of ion conductance and ATP release and provides insight into how these processes influence corticogenesis and cytoarchitecture more broadly.

">A robust low-dimensional manifold organizes neuronal responses to sustained input</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how neurons transform synaptic input into spiking output remains a central challenge in neuroscience. Although neuronal responses are often described in hig-dimensional terms, it remains unclear to what extent neuronal input-output transformations are governed by lower-dimensional structure. Here, we examine the geometric organization of neuronal input-output relationships using intracellular current-clamp recordings from mouse visual cortex. By representing neuronal responses in a feature space capturing multiple aspects of spike timing and excitability, we analyze how response variability is distributed across dimensions. We find that neuronal responses are organized within a robust low-dimensional manifold that accounts for the majority of observed variance and emerges despite substantial heterogeneity in neuronal responses and stimulation conditions, indicating a general organizational constraint rather than idiosyncratic properties of individual neurons. Importantly, the identified low-dimensional manifold is not a trivial consequence of feature reduction but delineates a constrained response space within which neuronal input-output transformations are expressed. Together, these results reveal a previously underappreciated regularity in neuronal response organization and delineate geometric constraints shaping neuronal input-output mappings under sustained drive, providing a principled foundation for computational models of neuronal function.

">Preparation and application of YFV-17D-derived Anterograde Trans-neuronal Viral Vectors for Neuroscience Research</a></h4>

              
                Trans-neuronal viruses that spread between synaptically connected neurons have become invaluable tools in neuroscience, enabling circuit mapping and targeted delivery of genetic material to cells within defined pathways. Although most available trans-neuronal viral tracers propagate retrogradely, an anterograde trans-neuronal virus that spread from presynaptic to postsynaptic neurons would substantially expand experimental capabilities. We previously demonstrated that YFV-17D--a live attenuated yellow fever vaccine used clinically for decades--spreads anterogradely along neuronal circuits. We further developed a suite of recombinant YFV-17D-based vectors for diverse applications, including tracing monosynaptic projectome of defined neuronal cell types, multiplex mapping of parallel pathways, and trans-neuronal genetic manipulation with minimal neurotoxicity. We have now tested and optimized procedures for vector production and application. Based on these optimizations, here, we present a two part guide for preparing and deploying this viral vector system to map brain connectivity. The first part describes the molecular biology and cell culture workflows required to generate high quality viral vectors, yielding titers of ~1x10^10 to 5x10^11 genomic copies per milliliter within approximately two weeks. The second part outlines optimized animal procedures, including intracranial injections, perioperative care, and experimental considerations tailored to specific aims and vector variants. Depending on the application, efficient trans-neuronal tracing can be achieved within 1-4 weeks following delivery.

">Severity-dependent proteomic alterations in the rat hippocampus following pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus</a></h4>

              
                Status epilepticus (SE) is a prolonged seizure state that can induce lasting hippocampal damage and promote the development of spontaneous seizures and cognitive deficits. The severity and duration of SE strongly influence these long-term outcomes; however, many experimental studies rely on behavioral assessments such as the Racine scale, which may not capture subclinical or non-convulsive seizure activity. Consequently, the molecular consequences of lower-severity seizures that do not meet conventional criteria for severe SE, but may nonetheless contribute to epileptogenesis, remain poorly understood. To address this gap, we investigated whether behavioral seizure severity in the pilocarpine model correlates with distinct proteomic alterations in the hippocampus. Seizures were induced in adult male rats using pilocarpine, and animals were behaviorally classified into three groups: control, mild SE, and severe SE. Hippocampal tissue was collected from control (n = 3), mild SE (n = 5), and severe SE (n = 6) rats and subjected to mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis. Proteomic profiles were analyzed using partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified using volcano plots. Functional enrichment analyses were performed using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway databases. Our findings revealed distinct hippocampal proteomic signatures across control, mild SE, and severe SE groups, as revealed by PLS-DA. Severe SE was associated with widespread proteomic alterations, including 129 DEPs linked to synaptic structure, RNA regulation, and metabolic processes. In contrast, mild SE was associated with fewer changes (81 DEPs), primarily involving synaptic organization and endocytosis. A direct comparison of the severe and mild SE groups identified 76 DEPs enriched in pathways related to synaptic plasticity and neurodegeneration. Notably, 23 proteins showed a stepwise expression pattern across groups, suggesting a molecular gradient correlated with seizure severity. Correlation analyses identified and further confirmed glial and inflammatory molecules as candidate molecular markers associated with seizure burden. In conclusion, behavioral seizure severity in the pilocarpine model corresponds to distinct hippocampal proteomic profiles, with severe SE inducing broader and more pronounced molecular alterations than mild SE. Importantly, lower-severity SE is associated with biologically meaningful changes in pathways related to synaptic organization and cellular processing, highlighting mechanistic differences between mild and severe SE that may contribute to epileptogenic progression.

">Social context modulates cannibalistic attraction in Drosophila  larvae</a></h4>

              
                Animals often face conflicting decisions to ensure survival. Under food limitation, cannibalism can provide a nutritional advantage despite substantial costs. In Drosophila melanogaster larvae, feeding is essential for successful metamorphosis, making food source decisions critical. We find that dead conspecifics act as attractive cues, but this attraction is weak for live larval groups. It is enhanced when dead larvae are injured or homogenized, or after repeated exposure. Larvae are also more attracted to dead individuals from other Drosophila or insect species. Testing live larvae individually revealed the strongest attraction, indicating that social context suppresses feeding-related attraction. Attraction to dead conspecifics depends on multiple chemosensory and mechanosensory modalities, highlighting the complex integration of social and nutritional cues in larval decision-making. Our results indicate that fly larvae flexibly balance attraction and avoidance based on social context to optimize resource use under ecological constraints.

">Physiological detection of flow states across varied gameplay workloads</a></h4>

              
                Flow is a cognitive state associated with heightened and seemingly effortless behavioral performance. Pioneering research suggests flow is an optimal cognitive mode for demanding tasks but the physiological underpinnings and identification on acute timescales, particularly across task contexts, remains an active area of research.  Studies have demonstrated flow experiences are ubiquitous, in that they can arise during nearly any type of activity, suggesting flow represents a fundamental mechanism of skill mastery under which sensory inputs are seamlessly coupled to the necessary motor outputs. Cognitively, flow states are accompanied by a sense of complete task immersion, feelings of control, automatic behavior, decreased self-referential thinking and anxiety, changes in the perception of time, and improved affect to the point that arduous tasks can become autotelic, or self-rewarding. As wearable sensor technology continues to advance, the identification and manipulation of cognitive states in real-time is increasingly becoming a reality, with the potential to revolutionize learning, treatment of neurological disorders, and optimize task performance in domains ranging from professional sports to industry. This study aims to capture flow states from physiological measures so that they might be identified through wearable sensors coupled to machine-learning pipelines. In this work, models are made to predict high behavioral performance across disparately varied task conditions using multimodal physiological data, and these behavioral bouts are loosely correlated to participant responses to traditional flow state survey questions.

">A portable cortical evoked potential operant conditioning system (C-EPOCS): System development</a></h4>

              
                This study presents customizations and evaluations aimed at adapting the Cortical-Evoked Potential Operant Conditioning System (C-EPOCS) into a portable, user-friendly platform for real-time neurofeedback applications. A primary goal was to simplify the component-heavy setup by integrating electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) data acquisition into a single system-while still supporting cortical and muscle response assessment and real-time feedback. One key limitation of portable biosignal acquisition systems is their typically lower sampling rates (e.g., 300-600 Hz) compared to high-resolution systems (e.g., 3200 Hz), which are commonly used for detecting transient responses such as the H-reflex and M-wave. In a CEPOCS setup, these responses are useful for determining the target stimulation intensity and minimizing inter-session variability in effective afferent excitation. We evaluated whether lower-resolution EMG signals could still support the generation of H-reflex and M-wave recruitment curves for determining target stimulation intensity. Results showed that while EMG sampled at ~600 Hz and ~300 Hz produced greater dispersion in recruitment curve data, particularly at 300 Hz, they still yielded comparable estimates for stimulation intensities that elicit Hmax and Mthreshold, the key parameters for C-EPOCS. Additionally, we demonstrate the feasibility of using an automated response delineation algorithm under these conditions. Despite reduced signal clarity, the algorithm reliably identifies M-wave and H-reflex responses in real time. Overall, this study demonstrates the feasibility of a portable C-EPOCS system capable of providing immediate feedback based on both EMG and EEG signals. It also offers practical recommendations for selecting acquisition hardware to support reliable signal quality, real-time processing, and portability.

">Selective Age-Related Changes in Brain Network Connectivity During Young Adulthood: Sensory Networks Decrease While Hub Networks Remain Stable</a></h4>

              
                Young adulthood (ages 22-35 years) represents an important period for brain development, yet mechanisms underlying age-related connectivity changes remain poorly understood. We examined developmental trajectories in 66 healthy young adults (22 per age group: 22-25, 26-30, 31-35 years) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging from the Human Connectome Project. Contrary to expectations of global increases, we found selective age-related changes: sensory networks (visual and auditory) showed significant decreases in connectivity with age (visual: slope = -0.0133, p = 0.038; auditory: slope = -0.0184, p = 0.012), while hub networks (default mode and frontoparietal) and other networks remained stable (all p > 0.15). Network coupling analysis revealed a mechanistic explanation: sensory networks decouple from hub networks with age (DMN-AUD: change = -0.77; DMN-VIS: change = -0.56), while sensory networks show increased coupling with each other (VIS-AUD: +0.18). This decoupling explains why only sensory networks show age-related changes, as they become independent from hub networks during young adulthood. Importantly, total IQ showed no significant association with network connectivity (all |r| < 0.10, all p > 0.43), strengthening the developmental interpretation. Machine learning revealed the somatomotor network was most predictive of age. All effects remained consistent after controlling for head motion and across sexes. These results demonstrate selective, network-specific developmental trajectories during young adulthood, with sensory networks becoming independent from hub networks and showing age-related decreases, while hub networks maintain stability.

">Emotional modulation of visual cortical reactivation during true and false memories</a></h4>

              
                Previous research revealed that memory retrieval is associated with a reactivation of sensory cortices reflecting the content of the memory. Further, such reactivation is stronger when retrieval is cued with emotional information as compared with neutral information. However, past studies focused on correct retrieval, and it remains unknown whether a similar reactivation occurs during memory errors, and whether this is enhanced in emotional contexts. Here, we hypothesized that emotion may influence memory errors due to an increase of sensory cortical reactivation at the cost of recovering episodic details (i.e. leading to incorrect retrieval of non-specific associations shared with other cues). We compared brain activations during successful memory retrieval and memory errors in 18 healthy participants who encoded unique negative or neutral scenes paired with one of four associated faces, shared with other trials. Participants were tested the next day with a scene-cued associative retrieval test, while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Results from a face-responsive region of interest in fusiform cortex (unlike a control place-responsive region in parahippocampal cortex) showed stronger activation for both Hits ('Old' | Target) and False Alarms ('Old' | Foil), as compared with Misses ('New' | Target) and Correct Rejections ('New' | Foil). The emotional content of scene cues did not modulate activation patterns during correct retrieval but produced specific effects on Misattribution errors (incorrect 'Old' | Target, i.e., retrieval of an incorrect face cued by a previously seen scene). Specifically, Misattributions were accompanied by increased fusiform activation comparable to Hits when cued by negative scenes, but low fusiform activation similar to Misses when cued by neutral scenes. Unlike Misattributions, however, Hits cued by emotional information recruited a distinctive network previously linked to personal episodic memories, including medial prefrontal, cingulate, and hippocampal regions, together with enhanced functional coupling between the latter and fusiform cortex. No implicit effect of previous face exposure was observed in the fusiform during Misses, regardless of emotion context. Our results suggest that the reactivation of sensory areas follows subjective memory experience during retrieval, and that emotion can enhance such mechanism when the cue is recognized but detailed episodic memory mediated by fronto-hippocampal circuits is absent, leading to the retrieval of inappropriate associations and false memories.

">Impaired gephyrin G-domain trimerization and phase separation in a patient with developmental epileptic encephalopathy</a></h4>

              
                Epilepsy, a common neurological disorder is frequently linked to genetic variants in synaptic proteins. Here, we describe a de novo pathogenic missense variant in the gephyrin G-domain (G134R) identified in an epileptic patient with developmental delay and seizures. Functional analyses reveal that G134R disrupts higher-order oligomerization, leading to impaired liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and synaptic clustering. Recombinant G134R-gephyrin variant forms lower oligomers with reduced molybdenum cofactor (Moco) synthesis. In non-neuronal cells, G134R fails to oligomerize beyond dimers and loses Moco synthesis function. In neurons, G134R is unable to form synaptic clusters and exerts a dominant-negative effect on WT-gephyrin, severely disrupting inhibitory synapse formation. Our findings highlight a critical role for the G-domain in gephyrin self-assembly and LLPS, shifting the focus from the E-domain-centric view of gephyrin function and providing a novel molecular mechanism for epilepsy linked to G-domain mutations.

">Focal brain stimulation sites that modify autonomic arousal map to a convergent brain circuit and potential therapeutic target</a></h4>

              
                Causal modulation of autonomic outflow could yield new therapeutic targets for autonomic hyperactivation. We employed three natural experiments in which different brain regions were targeted using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) (n=139 sites, n=14 individuals), deep brain stimulation (n=392 sites, n=58 individuals), or low-intensity focused ultrasound (n=46 sites, n=23 individuals) with subsequent autonomic measurements. Using a human connectome database (n=1000) as a wiring diagram, we identified a convergent brain circuit that, when focally modulated, transiently reduces autonomic arousal. This circuit significantly resembled previously reported causal circuits for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety. In independent datasets, TMS to the autonomic arousal circuit reduced laboratory startle in healthy volunteers (n=28), lesions to this circuit reduced exaggerated startle in PTSD (n=193), and TMS to this circuit reduced anxiety-related autonomic symptoms in patients with clinically significant anxiety (n=30). Thus, the convergent circuit may serve as a potential neuromodulation target for autonomic hyperactivation.

">Cortical responses to balance perturbations persist without active postural control</a></h4>

              
                Standing balance relies on rapid reflexes as well as longer-latency subcortical and cortical processes to generate corrective responses to postural disturbances. Electroencephalography (EEG) studies consistently identify two perturbation-evoked markers of cortical activity, the balance N1 and midfrontal theta power, associated with changes in body orientation and corrective actions. It remains unclear, however, whether these markers depend on the nervous system's active control of posture or reflect a more general evaluation of unexpected sensory input. We tested this by measuring cortical and muscle activity during support-surface perturbations while systematically manipulating whether participants actively controlled posture. In Experiment 1 (n = 10), participants experienced identical perturbations while either actively balancing or being passively moved through equivalent motion. Despite large reductions in balance-correcting muscle activity during passive trials (~30-60%), N1 and theta responses persisted with only modest amplitude reductions (~10%). In Experiment 2 (n = 16), we created passive conditions increasingly removed from balance by varying sensory feedback (footplate + whole-body vs footplate-only motion) and motor engagement (isometric contraction vs. relaxed posture). Relaxed postures markedly suppressed muscle responses, yet cortical responses persisted, showing only modest modulation with sensory feedback (larger during footplate-only rotations) and no dependence on motor engagement. Together, these results indicate that N1 and midfrontal theta are not dependent on active postural control and persist even without matching sensory feedback or motor engagement. Rather than reflecting the generation or scaling of corrective actions, they index the early detection and evaluation of unexpected sensory events, consistent with prediction error or surprise processing.

">Energetic implications of fMRI-based nodal complex network metrics: a complex picture unfolds across diverse brain states</a></h4>

              
                Functional MRI-based graph theory has provided profound insights into the brain's functional organization, yet the neuroenergetic meaning of widely used graph-theoretical metrics remains poorly understood. Although resting-state research suggests a positive coupling between network topology and glucose metabolism, it remains unclear whether this relationship reflects a general principle of brain organization or a state-specific phenomenon. Here, we test the neuroenergetic interpretability of nodal graph-theoretical metrics by linking complex network topology to cerebral glucose consumption across diverse brain states. Leveraging simultaneous functional PET-MRI, we directly compare state-dependent fluctuations in glucose consumption and network topology during sensory, cognitive, and arousal conditions. We further assess metabolic-topological couplings in disease through a meta-analysis of resting-state FDG-PET and fMRI studies involving Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia. Our results show that nodal graph-theoretical metrics exhibit state- and network-dependent metabolic associations, with coupling patterns diverging across experimental and disease contexts. Notably, frontoparietal and attentional networks show more conserved metabolic-topological coupling than other large-scale networks across states. These findings underscore a dynamic, complex interplay between metabolic demand and complex network organization, highlighting the need for a nuanced interpretation of the energetic underpinnings of nodal graph-theoretical metrics in health and disease.

">Co-Designing Research Priorities in Developmental Neuroscience: A Community-Based Participatory Approach</a></h4>

              
                Children and adolescents, the primary participants in developmental neuroscience research, are rarely consulted or included in the research design process. By neglecting their perspectives and needs, we risk limiting the relevance and effectiveness of translational research that might emerge from such research. Here, we report on a process of co-development with adolescents in the UK city of Bradford to inform the generation of a new developmental neuroimaging research programme. We employed a two-study community-based participatory approach and used mixed methods to identify the research priorities of this community. In the first study, 79 secondary school students from four schools were introduced to fundamental neuroscience concepts during five one-hour workshops. In groups, they then designed research studies, centred around topics they deemed imported, and were asked to present their ideas on posters, role playing as neuroscientists. Reflexive thematic analysis was conducted on these posters, extracting ten key themes. In the second study, 387 students from four schools ranked the ten extracted themes in order of importance. Mental health and stress consistently emerged as the highest priorities across groups. Exploratory analysis revealed that the priority for themes exploring healthy routines and understanding anti-social behaviours varied across schools and the importance of mental health, and topics related to video gaming varied significantly between genders. This work provides an illustration of how a place-based participatory approach can inform the design of developmental neuroscience programmes, improving both equity and translational relevance.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. The initial injury initiates a cascade of secondary injury mechanisms, including neuroinflammation and disruption of brain connectivity. In this study, we used the lateral fluid percussion injury model of TBI to investigate the relationship between secondary thalamic inflammation and corticothalamic connectivity disruptions. For this, we followed rats for six months post-injury, during which functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was conducted under light sedation, as well as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and positron emission tomography (PET). PET imaging with [<sup>18</sup>F]-FEPPA revealed neuroinflammation in the subacute stage in several ipsilateral thalamic nuclei, including the ventral posterior nucleus and lateral nucleus. In the fMRI analysis, we observed initial corticothalamic hypoconnectivity, which partially resolved by six months post-injury. DTI showed persistent increased mean, axial, and radial diffusivity in the ipsilateral thalamic nuclei from two months post-injury. Histological examination confirmed chronic thalamic neuroinflammation and neuronal loss eight months post-TBI. Correlation analyses showed that subacute thalamic neuroinflammation was associated with long-term structural and functional changes. These findings suggest that secondary thalamic inflammation contributes to enduring corticothalamic connectivity disruptions, which may underlie cognitive and sensorimotor deficits observed after TBI.</span>

                <p>Repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (rmTBI) is a major contributor to long-term neurological dysfunction, yet many preclinical models lack precise control and quantification of biomechanical forces across impacts. We developed a reproducible, closed-skull mouse model of rmTBI using a custom-built weight&ndash;drop apparatus featuring a solenoid-based rebound arrest system, integrated high-speed videography, and accelerometry to track head kinematics during impact. Adult male and female mice received either a single impact or nine daily impacts. Linear and angular acceleration data were analyzed alongside behavioral and histological outcomes. Our apparatus delivered consistent impact and velocity forces with minimal intersubject variability. Additionally, the animals experienced consistent linear and angular acceleration as measured using high-speed video capture. These impacts did not cause skull fracture or acute vascular hemorrhage, but impacted animals had increased return of righting reflex time, consistent with mild, concussion-like symptoms. Behavioral testing revealed reduced performance of rmTBI-affected mice in an olfaction-mediated foraging task (buried food task), particularly at later timepoints, consistent with progressive olfactory impairment. Immunohistochemical analysis of Iba1 and CD68 in the brain demonstrated sex-dependent microglial activation, with males showing higher expression levels in both single- and nine-impact models. Among the brain regions investigated, microglial activation was most pronounced in the corpus callosum, neocortex, and olfactory tubercle. These findings underscore the importance of including sex as a biological variable in rmTBI research and support the utility of this model for probing injury thresholds, regional vulnerability, and potential therapeutic interventions in repetitive head trauma.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>It has been established that aged rats are worse at learning the spatial version of the Morris watermaze task compared to their younger counterparts. It remains unclear, however, whether this poorer performance by the older rats can be attributed to the use of different behavioral strategies to solve the task. We trained young (6–9 months, <i>n</i> = 37) and old (19–22 months, <i>n</i> = 65) male Fischer 344 rats on the Morris watermaze for four consecutive days with six trials per day. Using Rtrack, an automated discriminant classifier, we analyzed each rat's swimming trajectory to estimate the probability of the rat using one of eight distinct navigation strategies on each given trial. Across acquisition, the behavioral strategy profiles diverged markedly by age. The use of both platform-independent and procedural strategy types declined across learning in young rats in favor of allocentric ones. In contrast, there was no decline in the old rats' use of procedural strategies across learning, although their use of allocentric strategies did increase across days. The allocentric strategies that older animals favored tended to be less accurate than those favored by young rats. To investigate the tendency to switch strategies between trials, the entropy of strategy transition matrices was calculated. Young rats exhibited lower entropy between trials, which reflects the fact that they tended to converge onto a restricted set of allocentric strategies by Day 4. Old rats, on the other hand, had higher entropy, reflecting the fact that they continued to interleave procedural and allocentric strategies throughout training. These results align with human literature that hypothesizes that aging shifts the balance of strategy selection from allocentric hippocampus-dependent circuits to procedural extra-hippocampal circuits.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 4,023 patients with CeAD, 534 (13.3%) had CeADid. In comparison to patients with CeADed, those with CeADid more often had clinical overt stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) at presentation, acute infarcts on imaging, a vertebral artery affected, and severe stenosis of the involved vessel (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001 for all). In contrast, carotid involvement and complete occlusions were more frequent in patients with CeADed (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001 for both). CeADid was associated with a shift in the distribution of scores on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) toward worse functional outcome (odds ratio [OR] = 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.62–0.92) but the odds for favorable outcomes (mRS = 0–2) did not differ between the groups after appropriate adjustments on multivariate analysis. CeADid was independently associated with higher mortality at 180 days on multivariate analysis (adjusted OR = 2.84, 95% CI = 1.50–5.38).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>CeADid is associated with more severe clinical presentation, a shift toward less favorable outcomes, and higher mortality rates. These findings suggest that CeADid may represent a high-risk type of CeAD. ANN NEUROL 2026</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) can drastically impair one's ability to work and interferes with activities of daily living. We recently demonstrated that, in rodents, conditioning electrical stimulation (CES) delivered to the nerve 7 days prior to surgery imparts a conditioning lesion-like effect by accelerating the rate of regeneration along the entire length of the nerve. The goal of this study is to test the hypothesis that CES could accelerate nerve regeneration and improve function in patients with moderate or severe CTS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Using a double-blind randomized controlled study design, patients received surgery + CES or surgery + sham stimulation. They were evaluated at regular intervals for 12 months following intervention. Primary outcome was motor unit number estimation (MUNE), supplemented with secondary outcomes including motor and sensory nerve conduction studies, Semmes Weinstein Monofilaments, and Moberg Pick-Up Test.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Sixty-four participants were randomized to either the treatment or control groups. There was no significant demographic or physiological difference at baseline between the groups. No major adverse event was found with treatment. Following intervention, there was significantly greater increase in MUNE of 62 ± 71 in the treatment group compared to 25 ± 66 in the controls after 12 months. In the treatment group, there was correspondingly better physiological and functional recovery and hand dexterity compared with the controls.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>CES is a safe, feasible, and efficacious treatment to improve nerve reinnervation and functional outcomes in patients with moderate or severe CTS. This may open future possibilities for more effective treatment for other peripheral nerve injuries. ANN NEUROL 2026</p>

                Rural tourism remains underexplored compared to urban and luxury destinations, yet it offers significant potential for sustainable development. Travel influencers, through digital storytelling and endorsements, are increasingly shaping tourist perceptions and reducing uncertainties about homestays. This study examines the impact of influencer endorsements on homestay intentions, utilizing the Theory of Planned Behavior as a guiding framework. Data from 216 urban tourists in Northern and Central India were analyzed with structural equation modeling. Findings reveal that rural image perception is the strongest predictor of homestay intentions, while subjective norms play a weaker but significant role. Influencer endorsements affect behaviour indirectly by enhancing destination image rather than exerting direct persuasion. The study advances the Theory of Planned Behavior by demonstrating the primacy of cognitive evaluations over normative pressures in the context of rural tourism. Practical implications underscore the need for destination marketers and homestay operators to utilize authentic storytelling and image-building strategies to effectively promote rural tourism.

                Abstract* Background Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) serves as a rescue therapy for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), yet data from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) remain limited. During the COVID-19 pandemic, several new ECMO centers were established to address rising demand. This study reports and analyzes the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19–associated ARDS who received ECMO support at a newly established high-volume ECMO center in Indonesia. Methods This single-center retrospective cohort study included all adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 and severe ARDS who underwent ECMO between July 24, 2020, and August 26, 2021. Outcomes evaluated included mortality, ICU length of stay, ECMO duration, and complications. Statistical analyses were conducted using R Studio version 4.2.1. Results Among 26 patients who received ECMO (25 veno-venous [VV] and 1 veno-arterial [VA]), the in-hospital mortality rate was 65.4%, and the 90-day mortality rate reached 69.2%. Non-survivors were more likely to present with hypoalbuminemia (82.4%) and septic shock (58.8%) at ECMO initiation. Mortality was significantly associated with a longer interval from symptom onset to ECMO cannulation (OR 1.36; 95% CI 1.01–1.84; p=0.04), occurrence of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) during ECMO (OR 19.20; 95% CI 1.88–>100; p=0.01), and shorter duration from ECMO initiation to death or discharge (OR 0.82; 95% CI 0.69–0.99; p=0.04). No significant differences were found in pre-ECMO mechanical ventilation duration, ECMO support duration, or ICU length of stay between survivors and non-survivors. Conclusions Survival in COVID-19–associated ARDS patients receiving ECMO is influenced by timing of intervention and the occurrence of complications such as MODS. Delayed initiation of ECMO after symptom onset and sepsis-related complications were associated with increased mortality. Optimizing early identification, infection control, and resource allocation, along with ongoing clinical training, are essential to improving outcomes in ECMO centers within resource-limited settings.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1271/v2?src=rss">Learning Science Beyond Sight: Conceptual Engagement of Elementary School Students with Visual Impairment through Hands-On Activities [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background A pressing challenge in science education is that visually impaired students continue to lack access to appropriate instructional media, making it difficult for them to engage with abstract concepts and resulting in limited opportunities for equitable education. Responding to this challenge, the present study investigates the design and implementation of hands-on, multisensory instructional strategies aimed at improving conceptual understanding of magnetism among elementary students with visual impairments. Method The research involved four elementary school students with varying degrees of visual acuity. Employing the ADDIE (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation) framework, the research was divided into 3 stages: needs analysis (A) using explanatory case study, design and develop (DD) instructional media and validate using Aiken’s V, implement and evaluate (IE) the media into classroom activity using evaluative case study. Result The findings indicate that tactile models, auditory explanations, and adapted activity kits significantly improved students’ engagement and comprehension of key magnetism concepts such as magnetic properties, forces, and polarity. Through an evaluative case study, the research demonstrates that instructional materials tailored to the sensory and cognitive profiles of visually impaired learners not only foster deeper conceptual understanding but also promote greater participation and confidence in science learning. Conclusions Multisensory science kits help students access abstract science material so that it can be felt and helps achieve conceptual understanding. Moreover, the results may inform teachers, curriculum designers, and science education professionals on how to design and adapt science content in ways that are both accessible and pedagogically sound.

                Background Cement-based materials deteriorate significantly when exposed to high temperatures due to extensive microcracking, increased porosity, and dehydration of hydration products, all of which lower the materials’ mechanical performance and post-fire stability. This makes thermally robust mortar essential for protective applications in fire-prone areas as well as structural restoration. Method The goal of this study is to assess how the amount of polypropylene (PP) fiber in cement mortar affects its mechanical behavior, thermal resistance, and residual performance at temperatures as high as 600°C. Prior to and following exposure to increased temperatures of 200, 400, and 600°C, mortar mixes containing 0%, 0.5%, 1.0%, and 1.5% PP fibers by volume were made and tested for workability, density, compressive strength, flexural strength, and flexural toughness. Results The results show that increasing PP fiber content decreases workability. PP fibers significantly improved high-temperature performance. At 600°C, the control mix retained only 19% of its compressive strength, while the 0.5% PP mix retained 33%. Flexural strength increased by 26–44% at ambient temperature for 0.5–1.0% PP fiber content, and at 600°C, PP mixes preserved up to 8% more flexural strength than the control. Toughness improved substantially, with the 1.5% PP mix showing nearly 10-time higher residual toughness than the control at 600°C. Conclusions In conclusion, the incorporation of 0.5-1.0% polypropylene fibers provides a balanced enhancement in thermal resistance, residual strength and ductility, confirming its effectiveness in producing mortar with superior structural integrity after exposed to high temperatures.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-29/v1?src=rss">Protocol for Conducting a Scoping Review on The Impact of Non-academic Activities on Medical Students' Achievement [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Medical education is intellectually demanding and emotionally taxing. Students must maintain academic excellence, acquire professional competence, and manage stress. Traditionally, academic success has been attributed to cognitive ability and classroom performance. However, growing evidence shows that extracurricular or non-academic activities such as research, leadership, athletics, volunteering, and peer teaching positively influence student learning and development. Participation in these activities fosters transferable skills such as time management, teamwork, communication, and resilience, which are vital for both academic success and clinical practice. Moreover, structured extracurricular involvement can protect against burnout, enhance motivation, and strengthen a sense of belonging, all of which are known to support learning outcomes. Despite increasing interest, existing studies remain fragmented and often focus on single activity types or well-being outcomes rather than direct academic achievement. This scoping review aims to map and synthesize the available evidence on how extracurricular participation relates to academic performance among medical students. Findings will clarify the educational value of such activities, identify gaps in the literature, and guide institutional policy and support strategies.

                This essay compares how Ngugi wa Thiong’o and Abdulrazak Gurnah, two leading East African writers, represent postcolonial identity and historical trauma through fiction. It examines their contrasting approaches to literary resistance: Ngugi embraces radical language politics and collective cultural reclamation, while Gurnah employs narrative ambiguity, exile experiences, and linguistic hybridity. The analysis reveals how intergenerational trauma operates in their works, with memory functioning as a morally charged force shaping identity and narrative authority. Despite their differences, Ngugi prioritizing political clarity and revolutionary consciousness, Gurnah exploring subtle psychological details and narrative dissonance, both authors demonstrate literature’s ethical power to contest historical erasure and reimagine postcolonial futures with compassion and complexity.

                Objectives To evaluate the effect of diode laser therapy on bleeding control and soft tissue healing after tooth extraction in patients with controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods Six patients with type 2 diabetes requiring dental extractions were included. Medical histories were reviewed, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels confirmed glycemic control, and panoramic radiographs ruled out periapical pathology. Extractions were performed under local anesthesia. Postoperatively, LLLT was applied using an 808-nm diode laser at 0.3 J energy output for 60 seconds to occlusal, vestibular, and lingual/palatal surfaces. A placebo laser application was performed in control sites. Results Diode laser therapy resulted in a reduction in both the amount and duration of postoperative bleeding, attributed to enhanced clot stability. Improved soft tissue healing was observed in laser-treated sites compared with placebo-treated sites. Conclusions LLLT using an 808-nm diode laser appears to promote hemostasis and accelerate soft tissue healing following dental extraction in patients with type 2 diabetes. These findings suggest a potential role for diode laser therapy as an adjunctive treatment in managing diabetic patients undergoing dental surgery.
