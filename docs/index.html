              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05394">A state-space framework for causal detection of hippocampal ripple-replay events</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.05394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hippocampal ripple-replay events are typically identified using a two-step process that at each time point uses past and future data to determine whether an event is occurring. This prevents researchers from identifying these events in real time for closed-loop experiments. It also prevents the identification of periods of nonlocal representation that are not accompanied by large changes in the spectral content of the local field potentials (LFPs). In this work, we present a new state-space model framework that is able to detect concurrent changes in the rhythmic structure of LFPs with nonlocal activity in place cells to identify ripple-replay events in a causal manner. The model combines latent factors related to neural oscillations, represented space, and switches between coding properties to explain simultaneously the spiking activity from multiple units and the rhythmic content of LFPs recorded from multiple sources. The model is temporally causal, meaning that estimates of the switching state can be made at each instant using only past information from the spike and LFP signals, or can be combined with future data to refine those estimates. We applied this model framework to simulated and real hippocampal data to demonstrate its performance in identifying ripple-replay events.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05493">Multi-Site rs-fMRI Domain Alignment for Autism Spectrum Disorder Auxiliary Diagnosis Based on Hyperbolic Space</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.05493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the medical field, most resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data are collected from multiple hospital sites. Multi-site rs-fMRI data can increase the volume of training data, enabling auxiliary diagnostic algorithms for brain diseases to learn more accurate and stable models. However, due to the significant heterogeneity and domain shift in rs-fMRI data across different sites, the accuracy of auxiliary diagnosis remains unsatisfactory. Moreover, there has been limited exploration of multi-source domain adaptation algorithms, and the interpretability of models is often poor. To address these challenges, we proposed a domain-adaptive algorithm based on hyperbolic space embedding. Hyperbolic space is naturally suited for representing the topology of complex networks such as brain functional networks. Therefore, we embedded the brain functional network into hyperbolic space and constructed the corresponding hyperbolic space community network to effectively extract brain network representations. To address the heterogeneity of data across different sites and the issue of domain shift, we introduce a constraint loss function, HMMD (Hyperbolic Maximum Mean Discrepancy), to align the marginal distributions in the hyperbolic space. Additionally, we employ class prototype alignment to align the conditional distributions. This significantly improves the quality of brain representations and enhances diagnostic classification accuracy for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm is robust to multi-site heterogeneity and shows promising potential for brain network mechanism analysis.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05680">Spaces and sequences in the hippocampus: a homological perspective</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.05680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological techniques have become a popular tool for studying information flows in neural networks. In particular, simplicial homology theory is used to analyze how cognitive representations of space emerge from large conglomerates of independent neuronal contributions. Meanwhile, a growing number of studies suggest that many cognitive functions are sustained by serial patterns of activity. Here, we investigate stashes of such patterns using path homology theory--an impartial, universal approach that does not require a priori assumptions about the sequences' nature, functionality, underlying mechanisms, or other contexts. We focus on the hippocampus -- a key enabler of learning and memory in mammalian brains -- and quantify the ordinal arrangement of its activity similarly to how its topology has previously been studied in terms of simplicial homologies. The results reveal that the vast majority of sequences produced during spatial navigation are structurally equivalent to one another. Only a few classes of distinct sequences form an ordinal schema of serial activity that remains stable as the pool of sequences consolidates. Importantly, the structure of both maps is upheld by combinations of short sequences, suggesting that brief activity motifs dominate physiological computations. This ordinal organization emerges and stabilizes on timescales characteristic of spatial learning, displaying similar dynamics. Yet, the ordinal maps generally do not reflect topological affinities -- spatial and sequential analyses address qualitatively different aspects of spike flows, representing two complementary formats of information processing.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05814">Topological Time Frequency Analysis of Functional Brain Signals</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.05814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel topological framework for analyzing functional brain signals using time-frequency analysis. By integrating persistent homology with time-frequency representations, we capture multi-scale topological features that characterize the dynamic behavior of brain activity. This approach identifies 0D (connected components) and 1D (loops) topological structures in the signal's time-frequency domain, enabling robust extraction of features invariant to noise and temporal misalignments. The proposed method is demonstrated on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, showcasing its ability to discern critical topological patterns and provide insights into functional connectivity. This topological approach opens new avenues for analyzing complex brain signals, offering potential applications in neuroscience and clinical diagnostics.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06057">Neurophysiological correlates to the human brain complexity through $q$-statistical analysis of electroencephalogram</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.06057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prospects of assessing neural complexity (NC) by $q$-statistics of the systemic organization of different types and levels of brain activity were studied. In 70 adult subjects, NC was assessed via the parameter $q$ of $q$-statistics, applied to the ongoing and EEG and its spectral power of 20 scalp points (channels). The NC were estimated both globally for all channels (AllCh) and locally (for each single channel) in different Functional States (FSs). The values of $q$ was compared among FSs and single channels, as well they were correlated with the power of $\theta$ (4-8Hz), $\beta_1$ (15-25Hz) and others EEG bands, in each FS. The value of $q$ across all FSs was higher for AllCh than for the single channels FSs. Consistently with previous studies, we found a negative correlation between NC and age. The FSs did not influence the $q$ of the EEG in AllCh, although locally the FS modulated $q$ in a consistent manner (e.g., reducing $q$ in posterior sites with eyes closed). The $q$ was correlated positively with the power of the $\theta$ and negatively with that of the $\beta_1$ band in general. These findings support the idea that, as a first approach, $q$-statistics can describe the human NC. The relationship between $q$ and $\theta$ power aligns with greater NC during FSs such as listening music and resting with eyes open, which is consistent with high-order representations rather than low-informative attentional tasks (OddBall).

                arXiv:2502.06320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterozygous mutations in KMT2B are associated with an early-onset, progressive, and often complex dystonia (DYT28). Key characteristics of typical disease include focal motor features at disease presentation, evolving through a caudocranial pattern into generalized dystonia, with prominent oromandibular, laryngeal, and cervical involvement. Although KMT2B-related disease is emerging as one of the most common causes of early-onset genetic dystonia, much remains to be understood about the full spectrum of the disease. We describe a cohort of 53 patients with KMT2B mutations, with detailed delineation of their clinical phenotype and molecular genetic features. We report new disease presentations, including atypical patterns of dystonia evolution and a subgroup of patients with a non-dystonic neurodevelopmental phenotype. In addition to the previously reported systemic features, our study has identified co-morbidities, including the risk of status dystonicus, intrauterine growth retardation, and endocrinopathies. Analysis of this study cohort (n = 53) in tandem with published cases (n = 80) revealed that patients with chromosomal deletions and protein-truncating variants had a significantly higher burden of systemic disease (with earlier onset of dystonia) than those with missense variants. Eighteen individuals had detailed longitudinal data available after insertion of deep brain stimulation for medically refractory dystonia. Median age at deep brain stimulation was 11.5 years (range: 4.5 to 37.0 years). Follow-up after deep brain stimulation ranged from 0.25 to 22 years. Significant improvement of motor function and disability (as assessed by the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scales, BFMDRS-M and BFMDRS-D) was evident at 6 months, 1 year, and last follow-up (motor, P = 0.001, P = 0.004, and P = 0.012; disability, P = 0.009, P = 0.002, and P = 0.012).

                arXiv:2402.01605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nervous system reorganizes memories from an early site to a late site, a commonly observed feature of learning and memory systems known as systems consolidation. Previous work has suggested learning rules by which consolidation may occur. Here, we provide conditions under which such rules are guaranteed to lead to stable convergence of learning and consolidation. We use the theory of Lyapunov functions, which enforces stability by requiring learning rules to decrease an energy-like (Lyapunov) function. We present the theory in the context of a simple circuit architecture motivated by classic models of learning in systems consolidation mediated by the cerebellum. Stability is only guaranteed if the learning rate in the late stage is not faster than the learning rate in the early stage. Further, the slower the learning rate at the late stage, the larger the perturbation the system can tolerate with a guarantee of stability. We provide intuition for this result by mapping the consolidation model to a damped driven oscillator system, and showing that the ratio of early- to late-stage learning rates in the consolidation model can be directly identified with the (square of the) oscillator's damping ratio. This work suggests the power of the Lyapunov approach to provide constraints on nervous system function.

                arXiv:2402.18489v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measuring transient functional connectivity is an important challenge in Electroencephalogram (EEG) research. Here, the rich potential for insightful, discriminative information of brain activity offered by high temporal resolution is confounded by the inherent noise of the medium and the spurious nature of correlations computed over short temporal windows. We propose a novel methodology to overcome these problems called Filter Average Short-Term (FAST) functional connectivity. First, long-term, stable, functional connectivity is averaged across an entire study cohort for a given pair of Visual Short Term Memory (VSTM) tasks. The resulting average connectivity matrix, containing information on the strongest general connections for the tasks, is used as a filter to analyse the transient high temporal resolution functional connectivity of individual subjects. In simulations, we show that this method accurately discriminates differences in noisy Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) between two conditions where standard connectivity and other comparable methods fail. We then apply this to analyse activity related to visual short-term memory binding deficits in two cohorts of familial and sporadic Alzheimer's disease. Reproducible significant differences were found in the binding task with no significant difference in the shape task in the P300 ERP range. This allows new sensitive measurements of transient functional connectivity, which can be implemented to obtain results of clinical significance.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12124">Optimal Visual Search with Highly Heuristic Decision Rules</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.12124v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual search is a fundamental natural task for humans and other animals. We investigated the decision processes humans use in covert (single-fixation) search with briefly presented displays having well-separated potential target locations. Performance was compared with the Bayesian-optimal decision process under the assumption that the information from the different potential target locations is statistically independent. Surprisingly, humans performed slightly better than optimal, despite humans' substantial loss of sensitivity in the fovea (foveal neglect), and the implausibility of the human brain replicating the optimal computations. We show that three factors can quantitatively explain these seemingly paradoxical results. Most importantly, simple and fixed heuristic decision rules reach near optimal search performance. Secondly, foveal neglect primarily affects only the central potential target location. Finally, spatially correlated neural noise can cause search performance to exceed that predicted for independent noise. These findings have broad implications for understanding visual search tasks and other identification tasks in humans and other animals.

Abstract: Epilepsy surgery, particularly for temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), remains a vital treatment option for patients with drug-resistant seizures. However, accurately predicting surgical outcomes remains a significant challenge. This study introduces a novel biomarker derived from brain connectivity changes caused by TLE surgery, analyzed using hyperbolic graph embeddings, to predict surgical success. Using structural and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from 51 patients, we examined differences in structural connectivity networks associated to surgical outcomes. Our approach uniquely leveraged hyperbolic disk embeddings of pre- and post-surgery brain networks, successfully distinguishing patients with favorable outcomes from those with poor outcomes. Notably, the method identified regions in the contralateral hemisphere relative to the epileptogenic zone, whose connectivity patterns emerged as a potential biomarker for favorable surgical outcomes. To validate the model, we employed a leave-one-out cross-validation approach, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.86 and a balanced accuracy of 0.81. These results underscore the predictive capability of our model and its effectiveness in individual outcome forecasting based on structural network changes. Our findings highlight the use of non-Euclidean hyperbolic graph embeddings to analyze brain networks, offering deeper insights into connectivity alterations in epilepsy, and advancing personalized prediction of surgical outcomes in TLE.

Abstract: Although neuron models have been well-studied for their rich dynamics and biological properties, limited research has been done on the complex geometries that emerge from the basins of attraction and basin boundaries of multistable neuron systems. In this paper, we investigate the geometrical properties of the strange attractors, four-dimensional basins, and fractal basin boundaries of an asymmetrically electrically coupled system of two identical non-chaotic Rulkov neurons. We discover a quasi-multistability in the system emerging from the existence of a chaotic spiking-bursting pseudo-attractor, and we classify and quantify the system's basins of attraction, which are found to have complex fractal geometries. Using the method of uncertainty exponents, we also find that the system exhibits extreme final state sensitivity, which results in a dynamical uncertainty that could have important applications in neurobiology.

                arXiv:2501.11409v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional echo state networks (ESNs) require supervised learning to train the readout layer, using the desired outputs as training data. In this study, we focus on input reconstruction (IR), which refers to training the readout layer to reproduce the input time series in its output. We reformulate the learning algorithm of the ESN readout layer to perform IR using unsupervised learning (UL). By conducting theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, we demonstrate that IR in ESNs can be effectively implemented under realistic conditions without explicitly using the desired outputs as training data; in this way, UL is enabled. Furthermore, we demonstrate that applications relying on IR, such as dynamical system replication and noise filtering, can be reformulated within the UL framework. Our findings establish a theoretically sound and universally applicable IR formulation, along with its related tasks in ESNs. This work paves the way for novel predictions and highlights unresolved theoretical challenges in ESNs, particularly in the context of time-series processing methods and computational models of the brain.

Abstract: Statistical-physics calculations in machine learning and theoretical neuroscience often involve lengthy derivations that obscure physical interpretation. We present concise, non-replica derivations of key results and highlight their underlying similarities. Using a cavity approach, we analyze high-dimensional learning problems: perceptron classification of points and manifolds, and kernel ridge regression. These problems share a common structure--a bipartite system of interacting feature and datum variables--enabling a unified analysis. For perceptron-capacity problems, we identify a symmetry that allows derivation of correct capacities through a na\"ive method.

                arXiv:2502.05594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This dissertation addresses the growing challenge of air traffic flow management by proposing a simulation-based optimization (SbO) approach for multi-objective runway operations scheduling. The goal is to optimize airport capacity utilization while minimizing delays, fuel consumption, and environmental impacts. Given the NP-Hard complexity of the problem, traditional analytical methods often rely on oversimplifications and fail to account for real-world uncertainties, limiting their practical applicability. The proposed SbO framework integrates a discrete-event simulation model to handle stochastic conditions and a hybrid Tabu-Scatter Search algorithm to identify Pareto-optimal solutions, explicitly incorporating uncertainty and fairness among aircraft as key objectives. Computational experiments using real-world data from a major U.S. airport demonstrate the approach's effectiveness and tractability, outperforming traditional methods such as First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) and deterministic approaches while maintaining schedule fairness. The algorithm's ability to generate trade-off solutions between competing objectives makes it a promising decision support tool for air traffic controllers managing complex runway operations.

                arXiv:2502.05824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as the potential aerial base stations (BSs) to improve terrestrial communications. However, the limited onboard energy and antenna power of a UAV restrict its communication range and transmission capability. To address these limitations, this work employs collaborative beamforming through a UAV-enabled virtual antenna array to improve transmission performance from the UAV to terrestrial mobile users, under interference from non-associated BSs and dynamic channel conditions. Specifically, we introduce a memory-based random walk model to more accurately depict the mobility patterns of terrestrial mobile users. Following this, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) focused on maximizing the transmission rate while minimizing the flight energy consumption of the UAV swarm. Given the NP-hard nature of the formulated MOP and the highly dynamic environment, we transform this problem into a multi-objective Markov decision process and propose an improved evolutionary multi-objective reinforcement learning algorithm. Specifically, this algorithm introduces an evolutionary learning approach to obtain the approximate Pareto set for the formulated MOP. Moreover, the algorithm incorporates a long short-term memory network and hyper-sphere-based task selection method to discern the movement patterns of terrestrial mobile users and improve the diversity of the obtained Pareto set. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively generates a diverse range of non-dominated policies and outperforms existing methods. Additional simulations demonstrate the scalability and robustness of the proposed CB-based method under different system parameters and various unexpected circumstances.

                arXiv:2502.06585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quality-Diversity (QD) has demonstrated potential in discovering collections of diverse solutions to optimisation problems. Originally designed for deterministic environments, QD has been extended to noisy, stochastic, or uncertain domains through various Uncertain-QD (UQD) methods. However, the large number of UQD methods, each with unique constraints, makes selecting the most suitable one challenging. To remedy this situation, we present two contributions: first, the Extract-QD Framework (EQD Framework), and second, Extract-ME (EME), a new method derived from it. The EQD Framework unifies existing approaches within a modular view, and facilitates developing novel methods by interchanging modules. We use it to derive EME, a novel method that consistently outperforms or matches the best existing methods on standard benchmarks, while previous methods show varying performance. In a second experiment, we show how our EQD Framework can be used to augment existing QD algorithms and in particular the well-established Policy-Gradient-Assisted-MAP-Elites method, and demonstrate improved performance in uncertain domains at no additional evaluation cost. For any new uncertain task, our contributions now provide EME as a reliable "first guess" method, and the EQD Framework as a tool for developing task-specific approaches. Together, these contributions aim to lower the cost of adopting UQD insights in QD applications.

                arXiv:2502.05509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As machine learning models become integral to security-sensitive applications, concerns over data leakage from adversarial attacks continue to rise. Model Inversion (MI) attacks pose a significant privacy threat by enabling adversaries to reconstruct training data from model outputs. While MI attacks on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have been widely studied, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) remain largely unexplored in this context. Due to their event-driven and discrete computations, SNNs introduce fundamental differences in information processing that may offer inherent resistance to such attacks. A critical yet underexplored aspect of this threat lies in black-box settings, where attackers operate through queries without direct access to model parameters or gradients-representing a more realistic adversarial scenario in deployed systems. This work presents the first study of black-box MI attacks on SNNs. We adapt a generative adversarial MI framework to the spiking domain by incorporating rate-based encoding for input transformation and decoding mechanisms for output interpretation. Our results show that SNNs exhibit significantly greater resistance to MI attacks than ANNs, as demonstrated by degraded reconstructions, increased instability in attack convergence, and overall reduced attack effectiveness across multiple evaluation metrics. Further analysis suggests that the discrete and temporally distributed nature of SNN decision boundaries disrupts surrogate modeling, limiting the attacker's ability to approximate the target model.

                arXiv:2502.05668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the implicit bias of constant step stochastic subgradient descent (SGD). We consider the setting of binary classification with homogeneous neural networks - a large class of deep neural networks with ReLU-type activation functions such as MLPs and CNNs without biases. We interpret the dynamics of normalized SGD iterates as an Euler-like discretization of a conservative field flow that is naturally associated to the normalized classification margin. Owing to this interpretation, we show that normalized SGD iterates converge to the set of critical points of the normalized margin at late-stage training (i.e., assuming that the data is correctly classified with positive normalized margin). Up to our knowledge, this is the first extension of the analysis of Lyu and Li (2020) on the discrete dynamics of gradient descent to the nonsmooth and stochastic setting. Our main result applies to binary classification with exponential or logistic losses. We additionally discuss extensions to more general settings.

                arXiv:2502.05672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article provides a rigorous analysis of convergence and stability of Episodic Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning, Goal-Conditioned Supervised Learning and Online Decision Transformers. These algorithms performed competitively across various benchmarks, from games to robotic tasks, but their theoretical understanding is limited to specific environmental conditions. This work initiates a theoretical foundation for algorithms that build on the broad paradigm of approaching reinforcement learning through supervised learning or sequence modeling. At the core of this investigation lies the analysis of conditions on the underlying environment, under which the algorithms can identify optimal solutions. We also assess whether emerging solutions remain stable in situations where the environment is subject to tiny levels of noise. Specifically, we study the continuity and asymptotic convergence of command-conditioned policies, values and the goal-reaching objective depending on the transition kernel of the underlying Markov Decision Process. We demonstrate that near-optimal behavior is achieved if the transition kernel is located in a sufficiently small neighborhood of a deterministic kernel. The mentioned quantities are continuous (with respect to a specific topology) at deterministic kernels, both asymptotically and after a finite number of learning cycles. The developed methods allow us to present the first explicit estimates on the convergence and stability of policies and values in terms of the underlying transition kernels. On the theoretical side we introduce a number of new concepts to reinforcement learning, like working in segment spaces, studying continuity in quotient topologies and the application of the fixed-point theory of dynamical systems. The theoretical study is accompanied by a detailed investigation of example environments and numerical experiments.

Abstract: Point spread function (PSF) engineering has been pivotal in the remarkable progress made in high-resolution imaging in the last decades. However, the diversity in PSF structures attainable through existing engineering methods is limited. Here, we report universal PSF engineering, demonstrating a method to synthesize an arbitrary set of spatially varying 3D PSFs between the input and output volumes of a spatially incoherent diffractive processor composed of cascaded transmissive surfaces. We rigorously analyze the PSF engineering capabilities of such diffractive processors within the diffraction limit of light and provide numerical demonstrations of unique imaging capabilities, such as snapshot 3D multispectral imaging without involving any spectral filters, axial scanning or digital reconstruction steps, which is enabled by the spatial and spectral engineering of 3D PSFs. Our framework and analysis would be important for future advancements in computational imaging, sensing and diffractive processing of 3D optical information.

Abstract: Physics-guided machine learning (PGML) has become a prevalent approach in studying scientific systems due to its ability to integrate scientific theories for enhancing machine learning (ML) models. However, most PGML approaches are tailored to isolated and relatively simple tasks, which limits their applicability to complex systems involving multiple interacting processes and numerous influencing features. In this paper, we propose a \textit{\textbf{P}hysics-\textbf{G}uided \textbf{F}oundation \textbf{M}odel (\textbf{PGFM})} that combines pre-trained ML models and physics-based models and leverages their complementary strengths to improve the modeling of multiple coupled processes. To effectively conduct pre-training, we construct a simulated environmental system that encompasses a wide range of influencing features and various simulated variables generated by physics-based models. The model is pre-trained in this system to adaptively select important feature interactions guided by multi-task objectives. We then fine-tune the model for each specific task using true observations, while maintaining consistency with established physical theories, such as the principles of mass and energy conservation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this methodology in modeling water temperature and dissolved oxygen dynamics in real-world lakes. The proposed PGFM is also broadly applicable to a range of scientific fields where physics-based models are being used.

Abstract: In this paper, we experiment with novelty-based variants of OpenAI-ES, the NS-ES and NSR-ES algorithms, and evaluate their effectiveness in training complex, transformer-based architectures designed for the problem of reinforcement learning such as Decision Transformers. We also test if we can accelerate the novelty-based training of these larger models by seeding the training by a pretrained models. By this, we build on our previous work, where we tested the ability of evolution strategies - specifically the aforementioned OpenAI-ES - to train the Decision Transformer architecture. The results were mixed. NS-ES showed progress, but it would clearly need many more iterations for it to yield interesting results. NSR-ES, on the other hand, proved quite capable of being straightforwardly used on larger models, since its performance appears as similar between the feed-forward model and Decision Transformer, as it was for the OpenAI-ES in our previous work.

Abstract: We study the application of a neural network architecture for identifying charged particle trajectories via unsupervised learning of delays and synaptic weights using a spike-time-dependent plasticity rule. In the considered model, the neurons receive time-encoded information on the position of particle hits in a tracking detector for a particle collider, modeled according to the geometry of the Compact Muon Solenoid Phase II detector. We show how a spiking neural network is capable of successfully identifying in a completely unsupervised way the signal left by charged particles in the presence of conspicuous noise from accidental or combinatorial hits. These results open the way to applications of neuromorphic computing to particle tracking, motivating further studies into its potential for real-time, low-power particle tracking in future high-energy physics experiments.

                arXiv:2402.15589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the most important yet onerous tasks in the academic peer-reviewing process is composing meta-reviews, which involves assimilating diverse opinions from multiple expert peers, formulating one's self-judgment as a senior expert, and then summarizing all these perspectives into a concise holistic overview to make an overall recommendation. This process is time-consuming and can be compromised by human factors like fatigue, inconsistency, missing tiny details, etc. Given the latest major developments in Large Language Models (LLMs), it is very compelling to rigorously study whether LLMs can help metareviewers perform this important task better. In this paper, we perform a case study with three popular LLMs, i.e., GPT-3.5, LLaMA2, and PaLM2, to assist meta-reviewers in better comprehending multiple experts perspectives by generating a controlled multi-perspective summary (MPS) of their opinions. To achieve this, we prompt three LLMs with different types/levels of prompts based on the recently proposed TELeR taxonomy. Finally, we perform a detailed qualitative study of the MPSs generated by the LLMs and report our findings.

                arXiv:2411.10958v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although quantization for linear layers has been widely used, its application to accelerate the attention process remains limited. To further enhance the efficiency of attention computation compared to SageAttention while maintaining precision, we propose SageAttention2, which utilizes significantly faster 4-bit matrix multiplication (Matmul) alongside additional precision-enhancing techniques. First, we propose to quantize matrices $(Q, K)$ to INT4 in a hardware-friendly thread-level granularity and quantize matrices $(\widetilde P, V)$ to FP8. Second, we propose a method to smooth $Q$, enhancing the accuracy of INT4 $QK^\top$. Third, we propose a two-level accumulation strategy for $\widetilde PV$ to enhance the accuracy of FP8 $\widetilde PV$. The operations per second (OPS) of SageAttention2 surpass FlashAttention2 and xformers by about 3x and 4.5x on RTX4090, respectively. Moreover, SageAttention2 matches the speed of FlashAttention3(fp8) on the Hopper GPUs, while delivering much higher accuracy. Comprehensive experiments confirm that our approach incurs negligible end-to-end metrics loss across diverse models, including those for language, image, and video generation. The code is available at https://github.com/thu-ml/SageAttention.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, particularly with the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) built on the transformer architecture, has redefined the capabilities of natural language processing. These models now exhibit remarkable performance across various language-related tasks, such as text generation, question answering, translation, and summarization, often rivaling human-like comprehension. More intriguingly, LLMs have demonstrated emergent abilities extending beyond their core functions, showing proficiency in tasks like commonsense reasoning, code generation, and arithmetic. This survey paper explores the foundational components, scaling mechanisms, and architectural strategies that drive these capabilities. Emphasizing models like GPT and LLaMA, we analyze the impact of exponential data and computational growth on LLM performance, while also addressing the trade-offs associated with scaling. We also examine LLM applications across sectors, such as healthcare, finance, education, and law, highlighting their adaptability and potential to solve domain-specific challenges. Central to this work are the questions of how LLMs generalize across diverse tasks, exhibit planning, and reasoning abilities, and whether these emergent abilities can be systematically elicited or enhanced. In particular, we provide some insights into the CoT (Chain of Thought) and PoT (Plan of Thought) abilities within LLMs, focusing on how pre-training data influences their emergence. Additionally, we investigate LLM-modulo frameworks that integrate external systems, allowing LLMs to handle complex, dynamic tasks. By analyzing these factors, this paper aims to foster the ongoing discussion on the capabilities and limits of LLMs, promoting their responsible development and application in novel and increasingly complex environments.

                arXiv:2501.18280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The security issue of large language models (LLMs) has gained significant attention recently, with various defense mechanisms developed to prevent harmful outputs, among which safeguards based on text embedding models serve as a fundamental defense. Through testing, we discover that the distribution of text embedding model outputs is significantly biased with a large mean. Inspired by this observation, we propose novel efficient methods to search for universal magic words that can attack text embedding models. The universal magic words as suffixes can move the embedding of any text towards the bias direction, therefore manipulate the similarity of any text pair and mislead safeguards. By appending magic words to user prompts and requiring LLMs to end answers with magic words, attackers can jailbreak the safeguard. To eradicate this security risk, we also propose defense mechanisms against such attacks, which can correct the biased distribution of text embeddings in a train-free manner.

	<p>Objectives: This research investigated the impact of transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) on sense of agency (SoA) when focusing on cortical regions like the cerebellum, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and the angular gyrus (AG). To this aim, three experiments were carried out, and agency was assessed through the Wundt Clock Paradigm, which provides a measure of intentional binding. Methods: The first experiment provided offline cathodal stimulation applied to the right cerebellum, with the return electrode placed on the left DLPFC, and participants were randomly assigned to either the placebo group or the active group. The second experiment adopted the same montage as the previous one, but the online stimulation was provided in a within-subjects design. Results: Since none of these studies targeting the cerebellum produced significant results on the agency measures, we carried out a third experiment aimed to replicate the study by Khalighinejad and Haggard (2005), who provided inhibitory stimulation of the left AG. However, this also showed no modulations of SoA. Conclusions: Several explanations could be given for these negative results. For example, the inter-individual variability, task complexity, and limitations of tDCS technology may contribute to the inconsistencies of the results. Also, the failure to replicate a previous study raises the issue of the replicability crisis in psychology. Nevertheless, this study may represent an important reference for research aimed at modulating SoA through the neuromodulation of brain areas included in the agency network. Future studies could benefit from assessing individual cognitive abilities supporting agency, optimizing stimulation protocols, and exploring alternative brain stimulation techniques to obtain significant results.</p>

                Biopesticides are pest control products derived from natural sources such as microbes, macro-organisms (insects and pathogens), plant extracts, and certain minerals. Many biopesticides are considered environmentally safe and can complement or substitute conventional chemical pesticides. They can also be highly specific or broad spectrum with a unique mode of action controlling a wide range of pest species. Due to their target-specificity and low to no environmental residuality, biopesticides conform to the 3 pillars of Climate-Smart Agriculture, the Sustainable Development Goals, and, ultimately, the Paris Agreement. This review focuses largely on microbial biopesticides derived from fungi, bacteria, viruses, and nematodes. It discusses (i) the various microbial biopesticide formulations, (ii) the mode of microbial biopesticide action, (iii) the factors that affect the potential efficacy of biopesticides, (iv) challenges to the adoption of microbial biopesticides, and (v) the role of microbial biopesticides in Integrated Pest Management programs. Finally, advancements in application techniques, as well as future research directions and gaps, are highlighted.

                <p>High-frequency stimulation (HFS)-induced long&ndash;term potentiation (LTP) is generally regarded as a homosynaptic Hebbian-type LTP, where synaptic changes are thought to occur at the synapses that project from the stimulation site and terminate onto the neurons at the recording site. In this study, we first investigated HFS-induced LTP on urethane-anesthetized rats and found that cortical HFS enhances neural responses at the recording site through the strengthening of local connectivity with nearby neurons at the stimulation site rather than through synaptic strengthening at the recording site. This enhanced local connectivity at the stimulation site leads to increased output propagation, resulting in signal potentiation at the recording site. Additionally, we discovered that HFS can also nonspecifically strengthen distant afferent synapses at the HFS site, thereby expanding its impact beyond local neural connections. This form of plasticity exhibits a neo-Hebbian characteristic as it exclusively manifests in the presence of cholecystokinin release, induced by HFS. The cortical HFS-induced local LTP was further supported by a behavioral task, providing additional evidence. Our results unveil a previously overlooked mechanism underlying cortical plasticity: synaptic plasticity is more likely to occur around the soma site of strongly activated cortical neurons rather than solely at their projection terminals.</p>

                <p>Inner speech refers to the silent production of language in one&rsquo;s mind. As a purely mental action without obvious physical manifestations, inner speech has been notoriously difficult to quantify. To address this issue, the present study repurposed the phenomenon of speaking-induced suppression, wherein overt speech has been consistently shown to elicit reduced auditory evoked potentials compared with externally generated speech, as well as changes in oscillatory activity in gamma and theta frequency bands. Given the functional similarities between inner and overt speech, we used an established experimental protocol to investigate whether similar metrics could be used to distinguish the content of inner speech. Healthy participants (<I>n</I> = 129) produced an inner syllable at a precisely specified time. An audible syllable was concurrently presented which either matched or mismatched the content of the inner syllable. The results revealed that Match and Mismatch conditions could be differentiated on the basis of their evoked oscillations in the gamma, theta, and alpha bands. Notably, there was a gamma-band oscillation in the vicinity of the P2 that differed between the Match and Mismatch conditions, suggesting that "late" gamma-band activity may index consciously perceived expectancy violations, or cognitive prediction errors. Regarding the auditory evoked potentials, the N1 component was suppressed in the Match condition while the P2 component was suppressed in the Mismatch condition, replicating previous findings. This study provides support for the existence of "inner speaking-induced suppression", and demonstrates that inner syllables can be differentiated based on their influence on the electroencephalographic activity elicited by simultaneously-presented audible syllables.</p>

                <p>Extended performance of cognitively demanding tasks induces cognitive fatigue manifested with an overall deterioration of behavioral performance. In particular, long practice with tasks requiring impulse control is typically followed by a decrease in self-control efficiency, leading to performance instability. Here, we show that this is due to changes in activation modalities of key task-related areas occurring if these areas previously underwent intensive use. We investigated in 25 healthy adults the effects of extended practice with high cognitive demand (HCD) tasks on a Go-No Go task and the underlying electroencephalographic (EEG) activity. We compared these effects with those induced by practice with similar, but low cognitive demand (LCD) tasks. HCD tasks were followed by an increase in response inhibition failures. These were correlated with the appearance of a distinct neural signature on fast response trials, characterized by lower levels of beta ([13&ndash;30] Hz) EEG activity in the prestimulus period, and by a lack of EEG markers of preresponse processing in frontal areas. Moreover, HCD tasks were followed by a decrease in N200 during correct withholds while LCD tasks were followed instead by a lesser fraction of hits and a decrease in P300, suggesting a decrease in engagement. Overall, these results show that exertion of cognitive control determines the appearance of two distinct modalities of response with different processing speeds, associated with distinct underlying neural activity.</p>

                Objective To estimate the prevalence of organophosphate (OP) poisoning in Nepal. Methods PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC), Cochrane Library, Ovid, and Springer databases were searched. The search strategies were used in different databases until December 13, 2024. The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal checklist was used to assess the quality of the included studies. The R project was used to estimate the pooled prevalence rate and 95% confidence interval (CI) based on the results of the heterogeneity test. Results Eleven studies, involving 4809 participants. Heterogeneity indicated a P value of <0.100; therefore, we applied the random effects model for data synthesis. The overall prevalence of OP poisoning in Nepal was 36.7% (95% CI: 24.99-49.34) in Nepal. Funnel plot dots were not distributed symmetrically on either side of the central line, suggesting a potential publication bias. The results of the heterogeneity analysis revealed that hospital-based studies showed a higher prevalence rate of 36.9% (95% CI: 24.2-50.6) than community-based studies. Additionally, studies conducted in Other cities-based demonstrated a pooled prevalence rate of 43.38% (95% CI: 28.95-58.39), which was higher than that in Kathmandu-based studies. Conclusion The overall prevalence of OP poisoning was 36.7% in Nepal. The hospital-based studies indicated a higher pooled prevalence than community-based studies and other cities-based studies reported a higher prevalence than Kathmandu-based studies. Future research is warranted to provide more accurate and comprehensive evidence regarding the prevalence of OP poisoning in Nepal.

                Background This study investigates the connection between aggregate markups and income inequality, exploring how market power affects inequality in developed, emerging, and developing economies. The analysis aims to reveal how institutional differences and economic systems shape this relationship. Method The study examines data from 12 countries from 1997 to 2016 using a panel data approach. The analysis focuses on key variables such as the Gini index (measuring inequality), lagged markups, trade openness, GDP per capita, tax revenue, poverty, and R&D expenditure. A two-way fixed-effects model is applied to account for country and year-specific differences, while robust standard errors ensure reliability. Results The results show that higher markups are closely linked to greater income inequality, with the impact being particularly pronounced in emerging and developing economies. Integrating tax policies, trade openness, and GDP growth into the analysis indicates the limitations of relying solely on economic growth to achieve equity. The research highlights taxation and trade as effective levers for mitigating inequality and raises important questions about the role of innovation in this dynamic. Conclusion This study shows the interaction between market power and inequality across diverse economic systems. We examine how factors like market concentration and institutional quality drive inequality provides practical insights and policy recommendations for effectively addressing income disparities.

                Background Dengue infection during pregnancy increases the risk of maternal and neonatal complications; therefore, the objective of this research is to determine these outcomes and describe the clinical manifestations of the infection. Methods A systematic review of studies published in PubMed, MEDLINE, LILACS, Web of Science, Scopus and thesis repositories published between 2013 and October 2023 was performed. DeCS and MeSH dengue and maternal-neonatal outcome were used. Thirteen studies were selected and the New Castle-Ottawa scale was used to assess their quality. Mantel-Haenszel hazard ratios were calculated to report the overall effect size using random-effects models. All analyses were performed in Rev Man 5.4.1 Results The 13 studies involved a population of 18,724 pregnant women, with cohorts ranging from 25 to 17,673 pregnant women. The most frequent outcomes in the pregnant women were cesarean section and postpartum hemorrhage, and in the newborns, preterm delivery and low birth weight. According to the New Castle-Ottawa scale, six studies were considered low risk and seven studies moderate risk. Dengue is a risk factor for postpartum hemorrhage (OR: 2.23 IC 0.24 – 20.38), premature rupture of membranes (OR: 1.04 IC 0.55-1.97) and cesarean section (OR: 1.39 IC 0.80 – 2.41). It could not be concluded that dengue is a risk factor for the neonatal outcomes studied. The clinical picture of pregnant women with dengue was predominantly fever, abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea, anemia, dyspnea and myalgia. Conclusions Pregnancy-related changes in the immune, cardiovascular and coagulation systems, among others, increase the probability of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes in case of DENV infection, such as postpartum hemorrhage, premature rupture of membranes, cesarean section, low birth weight and preterm delivery. Pregnant women should be considered a population at risk and should be included in dengue control, diagnosis and treatment policies.

                Background In this paper, we introduce the concept of H-implicative almost distributive lattices, which are a special class of lattices with both implicative and almost distributive properties. This study is aimed at extending the understanding of lattice structures and their ideals, particularly focusing on LI-ideals, a novel concept within H-implicative almost distributive lattices. Methods We define an LI-ideal of an implicative almost distributive lattice L and investigate its properties. The paper demonstrates that every LI-ideal in L is an almost distributive lattice ideal of L. Additionally, we explore the relationship between filters and LI-ideals, and we study the process of generating an LI-ideal from a given set. Lastly, we examine the construction of quotient structures via LI-ideals. Results We present several examples showing that every almost distributive lattice ideal is also an LI-ideal in an H-implicative almost distributive lattice. The study establishes key relationships between the concepts of filters and LI-ideals. Furthermore, we provide a method for generating an LI-ideal from a set and construct a quotient structure using an LI-ideal. Conclusions The paper introduces new concepts and relationships within the study of H-implicative almost distributive lattices. Our findings demonstrate the interconnection between almost distributive lattice ideals and LI-ideals and offer insights into how these ideals can be generated and used to construct quotient structures. This work provides a deeper understanding of lattice theory and opens new avenues for further research in the area of lattice ideals.

                Background & Purpose Falls and balance issues are significant concerns for the elderly. Treadmill training is increasingly recognized as a potential intervention to improve balance and reduce fall risk in this population. This systematic review evaluates the effectiveness of treadmill training on balance in the elderly. Methods A comprehensive search was conducted in databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus, PEDro, Cochrane Library, and ERIC from January 1, 1980, to January 1, 2025. The search focused on treadmill training’s impact on balance in older adults. From 74 identified studies, primary outcome measure was “Balance Improvement, risk of fall” and secondary were “Cognitive Function and Quality of Life,” and others. Articles were excluded for reasons like irrelevance to treadmill training, language barriers, or duplication, resulting in 16 final studies. Results Treadmill training demonstrated positive effects on balance and fall risk reduction, particularly in elderly individuals with Parkinson’s disease, spinal cord injuries, and age-related balance issues. Perturbation-based treadmill training significantly reduced fall rates, while underwater treadmill sessions improved mobility and cognitive function. Conclusion Treadmill training interventions are promising for improving balance and mobility in the elderly, including those with Parkinson’s disease, spinal cord injuries, and age-related balance issues. While these interventions show potential, further research is needed to determine optimal protocols, durations, and combinations with other interventions. This could lead to a more comprehensive approach for addressing balance and mobility challenges in the elderly, promoting healthy aging and reducing fall risks.

                Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) has been a well-known therapy since years ago, especially for renal stones less than 20 mm. This study compared the effectiveness of totally ultrasound-guided (US-guided) and fluoroscopy-guided (FS-guided) SWL in treating renal and ureteral stones. A protocol has been registered in PROSPERO databases for systematic reviews. A systematic literature search was conducted in five online databases (PubMed, ScienceDirect, EMBASE, ProQuest, and Scopus). We included all available articles that compared the effectiveness and safety of US-SWL to FS-SWL. A risk of bias assessment was done using Risk of Bias (Rob) Tools for randomized interventional studies and Risk of bias in non-randomized studies interventions (ROBINS-I) Tools for Non-randomized studies. The primary outcome was the stone-free rate, and the secondary outcome was the complication rate. Subgroup analyses were performed for adult and pediatric groups. A comprehensive literature search identified seven comparative articles that matched the criteria: two randomized trials and six retrospective cohort studies comprising 1,255 patients (609 using US-SWL). The results revealed a significant difference in overall stone-free rates between US-guided and FS-guided SWL RR 0.76(95% CI; 0.61-0.95, p=0.02) and in adults RR 0.76(95% CI; 0.60-0.96), but not children groups RR 0.68(95% CI; 0.24-1.88). US-SWL might be favourable due to the radiation-free procedure and real-time presentation. Complication rates were low, and no life-threatening complications were reported. In conclusion, US-guided SWL is more effective than FS-guided SWL for treating renal stones, with a low incidence of complications. Further randomized controlled trials with larger populations are needed to explore the comparison more accurately.

                Background of the study The influence of macroeconomic indicators makes it important to study the relationship between macroeconomic indicators and stock market return. On further analysis it can be observed that different sectors respond differently to change in the macroeconomic indicator that is important for investors, researchers and policy makers. Methods The autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model is applied to study influence of macroeconomic indicators on sectoral return of NSE from April 2012 to August 2024. Results Findings of the study show that macroeconomic indicators influence sectoral return in the short run as well as long run and the influence is differential. The analysis of long run relationship shows that Foreign Institutional Investment (FII) significantly affects all the sectoral indices except IT. Index of industrial production (IIP) have significant relationship with Auto, IT, Media, Metal and Pharma. Money supply (MS) significantly affects Bank, FMCG and IT in the long run. Wholesale Price Index (WPI) has significant relationship with Auto, FMCG and Media in the long run. Economic Policy Uncertainty Index (EPU) affects Auto, FMCG and Pharma in the long run. Crude oil price (COP) has significant effect only on Media in the long run. Exchange rate (ER) does not have significant effect on any of the sectoral index. Conclusion In the long run FII, IIP, EPU, MS and WIP are major determinants of stock market return. In the short run FII, ER and COP are major determinants of stock market return.

                <p>by Subhadip Biswas, Davit A Potoyan</p>

Many eukaryotic proteins and RNAs contain low-complexity domains (LCDs) with a strong propensity for binding and driving phase separation into biomolecular condensates. Mutations in LCDs frequently disrupt condensate dynamics, resulting in pathological transitions to solid-like states. Understanding how the molecular sequence grammar of LCDs governs condensate dynamics is essential for uncovering their biological functions and the evolutionary forces that shape these sequences. To this end, we present an energy landscape framework that operates on a continuous ‘stickiness’ energy scale rather than relying on an explicit alphabet-based sequence. Sequences are characterized by Wasserstein distance relative to thoroughly shuffled or random counterparts. Armed with an energy landscape framework, map diagrams of material and dynamical properties governed by key energy landscape features modulated by the degree of complexity in LCD arrangements, including the periodicity and local disorder in LCDs. Highly periodic LCD patterns promote elasticity-dominated behavior, while random sequences exhibit viscosity-dominated properties. Our results reveal that minimum sticker periodicity is crucial for maintaining fluidity in condensates, thereby avoiding transitions to glassy or solid-like states. Moreover, we demonstrate that the energy landscape framework explains the recent experimental findings on prion domains and predicts systematic alterations in condensate viscoelasticity. Our work provides a unifying perspective on the sequence-encoded material properties whereby key features of energy landscapes are conserved while sequences are variable.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012811">Computational mechanism underlying switching of motor actions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Shan Zhong, Nader Pouratian, Vassilios Christopoulos</p>

Survival of species in an ever-changing environment requires a flexibility that extends beyond merely selecting the most appropriate actions. It also involves readiness to stop or switch actions in response to environmental changes. Although considerable research has been devoted to understanding how the brain switches actions, the computations underlying the switching process and how it relates to the selecting and stopping processes remain elusive. A normative theory suggests that switching is simply an extension of the stopping process, during which a current action is first inhibited by an independent pause mechanism before a new action is generated. This theory was challenged by the affordance competition hypothesis, according to which the switching process is implemented through a competition between the current and new actions, without engaging an independent pause mechanism. To delineate the computations underlying these action regulation functions, we utilized a neurocomputational theory that models the process of selecting, stopping and switching reaching movements. We tested the model predictions in healthy individuals who performed reaches in dynamic and uncertain environments that often required stopping and switching actions. Our findings suggest that unlike the stopping process, switching does not necessitate a proactive pause mechanism to delay movement initiation. Hence, the switching and stopping processes seem to be implemented by different mechanisms at the planning phase of the reaching movement. However, once the reaching movement has been initiated, the switching process seems to involve an independent pause mechanism if the new target location is unknown prior to movement initiation. These findings offer a new understanding of the computations underlying action switching, contribute valuable insights into the fundamental neuroscientific mechanisms of action regulation, and open new avenues for future neurophysiological investigations.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012286">Mapping the learning curves of deep learning networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yanru Jiang, Rick Dale</p>

There is an important challenge in systematically interpreting the internal representations of deep neural networks (DNNs). Existing techniques are often less effective for non-tabular tasks, or they primarily focus on qualitative, ad-hoc interpretations of models. In response, this study introduces a cognitive science-inspired, multi-dimensional quantification and visualization approach that captures two temporal dimensions of model learning: the “information-processing trajectory” and the “developmental trajectory.” The former represents the influence of incoming signals on an agent’s decision-making, while the latter conceptualizes the gradual improvement in an agent’s performance throughout its lifespan. Tracking the learning curves of DNNs enables researchers to explicitly identify the model appropriateness of a given task, examine the properties of the underlying input signals, and assess the model’s alignment (or lack thereof) with human learning experiences. To illustrate this method, we conducted 750 runs of simulations on two temporal tasks: gesture detection and sentence classification, showcasing its applicability across different types of deep learning tasks. Using four descriptive metrics to quantify the mapped learning curves—<i>start</i>, <i>end - start</i>, <i>max</i>, <i>tmax</i>—, we identified significant differences in learning patterns based on data sources and class distinctions (all <i>p’s</i>  <  .0001), the prominent role of spatial semantics in gesture learning, and larger information gains in language learning. We highlight three key insights gained from mapping learning curves: <i>non-monotonic progress</i>, <i>pairwise comparisons</i>, and <i>domain distinctions</i>. We reflect on the theoretical implications of this method for cognitive processing, language models and representations from multiple modalities.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003002">vmTracking enables highly accurate multi-animal pose tracking in crowded environments</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Hirotsugu Azechi, Susumu Takahashi</p>

In multi-animal tracking, addressing occlusion and crowding is crucial for accurate behavioral analysis. However, in situations where occlusion and crowding generate complex interactions, achieving accurate pose tracking remains challenging. Therefore, we introduced virtual marker tracking (vmTracking), which uses virtual markers for individual identification. Virtual markers are labels derived from conventional markerless multi-animal tracking tools, such as multi-animal DeepLabCut (maDLC) and Social LEAP Estimate Animal Poses (SLEAP). Unlike physical markers, virtual markers exist only within the video and attribute features to individuals, enabling consistent identification throughout the entire video while keeping the animals markerless in reality. Using these markers as cues, annotations were applied to multi-animal videos, and tracking was conducted with single-animal DeepLabCut (saDLC) and SLEAP’s single-animal method. vmTracking minimized manual corrections and annotation frames needed for training, efficiently tackling occlusion and crowding. Experiments tracking multiple mice, fish, and human dancers confirmed vmTracking’s variability and applicability. These findings could enhance the precision and reliability of tracking methods used in the analysis of complex naturalistic and social behaviors in animals, providing a simpler yet more effective solution.

                Background After the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic which spread to 213 countries in 2020, Indonesia ranked 20th for morbidity with a mortality rate of 2.3%, higher than the global rate of 1.1%. In response, Indonesia issued a policy mandating mask use. This study aims to investigate the association between risk perception, sociodemographic factors, and knowledge of COVID-19, with consistent mask-wearing outside the home. Methods It was an online study conducted from November 2020 to February 2021, during the first wave of COVID-19. Participants were provided written informed consent prior if agree/reject to completing participate the questionnaire study voluntarily. A total of 1153 respondents were selected. The dependent variable was consistent mask-wearing outside the home, while the independent variables were risk perception regarding COVID-19, sociodemographic factors (location, age, gender, education, occupation, family income, family members, social health scheme), and knowledge of COVID-19. Data were analyzed by logistic regression analysis. Results The risk perception of COVID-19 as a viral disease that can cause death aOR: 2.502 was positively associated with consistent mask-wearing outside the home. Regarding sociodemographic factor, individuals age between 25 to 44 years aOR: 0.486. While, knowledge of the need to change cloth masks every 4-6 hours aOR: 1.686; the transmission aOR: 1.974, the severe symptoms of COVID-19 aOR: 1.981; and of the confirmed diagnosis by PCR aOR: 2.238 were positively associated with consistent mask-wearing outside the home. Conclusions The risk perception of potential fatality COVID-19 and knowledge of proper time to change cloth mask, the transmission, the severe symptom, and the confirmation of COVID-19 testing were positively associated with mask-wearing outside the home. While, age between 25 to 44 years was negatively associated. These findings underscore the importance of targeted public health interventions that address risk perception and enhance knowledge to promote mask use as effective COVID-19 prevention measures.

                Aim The aim of this study was to differentiate clinically suspected cases of leiomyoma and adenomyosis using 2d grey scale ultrasound with doppler.P Methods and materials 60 patients with a history of abnormal uterine bleeding (aub) and clinically suspected cases of uterine leiomyoma and adenomyosis were subjected to ultrasound. These patients underwent either myomectomy or total abdominal hysterectomy and the specimens were sent for histopathology. The data collected was analysed using statistical tools and sensitivity and specificity analysis was conducted to estimate the accuracy of ultrasound in differentiating leiomyoma and adenomyosis. Results Out of total of 60 patients 41 were diagnosed clinically as Leiomyoma, of which USG detected 36 cases to be Leiomyoma, leaving 5 cases unconfirmed. 19 patients were diagnosed clinically as Adenomyosis and USG detected 15 cases as Adenomyosis, leaving 4 cases unconfirmed. Out of 41 cases detected clinically as leiomyoma 37 were confirmed by histopathology. Out of 19 cases clinically diagnosed as adenomyosis 15 cases were confirmed by histopathology as adenomyosis. Conclusion The study revealed that USG findings for both Leiomyoma and Adenomyosis had a very strong correlation with histopathology with a P value of less than 0.001 which is statistically significant. These findings could be useful in clinical practice for differentiating between these two conditions, thereby facilitating better management and treatment of the patients.

                Background Ethiopia’s potato seed system is currently hindered by a disjointed regulatory framework, insufficient quality assurance processes, and a lack of collaboration among stakeholders, which collectively impede agricultural productivity and food security. The regulatory environment is characterized by inconsistent seed certification practices and a dependence on informal seed sources, negatively affecting the quality of potato seeds available to farmers. Although potatoes play a crucial role in global food security by providing high yields compared to other staple crops, the sector grapples with significant challenges due to bureaucratic inefficiencies, limited technical expertise, and the widespread presence of counterfeit seeds throughout the value chain. Methods To tackle these challenges, this mini-review outlines potential improvements, stressing the necessity for a unified regulatory framework tailored to the unique issues of vegetatively propagated crops. For this reason, we have used different literature source from web of science, Pubmed, Google Scholar, ResearchGate and other scientific websites. We have documented the most relevant information focusing on potato seed system, regulatory frameworks, quality assurance bottlenecks and pathways for improvement across the seed value chain. Results our paper highlights key recommendations that includes enhancing training for regulatory staff, investing in research for disease-resistant varieties, and bolstering public-private partnerships to encourage innovation and resource sharing. Furthermore, improving traceability in the seed supply chain is essential for maintaining seed quality and integrity. Conclusions This review calls for a comprehensive strategy that fosters stakeholder engagement and promotes sustainable practices to rejuvenate Ethiopia’s potato seed system, thereby supporting the livelihoods of millions of smallholder farmers and strengthening national food security through integrated seed sector development and capacity improvement of the seed regulatory body as well as smallholder farmers.

                Objective Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a chemical compound that can control the amount of bleeding and is often used in spinal surgery. TXA can be used alone or in combination. The study compared the effects of the two administrations, single-use or combined-use, providing a basis for the optimal route of TXA application. Methods Intravenous injection of TXA or topical TXA was used in the experimental group, and combined TXA was used in the control group. A systematic literature search without language restrictions was conducted until November 10, 2023. Statistical analyses were performed using Revman 5.4. Results Four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and one retrospective cohort study (RCS) were included, involving 682 patients. There were no significant differences in postoperative blood loss (PBL), preoperative haemoglobin (Hb), postoperative Hb, postoperative D-dimer level, operative time, nor complications between the two groups. However, there were statistically significant differences in intraoperative blood loss (IBL), total blood loss (TBL), and preoperative D-dimer levels between the two groups. (IBL: MD=48.63, 95%CI (confidence interval) =[12.61, 84.65], P=0.008, I 2=88%; TBL: MD=140.95, 95%CI= [25.97, 255.93], P=0.02, I 2=75%； Preoperative D-dimmer: MD=-0.15, 95%CI=[-0.19, -0.11], P<0.00001, I 2=0%). Conclusion During spinal surgery, single use of TXA was no better than combined use of TXA in terms of IBL, TBL, and preoperative D-dimer levels. However, the meta-analysis suggests that more high-quality studies need to be included to further compare the results between the two groups to make recommendations for the optimal use of TXA.

                Despite the popularity of Christian schools in Japan, Christians account for only 1.6% of the nation’s population. In the attempt to explore this inconsistency, we conducted an online survey in January 2020 to those between the ages of 15 and 29 living in Tokyo and Kanagawa. Our subjects include those who have enrolled in Christian schools, those who have some sort of affiliation, and those who do not have affiliation. We attempted to measure the difference in attitude by the degree of their affiliation. We focused on the notion of 'triple faith' which was proposed by Inoue and others. Many people in Japan believe in both Buddhism and Shintoism because neither requires a rite such as baptism. Christianity requires baptism, but that aside, in practice, many Japanese have triple faith including Christianity. Prosperity of Christian schools, preferences towards Christmas, and popularity of Christian-style weddings, all testify to this. This argument by Inoue and others conflicts with the common belief that Christianity never got a foothold in Japan. The results of cross tabulation of key questions and affiliation with Christian schools, combined with our interview results, show that those who have enrolled in Christian schools are more likely to have what may be referred to as triple faith. We have also provided a discussion on the possible reasons behind this finding.

     alt="Klf10 Regulates the Emergence of Glial Phenotypes During Hypothalamic Development"/>
<p>KLF10, a CREB target, is integral to hypothalamic gliogenesis, ensuring proper glial phenotype emergence and maintenance in adulthood via regulating potential target genes. The <i>Klf10</i>-deficient mouse provides a model to study the impact of reduced astrocytes and microglia on hypothalamic homeostasis.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Glial cells play a pivotal role in the Central Nervous System (CNS), constituting most brain cells. Gliogenesis, crucial in CNS development, occurs after neurogenesis. In the hypothalamus, glial progenitors first generate oligodendrocytes and later astrocytes. However, the precise molecular mechanisms governing the emergence of glial lineages in the developing hypothalamus remain incompletely understood. This study reveals the pivotal role of the transcription factor KLF10 in regulating the emergence of both astrocyte and oligodendrocyte lineages during embryonic hypothalamic development. Through transcriptomic and bioinformatic analyses, we identified novel KLF10 putative target genes, which play important roles in the differentiation of neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. Notably, in the absence of KLF10, there is an increase in the oligodendrocyte population, while the astrocyte population decreases in the embryonic hypothalamus. Strikingly, this decline in the number of astrocytes persists into adulthood, indicating that the absence of KLF10 leads to an extended period of oligodendrocyte emergence while delaying the appearance of astrocytes. Our findings also unveil a novel signaling pathway for <i>Klf10</i> gene expression regulation. We demonstrate that <i>Klf10</i> is a target of CREB and that its expression is upregulated via the BDNF-p38-CREB pathway. Thus, we postulate that KLF10 is an integral part of the hypothalamic developmental program that ensures the correct timing for glial phenotypes' generation. Importantly, we propose that the <i>Klf10</i>
<sup>−/−</sup> mouse model represents a valuable tool for investigating the impact of reduced astrocyte and microglia populations in the homeostasis of the adult hypothalamus.</p>

     alt="Basal Forebrain Projections to the Retrosplenial and Cingulate Cortex in Rats"/>
<p>We investigated the basal forebrain (BF) cholinergic and non-cholinergic projections to the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) using two retrograde tracers, Fast Blue and Fluoro-Gold, and ChAT immunostaining in rats. Our results show that the RSC and ACC receive both spatially overlapping and differential projections from the BF, with the cholinergic and non-cholinergic projections varying between BF subregions and different rostrocaudal cortical regions.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The basal forebrain (BF) plays a crucial role in modulating cortical activation through its widespread projections across the cortical mantle. Previous anatomical studies have demonstrated that each cortical region receives a specific projection from the BF. In this study, we examined BF cholinergic and non-cholinergic projections to the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) using two retrograde tracers, Fast Blue (FB) and Fluoro-Gold (FG), in combination with choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunostaining in rats. The RSC and ACC receive cholinergic and non-cholinergic projections mainly from the medial part of the horizontal limb of the diagonal band (HDB) and the vertical limb of the diagonal band (VDB). The main difference of BF projections to the RSC, ACC, and prelimbic cortex (PL) is that the ACC and PL receive projections from the rostral half of the medial globus pallidus (GP), whereas the RSC receives stronger non-cholinergic projections from the VDB and medial septum (MS). As the injection site shifts from rostral (PL) to caudal (RSC) through the ACC, the strong GP and weak MS/VDB projections of non-cholinergic neurons are reversed. Cholinergic projection neurons make up a similar proportion of the total projection neurons in both ACC (37%) and RSC (33%) injections. Double retrograde tracer injections in the RSC and ACC revealed a small number of double-labeled projection neurons in the MS/VDB and HDB. These findings indicate that the ACC and RSC receive both spatially overlapping and differential projections from the BF, with the cholinergic and non-cholinergic projections varying between BF subregions and different rostrocaudal cortical regions.</p>

                Tau phosphorylation plays an essential role in regulating tau’s microtubule-stabilizing function, but its hyperphosphorylation drives tauopathies such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In a recent study, Kim and colleagues decipher that tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) phosphorylates tau at tyrosine 29, promoting its stabilization and aggregation by interfering with autophagic clearance, providing novel insights into tau pathology and potential therapeutic strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100197">Mediator kinase inhibition suppresses hyperactive interferon signaling in Down syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Hyperactive interferon (IFN) signaling is a hallmark of Down syndrome (DS), a condition caused by Trisomy 21 (T21); strategies that normalize IFN signaling could benefit this population. Mediator-associated kinases CDK8 and CDK19 drive inflammatory responses through incompletely understood mechanisms. Using sibling-matched cell lines with/without T21, we investigated Mediator kinase function in the context of hyperactive IFN in DS over a 75 min to 24 hr timeframe. Activation of IFN-response genes was suppressed in cells treated with the CDK8/CDK19 inhibitor cortistatin A (CA), via rapid suppression of IFN-responsive transcription factor (TF) activity. We also discovered that CDK8/CDK19 affect splicing, a novel means by which Mediator kinases control gene expression. To further probe Mediator kinase function, we completed cytokine screens and metabolomics experiments. Cytokines are master regulators of inflammatory responses; by screening 105 different cytokine proteins, we show that Mediator kinases help drive IFN-dependent cytokine responses at least in part through transcriptional regulation of cytokine genes and receptors. Metabolomics revealed that Mediator kinase inhibition altered core metabolic pathways in cell type-specific ways, and broad upregulation of anti-inflammatory lipid mediators occurred specifically in kinase-inhibited cells during hyperactive IFNγ signaling. A subset of these lipids (e.g. oleamide, desmosterol) serve as ligands for nuclear receptors PPAR and LXR, and activation of these receptors occurred specifically during hyperactive IFN signaling in CA-treated cells, revealing mechanistic links between Mediator kinases, lipid metabolism, and nuclear receptor function. Collectively, our results establish CDK8/CDK19 as context-specific metabolic regulators, and reveal that these kinases control gene expression not only via TFs, but also through metabolic changes and splicing. Moreover, we establish that Mediator kinase inhibition antagonizes IFN signaling through transcriptional, metabolic, and cytokine responses, with implications for DS and other chronic inflammatory conditions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102538">Flexibility in PAM recognition expands DNA targeting in xCas9</a></h4>

              
                xCas9 is an evolved variant of the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing system, engineered to improve specificity and reduce undesired off-target effects. How xCas9 expands the DNA targeting capability of Cas9 by recognising a series of alternative protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequences while ignoring others is unknown. Here, we elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying xCas9’s expanded PAM recognition and provide critical insights for expanding DNA targeting. We demonstrate that while wild-type Cas9 enforces stringent guanine selection through the rigidity of its interacting arginine dyad, xCas9 introduces flexibility in R1335, enabling selective recognition of specific PAM sequences. This increased flexibility confers a pronounced entropic preference, which also improves recognition of the canonical TGG PAM. Furthermore, xCas9 enhances DNA binding to alternative PAM sequences during the early evolution cycles, while favouring binding to the canonical PAM in the final evolution cycle. This dual functionality highlights how xCas9 broadens PAM recognition and underscores the importance of fine-tuning the flexibility of the PAM-interacting cleft as a key strategy for expanding the DNA targeting potential of CRISPR-Cas systems. These findings deepen our understanding of DNA recognition in xCas9 and may apply to other CRISPR-Cas systems with similar PAM recognition requirements.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92180">Maturation and detoxification of synphilin-1 inclusion bodies regulated by sphingolipids</a></h4>

              
                Due to proteostasis stress induced by aging or disease, misfolded proteins can form toxic intermediate species of aggregates and eventually mature into less toxic inclusion bodies (IBs). Here, using a yeast imaging-based screen, we identified 84 potential synphilin-1 (SY1) IB regulators and isolated the conserved sphingolipid metabolic components in the most enriched groups. Furthermore, we show that, in both yeast cells and mammalian cells, SY1 IBs are associated with mitochondria. Pharmacological inhibition of the sphingolipid metabolism pathway or knockout of its key genes results in a delayed IB maturation and increased SY1 cytotoxicity. We postulate that SY1 IB matures by association with the mitochondrion membrane, and that sphingolipids stimulate the maturation via their membrane-modulating function and thereby protecting cells from SY1 cytotoxicity. Our findings identify a conserved cellular component essential for IB maturation and suggest a mechanism by which cells may detoxify the pathogenic protein aggregates through forming mitochondrion-associated IBs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95398">Multimodal mismatch responses in mouse auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Our movements result in predictable sensory feedback that is often multimodal. Based on deviations between predictions and actual sensory input, primary sensory areas of cortex have been shown to compute sensorimotor prediction errors. How prediction errors in one sensory modality influence the computation of prediction errors in another modality is still unclear. To investigate multimodal prediction errors in mouse auditory cortex, we used a virtual environment to experimentally couple running to both self-generated auditory and visual feedback. Using two-photon microscopy, we first characterized responses of layer 2/3 (L2/3) neurons to sounds, visual stimuli, and running onsets and found responses to all three stimuli. Probing responses evoked by audiomotor (AM) mismatches, we found that they closely resemble visuomotor (VM) mismatch responses in visual cortex (V1). Finally, testing for cross modal influence on AM mismatch responses by coupling both sound amplitude and visual flow speed to the speed of running, we found that AM mismatch responses were amplified when paired with concurrent VM mismatches. Our results demonstrate that multimodal and non-hierarchical interactions shape prediction error responses in cortical L2/3.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98521">Decoding the physics of observed actions in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Recognizing goal-directed actions is a computationally challenging task, requiring not only the visual analysis of body movements, but also analysis of how these movements causally impact, and thereby induce a change in, those objects targeted by an action. We tested the hypothesis that the analysis of body movements and the effects they induce relies on distinct neural representations in superior and anterior inferior parietal lobe (SPL and aIPL). In four fMRI sessions, participants observed videos of actions (e.g. breaking stick, squashing plastic bottle) along with corresponding point-light-display (PLD) stick figures, pantomimes, and abstract animations of agent–object interactions (e.g. dividing or compressing a circle). Cross-decoding between actions and animations revealed that aIPL encodes abstract representations of action effect structures independent of motion and object identity. By contrast, cross-decoding between actions and PLDs revealed that SPL is disproportionally tuned to body movements independent of visible interactions with objects. Lateral occipitotemporal cortex (LOTC) was sensitive to both action effects and body movements. These results demonstrate that parietal cortex and LOTC are tuned to physical action features, such as how body parts move in space relative to each other and how body parts interact with objects to induce a change (e.g. in position or shape/configuration). The high level of abstraction revealed by cross-decoding suggests a general neural code supporting mechanical reasoning about how entities interact with, and have effects on, each other.

">Altered Functional Network Energy Across Multiscale Brain Networks in Preterm vs. Full-Term Subjects: Insights from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study</a></h4>

              
                Infants born premature, or preterm, can experience altered brain connectivity, due in part to incomplete brain development at the time of paturation. Research has also shown structural and functional differences in the brain that persist in these individuals as they enter adolescence when compared to peers who were fully mature at birth. In this study, we examined functional network energy across multiscale functional connectivity in approximately 4600 adolescents from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study who were either preterm or full term at birth. We identified three key brain networks that show significant differences in network energy between preterm and full-term subjects. These networks include the visual network (comprising the occipitotemporal and occipital subnetworks), the sensorimotor network, and the high cognitive network (including the temporoparietal and frontal subnetworks). Additionally, it was demonstrated that full-term subjects exhibit greater instability, leading to more dynamic reconfiguration of functional brain information and increased flexibility across the three identified canonical brain networks compared to preterm subjects. In contrast, those born prematurely show more stable networks but less dynamic and flexible organization of functional brain information within these key canonical networks. In summary, measuring multiscale functional network energy offered insights into the stability of canonical brain networks associated with subjects born prematurely. These findings enhance our understanding of how early birth impacts brain development.

">Sex Specific Attenuation of Reward Preference</a></h4>

              
                Estradiol receptor signaling has a sex-specific impact on the brain's reward pathways, enhancing cocaine reinforcement in females but not in males. Selective activation of G-Protein Coupled Estradiol Receptor 1 (GPER-1) in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) attenuates the reinforcing effects of 0.1% saccharin (SACC) and cocaine in males but not females. This study investigated GPER-1 activation in the DLS and systemically using the GPER-1 agonist, G1, to assess its effect on SACC and cocaine preference in male and female rats. Five experiments were conducted using gonad-intact and gonadectomized animals to determine dose-response effects and the influence of circulating hormones. Intra-DLS GPER-1 activation with 20% G1 selectively reduced SACC preference in intact males but not females, while higher and lower concentrations had no effect. Systemic G1 administration attenuated cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) in both sexes in a dose-dependent way. Interestingly, systemic administration of G1 did not alter SACC preference in either sex, regardless of the presence or absence of gonadal hormones. These findings suggest that GPER-1 activation influences reward processing in a site, reward, and sex-dependent manner.

">How Autism Impacts Children's Working Memory for Faces</a></h4>

              
                This study investigates how visual working memory (WM) functions in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) compared to typically developing (TD) children aged 7 to 12, focusing on their ability to remember faces. The primary goal was to understand the differences in visual WM performance between these two groups and identify the sources of memory recall errors. Findings indicate that children with ASD demonstrated significantly poorer visual WM compared to their TD counterparts, particularly in the precision of memory recall. Despite this difference, both groups exhibited similar rates of random guessing, suggesting that the challenges faced by children with ASD are more about accuracy than guessing strategy. This research sheds light on the specific deficits in visual WM associated with ASD, enhancing our understanding of the cognitive mechanisms at play and highlighting potential areas for targeted interventions to support these children.

">Rigid Control of Motor Unit Firing Rates in the Human Tibialis Anterior Muscle Persists during Neurofeedback</a></h4>

              
                The conventional framework of motor-unit (MU) control assumes that MUs in a MU pool are constrained by a fixed recruitment order and a common input. This rigid-control framework has been challenged by recent findings suggesting that MU activity could be flexibly modulated, potentially mediated by descending cortical inputs. In this study, rather than evaluating flexibility from the perspective of recruitment thresholds, we investigated control flexibility by assessing if human participants can voluntarily modulate MU firing rates beyond rigid-control constraints. Specifically, we examined whether participants could voluntarily modulate the firing rates of a pair of MUs from the tibialis anterior muscle during real-time feedback. Two tasks involving target-reach with different visual feedback derived from the MUs firing rates were conducted. In both tasks, there was no evidence that participants were able to change MU firing rates in a way that would violate rigid control robustly. Our findings demonstrate limited flexibility in MU control in human tibialis anterior muscle within single-session training, even when real-time MU activity feedback was provided. The results suggest that MU flexibility is not inherently present in the human lower limb.

">Calcium channel-coupled transcription factors facilitate direct nuclear signaling</a></h4>

              
                VGCCs play crucial roles within the CNS, in maintaining cell excitability, enabling activity-dependent neuronal development, and forming long-term memory by regulating Ca2+ influx. The intracellular carboxyl-terminal domains of VGCC 1 subunits help regulate VGCC function. Emerging evidence suggests that some VGCC C-termini have functions independent of channel gating and exist as stable proteins. Here, we demonstrate that all VGCC gene family members express bicistronic mRNA transcripts that produce functionally distinct C-terminal proteins (CTPs) in tandem with full-length VGCC 1 subunits. Two of these CTPs, 1CCT and 1ACT, cycle to and from the nucleus in a Ca2+- and calmodulin-dependent fashion. 1CCT, 1ACT, and 1HCT regulate chromatin accessibility and/or bind directly to genes, regulating gene networks involved in neuronal differentiation and synaptic function in a Ca2+-dependent manner. This study elucidates a conserved process of coordinated protein expression within the VGCC family, coupling the channel function with VGCC C-terminal transcription factors.

">3-D Reconstruction of Fingertip Deformation during Contact Initiation</a></h4>

              
                Dexterous manipulations rely on tactile feedback from the fingertips, which provides crucial information about contact events, object geometry, interaction forces, friction, and more. Accurately measuring skin deformations during tactile interactions can shed light on the mechanics behind such feedback. To address this, we developed a novel setup using 3-D digital image correlation (DIC) to both reconstruct the bulk deformation and local surface skin deformation of the fingertip under natural loading conditions. Here, we studied the local spatiotemporal evolution of the skin surface during contact initiation. We showed that, as soon as contact occurs, the skin surface deforms very rapidly and exhibits high compliance at low forces (<0.05 N). As loading and thus the contact area increases, a localized deformation front forms just ahead of the moving contact boundary. Consequently, substantial deformation extending beyond the contact interface was observed, with maximal amplitudes ranging from 5% to 10% at 5 N, close to the border of the contact. Furthermore, we found that friction influences the partial slip caused by these deformations during contact initiation, as previously suggested. Our setup provides a powerful tool to get new insights into the mechanics of touch and opens avenues for a deeper understanding of tactile afferent encoding.

">SEX-DEPENDENT MODULATION OF BEHAVIORAL ALLOCATION VIA VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA-NUCLEUS ACCUMBENS SHELL CIRCUITRY</a></h4>

              
                Diagnostic criteria for substance use disorder, cocaine type (i.e., cocaine use disorder), outlined in the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, imply that the disorder arises, at least in part, from the maladaptive allocation of behavior to drug use. To date, however, the neural circuits involved in the allocation of behavior have not been systematically evaluated. Herein, a chemogenetics approach (i.e., designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs)) was utilized in combination with a concurrent choice self-administration experimental paradigm to evaluate the role of the mesolimbic neurocircuit in the allocation of behavior. Pharmacological activation of hM3D(Gq) DREADDs in neurons projecting from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the nucleus accumbens (AcbSh) induced a sex-dependent shift in the allocation of behavior in rodents transduced with DREADDs. Specifically, male DREADDs animals exhibited a robust increase in responding for a natural (i.e., sucrose) reward following pharmacological activation of the VTA-AcbSh circuit; female DREADDs rodents, in sharp contrast, displayed a prominent decrease in drug-reinforced (i.e., cocaine) responding. The sequential activation of hM3D(Gq) and KORD DREADDs within the same neuronal population validated the role of the VTA-AcbSh circuit in reinforced responding for concurrently available natural and drug rewards. Collectively, the VTA-AcbSh circuit is fundamentally involved in behavioral allocation affording a key target for the development of novel pharmacotherapies.

">Self-supervised image restoration in coherent X-rayneuronal microscopy</a></h4>

              
                Coherent X-ray microscopy is emerging as a transformative technology for neuronal imaging, with the potential to offer a scalable solution for reconstruction of neural circuits in millimeter sized tissue volumes. Specifically, X-ray holographic nanotomography (XNH) brings together outstanding capabilities in terms of contrast, spatial resolution and data acquisition speed. While recent XNH developments already enabled generating valuable datasets for neurosciences, a major challenge for reconstruction of neural circuits remained overcoming resolving power limits to distinguish smaller neurites and synapses in the reconstructed volumes. Here we present a self-supervised image restoration approach that improves simultaneously spatial resolution, contrast, and data acquisition speed. This enables revealing synapses with XNH, marking a major milestone in the quest for generating connectomes of full mammalian brains. We demonstrate that this method is effective for various types of neuronal tissues and acquisition schemes. We propose a scalable implementation compatible with multi-terabyte image volumes. Altogether, this work brings large scale X-ray nanotomography to a new precision level.

">Feedback and feedforward control are differentially delayed in cerebellar ataxia</a></h4>

              
                Damage to the cerebellum can cause ataxia, a condition associated with impaired movement coordination. Typically, coordinated movement relies on a combination of anticipatory mechanisms (specifically, feedforward control) and corrective mechanisms (embodied by feedback control). Here, we show that in 3D reaching in VR, ataxia preserves the visuomotor feedforward and feedback control structure compared to the control group. However, the ataxia group exhibits a small increase in feedback delay (~20 ms) and a substantial increase in feedforward delay (~70 ms) together with a reduced feedback gain (~25% lower). Our results suggest that the feedforward and feedback pathways remain largely intact in ataxia, but that time delay deficits and temoral discoordination amongst these control pathways may contribute to the disorder. We also find that providing a preview---analogous to driving on a clear night and seeing the road ahead vs.~driving in the fog---improves tracking performance in the ataxia group, although the control group was significantly better able to exploit this preview information. Overall, our results indicate that the feedforward control and preview utilization are relatively well-preserved in individuals with cerebellar ataxia, and that preview could potentially be leveraged to enhance the feedforward performance of those with ataxia.

">Real-world visual search goes beyond eye movements: Active searchers select 3D scene viewpoints too</a></h4>

              
                Visual search is a ubiquitous task; people search for objects on a daily basis. However, the majority of the existing visual search literature focuses on passive search on a 2D computer screen, a far cry from emulating a real-world environment. Search is a real-world task that involves active observation. Search targets may be occluded, completely out of the observer's line of sight, or oriented in unconventional ways. This is typically mitigated by actively selecting viewpoints, an important aspect of search behaviour with limited scope on a computer screen. Our goal was to explore viewpoint selection in active visual search. Subject eye and head movements were tracked as they moved freely while searching for toy objects in a controlled 3-dimensional environment, yielding the first such record of search-driven viewpoint selection. We found that subjects utilized their full range of eye and head motion to move from viewpoint to viewpoint, apparently employing a variety of objectives including changing viewing height and pose depending on object 3D pose. Subjects were also adept at selecting unobstructed views to search through otherwise occluded areas with objects. Furthermore, subjects completed the search task with high accuracy, even with no training on the environment. Although no learning was found in terms of accuracy over the duration of the experiment, increases in efficiency were found for other metrics such as response time, number of fixations, and distance travelled, particularly in target present trials where the target was not visible from the starting location. These results paint the story of a visual system that selects and moves to useful and informative views to facilitate the successful execution of an active visual search task, and stresses the significance of active vision research in understanding how vision is used in naturalistic environments.

">Cell-generated mechanical forces play a role in epileptogenesis after injury</a></h4>

              
                Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with a significantly increased risk of epilepsy. One of the consequences of severe TBI is progressive brain atrophy, which is frequently characterized by organized tissue retraction. Retraction is an active process synchronized by mechanical interactions between surviving cells. This results in unbalanced mechanical forces acting on surviving neurons, potentially activating mechanotransduction and leading to hyperexcitability. This novel mechanism of epileptogenesis was examined in organotypic hippocampal cultures, which develop spontaneous seizure-like activity in vitro. Cell-generated forces in this model resulted in contraction of hippocampal tissue. Artificial imbalances in mechanical forces were introduced by placing cultured slices on surfaces with adhesive and non-adhesive regions. This modeled disbalance in mechanical forces that may occur in the brain after trauma. Portions of the slices that were not stabilized by substrate adhesion underwent increased contraction and compaction, revealing the presence of cell-generated forces capable of shaping tissue geometry. Changes in tissue geometry were followed by excitability changes that were specific to hippocampal sub-region and orientation of contractile forces relative to pyramidal cell apical-basal axis. Results of this study suggest that imbalanced cell-generated forces contribute to development of epilepsy, and that force imbalance may represent a novel mechanism of epileptogenesis after trauma.

">Brain bases for navigating acoustic features</a></h4>

              
                Whether physical navigation shares neural substrates with mental travel in other behaviourally relevant domains is debated. With respect to sound, pure tone working memory in humans elicits hippocampal as well as auditory cortical and inferior frontal activity, and rodent work suggests that hippocampal cells that usually track an animal's physical location can also map to tone frequency when task-relevant. We generated a sound dimension based on the density of random-frequency tones in a stack, resulting in a percept ranging from low- ("beepy") to high-density ("noisy"). We established that unlike tone frequency, which listeners automatically associate with vertical position, this density dimension elicited no consistent spatial mapping. During functional magnetic resonance imaging, human participants (both sexes) held in mind the density of a series of tone stacks and, after a short maintenance period, adjusted further stacks to match the target ("navigation"). Density was represented most strongly in bilateral non-primary auditory cortex, specifically bilateral planum polare. Encoding and maintenance activity in hippocampus, inferior frontal gyrus, planum polare and posterior cingulate was positively associated with subsequent navigation success. Bilateral inferior frontal gyrus and hippocampus were among regions with elevated activity during navigation, compared to a parity-judgment condition with closely matched acoustics and motor demands. Bilateral orbitofrontal cortex was more active when navigation was toward a target density than when participants adjusted density in a control condition with no particular target. We find that self-initiated travel along a non-spatial auditory dimension engages a brain system overlapping with that supporting physical navigation.

">Offset analgesia and onset hyperalgesia: A comparison between women with non-suicidal self-injury and healthy women</a></h4>

              
                Individuals who engage in non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) exhibit reduced pain sensitivity compared to the general population. It has been argued that this hypoalgesic characteristic may be attributable to hyper-effective pain modulation; however, empirical support for this theory remains inconsistent. The aim of the study was to use a combined offset analgesia (OA) and onset hyperalgesia (OH) protocol to investigate if women with NSSI have a propensity to inhibit nociceptive signals to a higher degree (stronger OA response) and facilitate nociceptive signals to a lesser degree (weaker OH response), compared to a control group. Data was collected from 76 women, 18-35 age (37 with NSSI and 39 healthy controls). The OA and OH protocol was combined with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The NSSI group displayed a weaker OH response, compared to the control group. This suggests that women with NSSI do not facilitate nociceptive signals to the same extent as healthy women. However, there were no significant differences between the groups regarding OA. Across all participants, we observed stronger activation in the primary sensory cortex during the OH condition, compared to the control condition. The results offer partial support for the general hypothesis that women with NSSI demonstrate enhanced pain modulation.

">Transcriptomic and spatial GABAergic neuron subtypes in zona incerta mediate distinct innate behaviors</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the anatomical connection and behaviors of transcriptomic neuron subtypes is critical to delineating cell type-specific functions in the brain. Here we integrated single-nucleus transcriptomic sequencing, in vivo circuit mapping, optogenetic and chemogenetic approaches to dissect the molecular identity and function of heterogeneous GABAergic neuron populations in the zona incerta (ZI) in mice, a region involved in modulating various behaviors. By microdissecting ZI for transcriptomic and spatial gene expression analyses, our results revealed two non-overlapping Ecel1- and Pde11a-expressing GABAergic neurons with dominant expression in the rostral and medial zona incerta (ZIrEcel1 and ZImPde11a), respectively. The GABAergic projection from ZIrEcel1 to periaqueductal gray mediates self-grooming, while the GABAergic projection from ZImPde11a to the oral part of pontine reticular formation promotes transition from sleep to wakefulness. Together, our results revealed the molecular markers, spatial organization and specific neuronal circuits of two discrete GABAergic projection neuron populations in segregated subregions of the ZI that mediate distinct innate behaviors, advancing our understanding of the functional organization of the brain.

">GsMTx-4 Reduces Mechanosensitivity in a Model of Schwannomatosis-related Pain</a></h4>

              
                Patients with schwannomatosis (SWN) develop multiple tumors along major peripheral nerves, with most experiencing significant pain, though each patient's symptoms are unique. Neuropathic, nociceptive, and inflammatory pain types have been reported, but many patients describe severe pain when a schwannoma is palpated or even lightly touched. Currently, the only effective treatment for pain relief is surgical removal. We are investigating the root causes of tumor-induced pain. In some cases, tumor growth increases pressure on nearby nerves, resulting in pain. Additionally, schwannoma cells in culture secrete proinflammatory cytokines into the surrounding medium. This conditioned medium (CM) sensitizes sensory neurons to painful stimuli both in vitro and in vivo. When injected into the glabrous skin of a mouse hindpaw, CM from painful schwannomas increases neuron sensitivity to light touch, as demonstrated by a fourfold reduction in paw withdrawal threshold (measured using the Von Frey assay) one hour post-injection (p = 0.006), with effects persisting for 24 hours (p = 0.002).We hypothesize that this increase in sensitivity is linked to mechanosensitive ion channels (MSCs), which detect pressure and stretch. These channels can be blocked by the peptide GsMTx-4. This peptide penetrates deeper into cell membranes under mechanical pressure to block MSCs from opening without affecting other ion channels. When co-injected with CM into the mouse hindpaw, 10 M GsMTx-4 prevents heightened sensitivity to light touch. Moreover, GsMTx-4 can reverse hyperalgesia, restoring withdrawal thresholds to baseline levels. Thus, local injection of GsMTx-4 near painful tumors presents a promising, minimally invasive therapeutic approach for SWN patients.

">Impact of Aging on Theta-Phase Gamma-Amplitude Coupling During Learning: A Multivariate Analysis</a></h4>

              
                Aging is associated with cognitive decline and memory impairment, but the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) between mid-frontal theta (5 Hz) and occipital gamma (>30 Hz) oscillations is a proposed marker for parallel storage of multiple items in working memory. However, research has mainly focused on young individuals and epilepsy patients, with only a few studies on aging populations. Moreover, these studies have relied on univariate PAC methods, which can be flawed by potential spurious or biased PAC estimates due to non-stationarity of EEG signals. Additionally, these methods typically assess PAC at the level of individual electrodes, potentially overlooking the broader functional significance of theta-gamma coupling in coordinating neural activity across distant brain regions. To address these gaps, we employed multivariate PAC (mPAC) through generalized eigendecomposition (GED) analysis, which avoids the pitfalls of non-sinusoidal oscillations. 113 young and 117 older healthy participants engaged in a sequence learning paradigm (6423 sequence repetitions, 55'944 stimuli), in which they learned a fixed sequence of visual stimuli over repeated observations, allowing us to track the mPAC during the incremental process of learning. Behavioral results revealed that younger participants learned significantly faster than older participants. Neurophysiological data showed that mPAC increased over the course of learning in both age groups and could identify fast and slow learners. However, older participants exhibited lower mPAC compared to younger counterparts, which suggest compromised parallel storage of items in working memory in older age. Finally, stratification analysis revealed that mPAC effects persist across performance groups with similar mid-frontal theta levels, suggesting that theta alone does not account for these effects. These findings shed light on the age-related differences in memory formation processes and may guide interventions to enhance memory performance in older adults and slow learners.

">A lateralized pathway for associating nutrients with flavors</a></h4>

              
                Animals learn about the external world, in part, via interoceptive signals. For example, the nutrient content of food is first estimated in the mouth, in the form of flavor, and then measured again via slower signals from the gut. How these signals from the mouth and gut are integrated to drive learning is unknown. Here we identify a lateralized dopamine pathway that is specialized for learning about the nutrient content of food. We show that dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTADA) are necessary for associating nutrients with flavors, but that this does not involve canonical dopamine targets in the striatum. Instead, post-ingestive nutrients trigger DA release selectively in a small region of the anterior basolateral amygdala (BLA). Remarkably, this hotspot for nutrient-triggered DA release is localized to the left side of the brain in both mice and humans, revealing that the DA system is functionally lateralized. We identify the gut sensors that are responsible for nutrient-triggered DA release; show that they selectively activate BLA-projecting DA neurons defined by expression of cholecystokinin (CCK); and demonstrate that stimulation of DA axon terminals in the anterior BLA drives flavor-nutrient learning but not other aspects of behavior. Two-photon imaging of neurons in the left anterior BLA reveals that they encode food flavors, and these representations are strengthened by post-ingestive nutrients, whereas silencing of these neurons prevents flavor-nutrient learning. These findings establish a neural basis for how animals learn about the nutrient content of their food. They also reveal unexpectedly that post-ingestive nutrients are differentially represented on the right and left sides of the brain.

">The sensorimotor basis of subjective experience in social synchronization behavior</a></h4>

              
                The sensorimotor contingency (SMC) theory addresses action and perception as constitutive factors to one another - what is being perceived depends on what we do and vice versa. Accordingly, perception is seen as an active process of probing the environment and receiving feedback from it. These action- effect patterns may also be a predominant factor in social interactions. They can manifest in the phenomenon of synchronization, for example, when applause, gait, or posture in conversations synchronize unintentionally and form the basis of the concept of socially deployed sensorimotor contingencies (socSMCs). In this study, we introduce and compare measures used to study complex systems in order to quantify the information-theoretic basis of socSMCs. Two human participants had to synchronize arm movements in a full body virtual reality (VR) environment with each other. We aimed to evaluate the information-theoretic measures transfer entropy and mutual information in this complex motion synchronization task. Furthermore, in our experiment participants shared a mutual sensation of synchronicity and creativity for their interaction solely based on their movements. These subjective ratings of synchronicity and creativity can be predicted using transfer entropy and mutual information, showing that informational coupling between agents is relevant to subjective experience of interaction as described by the concept of socSMCs.

">Functional connectivity of thalamic nuclei during sensorimotor task-based fMRI at 9.4 Tesla</a></h4>

              
                The thalamus is the brain's central communication hub, playing a key role in processing and relaying sensorimotor and cognitive information between the cerebral cortex and other brain regions. It consists of specific and non-specific nuclei, each with a different role. Specific thalamic nuclei relay sensory and motor information to specific cortical and subcortical regions to ensure precise communication. In contrast, non-specific thalamic nuclei are involved in general functions such as attention or consciousness through broader and less targeted connections. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the functional connectivity patterns of the thalamic nuclei identified in our previous study as being involved in motor (finger-tapping) and sensory (finger-touch) tasks. The results of this study show that thalamic nuclei are not static hubs with a predefined role in neural signal processing, as they show different task-specific functional connectivity patterns in the anterior, middle, lateral, and posterior thalamic nuclei. Instead, they are all functional hubs that can flexibly change their connections to other brain regions in response to task demands. This work has important implications for understanding task-dependent functional connectivity between thalamic nuclei and different brain regions using task-based fMRI at 9.4 Tesla.

">Non-invasive peripheral delivery of CDNF fragment protects neurons in models of Parkinsons and ALS</a></h4>

              
                Non-invasive delivery of brain therapeutics is a key challenge for treating neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we discovered a novel carboxy (C)-terminal fragment of cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor (C-CDNF) that protects dopamine (DA) and motoneurons (MNs) in rodent models of Parkinsons disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). C-CDNF retains the same structure as CDNF and similarly to CDNF regulates cell stress pathways but unorthodoxly enters cultured neurons and passes through the blood-brain barrier. In vivo, intracranially or peripherally delivered C-CDNF improves motor deficits, protects DA neurons, and restores motor behavior in a rat model of PD. Subcutaneous C-CDNF also protects MNs and reduces microglial activation in an ALS model. Based on our findings, beginning C-CDNF treatment soon after diagnosis is anticipated to delay progression of PD and ALS, thereby improving treatment outcome. Thus, systemic delivery of C-CDNF should simplify the administration of protein-based therapeutics to patients while reducing treatment risk and financial burden for patients and families.

">Fixation shifts in a novel 'no-report' binocular rivalry paradigm induce saccade-related perceptual switches</a></h4>

              
                No-report paradigms help to avoid report-related confounds in conscious perception studies. A novel no-report binocular rivalry paradigm by Hesse and Tsao (2020) tracks conscious content using eye position as subjects follow fixation points linked to the rivaling stimuli. However, it remains unclear whether perceptual changes arise spontaneously or are induced by external factors such as fixation shifts and saccades. We found an increased probability of perceptual switches time-locked to fixation point shifts, indicating that some switches are externally driven. To disentangle the effects of visual fixation shifts and saccades, we implemented a two-factorial design and found that saccades play a larger role in eliciting perceptual changes. We estimate that 14% of saccades trigger a switch, accounting for 24% of all perceptual transitions. Our findings provide an analysis framework and guidelines for excluding externally driven perceptual switches, enabling a clearer focus on internally generated perceptual dynamics.

">Stable Actin As Synaptic Tag</a></h4>

              
                According to the tagging and capture hypothesis, long-lasting long-term potentiation (LTP) requires protein synthesis and a synaptic tag, which is a synapse specific memory of the synapse with a so far unclear molecular or biophysical identity. Here we use an interdisciplinary approach to explore the hypothesis that interaction between the dynamics of actin and the spine geometry can provide such a memory. Using a mathematical model, we demonstrate that this implementation of the tag requires an increase in the stable, cross-linked pool of actin filaments, and is not possible without this stable pool. Using FRAP experiments, we show that such an increase in stable actin can indeed be observed after cLTP in vitro. Thus, the interaction between actin dynamics and spine geometry could indeed serve as a synaptic tag for LTP.

">Neocortical Layer-5 tLTD Relies on Non-Ionotropic Presynaptic NMDA Receptor Signaling</a></h4>

              
                In the textbook view, NMDA receptors (NMDARs) act as coincidence detectors in Hebbian plasticity by fluxing Ca2+ when simultaneously depolarized and glutamate bound. Hebbian coincidence detection requires that NMDARs be located postsynaptically, but enigmatic presynaptic NMDARs (preNMDARs) also exist. It is known that preNMDARs regulate neurotransmitter release, but precisely how remains poorly understood. Emerging evidence suggest that NMDARs can also signal non-ionotropically, without the need for Ca2+ flux. At synapses between developing visual cortex layer-5 (L5) pyramidal cells (PCs), preNMDARs rely on Mg2+ and Rab3-interacting molecule 1{beta} (RIM1{beta}) to regulate evoked release during periods of high-frequency firing, but they signal non-ionotropically via c-Jun N-terminal kinase 2 (JNK2) to regulate spontaneous release regardless of frequency. At the same synapses, timing-dependent long-term depression (tLTD) depends on preNMDARs but not on frequency. We therefore tested if tLTD relies on non-ionotropic preNMDAR signaling. We found that tLTD at L5 PC[-&gt;]PC synapses was abolished by pre- but not postsynaptic NMDAR deletion, cementing the view that tLTD requires preNMDARs. In agreement with non-ionotropic NMDAR signaling, tLTD prevailed after channel pore blockade with MK-801, unlike tLTP. Homozygous RIM1{beta} deletion did not affect tLTD, but wash-in of the JNK2 blocker SP600125 abolished tLTD. Consistent with a presynaptic need for JNK2, a peptide blocking the interaction between JNK2 and Syntaxin-1a (STX1a) abolished tLTD if loaded pre- but not postsynaptically, regardless of frequency. Finally, low-frequency tLTD was not blocked by the channel pore blocker MK-801, nor by 7-CK, a non-competitive NMDAR antagonist at the co-agonist site. We conclude that neocortical L5 PC[-&gt;]PC tLTD relies on non-ionotropic preNMDAR signaling via JNK2/STX1a. Our study brings closure to long-standing controversy surrounding preNMDARs and highlights how the textbook view of NMDARs as ionotropic coincidence detectors in plasticity needs to be reassessed.

">Activity-Dependent Changes in Ion Channel Voltage-Dependence Influence the Activity Patterns Targeted by Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Neurons can maintain stable activity profiles over their lifetimes despite ion channel turnover over minutes to days. Neurons also exhibit flexibility in electrical activity by regulating the voltage-dependence of ion channels. This flexibility, combined with channel turnover can, in principle, work together to maintain a stable activity profile. We augment a classical model of activity-dependent ion channel density regulation with a mechanism that adjusts channel voltage-dependence based on activity. Our findings reveal that the timescale of these adjustments shapes the range of electrical patterns that meet an activity target. This work highlights a potentially distinct role for activity-dependent regulation of channel voltage-dependence in maintaining stable neuronal activity profiles.

">Dynamic fMRI networks of emotion</a></h4>

              
                The experience of emotions is that of dynamic, time changing processes. Yet, many fMRI studies of emotion average across time to focus on maps of static activations, overlooking the temporal dimension of emotional responses. In this study, we used time-resolved fMRI, group spatial independent component analysis (ICA), dual regression, and Gaussian curve fitting to examine both the spatial and temporal properties of whole-brain networks during a behavioral task. This task included trials that spanned over 25 seconds of watching short, emotionally evocative movie clips, making emotion-related decisions, and an intertrial rest period. We identified four whole-brain networks with unique spatial and temporal features that mapped onto different stages of the task. A network activated early in the course of the task included perceptual and affective evaluation regions, while two later networks supported semantic interpretation and decision-making, and a final network aligned with default mode activity. Both spatial and temporal properties of all four networks were modulated by the emotional content of the movie clips. Our findings extend current models of emotion by integrating temporal dynamics with large-scale network activity, offering a richer framework for understanding how emotions unfold across distributed circuits. Such temporal-spatial markers of emotional processing may prove valuable for identifying and tracking alterations in clinical populations.

">Spaces and sequences in the hippocampus: a homological perspective</a></h4>

              
                Topological techniques have become a popular tool for studying information flows in neural networks. In particular, simplicial homology theory is used to analyze how cognitive representations of space emerge from large conglomerates of independent neuronal contributions. Meanwhile, a growing number of studies suggest that many cognitive functions are sustained by serial patterns of activity. Here, we investigate stashes of such patterns using path homology theory--an impartial, universal approach that does not require a priori assumptions about the sequences' nature, functionality, underlying mechanisms, or other contexts. We focus on the hippocampus---a key enabler of learning and memory in mammalian brains---and quantify the ordinal arrangement of its activity similarly to how its topology has previously been studied in terms of simplicial homologies. The results reveal that the vast majority of sequences produced during spatial navigation are structurally equivalent to one another. Only a few classes of distinct sequences form an ordinal schema of serial activity that remains stable as the pool of sequences consolidates. Importantly, the structure of both maps is upheld by combinations of short sequences, suggesting that brief activity motifs dominate physiological computations. This ordinal organization emerges and stabilizes on timescales characteristic of spatial learning, displaying similar dynamics. Yet, the ordinal maps generally do not reflect topological affinities---spatial and sequential analyses address qualitatively different aspects of spike flows, representing two complementary formats of information processing.

	<p>Background: Autism spectrum disorder has been argued to involve impairments in domain-general predictive abilities. There is strong evidence that individuals with ASD have trouble navigating the dynamic world due to an inability to predict the outcomes of particular events. There is also evidence that this is apparent across the diagnostic criteria of ASD and common among correlates of ASD. However, the question remains as to whether this impairment in predictive abilities is domain-specific or domain-general, with little research investigating prediction in linguistic measures. Methods: The current study investigated whether individuals with ASD showed atypicalities in linguistic prediction using a cloze probability task. In Experiment 1, 33 individuals with ASD were compared to 64 typically developing individuals in an offline cloze task. Results: There was no significant effect of an ASD diagnosis on the cloze probability. However, individuals with higher levels of autistic traits were significantly more likely to produce lower-probability (non-modal) cloze responses. In Experiment 2, 19 individuals with ASD were compared to 22 typically developing individuals in a lab-based cloze task, in which we also measured the reaction times to begin speaking (i.e., voice onset time). The results showed that individuals with ASD had significantly slower reaction times (~200 ms) but, similarly to Experiment 1, did not show differences in the cloze probability of the responses produced. Conclusions: We conclude that individuals with ASD do show inefficiency in linguistic prediction, as well as indicating which ASD traits most strongly correlate with these inefficiencies.</p>

	<p> Background: Sexual characteristics in brain neurophysiological activity are a significant area of research in cognitive neuroscience. As a sport that involves minimal physical movement, shooters remain largely stationary during aiming, facilitating the collection of their neural activity compared to athletes in other sports. Objectives: To investigate the neural characteristics of novice shooters of different genders under competitive conditions. Methods: Sixteen subjects participated in a shooting competition following four weeks of training. Electroencephalogram (EEG) data and behavioral data (shooting scores, aiming curves, and pressure curves) were recorded during the competition, and the power spectral density (PSD) and phase-locking value (PLV) network features were extracted to explore further the correlation between the shooting scores and neural activity. Results: In our sample, (1) there were no significant differences in shooting scores between males and females; (2) there were differences in PSD values across the theta, alpha, alpha-2, beta, and gamma frequency bands between males and females; and (3) there were differences in PLV network properties in the theta, alpha, beta, and gamma frequency bands between males and females. Correlation analysis revealed associations between shooting scores and neural activity in male and female novices. Conclusions: The case study demonstrated that males and females exhibited different neural activity characteristics in the shooting competition, providing a foundation for further investigation into the sex differences in neural activity in shooting competition.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: This study evaluates the potential of electroencephalography (EEG) as a noninvasive tool for distinguishing between healthy individuals (n = 79), those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 36), and dementia patients (n = 7). Methods: Using a 14-channel Emotiv EPOC-X headset, we analyzed power spectral density during a 2-min eyes-closed resting state. Results: Our results demonstrated that while EEG effectively differentiated dementia patients from healthy controls, it did not show significant differences between MCI and healthy controls. This indicates that EEG holds promise for identifying advanced cognitive decline but faces challenges in early-stage detection. Conclusions: The study contributes to the growing body of literature by highlighting EEG&amp;amp;rsquo;s potential as a cost-effective alternative to invasive diagnostic methods while also identifying the need for larger sample sizes and task-oriented approaches to improve its diagnostic precision.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: The misuse of veterinary drugs is a growing concern, with increasing evidence of their presence in illicit drug markets and their use as alternatives to traditional substances. Methods: This study explores Reddit discussions on the misuse of veterinary drugs on Reddit, focusing on xylazine, carfentanil, medetomidine, pentobarbital, phenylbutazone, and acepromazine. Reddit was utilised for its abundant real-time data on users&amp;amp;rsquo; thoughts and experiences with substance misuse. Through a combination of manual and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven thematic analysis, we examined posts and comments to explore patterns of misuse. Results: The themes analysed included adverse effects, polysubstance misuse, routes of administration, motivations for misuse, and methods of obtaining these drugs. Our findings revealed that xylazine, medetomidine, carfentanil, and pentobarbital exhibit significant potential for misuse, while phenylbutazone and acepromazine are not widely misused. Despite this, phenylbutazone and acepromazine have been identified as adulterants in the illicit drug supply in the United States. The most discussed themes included motivations for misuse, followed by public experiences and perceptions, as well as adverse effects. Conclusions: The dual-method approach of combining manual interpretation with AI analysis allowed for a comprehensive understanding of social media discussions. This research highlights the importance of monitoring online platforms for early indicators of emerging drug trends, offering valuable insights to inform public health policies and intervention strategies. Impact Statement: This research highlights the growing public health risk posed by veterinary drug misuse, underscoring the need for enhanced monitoring, regulatory frameworks, and education to address their diversion into illicit markets. By leveraging social media as an early detection tool for emerging drug trends, our findings can inform targeted interventions.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Unilateral hand movements alter the excitability of the ipsilateral primary motor cortex (ipsi-M1) and contralateral spinal motoneurons. Although this excitability increases during complex, high muscle-activity movements, few studies have examined the excitability of ipsi-M1 and contralateral spinal motoneurons during complex movements while accounting for muscle activity. This study investigated the excitability of ipsi-M1 and contralateral spinal motoneurons during complex and simple movement tasks with comparable muscle activity between the two tasks. Methods: Nineteen healthy adult volunteers participated in this study. The ball rotation task was set as the complex movement task (BR condition), and the grasping task was set as the simple movement task (grasp condition), with peak muscle activity values comparable between the tasks. Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) and F-waves were recorded from the abductor pollicis brevis muscle contralateral to the movement during task execution. The excitability parameters of ipsi-M1 and contralateral spinal motoneurons were calculated by dividing the MEP, F-wave persistence, and F/M amplitude values recorded in each condition by the corresponding values recorded at rest. These parameters were compared across the rest, BR, and grasp conditions. Results: All the excitability parameters of ipsi-M1 and contralateral spinal motoneurons increased during both the BR and grasp conditions compared with the rest condition but did not differ significantly between the BR and grasp conditions. Conclusions: The excitability of ipsi-M1 and contralateral spinal motoneurons was strongly influenced by the amount of muscle activity but not by the complexity of the movement.</p>

	<p>Background: Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a recognized precursor of stroke that also indicates a high risk of recurrence. The Hyperintense Acute Reperfusion Marker (HARM), which is linked to blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier disruption, may serve as a novel imaging biomarker for TIA. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of 715 patients with TIA evaluated the predictive value of HARM for stroke recurrence and its association with TOAST subtype. Imaging findings, including those of diffusion-weighted imaging, were analyzed using logistic regression. Results: HARM-positive patients had significantly higher recurrence rates at 3 months (20.9%; odds ratio [OR] = 5.3) and 1 year (30.2%; OR = 5.8) compared to HARM-negative patients, relative to other imaging markers (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). HARM was significantly associated with the cardioembolic stroke (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusions: HARM is a promising imaging biomarker for predicting stroke recurrence and etiology in patients experiencing TIA. Incorporating HARM into clinical frameworks may enhance diagnostic and prognostic accuracy.</p>

">Functional Specialization for Language Processing in Inferior Frontal Regions During Early Childhood: Evidence from functional near-infrared spectroscopy individual functional channels of interest approach</a></h4>

              
                Early language acquisition represents a fundamental achievement in cognitive development, yet the neural mechanisms underlying this process remain debated. Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) with an innovative functional Channel of Interest (fCOI) approach, we investigated the functional specialization for language processing in bilateral inferior frontal regions during early childhood. In two experiments involving adults (N=20) and toddlers (N=22, ages 2-4 years), participants completed language processing and cognitive control tasks. Results demonstrated early functional specialization in the language-selective region of left inferior frontal gyrus, which showed selective responses to linguistic content while remaining insensitive to cognitive demand manipulations in both age groups. However, language selectivity in the homologous right hemisphere region was present only in adults, suggesting continued development of language organization beyond early childhood. The MD regions showed complementary patterns, with right-hemispheric selectivity for cognitive control emerging early. These findings provide evidence for early neural specialization of language processing in the left hemisphere, while revealing ongoing development in right hemispheric organization. Our results support models of early language-specific neural circuits rather than gradual differentiation from domain-general mechanisms, while highlighting the protracted development of language organization.

">Cholesterol-mediated Lysosomal Dysfunction in APOE4 Astrocytes Promotes α-Synuclein Pathology in Human Brain Tissue</a></h4>

              
                The pathological hallmark of neurodegenerative disease is the aberrant post-translational modification and aggregation of proteins leading to the formation of insoluble protein inclusions. Genetic factors like APOE4 are known to increase the prevalence and severity of tau, amyloid, and -Synuclein inclusions. However, the human brain is largely inaccessible during this process, limiting our mechanistic understanding. Here, we developed an iPSC-based 3D model that integrates neurons, glia, myelin, and cerebrovascular cells into a functional human brain tissue (miBrain). Like the human brain, we found pathogenic phosphorylation and aggregation of -Synuclein is increased in the APOE4 miBrain. Combinatorial experiments revealed that lipid-droplet formation in APOE4 astrocytes impairs the degradation of -synuclein and leads to a pathogenic transformation that seeds neuronal inclusions of -Synuclein. Collectively, this study establishes a robust model for investigating protein inclusions in human brain tissue and highlights the role of astrocytes and cholesterol in APOE4-mediated pathologies, opening therapeutic opportunities.

">A Semi-Automated MEA Spike sorting (SAMS) method for high throughput assessment of cultured neurons</a></h4>

              
                Neurons derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are valuable models for studying brain development and developing therapies for brain disorders. Evaluating human-derived neurons requires assessing their electrical activity, which can be achieved using multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) for extracellular recordings. Because each electrode channel generally detects activity from multiple neurons, resolving the activity of single neurons requires a process called spike sorting. However, currently available spike sorting methods are not optimized for the analysis of hPSC-derived neurons, and require complex workflows and time-consuming manual intervention. Here, we introduce a Semi-Automated MEA Spike sorting software (SAMS) designed specifically for low-density MEA recordings of cultured neurons. SAMS outperforms commercially available automated spike sorting algorithms in terms of accuracy and greatly reduces computational and human processing time. By providing an accessible, efficient, and integrated platform for spike sorting, SAMS enhances the resolution and utility of MEA in disease modeling and drug development using human-derived neurons.

	<p>Cerebral lateralisation is a core organising principle of the brain that is characterised by a complex pattern of hemispheric specialisations and interhemispheric interactions. In various mental disorders, functional and/or structural hemispheric asymmetries are changed compared to healthy controls, and these alterations may contribute to the primary symptoms and cognitive impairments of a specific disorder. Since multiple genetic and epigenetic factors influence both the pathogenesis of mental illness and the development of brain asymmetries, it is likely that the neural developmental pathways overlap or are even causally intertwined, although the timing, magnitude, and direction of interactions may vary depending on the specific disorder. However, the underlying developmental steps and neuronal mechanisms are still unclear. In this review article, we briefly summarise what we know about structural, functional, and developmental relationships and outline hypothetical connections, which could be investigated in appropriate animal models. Altered cerebral asymmetries may causally contribute to the development of the structural and/or functional features of a disorder, as neural mechanisms that trigger neuropathogenesis are embedded in the asymmetrical organisation of the developing brain. Therefore, the occurrence and severity of impairments in neural processing and cognition probably cannot be understood independently of the development of the lateralised organisation of intra- and interhemispheric neuronal networks. Conversely, impaired cellular processes can also hinder favourable asymmetry development and lead to cognitive deficits in particular.</p>

     alt="Exploring Anatomical Links Between the Crow's Nidopallium Caudolaterale and Its Song System"/>
<p>The crow's nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL) projects densely to the dorsal intermediate arcopallium (AID) and the striatum, paralleling important song system pathways. Connections from the magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium (MAN) to NCL and HVC run in parallel but remain distinct. These findings suggest the NCL is part of a general motor system with minimal direct interaction with the song system.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Crows are corvid songbirds that exhibit remarkable cognitive control, including their ability to vocalize on command. The activity of single neurons from the crow's associative telencephalic structure nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL) is correlated with the execution of this vocal and many non-vocal behaviors. However, whether anatomical connections directly link the crow NCL to its “song system” remains unclear. To address this, we used fluorescent tracers along with histological staining methods to characterize the connectivity of the crow's NCL in relation to its song system. Consistent with previous findings in other songbirds, we found that the NCL sends dense projections into the dorsal intermediate arcopallium (AID) directly adjacent to the song system's telencephalic motor output, the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA). Similarly, we demonstrate dense NCL projections into the striatum engulfing the basal ganglia song nucleus “area X.” Both of these descending projections mirror the projections of the nidopallial song nucleus HVC (proper name) into RA and area X, with extremely sparse NCL fibers extending into area X. Furthermore, we characterized the distribution of cells projecting from the lateral part of the magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium (MAN) to NCL. Notably, a separate medial population of MAN cells projects to HVC. These two sets of connections—MAN to NCL and MAN to HVC—run in parallel but do not overlap. Taken together, our findings support the hypothesis that the NCL is part of a “general motor system” that parallels the song system but exhibits only minimal monosynaptic interconnections with it.</p>

                Opioids can influence neuronal activity by regulating transmitter release. Here, Alexander and Bender demonstrate that delta opioid receptors engage different mechanisms to regulate release from parvalbumin- and somatostatin-expressing interneurons in mouse prefrontal circuits, resulting in differential temporal filtering of inhibitory transmission depending on presynaptic cell identity.

">Complementary MR measures of white matter and their relation to cardiovascular health and cognition</a></h4>

              
                Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers many ways to non-invasively estimate the properties of white matter (WM) in the brain. In addition to the various metrics derived from diffusion-weighted MRI, one can estimate total WM volume from T1-weighted MRI, WM hyper-intensities from T2-weighted MRI, myelination from the T1:T2 ratio, or from the magnetisation-transfer ratio (MTR). Here we utilise the presence of all of these MR contrasts in a population based life-span cohort of 650 healthy adults [CamCAN cohort] to identify the latent factors underlying the covariance of 11 commonly-used WM metrics. Four factors were needed to explain 89% of the variance, which we interpreted in terms of 1) fibre density / myelination, 2) free-water / tissue damage, 3) fibre-crossing complexity and 4) microstructural complexity. These factors showed distinct effects of age and sex. To test the validity of these factors, we related them to measures of cardiovascular health and cognitive performance. Specifically, we ran path analyses 1) linking cardio-vascular measures to the WM factors, given the idea that WM health is related to cardiovascular health, and 2) linking the WM factors to cognitive measure, given the idea that WM health is important for cognition. Even after adjusting for age, we found that a vascular factor related to pulse pressure predicted the WM factor capturing free-water / tissue damage, and that several WM factors made unique predictions for fluid intelligence and processing speed. Our results show that there is both complementary and redundant information across common MR measures of WM, and their underlying latent factors may be useful for pinpointing the differential causes and contributions of white matter health in healthy aging.

	<p>Background: In motor imagery brain&amp;amp;ndash;computer interface (MI-BCI) research, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are complex and nonlinear. This complexity and nonlinearity render signal processing and classification challenging when employing traditional linear methods. Information entropy, with its intrinsic nonlinear characteristics, effectively captures the dynamic behavior of EEG signals, thereby addressing the limitations of traditional methods in capturing linear features. However, the multitude of entropy types leads to unclear application scenarios, with a lack of systematic descriptions. Methods: This study conducted a review of 63 high-quality research articles focused on the application of entropy in MI-BCI, published between 2019 and 2023. It summarizes the names, functions, and application scopes of 13 commonly used entropy measures. Results: The findings indicate that sample entropy (16.3%), Shannon entropy (13%), fuzzy entropy (12%), permutation entropy (9.8%), and approximate entropy (7.6%) are the most frequently utilized entropy features in MI-BCI. The majority of studies employ a single entropy feature (79.7%), with dual entropy (9.4%) and triple entropy (4.7%) being the most prevalent combinations in multiple entropy applications. The incorporation of entropy features can significantly enhance pattern classification accuracy (by 8&amp;amp;ndash;10%). Most studies (67%) utilize public datasets for classification verification, while a minority design and conduct experiments (28%), and only 5% combine both methods. Conclusions: Future research should delve into the effects of various entropy features on specific problems to clarify their application scenarios. As research methodologies continue to evolve and advance, entropy features are poised to play a significant role in a wide array of fields and contexts.</p>

	<p>Background: The gut microbiome directly impacts brain health and activity, meaning the two are closely associated. This relationship suggests a link between microbial imbalances and diseases such as Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s, although multiple other contributing factors, such as genetics, also play a part. Additionally, recent studies discovered that cerebrospinal fluid has some microbial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which can be interpreted to mean a microbiome exists in the brain too. The vagus nerve and the central nervous and immune systems are responsible for the connection between the brain and gut microbiome. Aims and Objectives: The main aim of this systematic review is to analyze existing research on the gut&amp;amp;ndash;brain axis and the brain microbiome to fill the current knowledge gap. Materials and Methods: A search was conducted on the PubMed database based on a set of predefined MeSH terms. Results: After the search, 2716 articles meeting the MeSH parameters were found in PubMed. This list was then downloaded and analyzed according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, and 63 relevant papers were selected. Discussion: Bacteria in the gut microbiome produce some substances that are considered neuroactive. These compounds can directly or indirectly affect brain function through the gut&amp;amp;ndash;brain axis. However, various knowledge gaps on the mechanisms involved in this connection need to be addressed first.</p>

                Background Chronic non-specific neck pain is one of the most prevalent musculoskeletal disorders affecting work and lifestyle. Physiotherapy techniques, such as stretching and strength training, have beneficial effects on neck pain. Telerehabilitation exercise programmes could readily address the growing concern of patient adherence to home-based exercise programmes, while being time- and cost-effective. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of telerehabilitation exercise intervention in females with chronic non-specific neck pain by measuring the pain score, disability index, cervical range of motion (CROM), cervical muscle endurance, and patient adherence. Methods In this pilot randomized controlled trial, 31 females (mean age 22.7 ± 2.1 years) were given a 6-week home-based exercise programme based on their assigned group: telerehabilitation (TR) – online software or conventional (CG) – exercise manual. Baseline measurements were collected using the Visual Analog Scale for Pain (VAS Pain), Neck Disability Index (NDI) questionnaire, CROM using the CROM instrument, and cervical muscle endurance through the Craniocervical Flexion Test (CCFT), and repeated after six weeks, in addition to adherence. SPSS version 26.0 was used for all statistical analyses. Results Based on mixed model ANOVA measures (0 week and 6 weeks), within-group comparisons for both groups showed statistical significance in favour of the exercise programme, for all variables (p<0.05). Telerehabilitation group showed significantly more increase in cervical rotation ROM R (0.006) and L (0.03) post-exercise programme, and longer duration of treatment session (0.02) as compared to conventional group. Between-group comparisons showed no significant differences for all other variables. Conclusions Based on our findings, both groups showed significant improvement in neck pain, disability, cervical ROM, and cervical muscle endurance; however, no group was found superior to the other in this regard. While both groups showed good adherence to the frequency of sessions, telerehabilitation exhibited better adherence to the duration of the exercise sessions.

                Ongoing digitalization and data-driven developments in materials science and engineering (MSE) emphasize the growing importance of reusing research data and enabling machine accessibility, which requires robust data management and consistent semantic data representation. Ontologies have emerged as powerful tools for establishing interoperable and reusable data structures from inconsistent data structures. Despite advancements in semantic data representation for specific applications, integrating application ontologies with primary data repositories, such as electronic lab notebooks (ELNs), to feed world data remains an open task. As a use case in the MSE domain, this work presents a system based on semantic technologies from the point of view of engineers, developed with the help of information scientists, and unraveled on a small scale. The development of an application ontology (AO) was elaborated for flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) processes with the implementation of a data pipeline. The proposed FSP application ontology emerges from experimental in-house best-practice procedures and is adapted to the mid-level Project Material Digital core ontology (PMDco) to allow interoperability within the MSE domain. The pipeline retrieves manually acquired experimental data from an ELN, translates it into a machine-actionable format, and converts it into a Resource Description Framework (RDF) format to support semantic interoperability. The latter was stored in a triple store with a SPARQL interface, enabling findable and accessible datasets that are searchable and traceable. By creating semantically linked data structures in line with FAIR principles, this approach allows traceable and findable experimental results between stakeholders through both human-readable and machine-actionable formats. Seamless integration of the modular microservices of the data pipeline within established lab practices minimizes disruption while maintaining the software framework. The present work demonstrates the practical implementation of a FAIR data pipeline within a laboratory setting, paving the way for future data-centric science.

                Background Although observational studies demonstrate that higher levels of vascular risk factors are associated with an increased risk of dementia, these associations might be explained by confounding or other biases. Mendelian randomization (MR) uses genetic instruments to test causal relationships in observational data. We sought to determine if genetically predicted modifiable risk factors (type 2 diabetes mellitus, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, body mass index, and circulating glucose) are associated with dementia by meta-analysing published MR studies. Secondary objectives were to identify heterogeneity in effect estimates across primary MR studies and to compare meta-analysis results with observational studies. Methods MR studies were identified by systematic search of Web of Science, OVID and Scopus. We selected primary MR studies investigating the modifiable risk factors of interest. Only one study from each cohort per risk factor was included. A quality assessment tool was developed to primarily assess the three assumptions of MR for each MR study. Data were extracted on study characteristics, exposure and outcome, effect estimates per unit increase, and measures of variation. Effect estimates were pooled to generate an overall estimate, I2 and Cochrane Q values using fixed-effect model. Results We screened 5211 studies and included 12 primary MR studies after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria. Higher genetically predicted body mass index was associated with a higher odds of dementia (OR 1.03 [1.01, 1.05] per 5 kg/m2 increase, one study, p=0.00285). Fewer hypothesized vascular risk factors were supported by estimates from MR studies than estimates from meta-analyses of observational studies. Conclusion Genetically predicted body mass index was associated with an increase in risk of dementia.

                Background The aim of this study was to observe and analyze vascular function in ‘prolonged sitting’, followed by a yoga asana routine and pranayama intervention. Participants in this study include those who work from desks in offices. The study required the participants to attend on three separate days at random, and they had to finish a computerized test on each day. On the first day, participants were required to complete a computer test while sitting still for four hours (with the exception of washroom breaks). The next day, they underwent a computerized test along with a pranayama intervention. Finally, on the last day, they underwent a computerized test along with a yoga asana intervention. At the start of the study and after two and four hours, we measured the diameter and velocity of the common carotid artery (CCA) and superficial femoral artery (SFA). Methods The study was a within-subjects prospective single-center trial conducted in the Department of Radio-Diagnosis and Imaging, Kasturba Medical Hospital, Manipal, India, between September 2022 and January 2023. Participants were asked to do one of the following ‘activities’ over successive weeks: Week 1 – Prolonged sitting; Week 2 – Pranayama intervention; and Week 3 – Yoga asana intervention during prolonged sitting. The baseline and follow-up variables of pulse velocity, endothelial thickness, and shear rate were assessed for normality through a Shapiro-Wilk Test. Results Our sample included 11 participants with moderate physical activity, five with high physical activity and one with low physical activity. Yoga asana intervention comprised participants sitting continuously for four hours, with a yoga asana intervention being provided every hour, lasting for 10 minutes. Conclusions Yoga asana improves vascular functions in prolonged sitting conditions. This routine can promote the concept of interrupted sitting and ways to reduce it with efficient yoga asana practice without changing the work culture and provide better physical relief.

                <p>by Brinkley Raynor Bellotti, Elvis W. Díaz, Micaela De la Puente-León, Maria T. Rieders, Sergio E. Recuenco, Michael Z. Levy, Ricardo Castillo-Neyra</p>
Background <p>From smallpox to poliomyelitis, halting contagion transmission through simultaneous mass vaccination is ubiquitous and often perceived as the only possible solution. But implementing mass vaccination campaigns in large populations within a short period poses many challenges. For example, in Arequipa, Peru, sweeping mass vaccination campaigns conducted yearly over a single weekend have failed to achieve the required ‘herd immunity’ to halt canine rabies transmission. Contrary to the global paradigm of a simultaneous campaign, the 2022 Arequipa rabies campaign was implemented at the sub-district level (patches), with dates of the campaign staggered across 6 months.</p> Methods <p>We constructed a stochastic, metapopulation model to examine how the timing of pulsed vaccination campaigns across patches can affect metapopulation dynamics. We explore general metapopulation dynamics for pulsed vaccinations as well as parameterizing the model for canine rabies in Arequipa, Peru. We simulated how the timing of the planned vaccination campaign, staggered over 6 months versus a single yearly pulse, affected the prospects for regional rabies elimination.</p> Results <p>Metapopulation dynamics can affect the efficacy of pulsed vaccination campaigns. In the case of Arequipa, Peru, the planned staggered mass dog vaccination campaign has the potential for local elimination with the tradeoffs of increased time to elimination and increased outbreak size due to metapopulation dynamics.</p> Conclusions <p>Heterogeneities caused by control strategies enactment at sub-population scales should be accounted for when modeling transmission dynamics. In Arequipa, Peru, although metapopulation dynamics may allow for re-introduction of canine rabies in previously vaccinated patches when mass dog vaccination campaigns are staggered temporally over 6 months, continuous mass vaccination reaching recommended vaccination coverage levels is sufficient to eliminate canine rabies.</p>

                <p>by Eliezyer Fermino de Oliveira, Pranjal Garg, Jens Hjerling-Leffler, Renata Batista-Brito, Lucas Sjulson</p>

High-dimensional data have become ubiquitous in the biological sciences, and it is often desirable to compare two datasets collected under different experimental conditions to extract low-dimensional patterns enriched in one condition. However, traditional dimensionality reduction techniques cannot accomplish this because they operate on only one dataset. Contrastive principal component analysis (cPCA) has been proposed to address this problem, but it has seen little adoption because it requires tuning a hyperparameter resulting in multiple solutions, with no way of knowing which is correct. Moreover, cPCA uses foreground and background conditions that are treated differently, making it ill-suited to compare two experimental conditions symmetrically. Here we describe the development of generalized contrastive PCA (gcPCA), a flexible hyperparameter-free approach that solves these problems. We first provide analyses explaining why cPCA requires a hyperparameter and how gcPCA avoids this requirement. We then describe an open-source gcPCA toolbox containing Python and MATLAB implementations of several variants of gcPCA tailored for different scenarios. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of gcPCA in analyzing diverse high-dimensional biological data, revealing unsupervised detection of hippocampal replay in neurophysiological recordings and heterogeneity of type II diabetes in single-cell RNA sequencing data. As a fast, robust, and easy-to-use comparison method, gcPCA provides a valuable resource facilitating the analysis of diverse high-dimensional datasets to gain new insights into complex biological phenomena.

                <p>by Richard J. Wang, Yadira Peña-García, Muthuswamy Raveendran, R. Alan Harris, Thuy-Trang Nguyen, Marie-Claude Gingras, Yifan Wu, Lesette Perez, Anne D. Yoder, Joe H. Simmons, Jeffrey Rogers, Matthew W. Hahn</p>

Every mammal studied to date has been found to have a male mutation bias: male parents transmit more de novo mutations to offspring than female parents, contributing increasingly more mutations with age. Although male-biased mutation has been studied for more than 75 years, its causes are still debated. One obstacle to understanding this pattern is its near universality—without variation in mutation bias, it is difficult to find an underlying cause. Here, we present new data on multiple pedigrees from two primate species: aye-ayes (<i>Daubentonia madagascariensis</i>), a member of the strepsirrhine primates, and olive baboons (<i>Papio anubis</i>). In stark contrast to the pattern found across mammals, we find a much larger effect of maternal age than paternal age on mutation rates in the aye-aye. In addition, older aye-aye mothers transmit substantially more mutations than older fathers. We carry out both computational and experimental validation of our results, contrasting them with results from baboons and other primates using the same methodologies. Further, we analyze a set of DNA repair and replication genes to identify candidate mutations that may be responsible for the change in mutation bias observed in aye-ayes. Our results demonstrate that mutation bias is not an immutable trait, but rather one that can evolve between closely related species. Further work on aye-ayes (and possibly other lemuriform primates) should help to explain the molecular basis for sex-biased mutation.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate the role of neuroinflammation in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) across different parkinsonian disorders—Parkinson's disease (PD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and multiple system atrophy (MSA)—by examining SNc dopaminergic neuron counts, neuroinflammatory T cells, and microglial activity.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Postmortem neuropathological samples were collected from 79 individuals (PD, n = 38; PSP, n = 15; MSA, n = 14; controls, n = 12). The density of SNc tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons, T cells (CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+), and <i>Iba</i>1 expression (<i>Iba</i>1-positive microglia/macrophages) were examined in the SNc and crus cerebri. Demographic and clinical data were gathered from patient histories.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>PSP patients had 89 to 212% more nigral CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells compared to MSA patients (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.04), 125 to 178% more CD3+ and CD4+ T cells than healthy controls (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.002), and 95% more CD4+ T cells than PD patients (<i>p</i> = 0.001). <i>Iba</i>1 expression in the SNc was higher in PD patients than in MSA patients (<i>p</i> = 0.004), with no significant differences observed across other conditions. There was a negative association between disease duration and SNc CD3+ T cell density (<i>p</i> = 0.002), and a positive correlation between nigral dopaminergic neuron density and CD3+ density, CD8+ density, and <i>Iba</i>1 expression in PD patients.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The study reveals distinctive neuroinflammatory patterns in the SNc, with T cell-mediated inflammation prominent in PSP and microglia-mediated inflammation in PD. PSP and MSA show greater SNc dopaminergic neuron loss compared to PD. Increased neuroinflammatory response is seen in earlier disease stages, diminishing with greater neuron loss, which may inform disease progression understanding and therapeutic strategies.

                Background Machine learning and AI promise to revolutionize the way we leverage medical imaging data for improving care but require large datasets to train computational models that can be implemented in clinical practice. However, processing large and complex medical imaging datasets remains an open challenge. Methods To address this issue, we developed Med-ImageTools, a new Python open-source software package to automate data curation and processing while allowing researchers to share their data processing configurations more easily, lowering the barrier for other researchers to reproduce published works. Use cases We have demonstrated the efficiency of Med-ImageTools across three different datasets, resulting in significantly reduced processing times. Conclusions The AutoPipeline feature will improve the accessibility of raw clinical datasets on public archives, such as the Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA), the largest public repository of cancer imaging, allowing machine learning researchers to process analysis-ready formats without requiring deep domain knowledge.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95828">A ‘torn bag mechanism’ of small extracellular vesicle release via limiting membrane rupture of en bloc released amphisomes (amphiectosomes)</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies showed an unexpected complexity of extracellular vesicle (EV) biogenesis pathways. We previously found evidence that human colorectal cancer cells in vivo release large multivesicular body-like structures en bloc. Here, we tested whether this large EV type is unique to colorectal cancer cells. We found that all cell types we studied (including different cell lines and cells in their original tissue environment) released multivesicular large EVs (MV-lEVs). We also demonstrated that upon spontaneous rupture of the limiting membrane of the MV-lEVs, their intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) escaped to the extracellular environment by a ‘torn bag mechanism’. We proved that the MV-lEVs were released by ectocytosis of amphisomes (hence, we termed them amphiectosomes). Both ILVs of amphiectosomes and small EVs separated from conditioned media were either exclusively CD63 or LC3B positive. According to our model, upon fusion of multivesicular bodies with autophagosomes, fragments of the autophagosomal inner membrane curl up to form LC3B positive ILVs of amphisomes, while CD63 positive small EVs are of multivesicular body origin. Our data suggest a novel common release mechanism for small EVs, distinct from the exocytosis of multivesicular bodies or amphisomes, as well as the small ectosome release pathway.
