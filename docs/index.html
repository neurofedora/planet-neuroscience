              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Impact of COVID-19 on utilization of maternal, newborn and child health services in Nigeria: protocol for a country-level mixed-methods study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Battling with COVID-19 and providing essential services along the continuum of care could be challenging. This study will evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on utilization of maternal, newborn and child health (MNCH) services in Nigeria and explore the barriers being experienced by women and their families in getting access to MNCH services, as well as other contextual factors that may have shaped the utilization of MNCH services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods and analysis: The study will adopt an observational mixed-methods study design involving 18 health care facilities delivering MNCH services in six selected states across six geopolitical zones of Nigeria. We will retrieve longitudinal data on MNCH services from all selected hospitals six months before and after the first recorded case of COVID-19 in Nigeria. Qualitative data will be collected using in-depth interviews conducted via mobile phones or ZOOM meeting platforms among stakeholder participants (users of MNCH services, health workers and policymakers) to ascertain their perceptions on how COVID-19 has shaped the utilization of MNCH services. We will triangulate quantitative and qualitative data to better understand the impact of COVID-19 on the utilization of MNCH services in Nigeria. Ethics and dissemination: Ethics approvals have been obtained from the Health Research Ethics Committee of the tertiary hospitals involved in the study. Our findings will provide the first evidence from an African setting on the impact of COVID-19 on the utilization of MNCH services using a mixed-methods study design for policy formulation towards sustained MNCH service delivery.

	<p>Mutations of the SPAST gene that encodes the microtubule-severing enzyme called spastin are the chief cause of Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia. Growing evidence indicates that pathogenic mutations functionally compromise the spastin protein and endow it with toxic gain-of-function properties. With each of these two factors potentially relevant to disease etiology, the present article discusses possible therapeutic strategies that may ameliorate symptoms in patients suffering from SPAST-based Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia, which is usually termed SPG4-HSP.</p>

	<p>Previous cross-sectional studies have related aerobic fitness to inhibitory control and white matter (WM) microstructure in young adults, but there is no longitudinal study to confirm whether these relationships exist. We carried out a longitudinal study comparing aerobic fitness, inhibitory control, and WM integrity across time points, before versus after completing an exercise intervention in young adults (18–20 years old) relative to a control group. The exercise group (n = 35) participated in a 9-week exercise protocol, while the control group (n = 24) did not receive any regular exercise training. Behavioral data and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were collected prior to and following the intervention. After the exercise intervention, aerobic fitness and inhibitory control performance were significantly improved for the exercise group, but not for the control group. Analyses of variance (ANOVA) of the DTI data demonstrated significantly increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the right corticospinal tract and significantly decreased FA in the left superior fronto-occipital fasciculus in the exercise group after the intervention versus before. The enhanced aerobic fitness induced by exercise was associated with better inhibitory control performance in the incongruent condition and lower FA in the Left superior fronto-occipital fasciculus (SFOF). Regression analysis of a mediation model did not support Left SFOF FA as a mediator of the relationship between improvements in aerobic fitness and inhibitory control. The present data provide new evidence of the relationship between exercise-induced changes in aerobic fitness, WM integrity, and inhibitory control in early adulthood. Longer-duration intervention studies with larger study cohorts are needed to confirm and further explore the findings obtained in this study.</p>

	<p>Surgical skill acquisition may be facilitated with a safe application of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). A preliminary meta-analysis of randomized control trials showed that tDCS was associated with significantly better improvement in surgical performance than the sham control; however, meta-analysis does not address the mechanistic understanding. It is known from skill learning studies that the hierarchy of cognitive control shows a rostrocaudal axis in the frontal lobe where a shift from posterior to anterior is postulated to mediate progressively abstract, higher-order control. Therefore, optimizing the transcranial electrical stimulation to target surgical task-related brain activation at different stages of motor learning may provide the causal link to the learning behavior. This comment paper presents the computational approach for neuroimaging guided tDCS based on open-source software pipelines and an open-data of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) for complex motor tasks. We performed an fNIRS-based cortical activation analysis using AtlasViewer software that was used as the target for tDCS of the motor complexity-related brain regions using ROAST software. For future studies on surgical skill training, it is postulated that the higher complexity laparoscopic suturing with intracorporeal knot tying task may result in more robust activation of the motor complexity-related brain areas when compared to the lower complexity laparoscopic tasks.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Distinct patterns of hippocampal activity associated with color and spatial source memory</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus is known to be involved in source memory across a wide variety of stimuli and source types. Thus, source memory activity in the hippocampus is thought to be domain-general such that different types of source information are similarly processed in the hippocampus. However, there is some evidence of domain-specificity for spatial and temporal source information. The current fMRI study aimed to determine whether patterns of activity in the hippocampus differed for two types of visual source information: spatial location and background color. Participants completed three runs of a spatial memory task and three runs of a color memory task. During the study phase, 32 line drawings of common objects and animals were presented to either the left or right of fixation for the spatial memory task or on either a red or green background for the color memory task. During the test phase of both tasks, 48 object word labels were presented in the center of the screen and participants classified the corresponding item as old and previously on the “left”/on a “green” background, old and previously on the “right”/on a “red” background, or “new.” Two analysis methods were employed to assess whether hippocampal activity differed between the two source types: a general linear model analysis and a classification-based searchlight multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA). The searchlight MVPA revealed that activity associated with spatial memory and color memory could be classified with above-chance accuracy in a region of the right anterior hippocampus, and a follow-up analysis revealed that there was a significant effect of memory accuracy. These results indicate that different types of source memory are represented by distinct patterns of activity in the hippocampus.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Linking minimal and detailed models of CA1 microcircuits reveals how theta rhythms emerge and their frequencies controlled</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The wide variety of cell types and their biophysical complexities pose a challenge in our ability to understand oscillatory activities produced by cellular-based computational network models. This challenge stems from their high-dimensional and multiparametric natures. To overcome this, we implement a solution by linking minimal and detailed models of CA1 microcircuits that generate intrahippocampal (3–12 Hz) theta rhythms. We leverage insights from minimal models to guide explorations of more detailed models and obtain a cellular perspective of theta generation. Our findings distinguish the pyramidal cells as the theta rhythm initiators and reveal that their activity is regularized by the inhibitory cell populations, supporting a proposed hypothesis of an “inhibition-based tuning” mechanism. We find a strong correlation between input current to the pyramidal cells and the resulting local field potential theta frequency, indicating that intrinsic pyramidal cell properties underpin network frequency characteristics. This work provides a cellular-based foundation from which <i>in vivo</i> theta activities can be explored.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Nitrergic modulation of neuronal excitability in the mouse hippocampus is mediated via regulation of Kv2 and voltage‐gated sodium channels</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Regulation of neuronal activity is a necessity for communication and information transmission. Many regulatory processes which have been studied provide a complex picture of how neurons can respond to permanently changing functional requirements. One such activity-dependent mechanism involves signaling mediated by nitric oxide (NO). Within the brain, NO is generated in response to neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) activation but NO-dependent pathways regulating neuronal excitability in the hippocampus remain to be fully elucidated. This study was set out to systematically assess the effects of NO on ion channel activities and intrinsic excitabilities of pyramidal neurons within the CA1 region of the mouse hippocampus. We characterized whole-cell potassium and sodium currents, both involved in action potential (AP) shaping and propagation and determined NO-mediated changes in excitabilities and AP waveforms. Our data describe a novel signaling by which NO, in a cGMP-independent manner, suppresses voltage-gated Kv2 potassium and voltage-gated sodium channel activities, thereby widening AP waveforms and reducing depolarization-induced AP firing rates. Our data show that glutathione, which possesses denitrosylating activity, is sufficient to prevent the observed nitrergic effects on potassium and sodium channels, whereas inhibition of cGMP signaling is also sufficient to abolish NO modulation of sodium currents. We propose that NO suppresses both ion channel activities via redox signaling and that an additional cGMP-mediated component is required to exert effects on sodium currents. Both mechanisms result in a dampened excitability and firing ability providing new data on nitrergic activities in the context of activity-dependent regulation of neuronal function following nNOS activation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Evidence for a gradient within the medial temporal lobes for flexible retrieval under hierarchical task rules</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A fundamental question in memory research is how the hippocampus processes contextual cues to retrieve distinct mnemonic associations. Prior research has emphasized the importance of hippocampal–prefrontal interactions for context-dependent memory. Our fMRI study examined the human medial temporal lobes (MTL) and their prefrontal interactions when retrieving memories associated with hierarchically organized task contexts. Participants learned virtual object-location associations governed by subordinate and superordinate task rules, which could be independently cued to change. On each fMRI trial, participants retrieved the correct object for convergent rule and location contextual information. Results demonstrated that hippocampal activity and hippocampal–prefrontal functional interconnectivity distinguished retrieval under different levels of hierarchically organized task rules. In explicit contrast to the hippocampal tail, anterior (body and head) regions were recruited specifically for superordinate changes in the contextual hierarchy. The hippocampal body also differed in its functional connectivity with the prefrontal cortex for superordinate versus subordinate changes. Our findings demonstrate a gradient in MTL for associative retrieval under changing task rules, and advance understanding of hippocampal–prefrontal interactions that support flexible contextual memory.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Preferential frequency‐dependent induction of synaptic depression by the lateral perforant path and of synaptic potentiation by the medial perforant path inputs to the dentate gyrus</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The encoding of spatial representations is enabled by synaptic plasticity. The entorhinal cortex sends information to the hippocampus via the lateral (LPP) and medial perforant (MPP) paths that transfer egocentric item-related and allocentric spatial information, respectively. To what extent LPP and MPP information-relay results in different homosynaptic synaptic plasticity responses is unclear. We examined the frequency dependency (at 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 200 Hz) of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) at MPP and LPP synapses in the dentate gyrus (DG) of freely behaving adult rats. We report that whereas the MPP–DG synapses exhibit a predisposition toward the expression of LTP, LPP–DG synapses prefer to express synaptic depression. The divergence of synaptic plasticity responses is most prominent at afferent frequencies of 5, 100, Hz and 200 Hz. Priming with 10 or 50 Hz significantly modified the subsequent plasticity response in a frequency-dependent manner, but failed to change the preferred direction of change in synaptic strength of MPP and LPP synapses. Evaluation of the expression of GluN1, GluN2A, or GluN2B subunits of the NMDA receptor revealed equivalent expression in the outer and middle thirds of the molecular layer where LPP and MPP inputs convene, respectively, thus excluding NMDA receptors as a substrate for the frequency-dependent differences in bidirectional plasticity. These findings demonstrate that the LPP and MPP inputs to the DG enable differentiated and distinct forms of synaptic plasticity in response to the same afferent frequencies. Effects are extremely robust and resilient to metaplastic priming. These properties may support the functional differentiation of allocentric and item information provided to the DG by the MPP and LPP, respectively, that has been proposed by others. We propose that allocentric spatial information, conveyed by the MPP is encoded through hippocampal LTP in a designated synaptic network. This network is refined and optimized to include egocentric contextual information through LTD triggered by LPP inputs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">NRSF deficiency leads to abnormal postnatal development of dentate gyrus and impairment of progenitors in subgranular zone of hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neuron-restrictive silencing factor (NRSF) is a zinc-finger transcription factor that regulates expression of a diverse set of genes. However, NRSF function in brain development still remains elusive. In the present study, we generated NRSF-conditional knockout (NRSF-cKO) mice by <i>hGFAP-Cre/loxp</i> system to study the effect of NRSF deficiency on brain development. Results showed that NRSF conditional knockout caused a smaller hippocampus and a thinner granule cell layer (GCL) in mice. Moreover, the reduction and disarrangement of GFAP+ cells in subgranular zone (SGZ) of NRSF-cKO mice was accompanied with the decreased number of premature neurons, neural stem cells (NSCs) and neural progenitor cells (NPCs), as well as compromising the majority of mitotically active cells. The analysis of postnatal development of hippocampus indicated the existence of an abnormality at postnatal day (P) 8, rather than at P1, in NRSF-cKO mice, although the densities of Ki67+ cells with mitotic ability in dentate gyrus were relatively unaffected at P1 and P8. Meanwhile, NRSF deficiency led to abnormal organization of SGZ at P8 during postnatal development. RNA-Seq analysis revealed 79 deregulated genes in hippocampus of NRSF-cKO mice at P8, which were involved in p53 signal transduction, neuron migration and negative regulation of cell proliferation, etc. The deregulation of p53 pathway in NRSF-cKO mice at P1 and P8 was evidenced, of which p21/Cdkn1a was accumulated in a portion of NSCs and NPCs in hippocampus during postnatal development. Together, these results, for the first time, revealed that NRSF could significantly influence the postnatal development of hippocampus, especially the formation of SGZ.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>How does the brain anticipate information in language? When people perceive speech, low-frequency (&lt;10 Hz) activity in the brain synchronizes with bursts of sound and visual motion. This phenomenon, called cortical stimulus-tracking, is thought to be one way that the brain predicts the timing of upcoming words, phrases, and syllables. In this study, we test whether stimulus-tracking depends on domain-general expertise or on language-specific prediction mechanisms. We go on to examine how the effects of expertise differ between frontal and sensory cortex. We recorded electroencephalography (EEG) from human participants who were experts in either sign language or ballet, and we compared stimulus-tracking between groups while participants watched videos of sign language or ballet. We measured stimulus-tracking by computing coherence between EEG recordings and visual motion in the videos. Results showed that stimulus-tracking depends on domain-general expertise, and not on language-specific prediction mechanisms. At frontal channels, fluent signers showed stronger coherence to sign language than to dance, whereas expert dancers showed stronger coherence to dance than to sign language. At occipital channels, however, the two groups of participants did not show different patterns of coherence. These results are difficult to explain by entrainment of endogenous oscillations, because neither sign language nor dance show any periodicity at the frequencies of significant expertise-dependent stimulus-tracking. These results suggest that the brain may rely on domain-general predictive mechanisms to optimize perception of temporally-predictable stimuli such as speech, sign language, and dance.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Bombesin receptor subtype-3 (BRS3) is an orphan receptor that regulates energy homeostasis. We compared <I>Brs3</I> driver mice with constitutive or inducible Cre recombinase activity. The constitutive BRS3-Cre mice show a reporter signal (Cre-dependent tdTomato) in the adult brain because of lineage tracing in the dentate gyrus, striatal patches, and indusium griseum, in addition to sites previously identified in the inducible BRS3-Cre mice (including hypothalamic and amygdala subregions, and parabrachial nucleus). We detected <I>Brs3</I> reporter expression in the dentate gyrus at day 23 but not at postnatal day 1 or 5 months of age. Hypothalamic sites expressed reporter at all three time points, and striatal patches expressed <I>Brs3</I> reporter at 1 day but not 5 months. Parabrachial nucleus <I>Brs3</I> neurons project to the preoptic area, hypothalamus, amygdala, and thalamus. Both Cre recombinase insertions reduced <I>Brs3</I> mRNA levels and BRS3 function, causing obesity phenotypes of different severity. These results demonstrate that driver mice should be characterized phenotypically and illustrate the need for knock-in strategies with less effect on the endogenous gene.</p>

                Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is increasing rapidly. Hospital acquired infections enhance local outbreaks, impacting the vulnerable populations. Infection prevention and control practices (IPC) refer to all the activities used to reduce the risk of infection spread.  This study aims to estimate the proportion of health care workers (HCWs) who acquired SARS-CoV2 infection, and evaluate their knowledge to IPC and suggest recommendations to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV2 infection.   Methods: This is a cross-sectional study conducted in Egypt from June 8, 2020, till August 19, 2020. A purposive sample of 518 HCWs from different governorates was included in the study. HCWs filled a structured questionnaire developed by the World Health Organization on a Google Form and a printed copy. The questionnaire link was shared on social media forums including HCWs such as Facebook.   Results: The mean age of HCWs was 33±7 and 65% were males. The majority of health care workers were affiliated with the Ministry of Health and Population (62.5%), recruited from Cairo (52.4%), and were physicians (78.2%). About 11% of the HCWs had been infected with SARS-CoV2. Their mean knowledge percent score regarding IPC was 36.19 ± 11.26. The highest rate of infection was among those with little experience (p=0.002), and those worked inside Cairo (p=0.018). About 89% mentioned that the leading cause of infection with SARS-CoV2 was the shortage in Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). About 42% recommended raising the awareness for the importance of IPC to decrease risk of infection.   Conclusions: HCWs had a low score of knowledge toward IPC. There was a considerable proportion of SARS-CoV2 infection among them. Lack of knowledge and shortage of PPE were the contributing factors. It is necessary to provide juniors with IPC training, and hospitals with sufficient PPE.

                Background: Modeling with the complex random phenomena that are frequently observed in reliability engineering, hydrology, ecology, medical science, and agricultural sciences was once thought to be an enigma. Scientists and practitioners agree that an appropriate but simple model is the best choice for this investigation. To address these issues, scientists have previously discussed a variety of bounded and unbounded, simple to complex lifetime models. Methods: We discussed a modified Lehmann type II (ML-II) model as a better approach to modeling bathtub-shaped and asymmetric random phenomena. A number of complementary mathematical and reliability measures were developed and discussed. Furthermore, explicit expressions for the moments, quantile function, and order statistics were developed. Then, we discussed the various shapes of the density and reliability functions over various model parameter choices. The maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method was used to estimate the unknown model parameters, and a simulation study was carried out to evaluate the MLEs' asymptotic behavior. Results: We demonstrated ML- II's dominance over well-known competitors by modeling anxiety in women and electronic data.

                Metagenomic sequencing allows large-scale identification and genomic characterization. Binning is the process of recovering genomes from complex mixtures of sequence fragments (metagenome contigs) of unknown bacteria and archaeal species. Assessing the quality of genomes recovered from metagenomes requires the use of complex pipelines involving many independent steps, often difficult to reproduce and maintain. A comprehensive, automated and easy-to-use computational workflow for the quality assessment of draft prokaryotic genomes, based on container technology, would greatly improve reproducibility and reusability of published results. We present metashot/prok-quality, a container-enabled Nextflow pipeline for quality assessment and genome dereplication. The metashot/prok-quality tool produces genome quality reports that are compliant with the Minimum Information about a Metagenome-Assembled Genome (MIMAG) standard, and can run out-of-the-box on any platform that supports Nextflow, Docker or Singularity, including computing clusters or batch infrastructures in the cloud. metashot/prok-quality is part of the metashot collection of analysis pipelines. Workflow and documentation are available under GPL3 licence on GitHub.

                Background: An economic evaluation alongside the Hydroxychloroquine Effectiveness in Reducing symptoms of hand Osteoarthritis (HERO) trial was undertaken to assess the cost-effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine compared with placebo for symptomatic treatment of hand osteoarthritis for patients with at least moderate hand pain and inadequate response to current therapies. Methods: A trial-based cost–utility analysis was undertaken from the perspective of the UK National Health Service and Personal Social Services over a 12-month time horizon, using evidence from 248 participants included in the HERO trial, conducted in England. Patient-level data were collected prospectively over a 12-month period, using participant-completed questionnaires and investigator forms, to collect healthcare utilisation, costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) using the EQ-5D-5L. The base-case analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis and used multiple imputation methods to deal with missing data. Results were presented in terms of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (incremental cost per QALY) and net health benefit, with uncertainty surrounding the findings explored using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. Results: The base-case analysis estimated slightly lower costs on average (−£11.80; 95% confidence interval (CI) −£15.60 to −£8.00) and marginally fewer QALYs (−0.0052; 95% CI −0.0057 to −0.0047) for participants in the hydroxychloroquine group versus placebo group at 12 months. The resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £2,267 per QALY lost indicated that although costs were saved, health-related quality of life was lost. Even assuming symmetrical preferences regarding losses and gains for health benefits, the findings do not fall within the cost-effective region. Similar findings arose for analyses conducted from the societal perspective and using complete cases only. Conclusions: This economic evaluation indicates that hydroxychloroquine is unlikely to provide a cost-effective pain relief option for improving health-related quality of life in adult patients with moderate-to-severe hand osteoarthritis.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Modeling the impact of early interventions on the transmission dynamics of coronavirus infection [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                A deterministic model is proposed to describe the transmission dynamics of coronavirus infection with early interventions. Epidemiological studies have employed modeling to unravel knowledge that transformed the lives of families, communities, nations and the entire globe. The study established the stability of both disease free and endemic equilibria. Stability occurs when the reproduction number, R0, is less than unity for both disease free and endemic equilibrium points. The global stability of the disease-free equilibrium point of the model is established whenever the basic reproduction number R0 is less than or equal to unity. The reproduction number is also shown to be directly related to the transmission probability (β), rate at which latently infected individuals join the infected class (δ) and rate of recruitment (Λ). It is inversely related to natural death rate (μ), rate of early treatment (τ1), rate of hospitalization of infected individuals (θ) and Covid-induced death rate (σ). The analytical results established are confirmed by numerical simulation of the model.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Identification of microbial agents in tissue specimens of ocular and periocular sarcoidosis using a metagenomics approach [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Metagenomic sequencing has the potential to identify a wide range of pathogens in human tissue samples. Sarcoidosis is a complex disorder whose etiology remains unknown and for which a variety of infectious causes have been hypothesized. We sought to conduct metagenomic sequencing on cases of ocular and periocular sarcoidosis, none of them with previously identified infectious causes. Methods: Archival tissue specimens of 16 subjects with biopsies of ocular and periocular tissues that were positive for non-caseating granulomas were used as cases. Four archival tissue specimens that did not demonstrate non-caseating granulomas were also included as controls. Genomic DNA was extracted from tissue sections. DNA libraries were generated from the extracted genomic DNA and the libraries underwent next-generation sequencing. Results: We generated between 4.8 and 20.7 million reads for each of the 16 cases plus four control samples. For eight of the cases, we identified microbial pathogens that were present well above the background, with one potential pathogen identified for seven of the cases and two possible pathogens for one of the cases. Five of the eight cases were associated with bacteria (Campylobacter concisus, Neisseria elongata, Streptococcus salivarius, Pseudopropionibacterium propionicum, and Paracoccus yeei), two cases with fungi (Exophiala oligosperma, Lomentospora prolificans and Aspergillus versicolor) and one case with a virus (Mupapillomavirus 1). Interestingly, four of the five bacterial species are also part of the human oral microbiome. Conclusions: Using a metagenomic sequencing we identified possible infectious causes in half of the ocular and periocular sarcoidosis cases analyzed. Our findings support the proposition that sarcoidosis could be an etiologically heterogenous disease. Because these are previously banked samples, direct follow-up in the respective patients is impossible, but these results suggest that sequencing may be a valuable tool in better understanding the etiopathogenesis of sarcoidosis and in diagnosing and treating this disease.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The evolutionary history of topological variations in the CPA/AT transporters</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Govindarajan Sudha, Claudio Bassot, John Lamb, Nanjiang Shu, Yan Huang, Arne Elofsson</p>

CPA/AT transporters are made up of scaffold and a core domain. The core domain contains two non-canonical helices (broken or reentrant) that mediate the transport of ions, amino acids or other charged compounds. During evolution, these transporters have undergone substantial changes in structure, topology and function. To shed light on these structural transitions, we create models for all families using an integrated topology annotation method. We find that the CPA/AT transporters can be classified into four fold-types based on their structure; (1) the CPA-broken fold-type, (2) the CPA-reentrant fold-type, (3) the BART fold-type, and (4) a previously not described fold-type, the Reentrant-Helix-Reentrant fold-type. Several topological transitions are identified, including the transition between a broken and reentrant helix, one transition between a loop and a reentrant helix, complete changes of orientation, and changes in the number of scaffold helices. These transitions are mainly caused by gene duplication and shuffling events. Structural models, topology information and other details are presented in a searchable database, CPAfold (cpafold.bioinfo.se).

                Calpains are evolutionarily conserved and widely expressed Ca2+-activated cysteine proteases that act at neutral pH. The activity of calpains is tightly regulated, given that their abnormal activation can have deleterious effects leading to promiscuous cleavage of various targets. Genetic mutations in the genes encoding calpains are associated with human diseases, while abnormally elevated Ca2+ levels promote Ca2+-dependent calpain activation in pathologies associated with ischemic insults and neurodegeneration.

                Autophagy sustains cellular homeostasis and metabolism in numerous diseases. By regulating cancer metabolism, both tumor and microenvironmental autophagy promote tumor growth. However, autophagy can support cancer progression through other biological functions such as immune response regulation or cytokine/growth factor secretion. Moreover, autophagy is induced in numerous tumor types as a resistance mechanism following therapy, highlighting autophagy inhibition as a promising target for anti-cancer therapy. Thus, better understanding the mechanisms involved in tumor growth and resistance regulation through autophagy, which are not fully understood, will provide insights into patient treatment.

Cells preferentially penetrate at less common higher-order vertices, requiring them to sample multiple vertices. Increasing acetylation allows penetration at the more common tricellular vertices that requires less sampling.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Fatty acids impact sarcomere integrity through myristoylation and ER homeostasis</a></h4>

              
                Tang et al. show that fatty acid deficiency causes defects in muscle integrity in the nematode C. elegans and such an impact is mediated by deficiency of lipid modification of specific proteins in the muscle that in turn triggers ER stress and muscle disorganization. The results reveal the regulatory roles of fatty acids and ER homeostasis in muscle maintenance.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Gli1+ progenitors mediate bone anabolic function of teriparatide via Hh and Igf signaling</a></h4>

              
                Gli1+ metaphyseal mesenchymal progenitors (MMPs) are a main source for osteoblasts in postnatal mice. Through single-cell RNA sequencing, Shi et al. find a chondrocyte-like osteoprogenitor (COP) among MMPs. COP is a target of teriparatide, the mainstay of bone anabolic therapy, and requires Hh and Igf signaling for bone formation.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Mds1CreERT2, an inducible Cre allele specific to adult-repopulating hematopoietic stem cells</a></h4>

              
                Zhang et al. develop Mds1CreERT2 mice, which inducibly express Cre-recombinase in emerging fetal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Lineage tracing reveals increasing HSC contributions to hematopoietic cells in E14.5–E16.5 embryos, as well as the majority of macrophages in adult spleen and marrow. Mds1CreERT2 mice will help deconvolute the complexity of hematopoietic ontogeny.

                The molecular basis underlying glioblastoma (GBM) heterogeneity and plasticity is not fully understood. Using transcriptomic data of human patient-derived brain tumor stem cell lines (BTSCs), classified based on GBM-intrinsic signatures, we identify the AP-1 transcription factor <i>FOSL1</i> as a key regulator of the mesenchymal (MES) subtype. We provide a mechanistic basis to the role of the neurofibromatosis type 1 gene (<i>NF1</i>), a negative regulator of the RAS/MAPK pathway, in GBM mesenchymal transformation through the modulation of <i>FOSL1</i> expression. Depletion of <i>FOSL1</i> in <i>NF1</i>-mutant human BTSCs and <i>Kras</i>-mutant mouse neural stem cells results in loss of the mesenchymal gene signature and reduction in stem cell properties and in vivo tumorigenic potential. Our data demonstrate that <i>FOSL1</i> controls GBM plasticity and aggressiveness in response to <i>NF1</i> alterations.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The development of active binocular vision under normal and alternate rearing conditions</a></h4>

              
                The development of binocular vision is an active learning process comprising the development of disparity tuned neurons in visual cortex and the establishment of precise vergence control of the eyes. We present a computational model for the learning and self-calibration of active binocular vision based on the Active Efficient Coding framework, an extension of classic efficient coding ideas to active perception. Under normal rearing conditions with naturalistic input, the model develops disparity tuned neurons and precise vergence control, allowing it to correctly interpret random dot stereograms. Under altered rearing conditions modeled after neurophysiological experiments, the model qualitatively reproduces key experimental findings on changes in binocularity and disparity tuning. Furthermore, the model makes testable predictions regarding how altered rearing conditions impede the learning of precise vergence control. Finally, the model predicts a surprising new effect that impaired vergence control affects the statistics of orientation tuning in visual cortical neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cardiac pathologies in mouse loss of imprinting models are due to misexpression of H19 long noncoding RNA</a></h4>

              
                Maternal loss of imprinting (LOI) at the <i>H19/IGF2</i> locus results in biallelic <i>IGF2</i> and reduced <i>H19</i> expression and is associated with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS). We use mouse models for LOI to understand the relative importance of <i>Igf2</i> and <i>H19</i> mis-expression in BWS phenotypes. Here we focus on cardiovascular phenotypes and show that neonatal cardiomegaly is exclusively dependent on increased <i>Igf2</i>. Circulating IGF2 binds cardiomyocyte receptors to hyperactivate mTOR signaling, resulting in cellular hyperplasia and hypertrophy. These <i>Igf2</i>-dependent phenotypes are transient: cardiac size returns to normal once <i>Igf2</i> expression is suppressed postnatally. However, reduced <i>H19</i> expression is sufficient to cause progressive heart pathologies including fibrosis and reduced ventricular function. In the heart, <i>H19</i> expression is primarily in endothelial cells (ECs) and regulates EC differentiation both, <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. Finally, we establish novel mouse models to show that cardiac phenotypes depend on <i>H19</i> lncRNA interactions with <i>Mirlet7 </i>microRNAs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Dual mechanisms of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the inspiratory rhythm-generating network</a></h4>

              
                The analgesic utility of opioid-based drugs is limited by the life-threatening risk of respiratory depression. Opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD), mediated by the μ-opioid receptor (MOR), is characterized by a pronounced decrease in the frequency and regularity of the inspiratory rhythm, which originates from the medullary preBӧtzinger Complex (preBӧtC). To unravel the cellular- and network-level consequences of MOR activation in the preBӧtC, MOR- expressing neurons were optogenetically identified and manipulated in transgenic mice <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Based on these results, a model of OIRD was developed <i>in silico</i>. We conclude that hyperpolarization of MOR<i>-</i>expressing preBӧtC neurons alone does not phenocopy OIRD. Instead, the effects of MOR activation are twofold: 1) pre-inspiratory spiking is reduced and 2) excitatory synaptic transmission is suppressed, thereby disrupting network-driven rhythmogenesis. These dual mechanisms of opioid action act synergistically to make the normally robust inspiratory rhythm generating network particularly prone to collapse when challenged with exogenous opioids.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">KLF10 integrates circadian timing and sugar signaling to coordinate hepatic metabolism</a></h4>

              
                The mammalian circadian timing system and metabolism are highly interconnected, and disruption of this coupling is associated with negative health outcomes. Krüppel-like factors (KLFs) are transcription factors that govern metabolic homeostasis in various organs. Many KLFs show a circadian expression in the liver. Here, we show that the loss of the clock-controlled KLF10 in hepatocytes results in extensive reprogramming of the mouse liver circadian transcriptome, which in turn, alters the temporal coordination of pathways associated with energy metabolism. We also show that glucose and fructose induce <i>Klf10, </i>which helps mitigate glucose intolerance and hepatic steatosis in mice challenged with a sugar beverage. Functional genomics further reveal that KLF10 target genes are primarily involved in central carbon metabolism. Together, these findings show that in the liver, KLF10 integrates circadian timing and sugar metabolism related signaling, and serves as a transcriptional brake that protects against the deleterious effects of increased sugar consumption.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">How will mosquitoes adapt to climate warming?</a></h4>

              
                The potential for adaptive evolution to enable species persistence under a changing climate is one of the most important questions for understanding impacts of future climate change. Climate adaptation may be particularly likely for short-lived ectotherms, including many pest, pathogen, and vector species. For these taxa, estimating climate adaptive potential is critical for accurate predictive modeling and public health preparedness. Here, we demonstrate how a simple theoretical framework used in conservation biology—evolutionary rescue models—can be used to investigate the potential for climate adaptation in these taxa, using mosquito thermal adaptation as a focal case. Synthesizing current evidence, we find that short mosquito generation times, high population growth rates, and strong temperature-imposed selection favor thermal adaptation. However, knowledge gaps about the extent of phenotypic and genotypic variation in thermal tolerance within mosquito populations, the environmental sensitivity of selection, and the role of phenotypic plasticity constrain our ability to make more precise estimates. We describe how common garden and selection experiments can be used to fill these data gaps. Lastly, we investigate the consequences of mosquito climate adaptation on disease transmission using <i>Aedes aegypti</i>-transmitted dengue virus in Northern Brazil as a case study. The approach outlined here can be applied to any disease vector or pest species and type of environmental change.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cost-precision trade-off relation determines the optimal morphogen gradient for accurate biological pattern formation</a></h4>

              
                Spatial boundaries formed during animal development originate from the pre-patterning of tissues by signaling molecules, called morphogens. The accuracy of boundary location is limited by the fluctuations of morphogen concentration that thresholds the expression level of target gene. Producing more morphogen molecules, which gives rise to smaller relative fluctuations, would better serve to shape more precise target boundaries; however, it incurs more thermodynamic cost. In the classical diffusion-depletion model of morphogen profile formation, the morphogen molecules synthesized from a local source display an exponentially decaying concentration profile with a characteristic length λ. Our theory suggests that in order to attain a precise profile with the minimal cost, <i>λ </i>should be roughly half the distance to the target boundary position from the source. Remarkably, we find that the profiles of morphogens that pattern the <i>Drosophila </i>embryo and wing imaginal disk are formed with nearly optimal<i> λ</i>. Our finding underscores the thermodynamic cost as a key physical constraint in the morphogen profile formation in <i>Drosophila</i> development.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Receptor repertoires of murine follicular T helper cells reveal a high clonal overlap in separate lymph nodes in autoimmunity</a></h4>

              
                Follicular T helper cells (Tfh) are a specialized subset of CD4 effector T cells that are crucial for germinal center (GC) reactions and for selecting B cells to undergo affinity maturation. Despite this central role for humoral immunity, only few data exist about their clonal distribution when multiple lymphoid organs are exposed to the same antigen (Ag) as it is the case in autoimmunity. Here, we used an autoantibody-mediated disease model of the skin and injected one auto-Ag into the two footpads of the same mouse and analyzed the T cell receptor (TCR)β sequences of Tfh located in GCs of both contralateral draining lymph nodes. We found that over 90% of the dominant GC-Tfh clonotypes were shared in both lymph nodes but only transiently. The initially dominant Tfh clonotypes especially declined after establishment of chronic disease while GC reaction and autoimmune disease continued. Our data demonstrates a dynamic behavior of Tfh clonotypes under autoimmune conditions and emphasizes the importance of the time point for distinguishing auto-Ag-specific Tfh clonotypes from potential bystander activated ones.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">An in vitro stem cell model of human epiblast and yolk sac interaction</a></h4>

              
                Human embryogenesis entails complex signalling interactions between embryonic and extra-embryonic cells. However, how extra-embryonic cells direct morphogenesis within the human embryo remains largely unknown due to a lack of relevant stem cell models. Here, we have established conditions to differentiate human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into yolk sac-like cells (YSLCs) that resemble the post-implantation human hypoblast molecularly and functionally. YSLCs induce the expression of pluripotency and anterior ectoderm markers in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) at the expense of mesoderm and endoderm markers. This activity is mediated by the release of BMP and WNT signalling pathway inhibitors, and, therefore, resembles the functioning of the anterior visceral endoderm signalling centre of the mouse embryo, which establishes the anterior-posterior axis. Our results implicate the yolk sac in epiblast cell fate specification in the human embryo and propose YSLCs as a tool for studying post-implantation human embryo development <i>in vitro.</i>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Insulin-producing β-cells regenerate ectopically from a mesodermal origin under the perturbation of hemato-endothelial specification</a></h4>

              
                To investigate the role of the vasculature in pancreatic β-cell regeneration, we crossed a zebrafish β-cell ablation model into the avascular <i>npas4l</i> mutant (i.e. <i>cloche</i>). Surprisingly, β-cell regeneration increased markedly in <i>npas4l</i> mutants owing to the ectopic differentiation of β-cells in the mesenchyme, a phenotype not previously reported in any models. The ectopic β-cells expressed endocrine markers of pancreatic β-cells, and also responded to glucose with increased calcium influx. Through lineage tracing, we determined that the vast majority of these ectopic β-cells has a mesodermal origin. Notably, ectopic β-cells were found in <i>npas4l</i> mutants as well as following knockdown of the endothelial/myeloid determinant Etsrp. Together, these data indicate that under the perturbation of endothelial/myeloid specification, mesodermal cells possess a remarkable plasticity enabling them to form β-cells, which are normally endodermal in origin. Understanding the restriction of this differentiation plasticity will help exploit an alternative source for β-cell regeneration.

                De novo mutations in voltage- and ligand-gated channels have been associated with an increasing number of cases of developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, which often fail to respond to classic antiseizure medications. Here, we examine two knock-in mouse models replicating de novo mutations in the HCN1 voltage-gated channel gene, p.G391D and p.M153I (Hcn1G380D/+ and Hcn1M142I/+ in mouse), associated with severe drugresistant neonatal- and childhood-onset epilepsy, respectively. Heterozygous mice from both lines displayed spontaneous generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Hcn1G380D/+ animals had an overall more severe phenotype, with pronounced alterations in the levels and distribution of HCN1 protein, including disrupted targeting to the axon terminals of basket cell interneurons. In line with clinical reports from HCN1 patients, administration of the antiepileptic Na+ channel antagonists lamotrigine and phenytoin resulted in the paradoxical induction of seizures in both lines, consistent with an effect to further impair inhibitory neuron function. We also show that these variants can render HCN1 channels unresponsive to classic antagonists, indicating the need to screen mutated channels to identify novel compounds with diverse mechanism of action. Our results underscore the need to tailor effective therapies for specific channel gene variants, and how strongly validated animal models may provide an invaluable tool towards reaching this objective.

                We apply the Triple Correlation Uniqueness (TCU) theorem to the most basic representation of network spiking activity, the raster, to prove that third-order (triple) correlation uniquely characterizes spiking activity in the brain. As a consequence, the three-node (triple) motifs comprising the triple correlation are fundamental building blocks of neuronal activity. By analysing the putative flow of information in these motifs, we group all possible motifs into fourteen motif-classes. These motif-classes embody well-known and well-studied properties in neuroscience, e.g. spike rate, local dynamics, synchrony, feedback, feedforward, convergence, and divergence. We show that motifs with some of these properties---divergence, convergence, and feedforward---are far more prevalent in the triple correlation; and thus, these properties contribute more to characterizing neural activity than do the other properties. In the frequency domain, the triple correlation is the bispectrum, which characterizes the phase-relationship between spike trains and the relationships between frequency bands. We apply these analyses to example rasters to illustrate the dependence of our characterization on the firing patterns underlying neural activity.

                High-cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) often disrupts respiratory motor pathways and disables breathing in the affected population. Moreover, cervically injured individuals are at risk for developing acute lung injury (ALI), which predicts substantial mortality rates. While the correlation between ALI and SCI has been found in the clinical setting, the field lacks an animal model to interrogate the fundamental biology of this relationship. To begin to address this gap, we performed an experimental cervical SCI and assessed lung injury in adult rats. We demonstrate that animals display signs of ALI two weeks post-SCI. We also observed aberrant N-glycan metabolism determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging. Collectively, we establish for the first time a model of ALI after SCI at an acute time point that can be used to monitor the progression of lung damage, as well as identify potential targets to ameliorate ALI.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Columnar localization and laminar origin of cortical surface electrical potentials</a></h4>

              
                Electrocorticography (ECoG) methodologically bridges basic neuroscience and understanding of human brains in health and disease. However, the localization of ECoG signals across the surface of the brain and the spatial distribution of their generating neuronal sources are poorly understood. To address this gap, we recorded from rat auditory cortex using customized microECoG, and simulated cortical surface electrical potentials with a full-scale, biophysically detailed cortical column model. Experimentally, microECoG-derived auditory representations were tonotopically organized and signals were anisotropically localized to 200 micrometers, i.e., a single cortical column. Biophysical simulations reproduce experimental findings, and indicate that neurons in cortical layers V and VI contribute ~85% of evoked high-gamma signal recorded at the surface. Cell number and synchronicity were the primary biophysical properties determining laminar contributions to evoked microECoG signals, while distance was only a minimal factor. Thus, evoked microECoG signals primarily originate from neurons in the infragranular layers of a single cortical column.

                We describe a framework where a biologically plausible spiking neural network mimicking hippocampal layers learns a cognitive map known as the successor representation. We show analytically how, on the algorithmic level, the learning follows the TD(lambda) algorithm, which emerges from the underlying spike-timing dependent plasticity rule. We then analyze the implications of this framework, uncovering how behavioural activity and experience replays can play complementary roles when learning the representation of the environment, how we can learn relations over behavioural timescales with synaptic plasticity acting on the range of milliseconds, and how the learned representation can be flexibly encoded by allowing state-dependent delay discounting through neuromodulation and altered firing rates.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Molecular signature and target-specificity of inhibitory circuits formed by Martinotti cells in the mouse barrel cortex</a></h4>

              
                In the neocortex, fast synaptic inhibition orchestrates both spontaneous and sensory-evoked activity. GABAergic interneurons (INs) inhibit pyramidal neurons (PNs) directly, modulating their output activity and thus contributing to balance cortical networks. Moreover, several IN subtypes also inhibit other INs, forming specific disinhibitory circuits, which play crucial roles in several cognitive functions. Here, we studied a homogeneous subpopulation of somatostatin (SST)-positive INs, the Martinotti cells (MCs) in layer 2/3 of the mouse barrel cortex (both sexes). MCs are a prominent IN subclass inhibiting the distal portion of PN apical dendrites, thus controlling dendrite electrogenesis and synaptic integration. Yet, it is poorly understood whether MCs inhibit other elements of the cortical circuits, and the connectivity properties with non-PN targets are unknown. We found that MCs have a strong preference for PN dendrites, but they also considerably connect with parvalbumin (PV)-positive, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing and layer 1 (L1) INs. Remarkably, GABAergic synapses from MCs exhibited clear cell-type-specific short-term plasticity. Moreover, whereas the biophysical properties of MC-PN synapses were consistent with distal dendritic inhibition, MC-IN synapses exhibited characteristics of fast perisomatic inhibition. Finally, MC-PN connections used 5-containing GABAARs, but this subunit was not expressed by the other INs targeted by MCs. We reveal a specialized connectivity blueprint of MCs within different elements of superficial cortical layers. In addition, our results identify 5-GABAARs as the molecular fingerprint of MC-PN dendritic inhibition. This is of critical importance, given the role of 5-GABAARs in cognitive performance and their involvement in several brain diseases.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Differences in working memory coding of biological motion attributed to oneself and others</a></h4>

              
                The question how the brain distinguishes between information about oneself and the rest of the world is of fundamental interest to both philosophy and neuroscience. This question can be approached empirically by investigating how associating stimuli with oneself leads to differences in neurocognitive processing. However, little is known about the brain network involved in forming such self-associations for, specifically, bodily stimuli. In this fMRI study, we sought to distinguish the neural substrates of representing a full-body movement as one's movement and as someone else's movement. Participants performed a delayed match-to-sample working memory task where a retained full-body movement (displayed using point-light walkers) was arbitrarily labelled as one's own movement or as performed by someone else. By using arbitrary associations we aimed to address a limitation of previous studies, namely that our own movements are more familiar to us than movements of other people. A searchlight multivariate decoding analysis was used to test where information about types of movement and about self-association was coded. Movement specific activation patterns was found in a network of regions also involved in perceptual processing of movement stimuli, however not in early sensory regions. Information about whether a memorized movement was associated with the self or with another person was found to be coded by activity in the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG), left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), bilateral supplementary motor area, and (at reduced threshold) in the left temporoparietal junction (TPJ). These areas are frequently reported as involved in action understanding (IFG, MFG) and domain-general self/other distinction (TPJ). Finally, in univariate analysis we found that selecting a self-associated movement for retention was related to increased activity in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Association between Neighborhood Socioeconomic Status and Executive System Activation in Youth</a></h4>

              
                Low socioeconomic status has been shown to have detrimental effects on cognitive performance, including working memory (WM). As executive systems that support WM undergo functional neurodevelopment during adolescence, environmental stressors at both the individual and community levels may have a particularly strong impact on cognitive outcomes. Here, we sought to examine how neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) impacts task-related activation of the executive system during adolescence and to determine whether this effect mediates the relationship between neighborhood SES and WM performance. To address these questions, we studied 1,158 youths (age 8-22) that completed a fractal n-back WM task during fMRI at 3T as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort. We found that higher neighborhood SES was associated with greater activation of the executive system to WM load, including the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, posterior parietal cortex, and precuneus. These associations remained significant when controlling for related factors like parental education and exposure to traumatic events. Furthermore, high dimensional multivariate mediation analysis identified two distinct patterns of brain activity within the executive system that significantly mediated the relationship between neighborhood SES and task performance. Together, these findings underscore the importance of neighborhood environment in shaping executive system function and WM in youth.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">In silico Analysis of Transcriptomic Profiling and Affected Biological pathways in Multiple Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune, inflammatory neurological disease that is widely associated with Grey and white matter degradation due to the demyelination of axons. Thus exposing the underlying causes of this condition can lead to a novel treatment approach for Multiple Sclerosis. The total RNA microarray processed data from GEO for Multiple sclerotic patients was comprehensively analyzed to find out underlying differences between Grey Matter lesions (GML), Normal appearing Grey Matter (NAGM), and Control Grey matter at the transcriptomics level. Thus, in the current study, we performed various bioinformatics analyses on transcriptional profiles of 184 samples including 105 NAGM, 37 GML, and 42 Controls obtained from the NCBI-Bio project (PRJNA543111). First, exploratory data analysis based on gene expression data using principal component analysis (PCA) depicted distinct patterns between GML and CG samples. Subsequently, the Welch T-test differential gene expression analysis identified 15,525 significantly differentially expressed genes (p.adj value <0.05, Fold change(>=+/-1.5) between these conditions. This study reveals the genes like CREB3L2, KIF5B, WIPI1, EP300, NDUFA1, ATG101, AND TAF4 as the key features that may substantially contribute to loss of cognitive functions in Multiple sclerosis and several other neurodegenerative disorders. Further, this study also proposes genes associated with Huntington disease in Multiple sclerotic patients. Eventually, the results presented here reveal new insights into MS and how it affects the development of male primary sexual characteristics.

                Background and Purpose: No effective treatment is available for most patients who suffer ischemic stroke. Development of novel treatment options is imperative. The brain attempts to self-heal after ischemic stroke via various mechanism mediated by restored blood circulation in affected region of brain but this process is limited by inadequate angiogenesis or neoangiogenesis. Encephalomyosynangiosis (EMS) is a neurosurgical procedure that achieves angiogenesis with low morbidity in patients with moyamoya disease, reducing risk of stroke. However, EMS, surgery has never been studied as an therapeutic option after ischemic stroke. Here we described a novel procedure and feasibility data for EMS after ischemic stroke in mice. Methods: A 60 mins of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) was used to induce ischemic stroke in mice. After 3-4 hours of MCAo onset/sham, EMS was performed. Mortality of EMS, MCAo and. MCAo+EMS mice was recorded up to 21 days after surgery. Graft tissue viability was measured using a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide reduced tetrazolium reductase assay. Results: EMS surgery after ischemic stroke does not increase mortality compared to stroke alone. Graft muscle tissue remained viable 21 days after surgery. Conclusions: This novel protocol is effective and well-tolerated, may serve as novel platform for new angiogenesis and thus recovery after ischemic stroke. If successful in mice, EMS can a very feasible and novel treatment option for ischemic stroke in humans.

                Calcium imaging using GCaMP calcium indicators and miniature microscopes has been used to image cellular populations during long timescales and in different task phases, as well as to determine neuronal circuit topology and organization. Because the hippocampus (HPC) is essential for many tasks of memory, spatial navigation, and learning, calcium imaging of large populations of HPC neurons can provide new insight on cell changes and organization over time during these tasks. To our knowledge, all reported HPC in vivo calcium imaging experiments have been done in mouse. However, rats have many behavioral and physiological experimental advantages over mice, and, due to their larger size, rats are able to support larger implants, thereby enabling the recording of a greater number of cells. In this paper, we present the first in vivo calcium imaging from CA1 hippocampus in freely moving rats. Using GCaMP7c and the UCLA Miniscope, we demonstrate that hundreds of cells (mean 240+-90 cells per session, maximum 428 cells) can reliably be visualized and held across weeks, and that calcium events in these cells are correlated with periods of movement. We additionally show proof of method by showing that an extremely high percent of place cells (82.3%+-8.1%, far surpassing the percent seen during mouse calcium imaging) can be recorded on a navigational task, and that these place cells enable accurately decoding of animal position. Finally, we show that calcium imaging is rats is not prone to photobleaching during hour-long recordings and that cells can be reliably recorded for an hour or more per session. A detailed protocol for this technique, including notes on the numerous parameter changes needed to use Ca2+ in rats, is included in the Materials and Methods section, and implications of these advancements are discussed.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Extracellular cues accelerate neurogenesis of induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons</a></h4>

              
                Neurogenesis is a complex process encompassing neuronal progenitor cell expansion/proliferation and differentiation, followed by neuron maturation. In vivo models are most commonly used to study neurogenesis; however, human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived (iPSC) neurons are increasingly used to establish cellular models of human neurological processes. Unfortunately, the differentiation and maturation of iPSC-derived neurons varies in methodology, is asynchronous, and has restricted experimental utility because of extended differentiation/maturation times. To accelerate and standardize iPS neuronal maturation, we differentiated and matured feeder layer-free iPSC-derived neuronal cultures under physiological oxygen levels (5%), and modified the underlying extracellular matrix and medium composition. Our results demonstrate that calretinin gene expression occurred earlier under our optimized iPS conditions and the corresponding neurogenesis burst associated with proliferative expansion occurred more synchronously, reliably emerging two and three weeks after differentiation. As expected, the expression of mature neuronal markers (i.e., NeuN+/Calbindin+) started at 4-weeks post-differentiation. qPCR microarray, western blot and single cell analyses using high content imaging indicated that 4-week iPS neuronal cultures were non-cycling with decreased expression of cyclin D1 and Ki67. Our data demonstrate that extracellular cues influence the kinetics of neurogenesis models and that feeder layer-free iPSC-derived neurogenesis can be reproducibly miniaturized.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinct neural circuits establish the same chemosensory behavior in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                Animals frequently exhibit the same behavior under different environmental or physiological conditions. To what extent these behaviors are generated by similar vs. distinct mechanisms is unclear. Moreover, the circumstances under which divergent neural mechanisms establish the same behavior, and the molecular signals that regulate the same behavior across conditions, are poorly understood. We show that in C. elegans, distinct neural mechanisms mediate the same chemosensory behavior at two different life stages. Both dauer larvae and starved adults are attracted to carbon dioxide (CO2), but CO2 attraction is mediated by distinct sets of interneurons at the two life stages. Some interneurons mediate CO2 response only in dauers, some show CO2-evoked activity in adults and dauers but contribute to CO2 response only in adults, and some show CO2-evoked activity that opposes CO2 attraction in adults but promotes CO2 attraction in dauers. We also identify a novel role for insulin signaling in establishing life stage-specific CO2 responses by modulating interneuron activity. Further, we show that a combinatorial code of both shared and life-stage-specific molecular signals regulate CO2 attraction. Our results identify a mechanism by which the same chemosensory behavior can be generated by distinct neural circuits, revealing an unexpected complexity to chemosensory processing.

                The spatial location of cerebrospinal fluid contacting (CSF-c) neurons enables important regulatory homeostatic functions regarding pH and motion control. Their intricate organization, facing the central canal and extending across the spinal cord, in relation to specific subtypes is poorly understood. This calls for imaging methods with a high spatial resolution (5-10 nm) to resolve the synaptic and ciliary compartments of each individual cell to elucidate their signalling pathways and enough throughput to dissect the cellular organization. Here, light-sheet and expansion microscopy resolved the persistent ventral and lateral organization of dopamine and somatostatin CSF-c neuronal types. The number of somatostatin-containing dense core vesicles, resolved by STED microscopy, was shown to be markedly reduced upon each exposure to alkaline or acidic pH inhibiting any movement as part of a homeostatic response. Their cilia symmetry was unravelled by ExSTED as sensory in contrast with the motile one found in the dopaminergic ph insensitive neurons. This novel experimental workflow elucidates the functional role of CSF-c neuron subtypes in situ paving the way for further spatial and functional cell type classification.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The role of visual experience in brain inter-individual variability</a></h4>

              
                Visual cortex organization is highly consistent across individuals. But to what degree does this consistency depend on life experience, in particular sensory experience? In this study, we asked whether visual cortex reorganization in congenital blindness results in connectivity patterns that are particularly variable across individuals, focusing on resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) patterns from primary visual cortex. We show that the absence of shared visual experience results in more-variable RSFC patterns across blind individuals than sighted controls. Increased variability is specifically found in areas that show a group difference between the blind and sighted in their RSFC. These findings reveal a relationship between brain plasticity and individual variability in which reorganization manifests variably across individuals. We further investigated the different patterns of reorganization in the blind, showing that the connectivity to frontal regions, proposed to have a role in reorganization of the visual cortex of the blind towards higher cognitive roles, is highly variable. In a supplementary analysis, we link some of the variability in visual-to-frontal connectivity to another environmental factor - duration of formal education. Together, these findings show a role of sensory and socioeconomic experience in imposing consistency on brain organization. By revealing the idiosyncratic nature of neural reorganization, these findings highlight the importance of considering individual differences in fitting sensory aids and restoration approaches for vision loss.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Complexity of brain dynamics as a correlate of consciousness in anaesthetized monkeys</a></h4>

              
                The use of anaesthesia is a fundamental tool in the investigation of consciousness. Anesthesia procedures allow to investigate different states of consciousness from sedation to deep anesthesia within controlled scenarios. In this study we use information quantifiers to measure the complexity of electrocorticogram recordings in monkeys. We apply these metrics to compare different stages of general anesthesia for evaluating consciousness in several anesthesia protocols. We find that the complexity of brain activity can be used as a correlate of consciousness. For two of the anaesthetics used, propofol and medetomidine, we find that the anaesthetised state is accompanied by a reduction in the complexity of brain activity. On the other hand we observe that use of ketamine produces an increase in complexity measurements. We relate this observation with increase activity within certain brain regions associated with the ketamine used doses. Our measurements indicate that complexity of brain activity is a good indicator for a general evaluation of different levels of consciousness awareness, both in anesthetized and non anesthetizes states.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spatiotemporally Resolved Multivariate Pattern Analysis for M/EEG</a></h4>

              
                An emerging goal in neuroscience is tracking what information is represented in brain activity over time as a participant completes some task. Whilst EEG and MEG offer millisecond temporal resolution of how activity patterns emerge and evolve, standard decoding methods present significant barriers to interpretability as they obscure the underlying spatial and temporal activity patterns. We instead propose the use of a generative encoding model framework that simultaneously infers the multivariate spatial patterns of activity and the variable timing at which these patterns emerge on individual trials. An encoding model inversion allows predictions to be made about unseen test data in the same way as in standard decoding methodology. These SpatioTemporally Resolved MVPA (STRM) models can be flexibly applied to a wide variety of experimental paradigms, including classification and regression tasks. We show that these models provide insightful maps of the activity driving predictive accuracy metrics; demonstrate behaviourally meaningful variation in the timing of pattern emergence on individual trials; and achieve predictive accuracies that are either equivalent or surpass those achieved by more widely used methods. This provides a new avenue for investigating the brain's representational dynamics and could ultimately support more flexible experimental designs in future.

	<p>Oncologic and traumatic neurosurgery may have to cope with the issue of skull base defects, which are associated with increased risk of meningitis, epidural abscess and cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) leak. The aim of skull base reconstruction is to repair the dural exposure and to separate the intracranial contents from the nonsterile sino-nasal cavities and extracranial space. Currently, many different surgical techniques have been described, and one of the most performed is the use free flap. In the present paper we performed a case-based update and literature review of the use of chimeric anterolateral thigh free flap harvested from rectus femoris, reporting the case of a 68-year-old man with recurrent spheno-ethmoidalis plane meningioma.</p>

	<p>Over the last few decades, work in affective neuroscience has increasingly investigated the neural basis of emotion. A central debate in the field, when studying individuals with brain damage, has been whether emotional processes are lateralized or not. This review aims to expand this debate, by considering the need to include a hierarchical dimension to the problem. The historical journey of the diverse literature is presented, particularly focusing on the need to develop a research program that explores the neural basis of a wide range of emotional processes (perception, expression, experience, regulation, decision making, etc.), and also its relation to lateralized cortical and deep-subcortical brain structures. Of especial interest is the study of the interaction between emotional components; for example, between emotion generation and emotion regulation. Finally, emerging evidence from lesion studies is presented regarding the neural basis of emotion-regulation strategies, for which the issue of laterality seems most relevant. It is proposed that, because emotion-regulation strategies are complex higher-order cognitive processes, the question appears to be not the lateralization of the entire emotional process, but the lateralization of the specific cognitive tools we use to manage our feelings, in a range of different ways.</p>

	<p>Background: Inflammatory markers association with many diseases is the subject of many articles and reviews. This study presents a comprehensive bibliometric review and visualization analysis of inflammatory biomarkers (IB) in the context of febrile seizure (FS) patients. Methods: The study focused on IB in FS using (1) bibliometric analysis specific indicators and maps in order to analyze and present the network of authors, journals, universities, and countries, and (2) automated literature screening and unsupervised clustering approach for filtering and topic cluster identification. Results: We conducted a literature mining search on FS research, specifically IB in the context of FS, using the automated tools VOSviewer and Bibliometrix. Indices of the inflammatory response (in the context of febrile seizures) identified by the literature mining are (pro/anti-inflammatory) cytokines, such as interleukin IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, I-10, IL-22, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet count (PLT), and red blood cell distribution width (RDW). The resulted bibliometric maps and topic clusters offer a comprehensive overview, the status and leading trends on existing research of inflammatory biomarkers in FS. Conclusion: The analysis using bibliometrics and review with graphical presentations can be useful in investigating and (better) understanding the relationship between FS and IB.</p>

                Essential worker absenteeism has been a pressing problem in the COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly 20% of US hospitals experienced staff shortages, exhausting replacement pools and at times requiring COVID-positive healthcare workers to remain at work. To our knowledge there are no data-informed models examining how different staffing strategies affect epidemic dynamics...

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Activation of estrogen receptors is thought to modulate cognitive function in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and striatum by affecting both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission. The entorhinal cortex is a major source of cortical sensory and associational input to the hippocampus, but it is unclear whether either estrogens or progestogens may modulate cognitive function through effects on synaptic transmission in the entorhinal cortex. This study assessed the effects of the brief application of either 17-β estradiol (E2) or progesterone on excitatory glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the female rat entorhinal cortex in vitro. Rats were ovariectomized on postnatal day (PD) 63 and also received subdermal E2 implants to maintain constant low levels of circulating E2 on par with estrus. Electrophysiological recordings from brain slices were obtained between PD70 and PD86, and field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) reflecting the activation of the superficial layers of the entorhinal cortex were evoked by the stimulation of layer I afferents. The application of E2 (10 nM) for 20 min resulted in a small increase in the amplitude of fEPSPs that reversed during the 30-min washout period. The application of the ERα agonist propylpyrazoletriol (PPT) (100 nM) or the β agonist DPN (1 μM) did not significantly affect synaptic responses. However, the application of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor-1 (GPER1) agonist G1 (100 nM) induced a reversible increase in fEPSP amplitude similar to that induced by E2. Furthermore, the potentiation of responses induced by G1 was blocked by the GPER1 antagonist G15 (1 μM). Application of progesterone (100 nM) or its metabolite allopregnanolone (1 μM) did not significantly affect synaptic responses. The potentiation of synaptic transmission in the entorhinal cortex induced by the activation of GPER1 receptors may contribute to the modulation of cognitive function in female rats.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prevalence of malaria and quantification of cytokine levels during infection in East Nile locality, Khartoum State: a cross-sectional study [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The cytokines interferon gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin-10 (IL-10) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF- α) play an important role in malaria infection. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of malaria and to evaluate cytokine responses to malaria infection in patients from the East Nile locality of Khartoum State. Methods: This study was carried out from May to July 2018 in the East Nile Locality, Khartoum State. Blood samples were collected from 384 randomly selected patients for blood film analysis. Of these, 39 were selected for cytokine level analysis (10 control and 29 patient samples), determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Results: The malaria prevalence rate among 384 patients was 18.5%. Plasmodium falciparum was the most prevalent (13%), while the prevalence of Plasmodium vivax was 4.6%. The rate of mixed infection was 0.8%. There was a higher prevalence rate (22.7%) in males than females (15.6%). However, we found no significant correlation between cytokine levels and parasitemia in the study group. Nevertheless, our study demonstrated a significant correlation between cytokine levels and recurrent infections. Conclusions: Together, our data show that malaria remains a public health problem in East Nile locality with a high prevalence. Additionally, serum levels of IFN- γ and TNF- α were significantly higher in malaria-infected individuals compared to non-infecting individuals and cytokine levels were found to be correlated with recurrent malaria infection.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The impact of vitamin D supplementation on peripheral neuropathy in a sample of Egyptian prediabetic individuals [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Vitamin D deficiency is seen more frequently in diabetic patients with distal symmetrical polyneuropathy. Unfortunately, there is a shortage of data concerning prediabetic individuals with peripheral neuropathy (PN). Therefore, we aimed to study the association of vitamin D deficiency with PN severity and to determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on PN in prediabetics. Methods: A case-control study was conducted consisting of 178 prediabetic individuals recruited from the outpatient department of the National Institute of Diabetes and Endocrinology, Cairo, Egypt. All patients were screened for PN using clinical examination and Douleur Neuropathique 4 diagnostic questionnaire (DN4). They were divided into 89 patients with and 89 patients without PN (group A and B). Group A was assessed for neuropathic severity using the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ). In addition, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, ionized calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone (PTH), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting blood glucose (FBG), 2-hour post 75g glucose (2h-75g glucose) and lipid profile were measured. Prediabetic patients with PN were given vitamin D3 200.000 IU IM monthly for three months. After three months, clinical assessment, DN4, SF-MPQ and all laboratory measures were repeated. Results: Vitamin D level was negatively correlated with neuropathy score and severity (r = -0.65, -0.47, p <0.001) among group A. Moreover, vitamin D level was an independent predictor of neuropathic severity (odds ratio -0.18, 95% CI -0.33 -0.03, P ≤ 0.05). Supplementation of vitamin D resulted in a highly significant improvement in glycemic parameters and lipid profile, p ≤ 0.001. Interestingly, neuropathy score and severity before vitamin D supplementation were (6.4 ± 1.6 and 28.3 ± 7.2) and after became (2.5 ± 0.9 and 17 ± 6.3, p ≤ 0.001). Conclusion: Vitamin D deficiency is an independent risk factor for PN. Correction of vitamin D deficiency improves glycemic parameters, PN score and severity.

                Background: The prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD) with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is rising, but the optimal treatment remains unclear. The present study aims to investigate the impact of revascularization (coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)) and medical therapy (MT) on LVEF recovery in patients with CAD and LVEF ≤ 40%. Methods: All clinical studies which reported LVEF in patients with CAD and LVEF ≤ 40% undergoing either revascularization or MT were included. A systematic literature search up to May 11, 2017 was performed on MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library in Ovid. Studies were assessed for eligibility and data were extracted by independent reviewers in duplicate with disagreements resolved by a third reviewer. Bias assessment was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Random effect meta-analysis was performed on included studies. The primary outcome was change in LVEF after intervention as compared to baseline. Results: 83 cohort studies with a total of 7,157 patients were included. We observed a statistically significant increase in LVEF following revascularization with CABG (MD 7.76; 95% CI: 6.81 to 8.70; p<0.00001; I2=99%) and PCI (MD 6.70; 95% CI: 4.71 to 8.70; p<0.00001; I2=94%) but not after MT (MD 4.06; 95% CI: -2.12 to 10.24; p=0.20; I2=98%). Conclusion: In patients with CAD and LVEF ≤ 40%, revascularization leads to LVEF recovery as compared to MT. There is continued need for RCT level evidence to enable optimization of treatment selection in this difficult population.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Chlorpyrifos and other pesticide exposure and suspected developmental delay in children aged under 5 years: a case-control study in Phitsanulok, Thailand [version 4; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Developmental delay among children under 5 years of age is a serious global public health problem and much research has been carried out to find potential causes. Pesticides - especially organophosphates - are suspected to be one of the main causes of the problem.  This study aimed to investigate the association between pesticide use by the mother during pregnancy and preschool children development using a case-control study. Methods: Data on prenatal and postnatal pesticide exposure of 442 children with suspected developmental delay, and 413 controls with normal development were included for analysis. The children were matched for gender, age, and residency. Data on pesticide exposure were collected via interview with the mother, and data on pregnancy outcomes abstracted from hospital records.   Results: Chlorpyrifos exposure significantly increased the risk of developmental delay with an odds ratio (OR) of 3.71 (95% CI 1.03-13.36) for ever use of the pesticide, and an OR of 5.92 (95% CI 1.01-34.68) for postnatal exposure (p <0.05). Some other pesticides also had a positive association with developmental delay but none were statistically significant (p <0.05). Those pesticides were insecticide, fungicide, herbicide, and molluscicide. Individual pesticides with a positive association were glyphosate, paraquat, butachlor, methyl parathion (pholidon), savin, methomyl, endosulfan, carbosulfan, methamidophos, monochrotofos, mancozeb, and bordeaumixture. Conclusions: This case-control study found that chlorpyrifos and some other pesticide exposure during pregnancy was positively associated with developmental delay in children aged under 5 years. Further research should be conducted to better understand this potential effect of pesticides on child neurodevelopment, and the public - especially those who plan to have families - should be informed.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Why are feasibility studies accessing routinely collected health data? A systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Feasibility trials are often undertaken to determine whether a larger randomised controlled trial (RCT) is achievable. In a recent review, 15 feasibility trials accessed routinely collected health data (RCHD) from UK national databases and registries. This paper looks at attributes of these trials and the reasons why they accessed RCHD.  Methods: We extracted data from all publicly available sources for the 15 feasibility studies found in a previous review of trials successfully accessing RCHD in the UK between 2013–2018 for the purpose of informing or supplementing participant data. We extracted trial characteristics, the registry accessed, and the way the RCHD was used.  Results: The 15 feasibility RCTs were conducted in a variety of disease areas, and were generally small (median sample size 100, range 41–4061) and individually randomised (60%, 9/15). The primary trial outcome was predominantly administrative (non-clinical) (80%, 12/15) such as feasibility of patient recruitment. They were more likely to recruit from secondary care (67%, 10/15) settings than primary (33%, 5/15).  NHS Digital was the most commonly accessed registry (33% (5/15)) with SAIL databank (20% (3/15)), electronic Data Research and Innovation Service (eDRIS) and Paediatric Intensive Care Audit Network (PICANET) (each 13% 2/15) also being accessed. Where the information was clear, the trials used RCHD for data collection during the trial (47%, 7/15), follow-up after the trial (27%, 4/15) and recruitment (13%, 2/15).  Conclusions: Between 2013 and 2018, 15 feasibility trials successfully accessed UK RCHD. Feasibility trials would benefit, as with other trials, from guidance on reporting the use of RCHD in protocols and publications.

                Background: In Indonesia, maternal mortality remains high, significantly 61.59% occur in the postnatal period. Postnatal care (PNC) provision is a critical intervention between six hours and 42 days after childbirth and is the primary strategy to reduce maternal mortality rates. However, underutilisation of PNC in Indonesia still remains high, and limited studies have shown the regional disparities of PNC in Indonesia. Methods: This study aims to explore the gaps between regions in PNC service for mothers who have had live births during the last five years in Indonesia. This study was a secondary data analysis study using the Indonesian Demographic and Health Survey (IDHS) in 2017. A total of 13,901 mothers aged 15-49 years having had live births within five years were included. Chi-squared test and binary logistic regression were performed to determine regional disparities in PNC. Results: Results indicated that the prevalence of PNC service utilisation among mothers aged 15-49 years was 70.94%. However, regional gaps in the utilisation of PNC service were indicated. Mothers in the Central of Indonesia have used PNC services 2.54 times compared to mothers in the Eastern of Indonesia (OR = 2.54; 95% CI = 1.77-3.65, p<0.001). Apart from the region, other variables have a positive relationship with PNC service, including wealth quintile, accessibility health facilities, age of children, childbirth order, mother's education, maternal occupation, spouse's age, and spouse's education. Conclusion: The results suggest the need for national policy focuses on service equality, accessible, and reliable implementation to improve postnatal care utilisation among mothers to achieve the maximum results for the Indonesian Universal Health Coverage plan.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Non-commercial pharmaceutical R&D: what do neglected diseases suggest about costs and efficiency? [version 2; peer review: 2 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The past two decades have witnessed significant growth in non-commercial research and development (R&D) initiatives, particularly for neglected diseases, but there is limited understanding of the ways in which they compare with commercial R&D. This study analyses costs, timelines, and attrition rates of non-commercial R&D across multiple initiatives and how they compare to commercial R&D. Methods: This is a mixed-method, observational, descriptive, and analytic study. We contacted 48 non-commercial R&D initiatives and received either quantitative and/or qualitative data from 13 organizations. We used the Portfolio to Impact (P2I) model’s estimates of average costs, timelines, and attrition rates for commercial R&D, while noting that P2I cost estimates are far lower than some previous findings in the literature. Results: The quantitative data suggested that the costs and timelines per candidate per phase (from preclinical through Phase 3) of non-commercial R&D for new chemical entities are largely in line with commercial averages. The quantitative data was insufficient to compare attrition rates. The qualitative data identified more reasons why non-commercial R&D costs would be lower than commercial R&D, timelines would be longer, and attrition rates would be equivalent or higher, though the data does not allow for estimating the magnitude of these effects. Conclusions: The quantitative data suggest that costs and timelines per candidate per phase were largely in line with (lower-end estimates of) commercial averages. We were unable to draw conclusions on overall efficiency, however, due to insufficient data on attrition rates. Given that non-commercial R&D is a nascent area of research with limited data available, this study contributes to the literature by generating hypotheses for further testing against a larger sample of quantitative data. It also offers a range of explanatory factors for further exploration regarding how non-commercial and commercial R&D may differ in costs and efficiency.

                An interesting and valuable discussion has arisen from our recent article (Lachenmeier et al., 2020) and we are pleased to have the opportunity to expand on the various points we made. Equally important, we wish to correct several important misunderstandings that were made by Kruse and Beitzke (2020) on behalf of the European Industrial Hemp Association (EIHA) that possibly contributed to their concerns about the validity of our data, toxicological assessment and conclusions regarding regulatory status of cannabidiol (CBD) products. First and foremost, our study did only assess the risk of psychotropic Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) without inclusion of non-psychotropic Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA). Secondly, as this article will discuss in more detail, there is ample evidence for adverse effects of CBD products, not only in paediatric patients, but also in adult users of over-the-counter CBD products (including inadvertent “high” effects). Thirdly, the exposure and risk assessment was conducted using up-to-date guidelines according to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR). And finally, the current legal situation in the European Union, without approval of any hemp extract-containing product according to the Novel Food regulation, actually allows blanket statements that all such products are illegal on the market, and this indeed would imply a general ban on the use and marketing of such products as food or food ingredients until such an approval has been granted. We hope that this reassures the F1000Research readership regarding the validity of our results and conclusions. We are pleased, though, that the EIHA has acknowledged the fact that there are non-compliant CBD products available, but according to our data these are a substantial fraction of the market.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">An uncertainty-based model of the effects of fixation on choice</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Zhi-Wei Li, Wei Ji Ma</p>

When people view a consumable item for a longer amount of time, they choose it more frequently; this also seems to be the direction of causality. The leading model of this effect is a drift-diffusion model with a fixation-based attentional bias. Here, we propose an explicitly Bayesian account for the same data. This account is based on the notion that the brain builds a posterior belief over the value of an item in the same way it would over a sensory variable. As the agent gathers evidence about the item from sensory observations and from retrieved memories, the posterior distribution narrows. We further postulate that the utility of an item is a weighted sum of the posterior mean and the negative posterior standard deviation, with the latter accounting for risk aversion. Fixating for longer can increase or decrease the posterior mean, but will inevitably lower the posterior standard deviation. This model fits the data better than the original attentional drift-diffusion model but worse than a variant with a collapsing bound. We discuss the often overlooked technical challenges in fitting models simultaneously to choice and response time data in the absence of an analytical expression. Our results hopefully contribute to emerging accounts of valuation as an inference process.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A strategy for mapping biophysical to abstract neuronal network models applied to primary visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Anton V. Chizhov, Lyle J. Graham</p>

A fundamental challenge for the theoretical study of neuronal networks is to make the link between complex biophysical models based directly on experimental data, to progressively simpler mathematical models that allow the derivation of general operating principles. We present a strategy that successively maps a relatively detailed biophysical population model, comprising conductance-based Hodgkin-Huxley type neuron models with connectivity rules derived from anatomical data, to various representations with fewer parameters, finishing with a firing rate network model that permits analysis. We apply this methodology to primary visual cortex of higher mammals, focusing on the functional property of stimulus orientation selectivity of receptive fields of individual neurons. The mapping produces compact expressions for the parameters of the abstract model that clearly identify the impact of specific electrophysiological and anatomical parameters on the analytical results, in particular as manifested by specific functional signatures of visual cortex, including input-output sharpening, conductance invariance, virtual rotation and the tilt after effect. Importantly, qualitative differences between model behaviours point out consequences of various simplifications. The strategy may be applied to other neuronal systems with appropriate modifications.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Identification of structures for ion channel kinetic models</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kathryn E. Mangold, Wei Wang, Eric K. Johnson, Druv Bhagavan, Jonathan D. Moreno, Jeanne M. Nerbonne, Jonathan R. Silva</p>

Markov models of ion channel dynamics have evolved as experimental advances have improved our understanding of channel function. Past studies have examined limited sets of various topologies for Markov models of channel dynamics. We present a systematic method for identification of all possible Markov model topologies using experimental data for two types of native voltage-gated ion channel currents: mouse atrial sodium currents and human left ventricular fast transient outward potassium currents. Successful models identified with this approach have certain characteristics in common, suggesting that aspects of the model topology are determined by the experimental data. Incorporating these channel models into cell and tissue simulations to assess model performance within protocols that were not used for training provided validation and further narrowing of the number of acceptable models. The success of this approach suggests a channel model creation pipeline may be feasible where the structure of the model is not specified <i>a priori</i>.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Large-scale simulations of biological cell sorting driven by differential adhesion follow diffusion-limited domain coalescence regime</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Marc Durand</p>

Cell sorting, whereby a heterogeneous cell mixture segregates and forms distinct homogeneous tissues, is one of the main collective cell behaviors at work during development. Although differences in interfacial energies are recognized to be a possible driving source for cell sorting, no clear consensus has emerged on the kinetic law of cell sorting driven by differential adhesion. Using a modified Cellular Potts Model algorithm that allows for efficient simulations while preserving the connectivity of cells, we numerically explore cell-sorting dynamics over very large scales in space and time. For a binary mixture of cells surrounded by a medium, increase of domain size follows a power-law with exponent <i>n</i> = 1/4 independently of the mixture ratio, revealing that the kinetics is dominated by the diffusion and coalescence of rounded domains. We compare these results with recent numerical studies on cell sorting, and discuss the importance of algorithmic differences as well as boundary conditions on the observed scaling.

                Background: An immunoinformatic approach may be useful to investigate the conserved region in the spike glycoprotein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Indonesia isolates. The aim of this study was to investigate Indonesian SARS-CoV-2 isolates based on B cell epitopes by targeting the conserved regions in the spike glycoprotein to trigger increased multi-variant virus neutralization and memory response for the development of vaccine seed candidates. Methods: SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein gene sequences originating from Indonesia were compared with Wuhan (China), the United Kingdom, South Africa, India, the United States, and Brazil isolates obtained from the NCBI and GISAID databases. The recognition of antigens was carried out directly using B cells through the B cell receptor (BCR). An indirect B cell activation by Cluster of Differentiation (CD)4+ T cells and major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-II was predicted through the binding with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) based on IC50 value. In addition, vaccine allergenicity and toxicity were investigated. During the molecular complex examination, the 3D peptide structure was investigated and the lowest amount of energy formed when the vaccine candidate peptide bound to BCR and MHC-II was calculated. Results: As a result, the spike glycoprotein sequences of Indonesian SARS-CoV-2 isolates had conserved regions which were very similar to reference countries such as China, the United Kingdom, South Africa, India, the United States, and Brazil. Conclusion: It was predicted that the conserved regions could be identified as the epitope of B and T CD4+ cells that produced the peptides for vaccine candidate with antigenic, non-allergen, and non-toxic properties.

                Background: Vaccine hesitancy (VH) has been identified by the World Health Organization as one among the top ten threats to global public health. There is limited literature regarding VH from developing countries like India. Methods: In this facility based cross-sectional study, 172 mothers of under-five children were assessed regarding VH using the parental attitude towards childhood vaccination questionnaire (PACV). Results: The prevalence of VH was 3.4% (n=6). Only 7.6% (n=13) of the study participants had ever refused vaccination for their child and the most common reason cited for their refusal was that they thought it was not safe (n=6). Government health facilities was the place of routine immunization for 60.5% (n=104) participants. Health care providers (n =79, 46%) were the major source of information regarding vaccines. Conclusions: Our study highlights the presence of very low prevalence of VH in Mangalore compared to similar studies from India and other parts of the world. The limited number of participants had refused vaccination due to concerns related to vaccine safety.

                Background: Statistical reasoning is an important clinical skill that informs evidence-based medicine and is desirable for 21st century practice. Yet many physicians struggle to apply biostatistical techniques correctly, potentially undermining patient care decision-making and adversely affecting outcomes. The overarching concepts of foundational biostatistics and probabilistic reasoning can be challenging to teach and hard for students to internalize given time constraints, lack of intrinsic motivation, and varied pre-existing knowledge or cognitive schema. We investigated how supplemental, interactive online webtools affected first-year medical students’ learning of sensitivity, specificity, negative/positive predictive values, and prevalence. Methods: Online webtool design was informed by constructivism and sought to have learners 1) build conceptual representations by connecting new information to existing knowledge, 2) interact with primary sources of biostatistical data, and 3) begin with whole concepts then explore component parts. A total of 59 students were assigned randomly to two cohorts that had access to the webtools before or after in-class teaching; an additional 35 students had no access and served as the control cohort. Access metrics, summative exam scores, prior knowledge measurements, and qualitative data on learners’ experiences from three focus groups (n = 6/group) were collected. Results: Mean exam scores were 87.5 ± 10.8%, 90.7 ± 11.2%, and 88.9 7 ±12.9% for the before, after, and control cohorts (p = 0.49). Students repeatedly accessed the online webtools: mean access was 4.3 (± 2.6) (before) and 2.6 (± 1.5) (after). Qualitative data showed the webtools facilitated learning in a time-efficient manner. Conclusions: Online interactive webtools facilitated a constructivism-informed learning model and were found by first-year medical student to supplement and enhance their learning experience without detracting from established biostatistical teaching or negatively affecting summative assessment outcomes.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Conceptual design of smart multi-farm produce dehydrator using a low-cost programmable logic controller and raspberry pi [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Acceptable food processing techniques require the removal of water contents from the crop or food sample without destroying the nutritional qualities of the food sample. This poses a strict requirement on the dehydrator or oven that will be used in the dehydrating techniques to have the ability to control both temperature and humidity of its drying chamber. Methods: This work centres on how an autonomous multi-farm produce dehydrator that can also serve as an oven can be designed with a raspberry pi and a low-cost programmable logic controller (PLC). The dehydrator gives the users the flexibility to control both the drying chamber’s temperature and humidity from its web interface via a mobile device or the dehydrator’s HMI. Heat energy from the Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) is used so that the dehydrator can be readily available for commercial or industrial use.  The small electricity required to power the electronics devices is obtained from the hybrid power solution with an electric energy source from either the mains electricity supply or solar.. The design was tested by creating an operation profile from the proposed web application for the dehydrator. The operation trend was analysed from the web application’s Trendlines page. Results: The report showed that both the temperature and humidity of the dehydrator could be controlled, and access to historical operation data will give insight to the user on how to create a better operation profile. Conclusion: The setup described in this work, when implemented was able to produce a dehydrator/oven whose temperature and humidity can be perfectly controlled and its generated heat is evenly distributed in its drying chamber to ensure efficient and effective drying techniques use in crop preservation and food processing.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Pulsed administration for physiological estrogen replacement in mice [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Estrogens are important regulators of body physiology and have major effects on metabolism, bone, the immune- and central nervous systems. The specific mechanisms underlying the effects of estrogens on various cells, tissues and organs are unclear and mouse models constitute a powerful experimental tool to define the physiological and pathological properties of estrogens. Menopause can be mimicked in animal models by surgical removal of the ovaries and replacement therapy with 17β-estradiol in ovariectomized (OVX) mice is a common technique used to determine specific effects of the hormone. However, these studies are complicated by the non-monotonic dose-response of estradiol, when given as therapy. Increased knowledge of how to distribute estradiol in terms of solvent, dose, and administration frequency, is required in order to accurately mimic physiological conditions in studies where estradiol treatment is performed. In this study, mice were OVX and treated with physiological doses of 17β-estradiol-3-benzoate (E2) dissolved in miglyol or PBS. Subcutaneous injections were performed every 4 days to resemble the estrus cycle in mice. Results show that OVX induces an osteoporotic phenotype, fat accumulation and impairment of the locomotor ability, as expected. Pulsed administration of physiological doses of E2 dissolved in miglyol rescues the phenotypes induced by OVX. However, when E2 is dissolved in PBS the effects are less pronounced, possibly due to rapid wash out of the steroid.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Early detection of macrovascular complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus in Medan, North Sumatera, Indonesia: A cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Macrovascular complications occur very frequently in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with a high mortality rate, due to the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD), such as stroke, atherosclerosis acceleration, and atrial fibrillation. T2DM is a significant risk factor for CVD and has become the leading cause of death. The purpose of this study was to detect the early risk of macrovascular complications by using the ankle brachial index (ABI) as a marker. Methods: This study was an analytic study with a cross-sectional approach. The study population was patients with T2DM from several primary health care centers in Medan. In total, 89 subjects who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were recruited with consecutive sampling. ABI was determined as the ratio of systolic blood pressure in the brachial artery to the posterior tibial artery after the subjects had been relaxed and felt comfortable in a supine position. Examination of vitamin D and lipid profile was derived from examination of venous blood.  Data were processed using SPSS and analyzed with one-way ANOVA. Results: The study found that there was a relationship between LDL-C, triglyceride, and vitamin D (25OH-D) based on the ABI (p > 0.05). Conclusions: ABI can be used for an early detection of macrovascular complications. Apart from being easy to perform, ABI was non-invasive. Some other risk factors that can also be used to assess complications and have relationships with ABI were LDL-C, triglyceride, and vitamin D (25OH-D). Complications in T2DM patients can be prevented with reasonable blood sugar control and lifestyle changes. Education and motivation need to be given to patients so that they become more independent in controlling their disease and improving their quality of life.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Early Marriage among  young  girls in Eastern Ethiopia: trend during 2008-2018 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Early marriage practices undermine girls’ autonomy and seriously affect their physical and mental wellbeing. Monitoring the trends and understanding the drivers is essential in intervening against early marriage. However, many studies on early marriage in Ethiopia are cross-sectional, focusing only on the magnitude at a single point in time. Hence, we extracted data of girls of 10-17 years from Kersa Health and Demographic Surveillance System (Kersa HDSS) database for the period of 2008–2018 in order to examine the trends of early marriage. In this data note we provide the details of a research database of 24,452 girls in the age group of 10-17 years. The extracted data include date of marriage and the girls’ socio-demographic variables. Other variables considered to be potentially associated with timing of marriage were also extracted. The purpose of this publication is to describe the dataset for external researchers who may be interested in making use of it as a secondary use of their routinely collected data. This dataset is available at   https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.15034812.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Comparison of cell size, chlorophyll fluorescence and cadmium (Cd2+) bioaccumulation between wild-type and mutant strains of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii upon exposure to Cd2 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Heavy metal contamination presents a constant threat to biological systems. Simultaneously, heavy metals have become one of the major contaminants in the aquatic ecosystems. In this regard, the investigation of heavy metal-tolerance genes in algae is relevant. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a unicellular green alga, and an excellent model organism used in heavy metal studies. In C. reinhardtii, a novel gene designated as Cia7, was hypothesized to play a role in heavy metal homeostasis due to CIA7’s conserved cysteine-residue motif. This study compared two strains of C. reinhardtii, cc4425, the wild-type with the functional CIA7 protein and cc5013, the mutant strain with the disrupted cia7- gene. The hypothesis was that the expression of Cia7 contributes to an increased cadmium (Cd)-tolerance in C. reinhardtii. The Cd-tolerance would be described by physiological markers of microalgae health, and by intracellular accumulation of the metal. Methods: The objectives of this study were (1) to compare chlorophyll fluorescence and cell size in cc4425 and cc5013 exposed to Cd2+, and (2) to compare Cd2+ bioaccumulation in cc4425 and cc5013 strains in different growth media. Flow cytometry, and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) analysis were performed. Results: There was no significant statistical difference in Cd2+ bioaccumulation between the two strains, cc4425 and cc5013, regardless of growth media. However, a statistically significant difference in Cd2+ bioaccumulation (p<0.0001) was determined between the media (with acetate and without acetate).  The cia7- mutant, cc5013 was found to be more susceptible to a Cd2+-induced decrease in chlorophyll fluorescence and had a reduced cell size compared to cc4425, the wild-type strain. Conclusions: These observed differences between the strains suggest that CIA7’s biological activity could play a direct or indirect role in increasing Cd tolerance in C. reinhardtii.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">DNase treatment prevents CSF block in early experimental pneumococcal meningitis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p><i>S. pneumoniae</i> is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis, a disease that, despite treatment with antibiotics, still is associated with a high mortality and morbidity worldwide. Diffuse brain swelling is a leading cause of morbidity in <i>S. pneumoniae</i> meningitis. We hypothesized that neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) disrupt CSF transport by the glymphatic system and contribute to edema formation in <i>S. pneumoniae</i> meningitis.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used DNase I treatment to disrupt NETs and then assessed glymphatic function by cisterna magna injections of CSF tracers in a rat model of <i>S. pneumoniae</i> meningitis.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Our analysis showed that CSF influx into the brain parenchyma, as well as CSF drainage to the cervical lymph nodes, were significantly reduced in the rat model of <i>S. pneumoniae</i> meningitis. Degrading neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) by DNase treatment restored glymphatic transport and eliminated the increase in brain weight in the rats. In contrast, first-line antibiotic treatment had no such effect on restoring fluid dynamics.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study suggests that CSF accumulation is responsible for cerebral edema formation and identifies the glymphatic system and NETs as possible new treatment targets in <i>S. pneumoniae</i> meningitis.</p>

When a nanosphere is levitated inside an optical cavity, light can hybridize with the motion on a plane rather than along an axis, resulting in ‘vectorial’ polaritons.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">HIF1α is required for NK cell metabolic adaptation during virus infection</a></h4>

              
                Natural killer (NK) cells are essential for early protection against virus infection, and must metabolically adapt to the energy demands of activation. Here, we found upregulation of the metabolic adaptor hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is a feature of mouse NK cells during murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection <i>in vivo</i>. HIF-1 α -deficient NK cells failed to control viral load, causing increased morbidity. No defects were found in effector functions of HIF-1α KO NK cells however, their numbers were significantly reduced. Loss of HIF-1 α did not affect NK cell proliferation during <i>in vivo</i> infection and <i>in vitro</i> cytokine stimulation. Instead, we found HIF-1α -deficient NK cells showed increased expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim and glucose metabolism was impaired during cytokine stimulation <i>in vitro</i>. Similarly, during MCMV infection HIF-1α -deficient NK cells upregulated Bim and had increased caspase activity. Thus, NK cells require HIF-1α-dependent metabolic functions to repress Bim expression and sustain cell numbers for an optimal virus response.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Spinal lumbar dI2 interneurons contribute to stability of bipedal stepping</a></h4>

              
                Peripheral and intraspinal feedback is required to shape and update the output of spinal networks that execute motor behavior. We report that lumbar dI2 spinal interneurons in chicks receive synaptic input from afferents and premotor neurons. These interneurons innervate contralateral premotor networks in the lumbar and brachial spinal cord, and their ascending projections innervate the cerebellum. These findings suggest that dI2 neurons function as interneurons in local lumbar circuits, are involved in lumbo-brachial coupling, and that part of them deliver peripheral and intraspinal feedback to the cerebellum. Silencing of dI2 neurons leads to destabilized stepping in P8 hatchlings, with occasional collapses, variable step profiles and a wide-base walking gait, suggesting that dI2 neurons may contribute to the stabilization of the bipedal gait.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Spatially patterned excitatory neuron subtypes and projections of the claustrum</a></h4>

              
                The claustrum is a functionally and structurally complex brain region, whose very spatial extent remains debated. Histochemical-based approaches typically treat the claustrum as a relatively narrow anatomical region that primarily projects to the neocortex, whereas circuit-based approaches can suggest a broader claustrum region containing projections to the neocortex and other regions. Here, in the mouse, we took a bottom-up and cell-type-specific approach to complement and possibly unite these seemingly disparate conclusions. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing, we found that the claustrum comprises two excitatory neuron subtypes that are differentiable from the surrounding cortex. Multicolor retrograde tracing in conjunction with 12-channel multiplexed in situ hybridization revealed a core-shell spatial arrangement of these subtypes, as well as differential downstream targets. Thus, the claustrum comprises excitatory neuron subtypes with distinct molecular and projection properties, whose spatial patterns reflect the narrower and broader claustral extents debated in previous research. This subtype-specific heterogeneity likely shapes the functional complexity of the claustrum.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A CTP-dependent gating mechanism enables ParB spreading on DNA</a></h4>

              
                Proper chromosome segregation is essential in all living organisms. The ParA-ParB-<i>parS</i> system is widely employed for chromosome segregation in bacteria. Previously, we showed that <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i> ParB requires cytidine triphosphate to escape the nucleation site <i>parS</i> and spread by sliding to the neighboring DNA (Jalal et al., 2020). Here, we provide the structural basis for this transition from nucleation to spreading by solving co-crystal structures of a C-terminal domain truncated <i>C. crescentus</i> ParB with <i>parS</i> and with a CTP analog. Nucleating ParB is an open clamp, in which <i>parS</i> is captured at the DNA-binding domain (the DNA-gate). Upon binding CTP, the N-terminal domain (NTD) self-dimerizes to close the NTD-gate of the clamp. The DNA-gate also closes, thus driving <i>parS</i> into a compartment between the DNA-gate and the C-terminal domain. CTP hydrolysis and/or the release of hydrolytic products are likely associated with reopening of the gates to release DNA and recycle ParB. Overall, we suggest a CTP-operated gating mechanism that regulates ParB nucleation, spreading, and recycling.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Single-cell RNA analysis identifies pre-migratory neural crest cells expressing markers of differentiated derivatives</a></h4>

              
                The neural crest is a migratory population of stem-like cells that contribute to multiple traits including the bones of the skull, peripheral nervous system, and pigment. How neural crest cells differentiate into diverse cell types is a fundamental question in the study of vertebrate biology. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize transcriptional changes associated with neural crest cell development in the zebrafish trunk during the early stages of migration. We show that neural crest cells are transcriptionally diverse and identify pre-migratory populations already expressing genes associated with differentiated derivatives, specifically in the xanthophore lineage. Further, we identify a population of Rohon–Beard neurons in the data. The data presented identify novel genetic markers for multiple trunk neural crest cell populations and Rohon–Beard neurons providing insight into previously uncharacterized genes critical for vertebrate development.
